Decentralized network level adaptive signal control by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100020,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Adaptive traffic signal control systems are deployed to accommodate real-time traffic conditions. Yet travel demand and behavior of the individual vehicles might be overseen by their model-based control algorithms and aggregated input data. Recent development of artificial intelligence, especially the success of deep learning, makes it possible to utilize information of individual vehicles to control the traffic signals. Several pioneering studies developed model-free control algorithms using deep reinforcement learning. However, those studies are limited to isolated intersections and their effectiveness was only evaluated in ideal simulated traffic conditions by hypothetical benchmarks. To fill the gap, this study proposes a network-level decentralized adaptive signal control algorithm using one of the famous deep reinforcement methods, double dueling deep Q network in the multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by the real-world coordinated actuated signals in a simulated suburban traffic corridor which emulates the real-field traffic condition. The evaluation results showed that the proposed deep-reinforcement-learning-based algorithm outperforms the benchmark. It is able to reduce 10.27% of the travel time and 46.46% of the total delay.",2590-1982,https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/awesome-RL-traffic-signals
Physical activity of electric bicycle users compared to conventional bicycle users and non-cyclists: Insights based on health and transport data from an online survey in seven European cities,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100017,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Physical activity has been widely associated with beneficial health effects. The use of electric-assist bicycles (e-bikes) can lead to increased or decreased physical activity, depending on the transport mode substituted. This study aimed to compare physical activity levels of e-bikers and conventional bicycle users (cyclists) as well as across e-bike user groups based on the transport mode substituted by e-bike. Physical activity, transport and user related parameters were analysed. Data from the longitudinal on-line survey of the PASTA project were used. The survey recruited over 10,000 participants in seven European cities. Physical activity levels, measured in Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET min/wk), were similar among e-bikers and cyclists (4463 vs. 4085). E-bikers reported significantly longer trip distances for both e-bike (9.4 km) and bicycle trips (8.4 km) compared to cyclists for bicycle trips (4.8 km), as well as longer daily travel distances for e-bike than cyclists for bicycle (8.0 vs. 5.3 km per person, per day, respectively). Travel-related activities of e-bikers who switched from cycling decreased by around 200 MET min/wk., while those switching from private motorized vehicle and public transport gained around 550 and 800 MET min/wk. respectively. Therefore, this data suggests that e-bike use leads to substantial increases in physical activity in e-bikers switching from private motorized vehicle and public transport, while net losses in physical activity in e-bikers switching from cycling were much less due to increases in overall travel distance.",2590-1982,Not found
Increasing civil aviation capacity in China requires harmonizing the physical and human components of capacity: A review and investigation,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100005,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"China is the world's second largest aviation market and is projected to become the largest by the mid-2020s. However, there is a mismatch among the three critical components that determine aviation capacity: airports, airlines, and air traffic management. The uneven pace of development for these major components within the aviation system limits the efforts to improve on-time performance and accommodate the growing market demand. Through a careful examination of academic literature, official reports, and news articles, this study examines the recent achievements, reform, and institutional challenges facing the three critical components in China's aviation system. It highlights their interactions with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the omnipresent aviation authority in China, and explains the mismatch between the rapidly expanding ground aviation infrastructure and a highly constrained airspace amid increasing demand for air travel and worsening on-time performance. By incorporating institutional factors into the discussion of the critical components, this study aims to help enhance the understanding of China's civil aviation and inform officials to take necessary actions to prepare the country for the continuing growth of its aviation market.",2590-1982,Not found
Progress or regress on gender equality: The case study of selected transport STEM careers and their vocational education and training in Japan,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100009,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"This paper examines the role of vocational education and training (VET) in the STEM workforce to advance women's integration into traditionally male-dominated workplaces. In Japan, it has been reported that the size of the workforce has been substantially decreasing since 2011. One of the effective strategies to mitigate the risk of the shortage of human resources is considered to be making use of women in the STEM field. In this paper, the Japanese transport sector is studied to understand the role of VET to support women in the STEM workforce. We shed light on the merchant marine as one of the most male-dominated industries. A comparative institutional analysis was elaborated with other transport industries, such as air and rail. In addition, a narrative analysis was conducted with the empirical data as well as archived literature. The paper reveals that the merchant marine has failed to establish an institutional arrangement of maritime VET from the women transport workers' career-cycle perspective. The paper concludes that the role of VET is important not only before the employment but also after, in order to make sustainable use of women as human resources. In order to remove barriers to including women in STEM careers, institutional arrangement of VET should be reviewed through gender-mainstreaming and life-long VET would help to stop the leaky pipe line of STEM women in Japan.",2590-1982,Not found
Multiobjective integrated signal-control system calibration in urban areas: Application of response surface methodology,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100011,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Parameters concerning real-time, advanced traffic-control systems must be appropriately set for realizing adequate performance in urban areas that demonstrate fluctuating and dynamic traffic conditions. The proposed study presents a framework that entails application of the response surface methodology (RSM) to calibrate advanced control system parameters with several contradicting objective functions. RSM was applied to optimize specific control systems with multiple functions for congestion management, actuated split-phasing signal control, transit preemption, and incident detection and management. RSM can effectively handle multiobjective functions by estimating their composite desirability. Parameters considered in this study have been calibrated to simultaneously maximize transit throughput while minimizing travel time. Mathematical models that provide individual measures of effectiveness vis-à-vis various parameters have been developed using RSM under highly and very highly congested situations. Optimum settings, thus obtained, have been validated via simulation testing. The proposed study also examines the robustness of relevant parameter values.",2590-1982,Not found

What passengers really want: Assessing the value of rail innovation to improve experiences,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100014,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Technology has the potential to provide more up-to-date information and customised services to train passengers and therefore improve the rail journey experience. However, there is a lack knowledge about which innovations and services are preferred by the travelling public. The purpose of this study was to understand the value which passengers placed on technological innovations to improve the overall passenger journey experience. A conjoint analysis survey based on the best-worst scale of preference was developed to evaluate how passengers (N = 398) value different system features proposed to improve passenger experience in the UK. Results show that the automatic compensation for delayed or cancelled trains was valued the highest, and the ability to pre-order special services ranked as least value from a set of ten features. Additional results include the segmentation of responses according to passenger type (commuters, business and leisure) and the similarities and differences in responses from the public versus those working directly in the rail industry. The insights gained from this study suggest which features should be prioritised to improve rail passenger journey experiences.",2590-1982,https://github.com/browndw/corpus-tagger
"A socioeconomic analysis of ride-hailing emergence and expansion in São Paulo, Brazil",10.1016/j.trip.2019.100016,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"This paper estimates the socioeconomic impacts of the emergence and expansion of e-hailing services in São Paulo, Brazil. Combining data from a major service provider, individual level data from a representative travel diary survey and a structural traffic network simulation, we evaluate the impact of e-hailing on commuters' travel time and accessibility. We then estimate the effect of these changes on workers' productivity. Finally, using a Spatial Computable General Equilibrium (SCGE) model, we estimate the effect of these productivity shocks on broader economic outcomes. Our main results indicate that 83% of current e-hailing trips derived from trips that were previously made by traditional motorized private modes. We also find that the current e-hailing supply has mostly negligible effects on travel times and congestion; however, some individuals experienced important accessibility gains due to the emergence of this alternative mode. We then simulate e-hailing expansion and development scenarios, including the case of larger vehicle occupancy. Total economic activity expands by 1.089% if average vehicle occupancy reaches 3 passengers per trip and all motorized private trips are substituted by e-hailing.",2590-1982,Not found
Audio on the go: The effect of audio cues on memory in driving,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100004,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"An inability to recall details from an otherwise uneventful drive on a familiar route is a common experience to many. Whether this amnesia for everyday driving is because we don't actually form strong memories when we are driving on autopilot or whether this is because we simply can't find those memories when we try to later is an interesting question, not only for driving, but for memory and skilled performance more generally. The present study sought to determine whether recall could be aided by reinstating an auditory cue that was present during the drive. Twenty-five participants drove three 9 km routes on familiar roads and then were asked a series of questions about the details of the drives. Three auditory cues (music, radio documentary, or periodic verbal markers) and a visual cue were used as contextual stimuli during the drives and as post-drive recall cues. The music and verbal markers produced better recall than the radio documentary. Although proceduralised driving on a familiar road may make incidental details of the drive difficult to recall, those details are recoverable with a sufficiently robust recall cue.",2590-1982,Not found
Michigan's public transportation: An application of statewide performance assessment and management,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100013,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Transit agencies commonly use performance measures to assess the quality of provided transit services. This paper presents a case study, proposes and applies a method to assess the condition of a state-wide system combining urban, semi-urban, and rural transit agencies. First, the paper proposes 11 “Action Intent of Measures” (AIMs), which capture qualitative and quantitative aspects of transit systems. Second, it develops an index that condenses the 11 AIMs into one measure to allow assessment of the collective performance of the state's transit industry. Third, it applies the AIMs and the index to measure Michigan's state-wide transit performance annually between 2014 and 2018. Agencies reported better performance on AIMs that they felt they had control over in contrast to those that they felt they had no control over. Due to annual performance measurement of the state-wide system, the state transport agency targeted technical assistance to improve performance over time.",2590-1982,Not found
"Safety, stress and work zone complexity: A field study on police officers performing on-foot traffic control",10.1016/j.trip.2019.100018,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Workers such as police officers are exposed to many hazardous situations while performing traffic duties, which renders them vulnerable to work accidents. Such a dangerous work context can lead to high stress levels. This is conducive to performance impairment and, consequently, to high-risk situations in which safety, for both workers and road users, may be jeopardized. It then seems important to better understand the stress experienced by traffic workers to ultimately improve road safety. Hence, the current study aims at investigating whether work context could be associated with the stress levels of police officers doing traffic duties on foot. Nineteen police officers in Quebec City and Montreal, Canada, performed traffic duties on several sites (including constructions ones) while their physiological state was measured by a wearable sensor harness. Change in subjective stress was measured every 15 min. Characteristics of the environment were also noted for every working site, which permitted to perform hierarchical cluster classifications to assess each site's complexity. Results show that stress levels were significantly lower for less complex sites. Interestingly, traffic and safety measures—identified through automated computer vision—differ depending on the site complexity and were generally associated with measures of stress. Taken together, these results suggest that the context in which pedestrian workers perform traffic duties, that is the environment and the higher-risk events to which they are exposed, can lead to higher levels of stress. Implications for road safety are discussed in light of these results.",2590-1982,Not found
Learning to build strategic capacity for transportation policy change: An interdisciplinary exploration,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100006,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Realising policy solutions needed to achieve ‘sustainable mobility’ is difficult because, for one, they require a strategic capacity for “coordinated action” across multiple actors and organizations. Policy learning and policy transfer have been discussed for decades as a way for policy makers to acquire capacity to effect change. However, the process linking policy learning and transfer to the building of strategic capacity remains a black box. One possible reason for this gap is how learning is conceptualised and measured in contemporary transport policy studies. We turn to conceptual and empirical knowledge from education, organizational development, human resources, environmental sciences, and business strategy and management to expand our understanding of learning processes for strategic capacity building. The purpose of this paper is to tease out relevant implications for transportation planning by (1) building a theoretical and empirical database of learning for capacity building across disciplines; (2) examining how such learning is conceptualised and measured, with particular attention to how the literature links learning and strategic capacity building; and (3) reflecting on the implications for the transportation planning field. Findings demonstrate that learning is an integral part of a larger process (such as ‘innovation’), and mechanisms and conditions of the process drive learning and capacity-building, often accompanying each other. For example, an existing organizational culture that supports learning (condition) demonstrates matured practices of horizontal communication systems and relationship building (mechanisms). We end the paper with a discussion on implications for transportation planning, both in research and practice. Adding to the discourse on policy learning and transfer, we point to policy learning as a potentially valuable pathway for building a strategic capacity to coordinate action.",2590-1982,Not found

The local road safety committee, including public and private interdisciplinary parties, recently implemented the automated speed enforcement camera project along this corridor to achieve safer speeds. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the implemented project. The results indicated that this project decreased vehicle speed by 9.6% and increased the efficiency of the speed limit enforcement program six to eight times. Accidents, injuries, and fatalities rates decreased by 5.8%, 7.7%, and 34.3%, respectively. These outcomes prove the efficiency of the first stage of this speed control project in the context of developing cities. Further speed management programs are also discussed.

Evaluation of sustainable urban mobility using comparative environmental life cycle assessment: A case study of Qatar,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100003,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The transportation sector is responsible for impacting both human health and greenhouse gas emissions. The primary mode of transport in Qatar is private automobiles, which can have a significant environmental impact. One strategy for transitioning to a low-carbon urban environment is the Doha Metro Project, which aims to reduce emissions from private automobiles. The focus of this study is the development of comparative life cycle assessment models to quantify the energy output and emissions of two major transportation alternatives in Qatar—automobiles and metro—within gate-to-gate system boundaries that limit their operations. GaBi 6.0 software was used to model and quantify the environmental impacts per functional unit of passenger kilometers traveled. The analysis demonstrates that public transportation is more sustainable in all impact categories compared with private automobiles. Most importantly, public transportation is key for addressing the critical environmental impacts of the transportation sector: climate change, particulate matter formation, human toxicity, terrestrial acidification, and water depletion. Annually, a public transportation metro line can reduce approximately 19.42 kt of CO2 emissions, 3.15 tonnes of PM 10 formation, 377.17 tonnes of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 3.02 tonnes of nitrogen, 11.45 tonnes of sulfur dioxide, and 1.5 cubic meters of water. Electricity and water are the primary factors for the environmental impacts of the metro system; consequently, their impact can be further mitigated using cleaner renewable energy sources and through creation of strategic solutions to increase the use of the metro transit system.",2590-1982,Not found
Comparison of Waze crash and disabled vehicle records with video ground truth,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100019,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Waze is a popular mobile phone navigation application that allows users to report incidents on roadways in real time. Over 560 government agencies have access to Waze reports, and many are using them as data sources for operations. This study evaluated the accuracy of Waze crash and disabled vehicle reports along a 2.7-mile section of urban freeway by comparing Waze reports with images from four traffic cameras. Because the cameras were pan-tilt-zoom capable and operated by transportation management center staff, a surrogate measure for transportation agency awareness was used, defined as the time at which the camera panned or zoomed to an ongoing incident. Of 40 crashes reported in Waze, 13 (33%) were confirmed primary reports and 2 (5%) were false alarms. Of the 560 disabled vehicle reports, 125 (22%) were confirmed primary reports and 131 (23%) were false alarms. For disabled vehicles, neither a Waze report's reliability score nor an incident's duration was correlated with report accuracy. For both crashes and disabled vehicles, transportation management center staff was usually aware of the incident before the first Waze report, although this may be biased as the study corridor had dense camera coverage. This is the first study to evaluate the accuracy of individual Waze crash and disabled vehicle reports using ground truth evidence.",2590-1982,Not found

An autologistic regression analysis in Burlington, VT",10.1016/j.trip.2019.100001,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Law enforcement is critical for improving traffic safety. However, disputes on the equity in law enforcement have continuously exacerbated the distrust between the public and the law enforcement agencies in the United States in the past decades. This study explores this issue by identifying factors influencing outcomes of traffic stops - the most common scenarios where people need to deal with law enforcement agencies. To exclude possible confounding factors, this study specifically focuses on speeding traffic stops leading to tickets or warnings in Burlington, Vermont from 2012 to 2017. The Euclidean distance-based autologistic regression model is adopted due to the presence of spatial correlations of traffic stops. It is found that with the increasing speeding severity, a speeding traffic stop is more likely to lead to a ticket. Speeding of 20 mph over the speed limit significantly influences the penalty type. Young drivers, male drivers and minority drivers are found to be more likely to be issued tickets, which suggests the possible presence of some inherent biases against these groups. In addition, time of day and month are also found to influence the likelihood of receiving speeding tickets. These findings are expected to help both the public and law enforcement agencies to better understand the characteristics of law enforcement and take appropriate measures to eliminate possible biases.",2590-1982,Not found
Practitioners' perspective on user experience and design of cycle highways,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100010,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Cycle highways, also known as “fast cycle routes”, are an emerging concept in urban planning that describes long distance, high quality bicycle routes built for commuter use. In Northern European countries, large sums of money are invested into cycle highways promising to induce a mode shift with little critical assessment as to how cyclists experience these infrastructures. Through eleven interviews of practitioners from five European countries – the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom and Denmark – this paper explores how practitioners define cycle highways and how their conceptualizations of cycling experience shape the physical design of cycle highways. Results show that while practitioners are guided by infrastructural standards for cycle highways such as width, design speed, and intersection treatments, it is less clear how these infrastructure elements fit within the surrounding environment to create desirable cycling experiences. In addition to commuters, cycle highways are also used by recreational and sport cyclists, so policy makers and designers should consider a wide variety of user groups and their aesthetic and social experiences in the planning and design of cycle highways. Future research should investigate cycle highway experiences from the perspective of various user types.",2590-1982,Not found
"An informal transportation as a feeder of the rapid transit system. Spatial analysis of the e-bike taxi service in Shenzhen, China",10.1016/j.trip.2019.100002,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Despite recent Chinese legislative restrictions on the use of electric two-wheelers (e-bikes), this transportation method is still very popular in Chinese cities. In China, e-bikes currently provide an informal transportation service (e-bike taxi). Very little research has been conducted to study how this informal transportation service is organized. This study aims to fill this gap by offering an understanding of the spatial distribution of informal transportation providers in relation to rapid transit systems and urban villages. Using remote-sensing and geographical information systems (GIS), this study demonstrates that in Shenzhen, this common Chinese e-bike taxicab service survives in a tight relationship with the existence of rural areas within the city's urban fabric. Auxiliary field observations and in-depth interviews provide this study with information regarding service features and spatial distributions at the district scale. This paper shows how this informal transportation service is enlarging the catchment area of the rapid transit system and thus reducing the social exclusion of rural enclaves in the city.

This paper examines bikeshare users' sensitivity to changes in price and preferences on service by conducting an intercept survey at Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) stations. Monadic price testing approach was used to design survey questions and elicit responses on sensitivity of users to price changes in fare products. Ordered logit regression results indicated that higher household income groups and ‘White’ users are less sensitive to price compared to other income groups and other races/ethnicities, respectively. An illustrative application of the demand curves is presented, which showed that low-income groups are more sensitive to price than the middle and high-income groups. White users were found to be approximately 20% less price sensitive than other races for both casual users purchasing single-trips and annual members. The price elasticities revealed that females are about 30% and 10% more price sensitive than males for single-trip fare (STF) and annual membership, respectively. Also, sightseeing trips are 30% less price sensitive than work trips for STF purchasers. An illustrative application of income-based elasticities indicated that reducing the STF to $1.50 from the current $2.00 per trip and annual membership to $73.00 (from $85 per year) were found to improve both ridership and revenue.

Antecedents of flight delays in the Australian domestic aviation market,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100007,1,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Flight delays are widespread and growing around the world. Using public domain data of the airlines in Australia's domestic aviation market, this study investigates the antecedents of flight delays, and how airline operations contribute to such an important issue in the aviation industry. Applying the Hausman-Taylor regression method, the estimations suggest that the variables of the airline capacity decision are meaningful determinants of flight delays. Our findings inform that more frequent flights and larger aircraft are associated with more flight delays. A higher level of route congestion leads to more flight delays, especially for the low-cost carriers. Jet fuel price is identified as a driver, leading to more flight delays for the legacy airlines compared to the low-cost carriers.

This study uses semi-structured interviews with experts from academia as well as the public and private sectors in the United States to (1) explore potential synergies and conflicts between increasingly automated motorized vehicles and active travel; and (2) highlight planning and policy priorities for active travel in a time of emerging connected and automated vehicles (C/AVs). Our interviews indicate that while C/AVs promise to make roadways safer for motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians, some potential hazards exist related to communication, behavior, and technical capabilities in the near term. In the long-term, C/AVs may have drastic impacts on infrastructure, the built environment, and land use, but these impacts are likely to vary by locality.

"Autonomous, connected, electric shared vehicles (ACES) and public finance: An explorative analysis",10.1016/j.trip.2019.100038,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"This paper discusses the implications of autonomous-connected-electric-shared vehicles (ACES) for public finance, which have so far been widely ignored in the literature. In OECD countries, 5–12% of federal and up to 30% of local tax revenues are currently collected from fuel and vehicle taxation. The diffusion of ACES will significantly reduce these important sources of government revenues and affect transport-related government expenditures, unless additional policies are introduced to align the new technological context with the tax revenue requirements. We argue that the realization of socioeconomic benefits of ACES depends on the implementation of tailored public finance policies, which can take advantage of the increase in data availability from the further digitalization of transportation systems. In particular, the introduction of road tolls in line with ‘user pays’ and ‘polluter pays’ principles will become more feasible for policy. Moreover, innovation in taxation schemes to fit the changing technological circumstances may alter the relative importance of levels of governance in transport policy making, likely shifting power towards local, in particular urban, governmental levels. We finally argue that, given the risk of path-dependencies and lock-in to sub-optimal public finance regimes if policies are implemented late, further research and near-term policy actions taken during the diffusion process of ACES are required.",2590-1982,Not found
Evaluation of traffic management strategies for special events using probe data,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100052,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Special events can impose burdens to local roads. As these events are temporary and even seasonal in nature, concerned agencies need to identify cost-effective traffic management strategies to control this increased traffic. The current research empirically investigated the traffic flow, traffic volumes, and traffic management strategies for sporting events in Fort Myers, Florida. Extensive data were collected for over five consecutive years on an arterial road. These data contained traffic volumes from available loop detectors and travel time from Bluetooth sensors. Results showed that, like the experience curve effect, manual traffic control seemed to improve the traffic after the first year but leveled off thereafter. Signal retiming was effective for traffic entering games but not after games. The average travel time on a certain road segment for through traffic before the event starts was reduced by >40% after the signal retiming. Variable message signs (VMS), while appeared to help traffic management, might not considerably improve travel time before and after the events on the road investigated. Although an alternative route was introduced for through traffic, most of drivers still used the arterial road even during peak congestion. With an average penetration rate of >4%, this long-term study confirmed that the use of Bluetooth-based systems in collecting traffic probe data are still feasible in the near future.

Seventeen adults from London and sixteen from Singapore were interviewed and presented with an overview of the other city's transportation system to elicit their opinions on the differences and whether an alternate system could be applied in their city. Differences were observed in perceptions of, and beliefs concerning, private transport. In Singapore, cars served more than utilitarian purposes and were viewed as socially desirable status and success symbols. In London, car ownership and usage were viewed as a necessity due to a perceived lack of accessible, alternative transport. Both samples valued accessibility, affordability and comfort in relation to transport mode choice. There was also general acknowledgement and support for managing the car population and use in both cities, though how it should be done remains highly context-specific. Our findings suggest that public engagement and effective communication are important components when interventions and policies are introduced to better manage the car population and use in cities.",2590-1982,Not found
Assessment of risky behaviours among E-bike users: A comparative study in Shanghai,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100042,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"In China, E2Ws were compared or equated to traditional bicycles for crash studies and regulation purposes. We compared the similarity in riding behaviours of e-bike riders, riders of traditional bicycles, e-scooter riders and riders of motorized two-wheelers (gasoline and Liquid Petroleum Gas-LPG). In Shanghai, different types of two-wheelers (N = 400) were compared on the basis of frequency of self-reported risky behaviours. Overall, the results show a continuous increase in the incidence of risky behaviours as the weight and power of vehicles increases. Based on these reported behaviours, e-bikes appear to be different from traditional bikes and similar to e-scooters and other motorized two-wheelers. E-scooters are not significantly different from other types of motorized two-wheelers. In terms of prevention and regulation, e-bikes and e-scooters could be brought closer to motorized two-wheelers in order to identify common and other targeted actions according to the type of two-wheeler.",2590-1982,Not found
Disaggregation of aggregate GPS-based cycling data – How to enrich commercial cycling data sets for detailed cycling behaviour analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100041,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"In order to investigate cycling behaviour, planners and researchers are increasingly using disaggregate data such as GPS data. However, disaggregate data on cycling behaviour is not available for most cities. At first sight, the data collected by (sport) app providers like Strava could help fill the data gap, as they are available for most cities around the globe. Due to data privacy reasons however, this data is usually aggregated before it is sold commercially by data providers. To use the data for detailed analysis, this article presents a multi-step disaggregation approach to synthesise single routes from aggregate data sets. The approach requires aggregate origin-destination data of cycling demand as the primary input. A double-constrained routing algorithm is subsequently used to derive single bicycle routes from this data. This disaggregate route data can then be enriched with further attribute data and can thereafter be used to estimate bicycle route choice models. This article presents the approach developed as well as a proof of concept using a case study. It further illustrates how the results can estimate a route choice model for a case study area in Germany. The overall results show that the presented approach could easily be used to disaggregate available aggregate cycling data to investigate cycling behaviour.",2590-1982,Not found
The role of businesses in facilitating voluntary travel behaviour change - Insights from the London 2012 Olympic Games,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100040,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The organisers of the London 2012 Olympics faced transport congestion challenges whose resolution required travel behaviour change across an entire transport network. This study evaluates the role of Transport for London's (TfL) £30 m business-focussed Travel Demand Management (TDM) programme in achieving significant traveller behaviour change across its entire transport network. The paper argues that soft TDM measures, together with a targeted ‘hard-edge’ message, alongside travel alternatives, can achieve significant voluntary travel behaviour change (VTBC) across a whole transport network, despite such behaviour normally being habitual. Incorporating a longitudinal study comprised of pre-and post-Games qualitative interviews, office attendance data and analysis of TfL's travel survey with Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour, this research highlights the importance of reliable information, freedom of choice, and faith in the effectiveness of the measures proposed, in eliciting acceptance of the TDM policy. The results also demonstrate the importance of a relevant, hard-edge message in the form of a ‘big scare’—which operates as a ‘catalyst-for-change’ (CfC), breaking habit by increasing cognitive engagement and acceptance—as well as the importance of the role of businesses in delivering significant levels of voluntary travel behavioural change. The findings contribute to the evaluation of methods for achieving actual VTBC, which could be instrumental in enacting the large-scale travel behaviour changes required to meet international environmental objective of reducing carbon resource consumption by both businesses and individuals.",2590-1982,Not found
Incorporating systems thinking approach in a multilevel framework for human-centered crash analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100031,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Variations that exist in the frequency and severities of crashes across regions may be due to differences in road user behaviors or indirectly due to differences in regional characteristics. Regional strategies towards “vision zero” road fatalities, consisting of appropriate safety policies and laws, supported with public education and backed by appropriate sanctions, have the ability to shape road user behaviors in the long term. In this paper, certain human-centered crash factors are viewed as the outcome of a hierarchical system made up of road users nested in regions, in a way that regional characteristics like policies and punitive measures influence road user behaviors. Hence, we propose a multilevel framework that captures driver characteristics and regional attributes that directly and indirectly affect crash outcomes. The concept was applied to crash data analysis for the state of Alabama, where it was found that the probability of a fatal crash involving a typical driver is 0.115. About 6.19% of the variability in the fatal crash rate involving drivers from the state is accounted for by the city and 3.84% is accounted for by the county of residence of the causal driver, leaving 89.97% of the variability to be accounted for by driver attributes or other crash contributing factors. Fatal crash rates varied significantly across the state and some crash factors were more pronounced among drivers from particular cities and counties. In view of these findings, specific countermeasures and structural adjustments may be targeted in locations with the highest proportions of risky driver behaviors.",2590-1982,Not found
Analysis of severe and non-severe traffic crashes on wet and dry highways,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100043,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"This study examined the effects of several variables associated with geometric, environmental, and drivers' demographic factors on the likelihood of occurrences of traffic crashes on two and four-lane urban and rural highways. Among the variables tested, the key factors contributing to the crash are used as input variables to Poisson and negative binomial regression models. Four separate datasets representing severe and non-severe crashes occurred on dry and wet pavement surfaces are used to develop their respective models. The results of the analysis showed that the common principal determinants influencing both severe and non-severe crashes occurred on dry and wet pavement surfaces on the selected highways are AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic) and TADT (Truck Average Daily Traffic). The posted speed limits were found to be significant only for non-severe crashes occurred on wet pavement surfaces. The urban-rural designation of the segments was found to be a key factor for non-severe crashes occurred on dry pavement surfaces. Macrotexture and IRI (International Roughness Index) were critical determinants for non-severe dry pavement, and severe wet pavement crashes respectively.",2590-1982,Not found
Transportation policy profiles of Chinese city clusters: A mixed methods approach,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100053,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Chinese cities have experienced diverse urbanization and motorization trends that present distinct challenges for municipal transportation policymaking. However, there is no systematic understanding of the unique motorization and urbanization trends of Chinese cities and how physical characteristics map to their transportation policy priorities. We adopt a mixed-method approach to address this knowledge gap. We conduct a time-series clustering of 287 Chinese cities using eight indicators of urbanization and motorization from 2001 to 2014, identifying four distinct city clusters. We compile a policy matrix of 21 policy types from 44 representative cities and conduct a qualitative comparison of transportation policies across the four city clusters. We find clear patterns among policies adopted within city clusters and differences across clusters. Wealthy megacities (Cluster 1) are leveraging their existing urban rail with multimodal integration and transit-oriented development, while more car-oriented wealthy cities (Cluster 2) are building urban rail and discounting public transport. Sprawling, medium-wealth cities (Cluster 3) are opting for electric buses and the poorest, dense cities with low mobility levels (Cluster 4) have policies focused on road-building to connect urban cores to rural areas. Transportation policies among Chinese cities are at least partially reflective of urbanization and motorization trends and policy learning needs to account for these distinct patterns in both physical conditions and policy priorities. Our mixed-method approach (involving time-series clustering and qualitative policy profiling) provides a way for government officials to identify peer cities as role models or collaborators in forming more targeted, context-specific, and visionary transportation policies.",2590-1982,Not found
Driver brake response to sudden unintended acceleration while parking,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100039,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"In the past decade, there has been a rapid increase in reports of sudden unintended acceleration (SUA). While the precipitating conditions for SUA are well known, we know little about how drivers respond in such emergencies and how particular responses might lead to crashes. The goal of this study was to examine how drivers respond to a SUA in a controlled high-fidelity driving simulator experiment that closely replicated the motion cues of real driving. Younger and older drivers encountered a SUA event that mimicked a vehicle malfunction at the end of a simulated drive while executing a parking maneuver. A hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three distinct brake response patterns: hard braking, gradual braking combined with brake pumping, and light or no braking. The critical point in these brake responses, that is, the point at which response types diverged, was about 1 s after the onset of the SUA. Furthermore, older female drivers responded with less brake force than did younger or male drivers. These results indicate that over half of drivers react to SUA with indecisive responses that could lead to crashes. These results have important implications understanding how SUA may lead to crashes. The results also highlight the potential need for advanced driver assistance systems to aid drivers in hazard situations.",2590-1982,Not found
Reducing global warming by airline contrail avoidance: A case study of annual benefits for the contiguous United States,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100033,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"High thin clouds are generated by airliners when hot exhaust gases and water vapor from the jet engines mix with cold, humid air to form high thin clouds. These anthropogenic (human made) condensation trails, or “contrails,” create a green-house effect by absorbing or directing back to Earth approximately 33% of emitted outgoing longwave radiation. Although this effect is estimated to be <2% of the Earth's total anthropogenic radiative forcing, the effect on global warming is immediate, unlike CO2 emissions which have a two decade delay in affecting global warming. Policy makers and industry have asked what is the potential for mitigating contrails through operational changes in air traffic control and flight planning. Previous research calculated contrail inventories for the whole U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) over one year: on an average day only 15% of the flights (34% maximum) generated contrails, most of the contrails were generated in the south-eastern United States and the Pacific coast, and 63% of the total Contrail Along Track Distance was generated from June to September. This information suggests a possibility of mitigating the green-house effect of contrails by seasonally targeting a small set of flights. This paper describes the benefits of adjusting the Cruise Flight Level of a limited number of flights in the U.S. NAS that are flight planned to fly through Ice Super Saturated (ISS) regions that are conducive to the formation of persistent contrails. The analysis found that elevating the Cruise Flight Level of contrail generating flights by 2000′ or 4000′, reduced the number of average daily flights with contrails by an average of −14.8%, the Net Radiative Forcing by an average of −92%, with an average net small decrease in fuel-burn of <1% (due to lower Drag at higher altitudes). The implications of these results and the limitations of the method are discussed.",2590-1982,Not found

This paper focused on three themes: functional background, succession planning, and insider versus outsider. Design/methodology/approach The study combined primary and secondary data, including a unique compilation of CEO profiles from the world's largest 100 airlines. This information highlighted the choices that company boards had made in selecting their leaders. Data was collected through the use of semi-structured interviews and emailed responses with twelve interviewees, consisting of CEOs, non-executive directors (NEDs), and executives and global airline consultants, all with experience from the top 100 airlines. Findings The results indicate that the larger the airline, the more likely it is to have a finance CEO (50% of the top 10 airlines). However, operations CEOs dominate the top 100 airlines, with 24%. Succession planning has strong support, with 72% of CEOs being insiders. NEDs prefer insiders, whereas other interviewees were more open to outsiders. Sixteen per cent of CEOs had no previous airline experience. In 2016, 24% of the top 100 airlines changed their CEO, suggesting that boards may have to give more consideration to outsiders.

A decision tool for policymakers to foster higher-value perishable agricultural exports,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100035,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"A well-functioning logistics environment is key to a country's opportunities for trade, growth and employment. This is particularly relevant for developing countries, where a weak logistics environment often hampers trade. While logistics services are typically provided by private actors, national governments play a key role in ensuring high logistics performance, e.g. via infrastructure investments and regulatory reform. Given limited monetary resources, identifying the most critical investments is a crucial task for developing nations. We develop a decision framework as to which trade logistics interventions to prioritize in a country wishing to facilitate higher-value exports of perishable agricultural goods. The framework includes product-specific supply chain requirements. It is based on primary and secondary data analysis and a literature review. We apply the framework to the Kyrgyz Republic and present a country-specific gap analysis, using results from semi-structured interviews and secondary data analysis. Our results include policy recommendations for measures to improve the supply chain for agricultural goods in the Kyrgyz Republic.

The current study performed an analysis of the perceived risk of public transportation users of Metro Manila travelers during a flood event. Questionnaire data collected among transit users demonstrated that travelers generally perceive low risks (no risk to somewhat not risky) in using public transportation services during a flood event. Furthermore, bivariate analyses and linear regression models revealed that perceived risks primarily depend on the respondent's characteristics and their typical travel situation. Prior travel experience during a flood and beliefs about changes over time in the frequency of flood events also played a role but were less associated with the perceived risk of public transport use during a flood.

In the context of intermodal transport as a relevant application, the modelling frameworks are applied in Belgium-related case studies, in order to draw meaningful managerial insights. Several future scenarios are experimented by analysing a number of parameters that have been identified as significant operational factors and policy levers. The results underline the costly position of rail transport and a clear economic favouring of inland waterways (IWW), potentially attributed to the high rail fixed costs. Additionally, it is suggested that intermodal transport can benefit from rail subsidies, especially during the early stages of covering the market. Even in the best-case scenario, the resulting modal shares are far from reaching the figures desired for freight transport in the EU.

Three variables are considered in the aforementioned models to estimate passenger BA times, namely; the number of alighting passengers, the number of boarding passengers, and the number of passengers on board the bus. The models show that passenger BA times increase with an increase in all three variables (i.e. positive model coefficients). The Cholesky decomposition technique was applied to bootstrapped data to capture the model coefficient correlations with the use of only nine parameters (coefficient means, variances, and correlations) while capturing the stochasticity observed in the empirical data.",2590-1982,Not found
Effect of social capital on the life satisfaction of paratransit drivers in Sri Lanka,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100050,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The three-wheeler, a Sri Lankan form of paratransit, is a popular and important mode of transport in Sri Lankan cities due to largely insufficient public transport systems.

Thus, the objectives of this study are to clarify the actual condition of the industry and to identify the social capital related factors that affect drivers' life satisfaction in three cities in Sri Lanka. To this end, extensive interviews were conducted and revealed that national and local governments do not control the numbers or management of three-wheeler drivers and vehicles, but they do receive rent for using public road space for parking. In order to determine the effect of social capital factors, including working conditions and societal trust levels, on three-wheeler drivers' life satisfaction, we developed an ordered logit model based on questionnaire surveys in three target cities. In addition, the differences among the cities examined regarding provincial policies for three-wheelers, the percentage of drivers who have other jobs, and relationships between drivers' societies were revealed. As a result of the analysis, we identified differences between drivers based in the three cities regarding the social capital and work-related variables that have the greatest impact on their life satisfaction. In particular, we found that drivers based in the city of Kandy emphasized general social capital variables over work conditions and salary, but the opposite was obtained for the cities of Colombo and Moratuwa.",2590-1982,Not found

Translation software: An alternative to transit data standards,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100028,2,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Data standardization is recognized in many disciplines as a critical aspect of data stewardship. Establishing and implementing data specifications increases the usefulness of data collection efforts and facilitates analysis techniques. With the advent of large quantities of machine-generated data, the use of standardized data formats feeds opportunities for visualization and advanced applications with machine-learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The transportation industry made substantial progress with data format specifications in the late 1990s, primarily for highway traffic. Unfortunately, establishing data standards has been an on-going challenge for the transit community. Archived Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) transit data (e.g., Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs), Automatic Fare Card (AFC)) still lack industry standards for data formats.

Resilience literature, particularly the well-known performance recovery curve, is extended to show how infrastructure interdependencies affect reconstruction timelines, and how repair of key infrastructure therefore forms a lower bound on displacement duration that can be estimated using a CIS. CIS modeling literature describes model types and interdependencies for post-disaster recovery models concerned with displacement. These high-level requirements and design specifications are summarized within a simple scorecard and used to evaluate thirteen recent quantitative, recovery-focused CIS models for potential application to disaster displacement.

A vexed question is how the broader benefit of improved transport infrastructure in operation might usefully be leveraged to contribute to the capital investment cost. The Transit-Oriented Development impact of new transportation infrastructure on the value of local property is gaining increasing attention as a potential source of capital contribution. This study investigates the extent of value uplift in property brought about by the announcement and construction of a major transport infrastructure development in Sydney, Australia. A Hedonic Price Model approach is used to assess data on the market valuation of nearby properties and relevant Census data over two distinct project stages: project announcement (2008–2012), and project construction (2013–2019). Findings of the case study show that the impact of rail transit on property prices is significant, but are generally negative at the announcement stage and positive at the construction stage. At the construction stage, residential prices rose an average of 0.037% for every 1% reduction in the distance to the nearest metro station. Of the three models considered for the Hedonic Price Model the Log-linear model (elastic model) has been shown to perform best in representing the relationships in this particular case.",2590-1982,Not found
How to support cooperative driving by HMI design?,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100064,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Cooperative driving means that drivers coordinate their individual driving in a way that the involved drivers facilitate each others' goal achievement. In cooperation situations, like merging or turning left, one driver on a priority road generates a gap to help a driver on a minor road. This study aimed to investigate what kind of information should be provided to the driver via the Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) to support cooperative driving. Therefore, three different visual HMIs that vary in the type of information presented were developed to examine the drivers' information needs. The HMI focus either on the illustration of the partner and the gap, giving an advice how to drive, or the presentation of the current status of the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). The results show that the acceptance, comprehensibility of and reliance in the ADAS for cooperative driving are highest when the HMI highlights the partner and gap. From the perspective of the ‘cooperation granting’ driver confirming explicitly a cooperation request and an advice how to generate the gap are perceived as helpful. This clearly indicates that the driver requesting cooperation prefers information about the situation, whereas the driver granting cooperation additionally appreciates support in how to execute the maneuver.",2590-1982,Not found
Embedding aircraft system modeling to ATM safety assessment techniques: The runway excursion safety case for runway strips with reduced strength,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100026,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Several concepts were developed over the last years to fit safety assessment (SA) techniques to ATM operational needs. Quantitative SA models proved to achieve robust results if reliable data for hazard modeling and corresponding target levels of safety are available, inducing much effort in historic incident data gathering. Meanwhile, we consider hazard probability determination as a reliable mathematical process whereas consequence modeling as second risk component remains mainly a subjective technique. This paper presents an analytic approach to link a mechanical model of a representative critical aircraft part called TSIM (Tire-Soil Interaction Model) to an FEM (Finite Element Method) tire stress simulation to study critical aircraft part failures (here the landing gear) at high detail level during a hazardous condition. In doing so, we can show to significantly and robustly increase the transparency for allocating a severity category to a given hazard compared to current categories based on EASA and other international standards. The research also shows that risk-based aircraft part certification reveals weaknesses in data and setting of target levels of safety (TLS) as a risk considered to be acceptable in non-nominal situations. We apply the developed concept to a runway excursion scenario where the infrastructure is considered non-compliant to EASA/ICAO regulations.",2590-1982,Not found
"Factors associated with physical, psychological and functional outcomes in adult trauma patients following Road Traffic Crash: A scoping literature review",10.1016/j.trip.2019.100061,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Objective Road Traffic Crashes (RTCs) are a major cause of disability globally, with millions of people being injured or disabled each year. This study aims to identify the factors reported in the literature that are associated with physical, psychological and functional outcomes of adult trauma patients following an RTC. Methods A scoping literature review was conducted. Peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. These databases were chosen as the MeSH and Emtree thesauri allow for high specificity searches. Moreover, these databases index the major biomedical/health journals in the field. Results Thirty-one studies from 10 countries are reported in a PRISMA chart and summarized in a matrix. This review identified a number of factors that are clustered into six categories; (i.) injury characteristics and hospital predictive factors; (ii.) demographic factors; (iii.) family and social support; (iv.); compensation system process and fault in the RTC (v.); pre-injury health status. A final category was used to represent the range of (vi.) psychological and functional outcomes. Conclusion These findings highlight the multiple and diverse contributors that influence a person's outcomes following an RTC. These factors are intrinsic and extrinsic and commence from the time of injury as well as highlighting the importance for ongoing support after acute care discharge to enable a quick return to optimal wellbeing. Research examining RTC outcomes must integrate information about the crash response and health care system while simultaneously measuring other factors to appropriately quantify the relative contribution of each variable to psychological and functional outcomes.",2590-1982,Not found
Geoanalysis of park-and-ride facilities for future laboratory-wide commuting program,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100025,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"There is a growing interest in reducing the amount of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) to reduce overall carbon emissions and energy usage. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has more than 4500 employees, most of which live in and around Knoxville, Tennessee. ORNL is currently developing a pilot commuting program for all employees, which incorporates the use of park-and-ride facilities. This study outlines the methodology behind the preliminary geoanalysis and routing used in developing a lab-wide commuting program. The data used for the study included numbers of employee residences per zip code. Commuting configurations by clustered zip code area and vehicle type were developed. Satellite imagery was used to locate actual, suitable parking facilities to accommodate the specified number of residents involved in each commuting configuration. Routing and estimations of travel times were performed using TransCAD. Energy estimates in kilowatt-hours (kwh) and gallons of gasoline, and gallons of gasoline equivalent, were all determined based on the resulting scenarios. Standard petroleum-fuelled vehicles were used in the initial estimates. Standard electric vehicles were also used in alternative scenarios to estimate potential additional energy and fuel savings.

Flood evacuation and rescue: The identification of critical road segments using whole-landscape features,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100022,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"When studying real-world infrastructure systems as networks, one common avenue of analysis is the identification of critical network elements. These features are often defined as the nodes or edges in a given network that play an outsized role in the structure and functionality of the system. When network systems are under duress, particularly during (or just after) large-scale natural disasters, the continuity of networks is heavily dependent on these critical elements. If the critical features are vulnerable to disruption, the robustness of the network is compromised. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel geocomputational method for detecting critical road segments in a post-disaster landscape, with an eye toward human mobility and emergency response. This method accounts for the impacts of non-road landscape features on the overall traversability of an area and is contrasted with traditional critical feature analysis. The developed method provides several advantages, including the ability to produce higher-resolution, higher-fidelity criticality metrics for individual road segments. The paper concludes with a discussion on potential benefits to strategic urban planning, evacuation, and rescue planning during extreme events.",2590-1982,Not found
Identification of trip generators using remote sensing and geographic information system,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100069,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The traditional methods of building and updating databases for transport analysis that address origin/destination (O/D) data collection, such as surveys and traffic counting, are generally manual, costly and time-consuming. This serves as an impediment, especially in developing countries, owing to factors such as scarcity of financial resources, lack of skilled personnel, and high rate of urban criminality that dissuades interviewers from making visits and threatens equipment integrity. In this paper, we propose an alternative methodology that is more agile, cheaper, and safer in comparison, which identifies zones with clusters of trip generators (TG), i.e., areas with the highest potential to generate trips. This method utilizes the object-based image analysis approach to extract from satellite images, zones with high potential to generate trips in the city of João Pessoa in Brazil. It aims to map the land use/land cover (LULC) changes through image classification and associate the resulting LULC classes with the urban trip generation (O/D) data. By identifying zones that generate the most number of trips, the results can help to devise guidelines for conducting fieldwork that can facilitate the creation of a comprehensive repository to improve transportation planning. The identification of TG can supplement or provide preliminary measures for scouting prospective O/D zones. This paper constitutes an effort to integrate remote sensing into the urban planning process, primarily in areas where readily accessible data on transportation facilities and performance either does not exist or is rendered obsolete, which is often the norm in developing countries.",2590-1982,Not found
Creating a prediction model of passenger preference between low cost and legacy airlines,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100075,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The airline industry is highly competitive, and in order to increase profits, airlines are always looking to better target key customers. Increased understanding of customers also helps improve the product from the customer's perspective. This study aims to determine which factors predict airline passengers' preference between legacy and low-cost carriers. The correlational design used creates a prediction model for passengers from the United States. Through two stages of this study, 936 participants (379 females) from the US were utilized for the linear multiple regression analyses to build the model. In the first stage, the regression analysis was used to generate a regression model of passenger preference, which was then tested in the second stage, thereby validating the prediction model. Samples for each stage were independent and subjected to a backward stepwise regression analysis. To determine the influencers of passenger preference, nine potential predictors were surveyed. The predictors were age of the participant, gender of the participant, yearly income of the participant, education level of the participant, seat type, purpose of travel, frequency of travel in a year, category of frequent flier program, and risk-taking tendencies of the participant. The results of the data analysis showed frequency of travel in a year, yearly income of the participant, seat type, and education level of the participant as significant predictors of passengers' preference between legacy and low-cost carriers. This research has practical implications for the airline industry in better understanding the consumer base, which could lead to increased profitability for the carriers.",2590-1982,Not found
The irresistible peak-hour: Instrumental and axiological rationales of work hours' synchronisation,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100063,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"An ever-increasing proportion of the French working population today has working hours that are no longer subject to the explicit diktat of their employer. However, in Île-de-France (Paris region), the problems of morning rush-hour congestion continue to worsen. Before trying to solve peak congestion problems, therefore, we need to understand the underlying reasons behind an individual work schedule choices. Why does a person on flexitime commute during rush hour? Our research adopts an interpretive approach and focuses on daily scheduling demands. It draws on the results of a survey (3202 respondents) and interviews (29) with management level employees working in the Plaine Saint-Denis business district. In describing the temporal strategies that explain voluntary peak-hour commuting, we find results along three dimensions: (I) there are coupling constraints (school times, meeting times) that force workers with flexible hours to commute during peak hours; (II) workers with flexible hours and fewer coupling constraints prefer to arrive before or during rush hour in order to enjoy late afternoon activities with family and friends; (III) there are social norms on working hours (ideal of the disciplined worker or the dedicated executive) that limit flexibility by frowning on those who arrive overly late at the office. In conclusion, by revealing the organic intricacy of the factors that lead to synchronisation, our article is able to generate operational recommendations for reducing congestion at peak hours.",2590-1982,Not found
Computing optimum traffic signal cycle length considering vehicle delay and fuel consumption,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100021,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Traffic signal cycle lengths are traditionally optimized to minimize vehicle delay at intersections using the Webster formulation. This study continues previous work by the authors to enhance the Webster model and develop new formulations to compute the optimum cycle length, considering vehicle delay, fuel consumption, and tailpipe emissions. The microscopic simulation software INTEGRATION is used to simulate two-phase and four-phase isolated intersections over a wide range of traffic demand levels, traffic demand distributions, cycle lengths, and signal timing lost times. Intersection delay, fuel consumption levels, and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are derived from the simulation software. The optimum cycle lengths for various measures of effectiveness are then used to develop the proposed formulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the Webster method overestimates the optimum cycle length and produces unrealistically long cycle length estimates when the traffic volume-to-capacity ratio exceeds 50%. A new logarithmic delay model is proposed herein to address the shortcomings of the Webster model. This model is then calibrated to compute the optimum cycle lengths considering vehicle fuel consumption and emission levels. The estimated optimum cycle lengths for emissions are shown to be longer than the optimum cycle lengths for vehicle delay for lower levels of congestion. The paper demonstrates how a multi-objective cycle length can be computed to simultaneously minimize vehicle delays and fuel consumption levels. After computing the optimum cycle length, the optimum phase split can then be computed using the traditional approach of equating the degree of saturation across all phases. It is anticipated that the proposed formulations will produce significant savings in vehicle delay and fuel consumption levels.",2590-1982,Not found
Does news coverage of traffic crashes affect perceived blame and preferred solutions? Evidence from an experiment,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100073,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Traffic crashes are one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States. Nearly 20% of these roadway fatalities are people who were hit and killed while walking or bicycling. Pedestrian deaths increased by 46% between 2009 and 2016. Despite these troubling statistics, there has not been a sustained and widespread public call to action to improve road safety. Researchers and advocates are increasingly focused on how traffic crashes are reported in the media, and whether existing editorial patterns contribute to victim-blaming and distract from systems-level solutions. However, no previous study has examined whether editorial patterns in traffic crash coverage actually influence perceptions. This study conducted an experiment in which 999 subjects were randomly assigned to read one of three versions of a news article describing a traffic crash involving a pedestrian. After reading the description, subjects were asked to apportion blame, identify an appropriate punishment for the driver, and assess various approaches for improving road safety. In comparing the three groups, even relatively subtle differences in editorial patterns significantly affected readers' interpretation of both what happened and what to do about it on nearly every measure. Shifting from pedestrian-focused to driver-focused language reduced victim-blaming and increased perceived blame for the driver. A thematic frame significantly increased support for infrastructure improvements. This study provides strong evidence that efforts to change public perceptions of road safety should include a focus on improving editorial patterns in traffic crash reporting.",2590-1982,Not found
Driving performance and specific attentional domains,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100077,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Converging evidence from numerous previous studies highlights the relevance of attention in driving. However, these studies mostly conclude from respective situations or use complex tests that tap into further cognitive processes. Aiming a better understanding of specific attentional domains, we investigated the relation between visual selective attention, auditory selective attention, visual divided attention, switching attentional demands, switching between attributes, switching between rules, vigilance and driving performance in a driving simulator. Furthermore, we tested three-way interaction effects with respective attentional domains, inhibition and working memory. In the present study, 123 participants completed a driving scenario as well as commonly used measures of attention (SwAD-task, Oddball-task, MCST, TMT-B, D2), inhibition (Go/NoGo-task), and working memory (visual digit-span-task). Findings indicate no correlations between the tested attentional domains and driving performance. Furthermore, we found no interaction effects with the attentional domains and the two factors of inhibition and working memory on simulator driving performance. The present findings suggest no possibility to transfer findings from specific attentional domains, as well as the used measures for inhibition, and working memory to peoples' simulator driving performance. Along with previous findings we suggest using rather context-specific tasks than basic neuropsychological measures to quantify specific attentional domains, in order to predict peoples' driving performance.",2590-1982,Not found
Link-level travel time measures-based level of service thresholds by the posted speed limit,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100068,3,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Macroscopic parameters, such as density, volume-to-capacity ratio, and speed, are traditionally used to assess the level of service (LOS) of freeway/expressway or arterial road links. Capturing real-world data pertaining to these macroscopic parameters for all the links in the transportation network is expensive, tedious, and challenging. Additionally, density and volume-to-capacity ratio are not easily perceived by the commuters. Recent trends indicate that large-scale travel time data can be collected anonymously and without the use of field technicians, through global positioning systems (GPS), sensors, smartphones with apps, and other technological devices. The focus of this research is to develop link-level travel time measures-based LOS thresholds for urban areas, using large-scale travel time data from a private data source. The posted speed limit for each selected link in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina was integrated with the raw travel time data for the corresponding link. Travel time measures such as the average travel time, the 95th percentile travel time (planning time, PT), the planning time index (PTI), and the buffer time index (BTI) were computed and categorized by the posted speed limit of each selected link. The relationships between estimated speeds from the regional network model and computed travel time measures were then examined to develop LOS thresholds at link-level by the posted speed limit.",2590-1982,Not found

The model was subsequently used to identify the system wide contributory factors that play a role in road crashes, and to identify aspects of road transport systems that could be exploited when developing road safety interventions. The findings show that there are a set of crash contributory factors relating to the raison d'etre, values, and functions of road transport systems. This suggests that further significant reductions in road trauma will only be achieved through fundamental changes to the road transport system itself. Examples discussed include reducing the emphasis on the use of road transport for economic growth, reducing motor vehicle use and increasing active transport modes, and overhauling road safety strategies.",2590-1982,Not found

This study considers innovative freight delivery modes and multi-modal shifts, especially for the last-mile portion of intra-city freight delivery. For this study, GPS data were obtained from a truck fleet from a major parcel delivery company's depot near Columbus, Ohio and used to develop a freight delivery demand estimation model. Freight delivery tours were modeled in TransCAD and used to develop scenarios to incorporate various modal shifts to compare energy usage in kilowatt-hour estimates. Innovative modes of freight delivery were considered for the scenarios and were compared to a class six truck: electric class six trucks, electric delivery vans, parcel delivery lockers, drones, and electric passenger vehicles. Initial findings suggest that electric trucks reduce energy usage when the majority of miles traveled are in the long-haul, or stem portion of the route. Parcel delivery lockers reduced energy usage in suburban areas, especially those with large neighborhoods with cul-de-sacs.

This methodology combines traffic count data with structured qualitative interviews with transport users, operators, regulators and local development experts. A key finding concerned motorcycle taxis which, although officially banned in 2012, remain a common sight in rural Ghana and are generally appreciated by transport users and other stakeholders. Following our presentation of findings to an audience of national stakeholders and policy-makers, a consensus emerged to continue restricting commercial motorcycle operations in cities and on highways, but allowing them on rural roads, if combined with appropriate safety training and regulations.

This paper explores the potential for utilising social media (specifically, the Twitter platform) to provide personalised information to public transport passengers, drawing from lessons learned from related studies. The Tweeting Travel study developed an understanding of the types of dialogues that can unfold on social media between passengers and a simulated travel advice system and then used this to shape development of the TravelBot system. This system provided users with real-time passenger information, including details of relevant travel disruptions that were automatically extracted from social media posts. A user evaluation of a TravelBot trial is presented, findings of which showed that participants highly valued the service and the information it provided, with most indicating a strong desire for the system to continue operation.

Using social media to evaluate associations between parking supply and parking sentiment,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100085,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"A common complaint against changing parking requirements is that parking is critical for businesses to survive. Such statements are generally taken as a statement of fact by planners and local officials, yet there is little empirical work in support of this claim. This research examines how online business reviews reflect customer sentiment toward parking, and how this sentiment is associated with the supply of parking. The Phoenix, Arizona region is used for this analysis. The parking supply at the parcel level is combined with data from user-generated Yelp business reviews to assess satisfaction or frustration with parking at different types of businesses in commercial districts across the region. Results suggest that parking is mentioned in about 5% of overall reviews, and when mentioned in reviews it is most often as a negative characteristic of the establishment. Reviews that mention parking also give significantly lower ratings to businesses. The analysis shows that parking sentiment may be associated in some cases with parking supply, e.g. districts with more parking spaces per business tend to have more positive parking sentiment. Additionally, in areas with shared parking facilities, parking was generally viewed more positively or mentioned less frequently. These findings suggest that parking supply is part of a customer's overall perception of a business, though not a major component, and that shared parking facilities are not associated with negative reviews. Implications for policy are that shared parking can be part of an overall package of parking reforms that satisfy businesses and customers alike.",2590-1982,Not found

Objectives The aims of this study were to 1) explore users' views and preferences with respect to learning to drive; 2) create indicators based on science, experience, and users' views and preferences that can be used to evaluate driver education programs; and 3) use these indicators to measure the gaps between knowledge and practice in an existing adapted driver education program. Method Based on an integrated knowledge translation model, this study used a qualitative and quantitative design consisting of three steps: 1) focus group meeting and telephone interviews with users, 2) definition and validation of criteria and indicators, and 3) chart audit. Results 1) Users' needs and expectations were documented from the focus group meeting and three interviews. 2) Building on the results of step 1 and a review of the literature, including expert opinions on adapted driver's education, 34 quality indicators were created. These indicators were supported by information from the literature (42%), expert opinions (33%), and users' views (25%). 3) Forty charts from an existing program were audited and showed that the indicators are relevant to evaluate the quality of this type of program.

When this hypothesis was validated under two sets of conditions, in a driving simulator and in a naturalistic situation, our algorithm was able to capture the cognitive distraction event in the naturalistic case. In addition, we also review and discuss the eye-movement sensor, which has a marked effect on the results of the evaluation, and the potential of using eye-movement sensors to evaluate cognitive distraction in drivers.",2590-1982,Not found
Mathematical modeling of air pollution in city tunnels and evaluating mitigation strategies,10.1016/j.trip.2019.100086,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"A mаthemаtical model has been developed that is able to describe the environment of the city tunnels being affected by the road traffic, natural and forced air convective flows. The mathematical model describes the peculiarities of the traffic flows on one-lane roads with a satisfactory accuracy. The model well matches experimental data on traffic flows. Multidimensional calculations of the influence of cars on the airflow in tunnels are performed. The numerical model for simulating exhaust gas emissions by automobiles and their accumulation in a tunnel and evolution with traffic induced air flow was developed. The results of numerical investigations make it possible providing recommendations for transport researchers and policy-makers. In particular, it was shown that in the presence of long tunnels on automobile roads it is necessary to choose the traffic arrangement avoiding the necessity for vehicles to come to a full stop and then accelerate in tunnels. This could happen in the presence of traffic lights or other type of traffic regulation near the exit of the tunnel. Thus it is necessary in arranging traffic regulation avoiding placing traffic lights in the proximity of tunnel exit for the waiting cars line to be shorter than the distance from the tunnel exit. In venting the tunnel, the direction of the wind should coincide with the direction of traffic flow. Attempts to arrange venting in the opposite direction for high blockage ratio of a tunnel by vehicles could result in bringing to a worse situation with air pollution.",2590-1982,Not found

The review systematizes the current socio-technical debate on civil drones for transportation purposes allowing for a (critical) interim assessment. To guide the review process four dimensions of analysis were defined. A total of 2581 relevant quotations were subdivided into anticipated barriers (426), potential problems (1037), proposed solutions (737) and expected benefits (381). We found that the debate is characterized by predominantly technical and regulatory problems and barriers which are considered to prevent or impede the use of drones for parcel and passengers transportation. At the same time, definite economic expectations are juxtaposed with quite complex and differentiated concerns regarding societal and environmental impacts. Scrutinizing the most prevalent transportation-related promises of traffic reduction, travel time saving and environmental relief we found that there is a strong need to provide scientific evidence for the promises linked to the use of drones for transportation.

MaaS offers a new paradigm in the access, planning and pricing of travel. To date, however, young people's views and needs have not been explicitly considered within this context. This is despite more general transport work demonstrating that young people have specific needs and perceptions that could influence their use of MaaS now, and their ongoing perceptions of MaaS across their life. Views of young people towards the MaaS concept were captured through workshops using Lego™. Thematic analysis identified specific considerations for young people's perceptions of MaaS around the experience of travel, travel choices, technology, safety, and status and identity. These results include barriers to acceptance and adoption of MaaS, but also reservations regarding the underpinning transport services. These results also demonstrate the importance of recognising young people as active agents in the use of transport rather than passive users, while sharing many of the concerns of adult users. Young people have a rich and complex voice that needs to be considered in the context of a digitalised 21st century transport service provision and understand young people as having agency around their travel choices. As such this paper fills a critical research gap in the MaaS literature.",2590-1982,Not found

Data collected from three urban cities in Metro Cebu are used to determine which factors and transport mode choice are prioritized based on demographic and socioeconomic segments as well as reasons for travelling. Factors and modes of transportation are ranked using analytic hierarchy process. Key findings show that regardless of age, gender, income and intent of travel, safety is ranked first over accessibility, cost of travel, comfort and concern for environment. Despite the worsening traffic conditions and increasing cost of travel, private and semi-private for-hire vehicles are highly ranked over various mass transport systems when all factors are simultaneously considered.

Using a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) we capture their long-run relationship with world GDP and the price of oil, which serves as a proxy for freight rates. The results suggest that all three categories are affected by changes in the world economic environment, albeit to a different extent. Responses to a shock in the price of oil support the argument of the price inelasticity of demand. Dividing the world economy into high, middle and low income countries suggests that the first two always have a positive effect on demand, while low income countries have a negative effect. The quantification of these effects has a wide range of implications in the shipping industry ranging from freight rate forecasts and the associated implications for long-term chartering of vessels, to shipping valuations, risk management, and the mode of financing.",2590-1982,Not found
The illusion of aircrews' fatigue risk control,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100104,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"In the fragmented European airline sector, companies are operating in a highly competitive environment amid rising cost of labour, fuel and airport fees. Fatigue risk management systems (FRMS) contribute to flexibly optimizing crew “utilization” through deviations and derogations from prescriptive European limits on duty times and rest durations. However, the flexibility gained comes at a price: it introduces an internal bureaucracy to mitigate the risks associated with crewmembers' fatigue and to develop, maintain and document fatigue related safety performance indicators. This paper questions the effectiveness of the FRMS framework and suggests that the bureaucratic process of the FRMS provides an illusion of fatigue risk control. More specifically four questions will be addressed: Why an operator needs an FRMS? Why the FRMS involves a bureaucratic process? What are the limits of the bureaucratic accountability of the FRMS and, finally, how might we manage fatigue risk effectively while keeping everyone happy, the shareholders as well as stakeholders?",2590-1982,Not found
"Evaluation of pavement condition index by different methods: Case study of Maringá, Brazil",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100100,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"In order to speed up and prioritize investments in pavement recovery, it is necessary to perform localization and characterization studies of the defects. Thus, the objectives of this study were to analyze the objective and subjective evaluations of the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) used in the Urban Pavement Management System (UPMS) using GIS and identify the most damaged pathways. This research was carried out in the state of Paraná (PR), Brazil. A functional evaluation was performed, with defect identification by means of visual analysis using the PCI method. Two types of evaluation were performed, objective and subjective, which were compared to each other using the coefficient of Pearson's correlation. Subsequently, maps were generated in the ArcGIS 10.2 software. It was observed that 92.21% of the sections were classified as “very good” to “fair,” whereas 7.94% were classified as “poor” or “very poor”. It was possible to prove the similarity between the results of the objective and subjective evaluations from Pearson's correlation. The coefficient resulted in 0.95, a value close to 1 which represents a strong correlation between the data. Thus, the PCI can be determined more quickly and simply through subjective evaluations. Subjective evaluations are indicated for cities where maintenance is performed without any planning, it is a simplified way to evaluate the pavement and have good results. The use of the GIS tool facilitated the visualization of the pavement conditions in the different sections.",2590-1982,Not found
How are car buyers and car sellers currently informed about ADAS? An investigation among drivers and car sellers in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100103,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"This study provides a comprehensive overview of the way consumers and car sellers are currently informed about Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). In order to gain any economical, comfort and safety benefits from automated car systems, drivers need to know how to safely and efficiently use them. Still, it remains largely unknown if, and how, consumers are informed about ADAS when buying a car. Naturally, sales staff has to be accurately informed and instructed as well to inform customers. Two separate nationwide surveys were administered among consumers and car sellers across The Netherlands to gain insight on how they are currently informed about ADAS. The results of our study show several issues about the way that both consumers and car sellers are informed about ADAS. First, almost a quarter of the drivers did not receive any information about the ADAS in the car that they bought. Of the drivers that did receive information, only 9% was able to try out the automated systems before taking the car home. Almost 40% of the car sellers did not receive (sufficient) information about ADAS. However, brand dealers more often received sufficient information about ADAS compared to independent dealers. These issues need to be addressed now to avoid unsafe use of ADAS, but also unsafe use of more complex automated systems that are being incorporated into commercial cars. We propose several opportunities for improvement and standardization which may be implemented by the automotive industry, stakeholder organizations or the government.",2590-1982,Not found
"Designing with differences, cross-disciplinary collaboration in transport infrastructure planning and design",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100106,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"The study explores enablers and barriers of collaborative planning and design work in transport infrastructure planning projects, drawing upon five cases of projects in Sweden. The study apply a set of theoretical lenses complied of previous research focusing professional knowledge and co-production in planning and design practices, and research revolving around the concept of boundary objects in studies of collaborative work. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of practitioners' learning across professional boundaries: what they learn from each other, how they learn, and how the learning facilitates collaborative work. The results show that disciplinary barriers can be bridged through both individual efforts and project management strategies. This study shed light a set of enablers on individual level including; 1) a capacity to change focus between solving tasks within the remit of one's own discipline and jointly solving tasks together with professionals representing other disciplines; 2) curiosity and interest other professional perspectives; 3) willingness to learn from other professionals; and 4) motivation to engage in cross-disciplinary design processes. Project management is proposed to enable collaboration by; 1) opening up discussions about reasons and motives for collaborative work; 2) opening up discussions about strategies for collaborative processes; 3) promoting and facilitating learning processes among project participants, 4) coordinating meetings and activities for collaboration, and 5) facilitating deliberative dialogues at project meetings in which different types of knowledge can be put forth and interrelated.",2590-1982,Not found
Application of tablet-based cognitive tasks to predict unsafe drivers in older adults,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100105,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Background Due to aging and medication interferences, a wide range of motor, sensory, and cognitive skills that are imperative for driving are affected in older adults. Though on-road tests are most indicative of driving ability, they are costly, stressful, time-consuming, and risky. Application of tablet-based cognitive tasks is investigated in identifying unsafe drivers in a population of healthy and at-risk for driving older adults. Method Forty-nine older adult participants aged 54 to 81 (M = 78.08, SD = 9.78) that were screened by their physicians as “at-risk for driving impairment”, and forty-eight control participants aged 54 to 81 years (M = 65.85, SD = 6.93) completed an on-road driving test designed specifically to evaluate cognitive decline related to driving, and a set of tablet-based cognitive tasks (composed of reaction speed, decision making, memory, and bi-manual perceptual-motor tasks) that measured the cognitive skills needed during driving. Accuracy and reliability of predicting unsafe drivers based on the cognitive tasks were investigated using different trichotomous classifiers (class outputs: safe, unsafe, undefined). Results Trichotomous naive Bayes demonstrated the highest overall accuracy performance of 73%, a sensitivity of 69%, and a specificity of 75%. The rate of misclassified unsafe drivers was 19%, and the rate of misclassified safe drivers was 8%. Conclusion High accuracy and reliable prediction of unsafe drivers using cognitive-only tasks in a sample of older adults population demonstrate the efficacy of a widely available screening tool that can be applied in other cognitively impaired populations such as drug users.",2590-1982,Not found

As an alternative to change this scenario, it is proposed in this study to develop sustainability guidelines for urban mobility projects that can be applied in developing countries. Through a case study in a Brazilian city, a method of quantifying GHG emissions for the current scenario of the transport system was developed. From this, it became possible to construct four scenarios that determine sustainable urban mobility guidelines organized by complexity levels from the simplest to the most elaborate, each having different GHGs emission levels. The results indicate that the more comprehensive the mobility system remodeling measures, the lower the GHG emissions. The application of the generated guidelines could lead to a reduction of up to 88.6% of annual GHG emissions in the transport sector for the Brazilian city. Thus, the contributions of this work can guide policymakers and planners to define the levels of complexity to be applied in public policies according to the need to reduce emissions or the resources available to invest in this change.",2590-1982,Not found

We highlight two aspects of fuel quantity and quality management by looking at 1) automobile fuel supply policy and refinery development, and 2) emission regulation and fuel quality monitoring systems (FQM). This research allows us to visualize emission regulation time schedules with refinery updates and fuel quality regulations (Tables 2, 3 and 4). We composed specific data from the real world to create tables on the time schedule from refinery update, vehicle emission introduction to fuel quality. This enables us to understand why fuel quality regulations were delayed in the past and when they will be improved in the future, from a realistic point of view. We also visualized the flow of FQM operation (Figs. 1, 2 and 3) which can be developed from the different market structure of each country. FQM can be summarized as 4 incentives and disincentives: trace causes, sample size, frequency of inspection and strict punishment as a design of FQM operation.

Optimal locations for bikeshare stations: A new GIS based spatial approach,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100101,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"This study identifies three new bike station locations for Baltimore City's bikeshare program using a location allocation spatial analysis tool. Over 1.6 million Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of bikeshare trips over a period of four months were used to identify the routes most frequently used by bikers. It was hypothesized that potential new bike station locations have a relationship with proximity to transit, attractions and restaurants/pubs. A negative correlation was found between route usage intensity and proximity to attractions and restaurants/pubs, which means that the closer the proximity to attractions or restaurants/pubs, the higher the road usage intensity is. A new methodology was developed by modifying Huff's gravity model, replacing facility location size with a suitability score. The bike station suitability score is calculated with regard to proximity to transit, attractions, restaurants/pubs and existing bike stations. A location allocation model is developed to maximize market share, i.e., the potential bike station locations will be accessible to maximum population while also being within a 400-m (0.25-mile) radius of attractions, restaurants/pubs and at least 300 m from existing bike stations. The location of the proposed bike stations through location allocation is within a block of the planned bike stations by the City of Baltimore, which corroborates the findings of this study.

"Impeding access: The frequency and characteristics of improper scooter, bike, and car parking",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100099,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Many cities are grappling with how to regulate new shared mobility modes, including dockless e-scooters and bikes (i.e., “micromobility”). Transportation planners in these cities are particularly concerned about micromobility parking regulations, which have implications for the safety and mobility of riders and the general public. In this research, we investigate the parking practices as well as the frequency and types of parking violations of three types of vehicles operating on city sidewalks and streets: e-scooters, bikes, and motor vehicles. We collected original data on 3666 e-scooters, bikes, motor vehicles, and sidewalk objects in Austin, TX, Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA, Santa Monica, CA, and Washington, DC, to examine micromobility and motor vehicle parking practices. We find that motor vehicles impede access far more (24.7%) than bikes (0.3%) and e-scooters (1.7%). Ride-hail and food delivery drivers disproportionately impede access. Motor vehicles often impeded other travelers' access when dropping off or picking up people or food while double parking, parking in “No Parking” areas, or blocking driveways. Our findings suggest that micromobility companies are just one of several technology-enabled transportation services that should motivate cities to rethink parking policies.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring the price of motor vehicle collisions – A compensation cost approach,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100097,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Motor Vehicle Collisions (MVCs) accounted for an economic cost of $242 billion in the United States in 2010. A significant portion (42%) was associated with factors considered for compensation estimates – medical costs, lost earnings and reduced household productivity. This study proposes a methodology that accounts for these costs by using expected compensation costs (ECCs). Our approach differs from prior studies as we consider all injuries suffered by an individual in the MVC, rather than only the ‘most severe’ injury. We estimate ECCs for each injured occupant by linking the injuries suffered with guidelines on injury compensations, allowing for ECCs to be linked directly with collision factors. To demonstrate the ECC system, we conduct a cross-sectional mediation analysis to study the relationships between collisions and compensation. delta-V (the change in a vehicle's speed pre- and post-crash) remains a primary factor in the severity of MVCs and so it serves as a focal point in our study. We find that some collision factors influence compensation estimates because of the effects of delta-V, while others influence ECCs regardless of delta-V. The ECC system we introduce can mitigate litigation risk and highlight future approaches to road safety, as it bridges the gap between crash characteristics, injuries suffered, and economic damage. Our results support policy recommendations that promote seatbelt use and warn against alcohol-impaired driving, and support the proliferation of safety-enabled vehicles whose technology can mitigate the economic damage associated with detrimental crash types.",2590-1982,Not found
Insects and aviation safety: The case of the keyhole wasp Pachodynerus nasidens (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) in Australia,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100096,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"While birds and other vertebrates are well known hazards to aviation at airports, the threat posed by invertebrates is less well understood. Here we present an example of a serious risk to flight safety from the mud-nesting keyhole wasp (Pachodynerus nasidens) which views aircraft pitot probes as an attractive nesting opportunity at Brisbane Airport. Pitot probes measure airspeed, and obstructions can render measurements inaccurate, leading to serious and potentially catastrophic consequences. We undertook experiments over 39 months to determine rates of nesting in pitot probes and the associated risk of blocked probes. We also examined how this risk was reduced by covering probes. A bow-tie risk analysis was completed to assess the safety, reputation, one-off financial loss, and injury and illness costs of a range of incidents of increasing severity, and climate modelling was used to show the potential spread of the keyhole wasp in Australia. The reduction in risk from covering 33% to 75% of all probes on arrival is substantial and made more significant when the costs of incidents are set against those of wasp management. The prospects for eradicating the keyhole wasp and the prospect of it spreading to other parts of Australia with suitable climatic conditions are discussed in view of the substantial risk the species presents.",2590-1982,Not found
Emerging data for pedestrian and bicycle monitoring: Sources and applications,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100095,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Growing attention on the benefits of non-motorized travel has increased the demand for accurate and timely pedestrian and bicycle travel data. Advancements in technologies and the proliferation of smartphones have created new data sources that can help eliminate limitations related to small sample size and infrequent updates due to limited resources. This study reviews the emerging data sources and their current use, focusing on non-motorized travel monitoring. In this study, the emerging data are categorized into mode-unspecified and mode-specified data based on whether the mode used can be detected with no or little effort. While mode-unspecified data are collected without sorting out non-motorized travelers, mode-specified data at least know who (which mode) is being monitored. So far, commercial vendors provide a vast volume of mode-unspecified data, but their products have been mainly used for motorized trips or are in initial stages of development. Meanwhile, readily available data sources and their applications are more concentrated on mode-specified data, which have enabled varying non-motorized travel studies—including travel pattern identification, route-choice modeling, crash/air pollution exposure estimation, and new facility provision evaluation—but are mostly focused on bicycling. Despite the potential of emerging data, their use also has several challenges, such as limited mode inference, sample bias, and lack of detailed trip/traveler information due to privacy issues.

There is a lack of clear understanding of conflicts between pedestrians and cyclists, as they result in few reported incidents or injuries. More research is needed on the frequency and causes of pedestrian-cyclist incidents, and how those incidents affect the comfort and perceived safety of travelers by each mode. The objectives of this research were 1) to investigate the relationship between expressed safety concerns and experienced incidents for travelers in a high-volume non-motorized shared space, and 2) to examine primary factors in pedestrian-cyclist incidents. Data were acquired from an intercept survey of 337 travelers conducted on a large university campus. Results reveal a high frequency of incidents with physical contact between people walking and cycling, consistently described by each, which led to few injuries but verified the expressed concerns of survey participants and anecdotal reporting to the campus transportation agency. Prior experience of an incident was a significant factor influencing perceptions of safety. Cyclists were at least as concerned about intermodal conflicts and safety as pedestrians and preferred to avoid pedestrian-dominated areas, but that preference was weighed against travel time, ease of wayfinding, and avoidance of motor vehicles. Both pedestrians and cyclists identified crowding and pedestrian inattention as major contributing factors to incidents, but they disagreed on whether cyclist speed was a factor. Potential strategies to reduce intermodal conflicts in shared spaces include reducing crowding, separating modes, and reducing cycling speeds.",2590-1982,Not found

Physiological changes in heart rate were measured, monitored and recorded before and during the driving test, and the diver perception survey method was also used to evaluate subjects perceived stress level while driving on different median types. For the divided highways with raised-curb median, the results from biometric measures as well as self-perception evaluations suggest that increasing the width of the inner shoulder could help to reduce the driver stress load.

Effects of the driving context on the usage of Automated Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) -Naturalistic Driving Study for ADAS evaluation,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100093,4,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Automated Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support the driver and enhance the driving experience. Due to ADAS limitations associated with the driving context, the intended use of ADAS functions is often non-transparent for the end-user. The system performance capabilities affected by the continuously changing driving context influence ADAS usage. However, the cumulative effect of the driving context on driver behavior and ADAS usage is insufficiently covered in the ongoing research. This paper aims to investigate and understand how the driving context affects the use of ADAS. Throughout this research, data from a Naturalistic Driving (ND) study was collected and analyzed. The analysis of the ND data helped to register how drivers use ADAS in different driving conditions and indicated several issues associated with ADAS usage. To be able to clarify the outcomes of quantitative sensor-based data analysis, an explanatory sequential mixed-method design was implemented. The method facilitated the subsequent design of qualitative in-depth interviews with the drivers.

In this paper, we comprehensively review methods from the existing literature for assessing the equity of a few important system outcomes: accessibility, traffic emissions, and safety. We also identify the existing challenges of analyzing equity for emerging transportation technologies. We unify the existing methodologies into a three-step framework that includes population measurement, cost/benefit measurement and equity assessment, and we summarize the applicable measurements for each step, in detail.

This paper examines how commute duration is associated with activity patterns. It utilizes a two-day time use survey administered in the United Kingdom in 2014 and 2015. Focusing on full-time employees and controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, we regress time spent engaging in 22 different activities on commute duration using OLS and Cragg two-part hurdle modeling. We separately test the effects of commute duration on activity participation for men versus women and for single persons versus persons in couples. We also report the subjective well-being (SWB), specifically the hedonic affect, associated with these activities as determined by using fixed-effects panel regression. The estimations suggest that commutes are associated with time constraints and entail trade-offs, with longer commutes being associated with significantly less time engaging in most of our activities including sleep, cooking, housework, shopping/accessing services, arts/entertainment activities, TV/music time, computer games and other computer use, visiting with others, sports/exercise/outdoor activities, hobbies, volunteering, and non-work travel. Those with longer commutes are found to tend to engage in more of two activities: work and eating out. The activities those with longer commutes tend to forego run the gamut from high-SWB to low-SWB. Given that the lowest-SWB activity in our sample is commuting itself, it appears as if the substitution of nearly any activity for commuting may bring emotional benefits. In all, the results suggest that longer commutes are associated with significant emotional costs.",2590-1982,Not found
Can Sharing Economy Platforms Increase Social Equity for Vulnerable Populations in Disaster Response and Relief?

Recent sharing economy advances – including transportation network companies (TNCs, also known as ridehailing and ridesourcing), carsharing, and homesharing – may supplement public resources and ensure more equitable evacuations. To explore the social equity implications of the sharing economy in disasters, we conducted four focus groups (n = 37) of vulnerable populations impacted by California wildfires in 2017 or 2018. To structure these data, we employed the Spatial Temporal Economic Physiological Social (STEPS) equity framework in an evacuation context. We contribute to the literature by: 1) summarizing the focus groups and their opinions on the sharing economy in evacuations; 2) capturing wildfire evacuation obstacles through the STEPS transportation equity framework; and 3) linking STEPS and focus group results to explore the future potential of shared resources. Using STEPS, we also expand our shared resource exploration to 18 vulnerable groups. We found that all focus groups were highly concerned with driver availability and reliability and the ability of vehicles to reach evacuation zones, not necessarily safety and security. Each group also expressed specific limitations related to their vulnerability. For example, individuals with disabilities were most concerned with inaccessible vehicles and homes. Using the STEPS framework, we found that while multiple vulnerable groups could gain considerable benefits from shared resources, 10 of the 18 groups experience three or more key challenges to implementation.

Ethical decision making behind the wheel – A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100147,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Over the past several years, there has been considerable debate surrounding ethical decision making in situations resulting in inevitable casualties. Given enough time and all other things being equal, studies show that drivers will typically decide to strike the fewest number of pedestrians in scenarios where there is a choice between striking several versus one or no pedestrians. However, it is unclear whether drivers behave similarly under situations of time pressure. In our experiment in a driving simulator, 32 drivers were given up to 2 s to decide which group of pedestrians to avoid among groups of larger (5) or smaller (≤1) number of pedestrians. Our findings suggest that while people frequently choose utilitarian decisions in the typical, abstract manifestations of the Trolley Problems, drivers can fail to make utilitarian decisions in simulated driving environments under a restricted period of time representative of the time they would have to make the same decision in the real world (2 s). Analysis of eye movement data shows that drivers are less likely to glance at left and right sides of crosswalks under situations of time duress. Our results raise critical engineering and ethical questions. From a cognitive engineering standpoint, we need to know how long at minimum a driver needs to make simple, moral decisions in different scenarios. From an ethical standpoint, we may need to evaluate whether automated vehicle algorithms can aid decision making on our behalf when there is not enough time for a driver to make a moral decision.",2590-1982,Not found

To explore individuals' attitudes and perceptions regarding the act of supplying a personal vehicle to peer-to-peer vehicle fleet, a stated preference survey was designed and disseminated between February and April of 2018 where survey respondents were asked how likely they would be to rent their car (extremely unlikely, unlikely, unsure, likely, extremely likely). The survey questionnaire collected detailed socio-demographic information, as well as data on travel behavior and travel patterns. These data were then used to estimate a random parameters ordered probit model of their likelihood of renting their car. Some of the variables found statistically significant determinants of the willingness to rent a personal vehicle were gender, age, income, household composition, vehicle ownership, living location with respect to a grocery store, and participation in other shared mobility modes. The above findings and especially the gender and income related variables were found to complement prior literature and offered additional layer of understanding of the factors determining the supply side of peer-to-peer carsharing. The findings of this study offer some initial insights into the factors that may determine the success or failure of this novel transportation alternative.",2590-1982,Not found
Agent-based vulnerability assessment at airport security checkpoints: A case study on security operator behavior,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100139,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Despite enormous investments in airport security, terrorists have been able to find and exploit vulnerabilities at security checkpoints. Existing vulnerability assessment methodologies struggle with accounting for human behavior, and agent-based modelling forms a promising technique to overcome this limitation. This paper investigated how the decision-making and performance of human operators can be taken into account while assessing vulnerability at an airport security checkpoint. To this end, an agent-based model was designed, in which the performance of security operators was modelled using a functional state model, while decision making was modelled using decision field theory. Passengers and an attacker that brings a weapon to the security checkpoint were also explicitly modelled as agents. Simulation results indicate that the highest skilled operators outperformed their lowest skilled counterparts on analyzing X-ray images, but performed worse on both searching luggage and performing patdowns. Furthermore, results showed that a high focus on speed of security operators leads to a decrease in luggage searches and therefore increased vulnerability. More work is needed to calibrate and validate the simulation results, but initial results are promising. The agent-based model can be used by airport regulators and managers to understand the workings of their security checkpoint better and ultimately to reduce vulnerabilities.",2590-1982,Not found
"Transit in flex: Examining service fragmentation of app-based, on-demand transit services in Texas",10.1016/j.trip.2019.100060,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"App-based, on-demand services are a nascent mode of public transportation, which can provide point to point transportation, first-last mile access to fixed route transit, or serve in place of paratransit, among other uses. First-last mile service has emerged as a dominant service model in the Federal Transit Administration's MOD Sandbox Program. However this service model also requires strong integration between app-based, on-demand services and the traditional fixed route lines they connect to. Following previous research identifying the role transit governmental institutions can play in creating barriers to service integration, this study examines whether and how governmental institutions known to impact fixed route services have a similar effect on app-based, on-demand modes. This study surveys cities and transit agencies across Texas. Interviews and archival analysis are used to identify fragmentation challenges and causes in app-based, on-demand services. This study finds that many of the jurisdictional challenges identified for fixed route services also apply to emerging app-based, on-demand services. However the need for integration of apps poses a challenge not seen before. Integration needs make app-based, on-demand services of limited suitability for first/last mile connectivity when provided by separate agencies or companies, when formal and informal coordination is poor, and when fixed route services are infrequent.",2590-1982,Not found
The cruise industry and the COVID-19 outbreak,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100136,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The movement of cruise ships has the potential to be a major trigger of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks. In Australia, the cruise ship Ruby Princess became the largest COVID-19 epicenter. When the Ruby Princess arrived at the Port of Sydney in New South Wales on March 19, 2020, approximately 2700 passengers disembarked. By March 24, about 130 had tested positive for COVID-19, and by March 27, the number had increased to 162. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between the cruise industry and the COVID-19 outbreak. We take two perspectives: the first analysis focuses on the relationship between the estimated number of cruise passengers landing and the number of COVID-19 cases. We tracked the movement of all ocean cruise ships around the world using automatic identification system data from January to March 2020. We found that countries with arrival and departure ports and with ports that continued to accept cruise ships until March have a higher COVID-19 infection rate than countries that did not. The second analysis focuses on the characteristics of cruise ships infected with COVID-19. For this purpose, we utilize the list named “Cruise ships affected by COVID-19” released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As a result, cruise ships infected with COVID-19 were large in size and operated regular cruises that sailed from the same port of arrival and departure to the same ports of call on a weekly basis.",2590-1982,Not found
Air quality and fossil fuel driven transportation in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100137,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"In this paper, we use origin and destination mobility surveys and high-resolution assignment and emission models to study air quality and short-lived climate pollutant impacts related to on-road transportation in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP). To begin with, we calculate transport carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel-driven vehicles (light and heavy-duty) at spatial and temporal resolutions of 500 m and one hour, by means of traffic demand forecasting. These estimates, carry out for 2007 and 2012, are based on passenger and freight trips and the height of the atmospheric boundary layer, among other variables. These proxies depend also on ancillary parameters as particulate matter concentrations and dilution rates. In the second place, we evaluate the changes in CO2 emissions from the MASP (3%/year). Transport emission inventories combine mobility surveys and road network assignments with air quality data. In spite of using different methodologies, bottom-up road link assignments versus top-down vehicle activity-based and fuel consumption approaches, the estimated CO2 emissions are consistent with the Official São Paulo State's Inventory. This work found that the CO2 emissions in MASP were 10,044 and 11,503 t Ceq./day in 2007 and 2012 (73% light and 27% heavy vehicles), respectively. On-road emission patterns agree with the spatial-temporal variation of transportation journeys and corresponding passenger and freight network assignments. Temporal patterns, diurnal, weekly and monthly, were determined using traffic counts and congestion surrogates. The patterns were also crosschecked with average CO2 measurements, available for 2014 at the road (western area of MASP) and background sites (Jaraguá Peak). Kerbside road measurements showed two prominent peaks associated to the morning (437 ± 45 ppm) and night rush hours (435 ± 49 ppm), coupled to low values of boundary layer height (313 m) and dilution rate (329 m2/h). Background values (414 ± 2 ppm) were subtracted from on-road measurements to estimate excess CO2 (12 ± 8 ppm) directly attributed to vehicles. The inventory reflects the relationships between traffic patterns and emissions, and the developed methodology could be used to evaluate the impacts of forthcoming urban transport and emission control policies. In the future, our estimates will be verified with ground measurements of CO2 concentrations over a bigger monitoring network in the MASP.",2590-1982,Not found
"Exploring the relationship between the built environment, trip chain complexity, and auto mode choice, applying a large national data set",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100134,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"In the completion of transport-based activities, some people save time by chaining trips with different purposes. Several studies have found that trip chaining encourages car use, while others find that features of the built environment can enable complex trip chains without the use of the car. Relatively few studies have presented analyses of trip chains and mode choice that also include built environment variables, although it is well established that urban density and urban structure influence on the transport mode distribution. In this paper we explore the relationship between the built environment, trip chaining, and auto mode choice in Norway. We apply national travel survey data, deriving commuting and non-commuting home-to-home trip chains, terming trip chains with more than two legs “complex”. We add built-environment measures, including the density of inhabitants plus employments, and their balance, the number of public parking lots and transit stops/stations, as well as the distance to the nearest urban centre. We run models splitting the travel survey data into two subsets, one more urban and the other more rural. We find that higher minimum density at destinations is consistently associated with lower odds of a complex trip chain and of auto mode choice. Longer distance from the residence to the nearest centre increases the odds of car use, and reduces the odds of a complex trip chain. The association with other built-environment characteristics depends on area type and whether it is commuting or not. A higher maximum distance from a destination to an urban centre increases the odds of a complex trip chain and auto mode choice in the more urban subset of the data, but in the more rural subset of the data such association is only found for commuting trip chains. The job-population balance in the home area shows negative association with auto mode choice; and in the more urban subset also a negative association with complex commuting trip chains. The more urban subset comprised municipalities with registered numbers of public parking lots; a higher minimum parking lot number at destinations in the trip chain was associated with lower odds of a complex trip chain, as well as higher odds of choosing the car as the main mode in non-commuting trip chains.",2590-1982,Not found
Survey on residents' willingness in the renovation of traffic environments in old communities,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100132,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Old communities in many cities in China have serious traffic problems, such as congestion, outdated facilities and chaotic traffic. Therefore, it is important to update the traffic environment of these communities. Based on a survey of five typical old residential communities in Changsha, China, this paper analyzes the effect of factors such as age, gender, education level, occupation, and car ownership on preferences for traffic environment renewal. Most residents can tolerate a maximum walking distance of no >300 m to a parking lot and no >500 m to a bus stop. Age, education level, and occupation were related to the longest walking distance to a parking lot that residents could accept. Gender, age, education level, and occupation were related to the longest walking distance to a bus station that residents could accept. A large proportion of residents currently have a walking range of >500 m during their routine activities. Most residents believed that it is necessary to ensure the separation of pedestrians and vehicles in the community and that vehicles should be parked in parking lots or garages instead of merely along the road. Gender and occupation were related to the walking distance range of residents in the community and whether residents thought it necessary to achieve pedestrian-vehicle separation. Age, education level, and occupation were related to the choice of parking mode.",2590-1982,Not found
Framing systemic traffic violence: Media coverage of Dutch traffic crashes,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100109,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Traffic crashes undeniably levy a significant and detrimental toll on contemporary societies. They are a disruption of every-day traffic order, and the specifics of their coverage in the media offer insights into how a society frames and perceives this underlying order. This study analysed the terms and frames that are used in 368 reports on traffic crashes in local Dutch newspapers. The coding is embedded in the larger debates about competing frames of mobility (efficiency versus justice), and informed by recent studies on traffic crash reporting. The study adds a novel geographical context to the Northern American focus of earlier work, and a broader scope of traffic crash types (including non-fatal crashes and all vehicle types). The reviewed articles support the previous findings that media coverage largely dehumanizes traffic crashes, presenting them more as glitches in the machine (efficiency) than human tragedies (justice). Crashes are presented as episodes instead of as part of a larger pattern, in a factual tone. Parties involved in a crash, and especially secondary parties are most often referred to as vehicles instead of persons and most often the headlines use a non-agentive grammar. However, the study also demonstrates that the way we currently study this coverage is limiting us in develop a full understanding of the complex nature of traffic crashes. To overcome this, we need to deploy mixed methods and a richer coding scheme that help us to get a better grip of the systemic violence of our contemporary traffic.",2590-1982,Not found
Does a fighter pilot live in the danger zone? A risk assessment applied to military aviation,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100114,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Military aviation is different compared to civil aviation. The two main differences are the operational environment and aircraft characteristics. The United States Air Force (USAF) conducts a range of military operations from rescue missions to full-scale war environments. Military aviation, because of its operational environment and aircraft characteristics, works under frequent risk. This paper investigates the probability of accidents occurring among the current USAF's fleet and classifies which aircraft is the most dangerous to fly. After performing goodness-of-fit tests using historical data, a Gamma-Poisson probability distribution is used to model the probability of Class A mishaps, Class B mishaps, and Fatalities. The results show that three aircraft have a probability >20% of one fatality occurring. These three aircraft are classified in the study as “The 20% Club,” and the pilots of these aircraft are exposed to higher risks during operations compared to other military aircraft. The results showed that fighter pilots, due to the nature of their missions, have a higher probability of incidents, accidents, and fatalities occurring. However, the results also show that fighter pilots are not the only ones who face a constant risk; transport and training aircraft also presented a high probability of accidents or fatalities, showing how risky military aviation is.",2590-1982,Not found
The ultimate smart mobility combination for sustainable transport? A case study on shared electric automated mobility initiatives in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100129,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The current mobility system faces severe sustainability challenges and requires a fundamental change. Enabled by smart mobility innovations, the previously separate fields of shared, electric, and automated mobility seem to converge into a promising alternative. As the ultimate combination, it is expected to have a major impact by transforming the current mobility system. This paper provides an empirical perspective by looking into the promises of the combination and the current state of development by conducting a case study in the Netherlands on shared electric automated mobility initiatives. The case study demonstrates that the initiators mobilized promises of reduced automobility and promises of increased sustainability to develop their shared electric automated mobility initiatives. The initiators, however, also experienced several difficulties, such as operational and technical issues and the difficulty of involving users. Automation was often regarded as an element to overcome these implementation challenges and is, therefore, also seen as an interesting business opportunity. Although promising in some regards, the combination might also result in the opposite effect, increasing car-dependency and diminishing any environmental benefits. Developments are still at an early stage, but the continuous involvement of a wide range of actors remains crucial to move beyond just vehicles and steer the developments into a direction of a shared electric automated mobility system, including the integration of multiple modes and alternative mobility developments.",2590-1982,Not found

This article aims to summarise and synthesise the literature to support practitioners and advocates seeking to increase urban cycling. We undertake a broad review of the research literature focused upon international best practices, and the challenges that may impede their implementation. In doing so, we synthesise a Planning for Cycling Maturity Model – a framework which can be used to identify and conceptualise barriers to cycling, benchmark practices between jurisdictions, and illustrate the need for specific policy approaches to guide effective, evidence-based measures to increase participation in cycling.",2590-1982,Not found
Spoilt - Ocean Cleanup: Alternative logistics chains to accommodate plastic waste recycling: An economic evaluation,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100115,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Every year about 300 million tons of plastic is produced, resulting in more than five trillion plastic particles currently floating in the oceans five largest convergence zones. The Ocean Cleanup is testing a method to passively collect this floating plastic debris, transport, recycle, process and sell it. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate alternative logistics chains to accommodate ocean plastic waste recycling by connecting transport with data collection and data analytics. The scenarios are based on different geographical destinations, supply chain lengths and types, and offered local development opportunities. A new reverse logistics channel dedicated to the Ocean Cleanup is developed, as existing reverse logistics supply chains are not able to capture the specifics of the plastic waste collection. Performances of the different scenarios are assessed by collecting data (on plastic volumes collected from the Ocean, on usage of plastics as a resource, and on transport cost) and usage of a detailed integrated model which enables a performance comparison of different logistical structures on logistics costs and on plastics production outputs. The cheapest and most disappointing solution would be to do nothing. However, the analysis shows that more complicated logistic structures whereby the collected plastic waste is used to produce glasses, socks, and carpets can lead to sustainable business models for cleaning up the Oceans. If the focus would be only on cost, the best model would be to minimize the transport distance and focus on San Francisco as closest port for the selected gyre to be analyzed.",2590-1982,Not found
Influenza risk perception and travel-related health protection behavior in the US: Insights for the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100127,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Influenza is a contagious virus affecting both one's health and economic productivity. This study evaluates uses a survey of 2168 individuals across the U.S. Ordered logit regressions are used to model risk perception and generalized ordered logit regressions are used to model risk mitigation travel-related decisions. Models are estimated for three influenza outbreak scenarios, specifically an individual's travel-related: 1) risk perceptions, 2) risk mitigation decisions when infected and the individual wants to prevent spreading it, and may want treatment, and 3) risk mitigation decisions when not infected and the individual wants to reduce exposure. Risk perception results show that a recent personal experience with influenza-like symptoms and being female significantly increased risk perception at mandatory and medical trip locations. Risk mitigation model results show that males are less likely to alter their travel patterns in response to the possible spreading of the virus or increasing exposure. Knowing the difference between influenza and the stomach flu is more influential in reducing travel than a recent influenza experience in one's household. Individuals proactive with their health (i.e., receive the vaccine, have health insurance) are also proactive in seeking medical attention and reducing influenza spread. Lastly, aligned with the Protection Motivation Theory, individuals reduce travel to locations in which they perceived medium or high risk. However, increased risk perceived at one's work location did not significantly reduce travel. The findings provide insight into the risk perception and mitigation behavior of the American public during the COVID-19 pandemic and after restrictions are lifted.",2590-1982,Not found

The research was conducted under the Low Carbon Transport Theme. It examines policy knowledge-seeking among transport researchers and practitioners in a subgroup of nine Sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries; these experts are already convinced of the need for HVT measures and are seeking knowledge regarding successful policy-transfer in order to accelerate transport decarbonisation. The policies in the countries investigated in this study recognise the need to reduce transport emissions, but this is rarely the measure that drives mobility interventions. Meeting the Paris Agreement targets will depend on whether low carbon, sustainable transport is rapidly and broadly implemented. Interviews with key informants include questions relating to motivations for seeking policy knowledge; the key policy knowledge that interviewees seek in order to shift country priorities or accelerate low-carbon development; and how best to share and access appropriate and relevant knowledge. These questions are drawn from the policy-transfer theory and processes described in the literature. Findings from the interviews suggest that key informants are aware of the prevalence and impact of uncritical, unsuccessful policy transfer, given their experiences with new transport measures in their countries; this is a significant lesson-learned. The value of context-specific transport policy transfer rather than off-the-shelf solutions is recognised by key informants, and appropriate policy knowledge is actively sought. A research gap exists to document an evidence-base regarding the influences and mechanisms that lead to successful low-carbon transport transfer processes in low-income countries.",2590-1982,Not found

This is attributable to the fact that many governments around the world have a budget constraint and may try to prioritize their budget for other developments in need. Allowing a private sector to participate in investment is an important step towards the cost-saving for a government. The private sector has an advantageous opportunity in the investment partnership, and public users tend to have superior service. Thai government envisages potential advantages of PPP and adopts this practice in various projects. However, the new mega project linking 3 airports is one of the first highspeed rail projects in Thailand of which the Thai government has insufficient experience. There are serious concerns whether the PPP adoption could enable a viable option. Therefore, this study aims to analyze benefits and risks of PPP adoption in the High-Speed Rail Project Linking 3 Airports in Thailand. Lifecycle assessment has been carried out by breaking down the project into various phases. Field data have been gathered from different sources such as an official website, feasibility study reports, annual reports of related government agencies, and opinions from technical experts in private sector. Financial analysis is used to analyze and calculate related financial values. The results reveal that the PPP adoption in this project yields different benefits and risks depending on each phase of the project. Adopting PPP can overcome key limitations and provide some real benefits that the traditional approach cannot. Simultaneously, there are risks incurred from the PPP adoption due to the complexity in PPP partnership such additional transaction costs and interrelation complexity.

Rail and road public transport: Cooperation or coexistence?,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100122,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"In this paper we analyse the performance of 34 multimodal public transport networks worldwide to investigate whether the service characteristics of their metro components significantly affect bus performance and vice versa as well as whether their operational environment exerts the same impact on metro and bus public transport modes. We built a combined effectiveness model to simulate the production process of both bus and metro systems and calculated credible performance scores for them by applying data envelopment analysis and bootstrapping techniques. Results showed that, on average, both bus and metro systems require a great ridership increase to reach their best performing peers. We employed conditional robust order-m efficiency estimators to identify factors that may account for these performance rankings. Empirical findings indicate that bus and metro systems more coexist than cooperate in terms of developing their performance profiles. Bus and metro systems are influenced by different exogenous factors and fail to incorporate effectiveness improvements if service upgrades are delivered in their road or rail public transport counterparts. Our findings provide for a better understanding of the interrelationships within multimodal public transport networks and thus contribute to the formulation of both appropriate decision making and realistic performance targets.",2590-1982,Not found
Distracted by “distracted pedestrians”?,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100118,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Some observers view distracted walking as a menace, while others contend that concern is overblown. Understanding these competing frames about pedestrian safety is essential because interpretive frames influence how we try to solve problems. In this study, we survey transportation practitioners to gauge how concerned they are about distracted walking, assess whether windshield bias and professional training influence concern, and determine whether concern influences preferred policy solutions for reducing pedestrian deaths. One third of transportation practitioners surveyed view distracted walking as a large problem, estimating that it was responsible for 40% of pedestrian deaths. Practitioners were more concerned about distracted walking if they primarily use a car or spend little time in pedestrian -oriented areas (windshield bias), or if they work in engineering or public health (professional training). Most importantly, the distracted walking frame does indeed shape policy solutions. Practitioners concerned about distracted walking were more likely to endorse individual-level solutions (like educational campaigns) and were less likely support reducing vehicle speeds. Concern about distracted walking detracts attention from more deadly risk factors, more effective policy approaches, and, most importantly, is inconsistent with the ethos of making streets safe for all users, including children, the elderly, and vision impaired people. Instead of focusing on educational campaigns, practitioners should focus their pedestrian safety efforts on the biggest risk factors and the most effective solutions.",2590-1982,Not found
Autonowashing: The Greenwashing of Vehicle Automation,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100113,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The presence of automation is growing in the domains of our homes, workplaces, and roadways. Vehicle automation in particular is raising critical human factors issues which directly impact human-machine interaction and road safety.

Studies indicate that media and marketing descriptions of vehicle automation affect user perceptions of asystem's capabilities, and later their interaction with the system. Much like “greenwashing”, the capabilities of automation are often overstated. The lack of public awareness of this issue is one of the most critical problems impacting trust calibration and the safe use of vehicle automation. Yet, it has gone unnamed and continues to affect the public understanding of the technology. Hence, the case for the use of the term “autonowashing” to describe the gap in the presentation of automation and the actual system capabilities is put forth.

The authors propose future research recommendations and training/education strategies for enhancing interprofessional collaboration around transportation equity for environmental justice populations.",2590-1982,Not found
Testing on the move: South Korea's rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100111,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The emergence of COVID-19 in South Korea, and the public and private sector response to it, serves as a valuable case study for countries facing similar outbreaks. This article focuses on how Korean health officials implemented drive-through and walk-through diagnostic testing, and extensive movement and contact tracing, to identify and inform exposed members of the public. Mobile applications from both government agencies and private developers played an important role in guiding people to testing centers, communicating movement trajectories of confirmed cases on digital maps, and tracking the health and movements of travelers and others at risk of exposure. This case study illustrates the importance of rapid adaptation of transportation infrastructure and location-based information technology to respond to public health crises, and how governments can learn from experimentation and past experience to accelerate these responses.",2590-1982,Not found
COVID-19 and airline employment: Insights from historical uncertainty shocks to the industry,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100123,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of uncertainty shocks on airline employment in the light of the current global pandemic. The airline industry has faced many threats throughout history, but none quite as rapid and severe as the one posed by the spread of COVID-19. One constant during uncertainty shocks and industry downturns is that airline labor bears the brunt of the decline. As the industry reduces capacity amid the increase in travel restrictions, the post-stimulus impacts to airline labor are not known. Using time series analysis, the dynamics of historical uncertainty shocks to the industry are examined. During periods of uncertainty shocks, the estimated job loss is nearly 7% of the airline workforce with an upper bound of over 13%. Major airline employment is most impacted, while low-cost and regional airline employment is least impacted. The hardest hit employees are ones related to passenger handling and flight operations, while management employees fair slightly better during these uncertain periods. Further, recovery following uncertainty shocks is estimated to take between 4 and 6 years. Overall, the labor impacts to the airline industry from uncertainty events are substantial and provide insight into the expected industry job loss from COVID-19.",2590-1982,Not found
The effect of COVID-19 and subsequent social distancing on travel behavior,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121,5,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in unprecedented measures restricting travel and activity participation in many countries. Social distancing, i.e., reducing interactions between individuals in order to slow down the spread of the virus, has become the new norm. In this viewpoint I will discuss the potential implications of social distancing on daily travel patterns. Avoiding social contact might completely change the number and types of out-of-home activities people perform, and how people reach these activities. It can be expected that the demand for travel will reduce and that people will travel less by public transport. Social distancing might negatively affect subjective well-being and health status, as it might result in social isolation and limited physical activity. As a result, walking and cycling, recreationally or utilitarian, can be important ways to maintain satisfactory levels of health and well-being. Policymakers and planners should consequently try to encourage active travel, while public transport operators should focus on creating ways to safely use public transport.",2590-1982,Not found
Rail factor and realism of the unconscious,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100144,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The paper reviews the spoken but unknown behavioral ‘rail factor’ that may bias travel forecasts toward rail, or favor investments in urban rail, foster economic development, or add to satisfaction of travel. An examination of the rail factor hypothesis is timely because of the many high-speed rail (HSR) ‘bullet train’ projects implemented and planned, especially in Europe. Many railway passenger services have negative net benefits and require taxpayer subsidies, and the HSR projects have experienced substantial cost overruns. In this paper the hidden and unspoken rail factor hypothesis is examined from cognitive and unconscious points of view. The former is based on the mode specific constants in mode choice models, types of travel time data, values of travel time reductions, and citizen preferences in two urban transport corridors. The unconscious view is based on Freud's conception of the unconscious, on ‘knowledge illusion’ and perceptions about rail travel. It is pointed out that the cognitive factors already broach the unconscious and its dynamics. The cognitive views and realism of the unconscious are brought together via a literature review of the most typical genres on rail factor research. The findings indicate that a behavioral ‘rail factor’ may exist in planning and derives from the pleasure principle, while the revealed preferences in models, based on the reality principle, and the built projects contraindicate the presence of a ‘rail factor’. The paper calls for perceptive public participation processes, for a greater scope of issues in planning transport projects to help reinforce the reality principle, and for explicit recognition of the unconscious (motives) in transport infrastructure and service decisions.",2590-1982,Not found
The development and reliability of a national survey of police officers regarding the enforceability of cell phone use while driving laws,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100140,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Even though numerous types of cellphone use while driving (CPWD) laws have been passed in the United States, it does not appear that these laws are heavily enforced by police. Two studies conducted among officers from West Virginia and Washington states found that numerous barriers to CPWD enforcement exist. However, no studies have investigated whether barriers to enforcement exist for officers nationally. The purpose of this study was to design a national survey of police regarding the enforcement of CPWD laws and to assess the survey's reliability. The survey was designed based on the existing literature, cognitive tested, and assessed for face validity among experts. Officers were recruited via convenience sampling to assess the survey for test-retest correlation, test-retest agreement, and internal consistency reliability using standardized Cronbach's α and weighted Kappa statistics. Among participants, the test-retest correlations for most sections of the survey showed acceptable correlation (Cronbach α's > 0.7) (N = 6). For test-retest agreement, the median Kappa equaled 0.77 (N = 6). As for internal consistency reliability, responses thought to be associated showed acceptable correlation with Cronbach α ranging from 0.41 to 0.94 (N = 353).

A constructive role for social science in the development of automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100133,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Automated vehicles (AVs) have the potential to cause profound shifts across a wide range of areas of human life, including economic structures, land use, lifestyles and personal well-being. Most current social science on AVs is narrowly framed. Research on public attitudes has focused on whether people are likely to accept and use AVs. We contend that failing to anticipate a wider range of profound social implications may have serious negative consequences, and that social scientists from a range of disciplinary perspectives can provide invaluable insights. Our conclusions are the product of a workshop in London held in 2018 to discuss the place of social science research in relation to the development of AVs. This paper summarises a core selection of our concerns, interests, theoretical and substantive points of reference and aspirations for a constructive role in this field of research and development.",2590-1982,Not found
Associations between self-rated personality traits and automobile fatality rates across small geographic areas,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100175,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"We explore how variation in fatal automobile crashes across small geographic areas is associated with geographic variation in self-rated psychological and behavioral characteristics. Specifically, estimates of ZIP-code-level automobile fatality rates were linked to a separate dataset comprising 2.8 million responses to a widely used self-report personality questionnaire. To control for an area's wealth and population density, associations were estimated at the slightly larger level of US Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). Relationships were estimated using an intraclass adjustment method, where the estimated correlation between individual scores and ZCTA-level fatality rates was divided by the square root of the estimated within-ZCTA intraclass correlation. Further, the ZCTA-level correlation was estimated separately for each US state to examine the consistency of associations. Rates of fatal crash involvement tended to be higher in areas where respondents were more likely to describe themselves as being depressed, moody, and quarrelsome. Some relationships were less intuitive; for instance, rates of fatal crash involvement tended to be higher in areas where respondents described themselves as more helpful and as less easily distracted. However, many small-area-level associations between self-rated personality and fatality rates were found to be in the same direction across more states than expected by chance. This pattern indicates that even many of the less intuitive associations were often highly reliable and general, which has implications for identifying geographic areas with heightened automobile fatality risk.",2590-1982,Not found
Vulnerability assessment of Alberta's provincial highway network,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100171,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Within their emergency planning and management roles, it is critical for transportation authorities to understand the characteristics of the transportation network and the communities it serves. The northeastern section of the province of Alberta, Canada has a very limited roadway network and is remote from major population centers, yet also has a relatively large population concentration due to the oil and gas industry. It is also prone to wildfires, with subsequent community evacuations every year in the summer months. This paper is a case study of the application of several network analysis measures (related to network topology, community accessibility, and transportation facility characteristics) to this wildfire-prone region, to better understand the region's vulnerability in the face of emergency evacuation and facility disruption. Our results show communities in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo are highly vulnerable to facility disruptions while accessibility to major centers during evacuation is relatively low. Our results also determine critical communities with respect to network vulnerability, and locations for interim emergency supplies. Despite the concentrated populations supporting oil and gas extraction, historical indigenous communities, and the growing prevalence of wildfires and evacuations, justification of transportation infrastructure investments is difficult in this remote area. The findings demonstrate the need for provincial and federal emergency management plans that incorporate the use of existing intermodal infrastructures (i.e. aerodromes) as an alternate means of transport connecting impacted communities. The findings also provide guidance for traffic management planning, strategic placement of emergency services, and identifying where infrastructure investments are most critical.",2590-1982,Not found
Multimodal evacuation after subway breakdown: A modeling framework and mode choice behavior,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100177,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Subway is the backbone of the urban transportation system. However, because of its superior and high-capacity performance, it is difficult to evacuate the stranded passengers through other modes when unexpected disruptions happen. Previous studies paid much attention to the evacuation by gapping buses, but little attentions to the potential of the subway network and the transfers with other transport modes. This paper proposed a multimodal emergency evacuation modeling framework in response to subway breakdowns. The multinomial logit model was employed to analyze the evacuees alternative mode choice behavior. A case study of Longyang road subway station was analyzed by the proposed modeling framework, an SP (Stated Preference) survey of alternative evacuation modes was conducted for the calibration of the multinomial logit model. The results showed that a multimodal emergency evacuation based on the subway network could meet the requirements of evacuees, and make full use of all transport modes and improve evacuation efficiency. The research enriches the existing theory of multimodal emergency evacuation of the subway, and the conclusions can be used as a reference for emergency management and decision-making of subway emergencies.",2590-1982,Not found
Vehicle involvements in hydroplaning crashes: Applying interpretable machine learning,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100176,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Although hydroplaning is a major contributor to roadway crashes, it is not typically reported in conventional crash databases. Hence, a framework to classify various crash attributes from police reports and to identify hydroplaning crashes is strongly needed. This study applied natural language processing (NLP) tools to seven years (2010–2016) of crash data from the Louisiana traffic crash database to identify hydroplaning related crashes. This research focused on the development of a framework to apply interpretable machine learning models to unstructured textual content in order to classify the number of vehicle involvements in a crash. This approach evaluated the effectiveness of keywords in determining the classification. This study used three machine learning algorithms. Of these algorithms, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was found to be the most effective classifier. This research provided a platform to understand the application of interpretability in machine learning models. The outcomes of this study prove that underlying trends or precursors can be revealed and analyzed through these models.

Driver compliance and safety effects of three-foot bicycle passing laws,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100173,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The long and tragic history of bicycle/vehicle collisions has led to calls for legislative action to provide greater safety for bicyclists on the roadways. In the United States, “Three-foot bicycle passing laws,” are among the most common. In general, these laws require motor vehicles overtaking or passing bicyclists to do so by providing a minimum of 3 ft of lateral separation. The goal of this paper was to investigate how these laws substantively affect driver behavior. In this paper, a driving simulator was used to quantify the overtaking behavior, in terms of lateral overtaking distance and speed, of drivers in the vicinity of bicyclists. Study participants included drivers both aware and unaware of these laws. The research also examined the behavior of participants under varying traffic conditions. The results showed a tendency of drivers to provide more than the three-foot minimum requirement. This was true for both sets of “aware” and “unaware” drivers. Overall, this research suggests that drivers in the simulated environment tended to behave similarly regardless of prior knowledge of the three-foot law requirements. Materially, the research failed to identify a significant distinction between the two groups of participants under a range of traffic conditions.",2590-1982,Not found
"Road transport energy consumption and vehicular emissions in Lagos, Nigeria: An application of the LEAP model",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100172,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The “Avoid”, “Shift” and “Improve” (A-S-I) approach is an effective method for transforming an unsustainable transport system to a sustainable one. This study intends to examine the possible impact of the A-S-I policy measures in transforming the transportation system in Lagos - the most populous city and the commercial capital of Nigeria. The study employs the Long Range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model to project future energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions to determine the most effective A-S-I option for the city. We construct a business-as-usual scenario for Lagos as well as sustainable road transport alternative policy scenarios. The results show that Lagos' biggest obstacle to achieving its emission reduction target is the presence of very old vehicles on its roads. Our analysis shows that emission reduction in the road transport sector in Lagos is sensitive to vehicle survivability rate (i.e. the fraction of vehicles of a certain age still driven). We conclude that unless the age limit of vehicles in Lagos reduces from 40 years to 22 years, vehicle growth rate from 5% to 2% and mileage by 2% per year from 2020 to 2032, Lagos may not achieve its target of 50% emission reduction by 2032.",2590-1982,Not found
Compensation effect between deaths from Covid-19 and crashes: The Italian case,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100170,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Emergencies such as the Covid-19 pandemic pose several decision-making issues, while clear evidence of successful strategies are still unavailable, different policies may be identified. However, in such emergencies, the preservation of public health, by firstly reducing human loss of life may be prioritized and then restrictive measures are implemented. The trade-off between damage due to the threat and the decrease in damage due to the lockdown is largely unexplored. Here we show that there is a degree of compensation between damage from epidemic deaths and from traffic deaths, especially in the case of immediate restrictive measures imposed by governments. Based on the Italian case, we found that damage from loss of human Capital and health care costs could have been fully compensated if the lockdown had been imposed ten days earlier. Considering only one Italian region (Puglia), where the epidemic was delayed and then restrictions were timely, damage due to loss of human Capital was largely compensated in the real scenario. However, damage due to loss of welfare could not have been fully compensated for, since Covid-19 deaths largely outnumber traffic deaths in the simulated epidemic period and loss of welfare damage is scarcely dependent on the age-at-death. From a broader perspective, societies seem to react to external threats as a whole organism, thus tending to restore the original equilibrium. Governmental decisions could accelerate this process. However, in the case of similar threats, some wounds cannot be compensated for, such as the incalculable damage due to loss of welfare.",2590-1982,Not found
Potential for improving the environmental performance of railway sleepers with an outer shell made of recycled materials,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100160,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"An innovative sleeper with a pre-stressed reinforced concrete inner structure wrapped by an outer shell manufactured with end-of-life tires powder and recycled plastics has been recently designed by the Greenrail company. The external protection is aimed at increasing its lifetime and reducing the maintenance requirements of the railway lines. This study evaluates the environmental performances of this sleeper, under different operational conditions, in comparison with traditional pre-stressed reinforced concrete sleepers, using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The assessment includes 16 environmental, energy, and human health impact categories. It is performed considering the following functional unit: 1 railway sleeper, including the fastenings of the rail to the sleeper and the portion of the track bed underneath it, over one year of operation. The evaluated system includes the sleeper production, its installation, the railway maintenance, the sleeper removal at its end-of-life and the final recovery. Moreover, the ballast is included in the analysis considering its mining and transportation to the railway line, the partial replacement during maintenance operations, the removal during a track renewal, and the end-of-life management. For the worst operational conditions of the Greenrail sleeper, the potential impacts between the two sleeper typologies differ by <10% for most of the examined categories, meaning that no significant environmental differences are observed. In the average conditions, impact reductions for the Greenrail sleepers result bigger than 10% for 7 out of 16 categories. Finally, for the best conditions, benefits are in the range 20% - 30% for 11 impact categories.",2590-1982,Not found

Evaluating and assessing the effect helps practitioners proactively plan and improve traffic operations within its vicinity during the future planned special event. The objective of this paper, therefore, is to adopt a systemic evaluation method and examine the effect of a planned special event on travel time performance measures, over time and space, from the location of the planned special event. Raw travel time data obtained from a private data source was used to assess the spatial and temporal effects of two planned special events on travel time performance measures. Data were captured for each major road link within 3-miles of each planned special event location. Statistical analyses such as the t-test and Cohen's D were conducted to assess the difference in travel time performance measures during the day of the planned special event compared to the normal day. A statistically significant increase in travel times and travel time variations was observed on the day of the planned special event when compared to the normal day. However, the effect of the increase in travel times was observed to be small, whereas, the effect of the increase in the travel time variation was observed to be higher.

Towards more sustainable transport in Metro Manila: A case study of household vehicle ownership and energy consumption,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100163,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Improvement of residential areas with low accessibility to crucial destinations (e.g., hospitals, schools, markets, and recreation centers) is expected to improve traffic flow and reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This study intends to evaluate the multi-criteria accessibility measure of residential areas to key destinations in Metro Manila, using the gravity method and applying it to understand its impact on household vehicle ownership and energy consumption. The main findings suggest that improving residential area access to key services and facilities (i.e., hospitals, schools, markets, and recreation centers) not only enhances the equitable development of society but also discourages household vehicle dependency. Additionally, the highest multi-criteria accessibility is observed for areas with the presence of high rail line density, specifically in the most populated part of Metro Manila because of many educational institutions, medical centers and hospitals, and markets and shopping malls are located around the train stations and along the rail lines. Furthermore, households living in an area with high multi-criteria accessibility are less likely to acquire and use vehicles. A 1% improvement of accessibility reduced the energy consumption by 38.470 MJ/month-vehicle, CO2 emission by 2.851 kg/month-vehicle, and vehicle kilometers traveled by 12.043 km/month-vehicle. Based on the empirical findings, policy implications recommend building more key facilities in residential areas having the lowest accessibility.

We analyzed the spatial, temporal, and environmental factors influencing trips within a 19-month period to shed some light on how the bikeshare system is being used across campus and in its surroundings and to determine the most important factors shaping the demand. Results show that, similar to the city-wide bikeshare systems, demand for campus bikeshare is mostly influenced by weather, time of day, day of the week, month of the year, and accessibility to transit and various other destinations. However, unlike the city-wide bikeshare systems, there is not a concentration of trips within peak hours, as trips are scattered throughout the day. This is probably due to the flexible working schedules of bikeshare users on-campus (i.e., students and faculty), as opposed to the users of city-wide systems. Additionally, results indicate a higher on-campus usage of the system within the proximity of the transit hubs with a median trip duration of 6.8 min which supports the complementary relationship between bikeshare system and conventional transit systems.",2590-1982,Not found
The impact of COVID-19 on transport volume and freight capacity dynamics: An empirical analysis in German food retail logistics,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100165,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Governmental restrictions aspiring to slow down the spread of epidemic and pandemic outbreaks lead to impairments for economic operations, which impact transportation networks comprising the maritime, rail, air, and trucking industries. Witnessing a substantial increase in the number of infections in Germany, the authorities have imposed drastic restrictions on everyday life. Resulting panic buying and increasing home consumption had versatile impacts on transport volume and freight capacity dynamics in German food retail logistics. Due to the lack of prior research on the effects of COVID-19 on transport volume in retail logistics, as well as resulting implications, this article aspires to shed light on the phenomenon of changing volume and capacity dynamics in road haulage. After analyzing the transport volume of n = 15,715 routes in the timeframe of 23.03.2020 to 30.04.2020, a transport volume growth rate expressing the difference of real and expected transport volume was calculated. This ratio was then examined concerning the number of COVID-19 infections per day. The results of this study prove that the increasing freight volume for dry products in retail logistics does not depend on the duration of the COVID-19 epidemy but on the strength quantified through the total number of new infections per day. This causes a conflict of interest between transportation companies and food retail logistics for non-cooled transport capacity.

Our goals were to investigate whether, like consumers, commuters tend to satisfice when deciding to use the modes they typically use for commuting and to understand the psychological and travel characteristics that distinguish commuters with strong from those with weak tendencies to satisfice. A sample of New Zealand commuters (n = 313) completed an online questionnaire measuring their satisficing scores, psychological and travel characteristics. A factor analysis revealed two measures of satisficing such that commuters may satisfice when deciding to use (decision-satisficing) and when using (behaviour-satisficing) their usual modes for their daily commute. Commuters tend to satisfice when deciding to use modes that they use frequently (usual modes) compared to modes that they use infrequently (alternative modes). Commuters with high satisficing tendencies (decision and behaviour) tend to be more positive and more satisfied with their usual-mode commutes compared to commuters with low satisficing tendencies. Cyclists had the strongest decision-satisficing tendencies while solo drivers had the weakest decision-satisficing tendencies. We demonstrated that commuters do satisfice during their daily commutes and there are some differences between high- and low-satisficing commuters.

The public health crisis has necessitated an urgent reconsideration of transport and its contribution to post-COVID economic recovery. In recognition of the importance of individual behaviour and collective responsibility in protecting both personal and public health during the crisis, this think piece proposes a new concept of Responsible Transport to help inform and shape transport policy and practice responses to COVID. The novelty of this proposal lies in the fact that it incorporates not only environmental considerations with respect to sustainability but also encompasses considerations of individual and community health and wellbeing. Moreover, it stresses the role of the individual as a responsible autonomous actor in delivering socially desired transport outcomes.",2590-1982,Not found
Is caring about the environment enough for sustainable mobility? An exploratory case study from South Tyrol (Italy),10.1016/j.trip.2020.100148,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Sustainable mobility has a positive impact on quality of life, in both urban and rural contexts. Policies aimed at promoting greener travel behaviors – at European, as well as at state and regional level – require a deep knowledge of differing mobility cultures across European regions. In order to better understand the relationship between the (stated) propensity towards sustainability, reported mobility patterns and users' lifestyles in rural areas, an exploratory study was conducted in South Tyrol, a rural region in Northern Italy that strives to become a model region for sustainable alpine mobility by 2030. More specifically, an online survey on sustainable mobility was administered to the inhabitants, exploring motivations, preferred incentives and drivers that may lead towards the adoption of sustainable mobility solutions (with a focus on e-mobility). By analyzing how pro-environmental self-identity interacts with consumers' heterogeneity, results show that heterogeneity exists in the individual pro-environmental identity measure. Based also on evidence from the literature that extrinsic rewards might negatively impact intrinsic motivations to engage in a certain behavior, this study warns policy-makers of potential unintended consequences of current policy tools used to incentivize the adoption of sustainable means of transport, such as the provision of monetary incentives for electric vehicles.",2590-1982,Not found
Autonomous driving cargo bikes – Introducing an acceptability-focused approach towards a new mobility offer,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100135,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Autonomous Driving as a possible, almost likely future of mobility offers new scenarios to move. In the present study, we take the first step to transfer the vision of mobility as a service on autonomous driving cargo bikes: users will be able to call a cargo bike, use it for multiple purposes and release it again for others to use. To ensure broad applicability in different mobility scenarios as well as addressing individual mobility needs while offering intuitive operability, we followed an interdisciplinary approach. While the challenge to realize this vision on a technical level was prepared, both logistics and human sciences collaborated in developing data collection instruments and using user-centered development methods. In detail, we used online questionnaires to describe mobility needs on the test field of a university's' campus. Secondly, we used focus groups to discuss points relevant to future users' needs for the autonomous driving cargo bike as well as discussion points with other road users who would encounter the cargo bike in traffic. We integrated results from those different approaches to formulate construction indications and points for future research.",2590-1982,Not found
Estimating bus passenger volume based on a Wi-Fi scanner survey,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100142,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The main objective of this study is to estimate bus passenger volume based on a Wi-Fi scanner transportation survey. The study proposes a new data cleaning procedure to characterize bus passenger volume using a combination of media access control (MAC) address and global positioning system (GPS) data. We used a Wi-Fi scanner to detect the MAC addresses of individual bus passengers. The Wi-Fi scanner, used as a tool to capture passenger device data, can engage in a probe request mode to capture the MAC addresses of mobile devices or other Wi-Fi-enabled modalities without connecting to the internet. The approach proposed in this study can yield the passenger volume outputs for various bus route sections. A comparison of the passenger volume results obtained from Wi-Fi data and ground truth data indicates that the number of passengers determined from the former is less than that from the latter. The correlation between Wi-Fi estimation and ground truth is 0.78, and the trend line in both methods is similar. Therefore, the cleaning procedure proposed in this study can effectively clean raw Wi-Fi data to extract passenger volume data.",2590-1982,Not found
A comparative analysis of service quality among ECOWAS seaports,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100152,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Customers' expectations and perceptions about service quality continue to remain essential for the growth and survival of firms. In the case of seaports, these expectations and perceptions cannot be overemphasized given that, seaports are at the heart of international trade. Considering the role of trade in increasing economic and social welfare outcomes of countries, improving trade facilitation through enhanced service quality at seaports remain very essential. Notwithstanding the above, it is startling to note that very little is known about service quality across Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) seaports. This study therefore provides comparative analyses of service quality at selected ECOWAS seaports using the gap score technique of the service quality (SERVQUAL) model. The study reveals that in general, all the selected seaports studied have poor service quality. This outcome calls for instituting effective measures towards enhancing service quality at ECOWAS seaports.",2590-1982,Not found

Two hundred and fifty questionnaires were administered with a 100% return rate. Factor analysis technique was conducted using Maximum Likelihood, Varimax rotation and Kaiser Normalization. Also, contingency correlation coefficient was carried out at α = 0.05. Results revealed that over speeding (29.89%), bad roads (8.24%), distraction (7.01%), mechanical fault (6.16%) and improper parking (5.8%) contributed a 57.13% of explained total variance. All the pre-selected factors were judged to be significant to unsafe motorization by no less than 80% of respondents. Results also confirmed a correlation between over speeding and all of accident, injury and death, thus confirming the findings by previous studies such as carried out in Australia, United Kingdom and Sweden, that established association between speed and road accident occurrence, rates and severity.

Population size and transport company efficiency – Evidence from Czech Republic,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100145,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The obligation to ensure transport accessibility of a territory in the Czech Republic is mandated by law. Services provided in the area of transport fall under the group of collectively- provided public goods and that is the reason for economic investigation of transport companies. These services cannot be provided efficiently with an eye on the profitability principle. The aim of this paper is to evaluate efficiency of management of 18 transport companies using a selected multi-criteria method. For this purpose, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is chosen in combination with the Coefficient of Variance method (CV) as an objective method for determining the weight of indicators. Analysis by means of CV-TOPSIS technique is carried out in 2006 and 2016 using 5 indicators, such as sales or short-term liabilities. Based on the results, authors can aver that the number of residents, i.e. number of the users of transport services, is not a significant factor that would affect evaluation of transport companies' efficiency in the Czech Republic. At the same time, transport companies in larger cities provided public transport less efficiently. In other words, with the growth of population, the transport company's economic efficiency decreased significantly, irrespective of the size of the territory for which the service of public transport was provided.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploratory analysis of recent trends in school travel mode choices in the U.S.,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100146,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The study explores the recent trends in school travel using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey data. The study also investigates the exogenous factors affecting the school travel mode choice using random parameters multinomial logit (RPMNL) model. The results indicate that urban school trips range between 3 and 5 miles, whereas, average rural trips are longer than 6 miles. School commute times are higher among lower-income households. Further, the share of school bus and auto has declined while that of walking and biking has increased in 2017. This change is significant among high school students. Like other studies, the findings of the RPMNL model confirm that students within shorter distances from school are more likely to walk or bike to school. However, the likelihood of riding a school bus for distances >15 miles is higher than that of auto, indicating a policy implication to support school transportation budgets, especially in rural school districts. Lower-income households have a higher likelihood of riding the school bus. Females are more likely to use a car and less likely to bike to school. Interestingly, households with more than three vehicles are more likely to use the school bus compared to no-vehicle households. Children living in rented houses are less likely to ride the school bus or car. Also, an increase in gas price is indirectly but positively linked with walking, biking, and auto use. The findings from this study will assist policymakers in formulating policies and planning decisions towards improvements in the current school travel trends.",2590-1982,Not found

This paper presents first insights in current and potential future effects of the virus and the Dutch government's ‘intelligent lockdown’ on people's activities and travel behaviour. Findings are based on a representative sample of about 2500 respondents from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN). We show that approximately 80% of people reduced their activities outdoors, with a stronger decrease for older people. 44% of workers started or increased the amount of hours working from home and 30% have more remote meetings. Most of these workers report positive experiences. Students and school pupils, however, are mostly not happy with following education from home. Furthermore, the amount of trips and distance travelled dropped by 55% and 68% respectively when compared to the fall of 2019. So-called ‘roundtrips’ (e.g. a walking or cycling tour) gained in popularity. People are currently more positive towards the car and far more negative towards public transport. Changes in outdoor activities seem to be temporal, with over 90% of people who currently reduced their outdoor activities not expecting to continue this behaviour in the future after corona. However, 27% of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future. In addition, 20% of people expect to cycle and walk more and 20% expect to fly less in the future. These findings show that the coronavirus crisis might result in structural behavioural changes, although future longitudinal analyses are needed to observe these possible structural effects.",2590-1982,Not found

Exploring network properties of social media interactions and activities during Hurricane Sandy,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100143,6,2020-07-01,2020,7,"In this study, we analyze Twitter data to understand information spreading activities of social media users during Hurricane Sandy. We create multiple subgraphs of Twitter users based on activity levels and analyze such network properties. We observe that user information sharing activity follows a power-law distribution suggesting the existence of few highly active nodes in disseminating information compared to many other nodes. We also observe close enough connected components and isolates at all levels of activity, and networks become less transitive, but more assortative for larger subgraphs. We also analyze the association between user activities and characteristics that may influence user behavior to spread information during a crisis. Users who are centrally placed in the network, less eccentric and have higher degrees, they are more active in spreading information. Our analyses provide insights on how to exploit user characteristics and network properties to spread targeted information in major disasters.",2590-1982,Not found
Forgotten or never consciously processed?

To investigate how quickly people forget information from an everyday drive we asked participants (n = 38) to take a 20-min simulated drive on familiar local roads and after a delay, answer questions about what happened and what they saw at four locations. We questioned drivers either immediately (<1 s), 20 s or 45 s after driving through each location, or at the end of the drive. Recall accuracy remained high when drivers were questioned immediately and at delays of 20 s and 45 s, but was significantly poorer when drivers were questioned at the end of the drive. Recall accuracy for stopping at a location did not decrease regardless of delay. The results add to our knowledge about the role of attention and memory for highly practised and largely automatic skills, such as everyday driving.",2590-1982,Not found
GPS-data in bicycle planning: “Which cyclist leaves what kind of traces?” Results of a representative user study in Germany,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100192,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"In the recent decade, numerous scientific studies investigated the utility of GPS data to bridge the existing data gap in cycling. Almost all studies faced the lack of representativeness of data because the participation in data collection was influenced by self-selection of participants. Thus, the GPS data were biased by dominant user groups. However, the difference between biased samples and representative data has not been quantified, yet, as there was no data from representative selected samples that could be used for comparison. The present work investigates whether and how cycling behaviour of different groups differs. It furthermore examines the parameters cycling behaviour depends on. For this purpose, nearly 200 cyclists were selected according to representativeness regarding age, gender and type of cyclist. The study participants recorded their ways using a GPS smartphone app during a two-week field study. Data analysis revealed little influence of the user group on cycling behaviour, only. In contrast, the variables age, gender and trip purpose show a strong influence on cycling speed, distance, acceleration and frequency. The study results point out the need for representative data collection in GPS-based studies on cycling.",2590-1982,Not found

Long-established routines such as commuting to workplace and in-store shopping are being replaced by telecommuting and online shopping. Many of these shifts were already underway for a long time, but the pandemic has accelerated them remarkably. This research is an effort to investigate how and to what extent people's mobility-styles and habitual travel behaviors have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore whether these changes will persist afterward or will bounce back to the pre-pandemic situation. To do so, a stated preference-revealed preference (SP-RP) survey is designed and implemented in the Chicago metropolitan area. The survey incorporates a comprehensive set of questions associated with individuals' travel behaviors, habits, and perceptions before and during the pandemic, as well as their expectations about the future. Analysis of the collected data reveals significant changes in various aspects of people's travel behavior. We also provide several insights for policymakers to be able to proactively plan for more equitable, sustainable, and resilient cities.",2590-1982,Not found

All nations and communities have applied many countermeasures to control the spread of the epidemic. In terms of countermeasures, lockdowns and reductions of social activities are meant to flatten the curve of infection. Nevertheless, to date, there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods. Thus, the present study aims to interpret the change in the population density of Sapporo city in the emergency's period declaration using big data obtained from mobile spatial statistics. The results indicate that, in the time of refraining from traveling, the city's residents have been more likely to stay home and less likely to travel to the center area. This has led to a decrease of up to 90% of the population density in crowded areas. The study's outcomes partly explain the statement of reducing 70%–80% of contact between people in line with the purpose of the emergency declaration. Moreover, these findings establish the primary step for further analysis of estimating the efficiency of policy in controlling the epidemic.",2590-1982,Not found

The empirical evidence is anchored on the negative binomial regression estimator, due to the count nature of the dataset on the daily cases of the virus. The study established the key following findings: First, retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, and workplaces are statistically significant and negatively signed as relevant predictors of the virus. Second, the impact of residential is positive and statistically significant at the conventional level. Lastly, the results are robust to an alternative estimator of Poisson Regression.

The concept of ‘eyes on the street,’ crime prevention, and motorcycle taxi services in Bangkok were investigated to conceptualize the theoretical framework. In cases of Chatuchak District, motorcycle taxi stands called ‘Win’ and crime incidents recorded in 2016 were mapped. Data show that crime incidents within 100-m. radius from Win were less than areas without Win. The theoretical model describing the eyes on the street from the motorcycle taxis is the natural surveillance that can deter crime. There is three dimensions of eyes on the street: 1) Within a 100 m. radius from the Win; 2) Within an isovist field (24 m. radius from Win); and 3) Dynamic eyes on the street along the service route of motorcycle taxis.

"Do students, workers, and unemployed passengers respond differently to the intention to evade fares? An empirical research",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100215,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"In proof-of-payment transit systems, fare evasion has recently captured increasing attention because of the relevant implications it produces. Research has investigated how sociodemographic, travel behaviour, and situational determinants affect the intention to evade fares for segments of passengers clustered according to ‘Gender’ and ‘Age’. Conversely, no study has isolated these determinants in segments clustered according to ‘Employment’. This paper fills this gap by analyzing students, workers, and unemployed passengers. Key determinants are isolated by logistic regression models. The findings show that gender, age, and having been fined are the common determinants that make all these segments more likely to evade fares. In addition, some specific determinants are identified for each segment. Hence, the overall findings may support transit operators by anticipating preventive and corrective strategies tailored to specific segments, which can positively impact other segments.",2590-1982,Not found
Rail versus bus local public transport services: A social cost comparison methodology,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100200,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"In the last years, several Italian legislative interventions concerning the local public transport (LPT) sector aimed at inducing Local Authorities to re-programming the current services by changing the existing transport modes in favor of less expensive ones, while preserving passengers mobility. Indeed, for some local railway routes the existing level demand and its characteristics (e.g. distribution along the day) would justify a switch from rail to bus mode, when the latter are proved to be less expensive in providing comparable services. We propose a methodology to compare the social economic costs associated with the bus and the rail modes in Italy that can represent a simple and effective tool to support the Italian local policy makers in re-programming the LPT services while using more efficiently the (scarce) financial public funds. The comparison is carried out by considering a given level of exogenous demand (e.g. externally fixed), not influenced by the activated transport mode. Differences in the offered level of services are taken into account through estimation of the users cost in terms of in-vehicle trip time. The social economic costs include service production costs, infrastructure usage costs and externalities impacts (e.g. air pollution, congestion, noise). The investment costs for rail and road infrastructures construction are assumed to be sunk, while the generated infrastructure usage costs (increasing maintenance and operations) are included in the analysis. Finally, the proposed methodology is finally applied to an Italian real case.",2590-1982,Not found
"Influence of demand and capacity in transportation simulations of short-notice, distant-tsunami evacuations",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100211,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Distant tsunamis require short-notice evacuations in coastal communities to minimize threats to life safety. Given the available time to evacuate and potential distances out of hazard zones, coastal transportation planners and emergency managers can expect large proportions of populations to evacuate using vehicles. A community-wide, short-notice, distant-tsunami evacuation is challenging because it creates a sudden, significant, and concentrated demand on road-network systems. Transportation planners and emergency managers need methods to help them determine if a road network can handle an evacuation surge and if not, where interventions can best reduce overall clearance times. We use the coastal community of Bay Farm Island (City of Alameda, California, USA) and the distant-tsunami threat posed by Aleutian-Alaskan earthquakes as a case study to explore the use of agent-based, transportation simulation to support short-notice, tsunami-evacuation planning. Results demonstrate how vehicle simulation can characterize network performance during a tsunami evacuation in the absence of real-world measurements of vehicle demand and flow. Changes in vehicle demand had the greatest influence on reductions in clearance times and recommended reductions varied based on time of day. Doubling the capacity of certain road segments based on traditional vehicle-capacity ratios and level-of-service thresholds reduced overall clearance time in some cases but increased it in other cases. The proposed simulation approach can serve as an analytical foundation for future efforts to characterize distant-tsunami evacuations in other coastal communities throughout the world.",2590-1982,Not found

At this age, children's self-control ability is not mature and still developing, and thus they need more parental companionship and education. However, as China's social and economic development accelerates, many parents living in townlets have chosen to work in big cities. Currently, the effects of the absence of parental education on children's pedestrian safety, or what mechanisms lie behind these effects, are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationship between parental absence and the pedestrian behaviors of primary school children and proposed a mediating model to examine the mediating effect of self-control ability. In this study, a questionnaire survey was conducted with 197 elementary school students in grades four to six in a town in Shandong Province, China. A student self-control scale and pedestrian behaviors scale were used in the research. The results were as follows: First, children with absent fathers had low planning ability. Second, as children's planning ability increased, they showed more positive traffic behaviors. Third, planning played a mediating role in the relationship between father absence and the pedestrian behaviors of primary school children; that is, father absence indirectly affected children's positive pedestrian behaviors through planning.",2590-1982,Not found

In this paper, we build a traffic simulation pipeline to explore the above problems, covering many aspects of evacuation, including map creation, demand generation, vehicle behavior, bottleneck identification, traffic management policy improvement, and results analysis. We apply the pipeline to two cases studies in California. The first is Paradise, which was destroyed by a large wildfire in 2018 and experienced catastrophic traffic jams during the evacuation.

What is a parked bicycle? Vehicle fleet characteristics in Australia,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100204,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Bicycle parking facilities are an important part of the transport system and their design can make bicycle transport more convenient. At a detailed level, the design of bicycle parking devices depends on how they relate to the bicycle's properties. This research seeks to provide a more detailed understanding of the characteristics and fleet of bicycles to inform better policy and practice. Set in Australia, an urbanised country aiming to increase a presently low bicycle mode share, the results are potentially useful to other low bicycle mode share cultures. Visual analysis reveals that although the relevant Australian standard describes a spatial envelope for bicycles, the envelope introduces a treatment of bicycle geometry at odds with vehicle characteristics; namely the contradiction that the spatial envelope in the standard significantly over states the volume of a bicycle, while at the same time the handlebars of the bicycle are inadequately accommodated. A random sample of 180 parked bicycles in Australian urban environments provides a detailed geometry database and shows that the Australian bicycle fleet is heterogeneous around clusters of geometry reflecting industry standards, but does not match with the spatial envelope provided in the standard. Photographic observations of these bicycles provide an insight into bicycle characteristics and parking behaviours, in particular revealing that 55% of the sample bicycles were not equipped with kick stands and thus depend on parking infrastructure for stability. Evidence from the field suggests that some bicycle users are willing to park bicycles more closely than suggested in the standard.",2590-1982,Not found
The challenge of the bicycle street: Applying collaborative governance processes while protecting user centered innovations,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100209,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The innovation of the bicycle street allows missing links in cycling networks to be developed in places where financial or spatial constraints present challenges to implementing separated cycling facilities. Two separate cases in the Netherlands demonstrate that when the intent is to use the innovation to resolve spatial constraints, the goal of reaching consensus between different stakeholders involved with a collaborative governance process can lead to a result in which the user practices necessary to make the innovation a success are not sufficiently protected. These cases show how collaborative governance processes in transportation planning can lead to innovations being implemented in ways that fail to support the group that they are intended to benefit. This argument is supported by drawing on two different bodies of literature: 1) collaborative governance literature that describes the movement to increase the legitimacy of government supported projects through substantial stakeholder involvement; and 2) strategic niche management literature that describes the role that established user practices play in the upscaling potential of innovations. These literatures are connected through the evaluation technique of Strategic Policy Niche Management (SPNM), which has been used to apply strategic niche management principles to innovations in transportation policy. The article uses the concept of SPNM to illustrate the need for understanding the connection between citizens in collaborative governance and users in innovation development. This relationship is illustrated by examining the history of a transportation innovation, the bicycle street, with a particular focus on how its development in Germany and Belgium as a means to provide bicycle infrastructure at low cost differs from its introduction in the Netherlands, where it has been used as a compromise solution between different user groups. The history of the bicycle street and its uses in different contexts is followed by a detailed case study on the contested implementation of a bicycle street in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. This specific case reveals what can happen when an innovative project is undertaken with a focus on consensus among potentially impacted stakeholders and does not give increased weight to the needs of the users of the innovation. The innovation may develop sufficient support to be implemented but may not be sufficiently attuned to user practices to meet the needs of its intended user group, creating an obstacle to future upscaling. The article concludes with a discussion of how adopting specific regulations for bicycle streets could resolve this issue, preventing bicycle streets from being implemented in places where other options would better serve cyclists.",2590-1982,Not found

The proposed metrics indicate that each airline has reacted differently to the COVID-19 travel restriction measures from a passenger perspective, therefore they can be used by airlines and passengers to improve their decision making process. This report comes ahead of official data related to the same sequence of events, thereby showing the value of passenger-borne data in an industry where corporate priorities, institutional prudence, and passenger satisfaction come close together.",2590-1982,Not found
A field study of sensors for winter road assessment,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100206,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Winter road assessment is a research field with considerable progress over the last 10 years. Various sensors and methods have been tested and analysed, often in a laboratory setting, in order to come up with robust and valid assessment tools that can be used to warn the driver, road users in general, and maintenance personnel of critical conditions. In this paper we compare the field measurements of an RCM411 and a MARWIS sensor with each other and with previously performed laboratory experiments, we reflect on OBD-II as a tool in winter road assessment, and perform initial field tests with an experimental radar sensor. The results of the RCM411/MARWIS comparison shows significant correlation between our field experiments and the laboratory experiments, OBD-II appears to be fitting as a supplementary tool in the assessments, and the experimental radar tests uncovers a need for more investigation.",2590-1982,Not found
"Spatial inequalities and media representation of cycling safety in Bogotá, Colombia",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100208,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"While there has been sustained growth in cycling as an urban mean of transport over the last two decades, it has often been accompanied by an increase in traffic crashes and deaths involving cyclists (Broe et al., 2017; Loreta et al., 2016). Many of the recommendations proposed to reduce such negative consequences rely primarily on individual behavioural changes or segregating infrastructure; however, the positive impacts of such actions are not yet proven (Dozza, 2017; Shinar et al., 2018). While these actions are certainly necessary, it has been proposed that more collective and long-standing changes in policy, education and law can be even more beneficial for cycling safety (Jacobsen, 2003; Marqués and Hernández-Herrador, 2017). Research considering social, spatial and economic disparities and their relation to urban cycling is very scarce within cycling studies and has the potential to benefit cycling safety by expanding its underlying understanding (Brown, 2016). Additionally, qualitative approaches such as the analysis of media representations of cycling safety events have only recently started attracting attention from researchers (Macmillan et al., 2016). Furthermore, there is a clear disproportion between research about cycling safety undertaken in Europe, Oceania and North America when compared to the rest of the world – in particular, Latin America. While debates around transport and inequalities are prevalent in Latin American cities, limited attention has been paid to cycling. In this study, through the analysis of secondary data and media coverage of traffic crashes involving cyclists in Bogotá, Colombia, it is proposed that cycling safety research can benefit from including analysis of social, economic and spatial inequalities as well as media representation. Preliminary results show that spatial inequality in cycling safety is expressed in at least three ways: disparities in cycling infrastructure allocation by city planners; concentration of traffic crashes resulting in cyclists' deaths in low income areas; and disproportion in media coverage of cyclists' deaths in traffic according to their locations.",2590-1982,Not found
Tram drivers' perceived safety and driving stress evaluation. A stated preference experiment,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100205,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The tram is a sustainable mode of transport. However, tram tracks are often shared with vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. In this mixed environment, accidents between trams and VRUs are very rare but severe at the same time. Previous studies have acknowledged that tram driving is a complex and very demanding task. Yet, subjective notions of traffic safety that are more connected with the behavior of tram drivers, have never been quantified. This is important in order to better interpret the challenges that tram drivers face. To do so, a stated preference experiment was designed in which tram drivers in Athens rated their perceived safety and driving stress of different driving scenarios on a 7-point Likert Scale. The driving scenarios were presented to the tram drivers using static images. According to the estimated perceived safety model, the alignment type (such as exclusive, semi-exclusive), the existence and the type of pedestrian crossing and the volume of VRUs influence tram drivers' perceived safety. Driving stress was affected mainly by arrival delay and load of standing passengers. Route familiarity also appeared as an important factor, that influences driving stress. No statistically significant correlation between perceived safety and driving stress was observed. One explanation for this is that experienced tram drivers believe that they are ready to respond properly in a section that they perceive as unsafe, if they are familiar with it. If there is no familiarity, tram drivers lack confidence and therefore driving stress is increased.",2590-1982,Not found
Trusting autonomous vehicles: An interdisciplinary approach,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100201,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The theoretical concept of trust has been identified as highly important to the successful design of intelligent technologies such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). In human-centred transport research this has resulted in a focus on trust in the technical design of future AVs and has raised the question of how the conditions that form trust change as technologies become more intelligent. In this article we discuss the first stage of an interdisciplinary project that brought together ethnographic and experimental user studies into trust in intelligent cars. This stage focused on the development of an interdisciplinary methodological framework for the user studies, through a review of 258 empirical HCI research articles on trust in automation and AVs. The review investigated the following research questions: a) what are the key themes in HCI methodologies used to research trust in automation and AVs; b) how do they account for trust in AVs as part of wider contexts; and c) how can these methodologies be developed to include more than momentary and individual human-machine interactions. We found that while theoretical understandings of trust in automated technologies acknowledge the relevance of the wider context in which the interaction occurs, existing methodologies predominantly involve experimental studies in simulated environments with a focus on reliance related aspects of trust. We identified that ethnographic user studies can potentially contribute to new connections between theoretical understandings and conventional experimental methods. Therefore, we propose a framework for an interdisciplinary approach that combines experimental and ethnographic methodologies to investigate trust in AVs.",2590-1982,Not found
Activity-based travel as a social signal of the City Satisfaction Index. Study case in a medium-sized city of Argentina,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100207,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The travel based on activities carried out daily by citizens is a social signal that helps interpret the City Satisfaction Index. In the present study, we characterized these daily trips by the mode of transport, motive, duration, area of origin, area of destination, etc, and explored their relationship with four dimensions of citizen satisfaction: Job Opportunities, Urban planning and diversity, Nature and recreation and Reproductive success. This relationship was studied by the partial least squares path modelling and the four dimensions establish a conceptual framework of factors that are relevant for the satisfaction of citizens with their place of residence. The results obtained suggest a double-entry channel: mandatory activities influence the City Satisfaction Index, whereas discretionary, emotional, and self-expressive activities are key indicators of the performance of the index. The data used were based on a survey of the daily commutes of citizens of Tandil, a medium-sized city of Argentina, collected between 2012 and 2016.",2590-1982,Not found
Impact of physical distancing due to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on daily travel for work during transition to lockdown,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100203,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in change in both commute and personal travel patterns. Though, in India, lockdown was implemented from 25th March 2020, due to self-awareness and pandemic risk perception, change in commuter behavior was observed from the beginning of March 2020. The period from 15th to 24th March 2020 is considered as the transition phase of COVID-19 outbreak in India (i.e., between no lockdown and lockdown period). This study attempts to use a decision tree approach to investigate the modal preference of 1542 commuters in association with socio-economic and travel characteristics, and safety perceptions with respect to public and private modes during transition to lockdown due to COVID-19 in India. About 41% of commuters stopped traveling during the transition to lockdown phase, 51.3% were using the same mode of transport and 5.3% of commuters shifted from public to private mode. The study findings reported different interactions of factors influencing the decision to use public or private modes of transport for daily commuting during pandemic situations like COVID-19. Interestingly, safety perceptions (associated with personal health) of commuters did not play a significant role in their mode choice behavior during the transition phase. Though people perceived public transportation as unsafe over personal vehicle use, the actual commute patterns did not validate this due to a possible reason that commuters do not have enough alternative modes. Given the uncertainties in the decision making of the commuters regarding their travel behavior due to physical distancing, the insights from this study are important to policymakers and local transport authorities to understand the change in travel patterns.",2590-1982,Not found
VIEWPOINT: Accelerating reform to govern streets in support of human-scaled accessibility,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100199,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"A longstanding mantra is that city governments lack capacities for agile, nimble change; such lack of capacity is starkly realized in how streets are governed. Exhaustive layers of codes, regulations and guidelines support a single objective: moving automobiles. The networks of streets themselves, together with the legislative and institutional networks that guide their character, are in dire need of being modernized. This viewpoint recounts a current perspective of city street governance, formulated by antiquated legislation and procedures; it points to an automobile-dominated regime that restricts innovation. We propose and describe three principles to support innovation and accelerate transformation in how streets are managed: (1) a focus on accessibility, (2) the power of local government, and (3) reflexive learning that draws on strategic experiments with city streets.",2590-1982,Not found
Comparison of competing market mechanisms with reinforcement learning in a carpooling scenario,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100190,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"In this paper a multi-agent simulation was implemented to analyze the dynamics of different market mechanisms with a Reinforcement Learning algorithm in the context of a carpooling market. The agents in the simulation, car owners (COs) and non car owners (NCOs), had to sell or buy a car seat for multiple rounds by picking one of two possible mechanisms: Dutch Auction or Fixed Price. In the beginning of the simulation the agents have no information about the efficiency of these mechanisms and they are chosen with the same probability. In the course of the simulation a Reinforcement Learning algorithm alters the agents' preferences for the two mechanisms depending on their cumulative payoffs. The key finding is that sellers have a clear preference for the Dutch auction mechanism with differing degrees dependent on the seller/buyer ratio. Buyers on the other hand have no significant preference for any mechanism. If these results are replicable, they suggest that an increased utilization of the Dutch auction could lead to an expansion of the carpooling market, increasing its impact as an alternative means of transportation.",2590-1982,Not found
Air emission impacts of low-level automated vehicle technologies in U.S. metropolitan areas,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100194,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Reduction of the transportation sector's air emissions has been an essential goal for decreasing the emissions' externalities and slowing climate change. This study evaluated the emission impacts of low-level automated vehicles (LAVs) in 86 metropolitan areas in the United States, based on county-specific emission costs of morbidity, mortality, and environmental damages. Twelve LAV technologies were investigated to estimate their impacts on CO2, CO, NOx, PM2.5, SOx, NH3, and VOC. The study analyzed the LAV technologies' direct and indirect emission impacts, including accident-related and non-accident-related congestion reductions, aerodynamic force reduction, the operational load of equipment, and traffic rebound. The results show that the LAV technologies could reduce the annual social costs of emissions by between 9 and 20 billion USD2019 in these metropolitan areas. This is equal to approximately 20% of the vehicles' emissions. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the technologies' market penetration rates (MPRs), demonstrating that the rate strongly influences the emission savings. This study revealed that LAVs' savings per vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) vary between areas, with the technologies performing differently in different areas due to both geographical factors (e.g., population) and technological factors (e.g., internal combustion engine performance). The study provides extensive resources for policymakers to develop targeted incentives and maximize the social benefits of the LAV technologies.",2590-1982,Not found
Digitalisation and automation of transport: A lifeworld perspective of travellers,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100195,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Increasing participation as well as improved traffic and transport conditions, especially safer transport are the promises commonly connected with a digitalisation and automation of transport. What is needed is the well-connected traveller who by means of a smartphone and applications can choose on digital maps and pictograms where or to whom to go, who by means of these media can have access to public transport without any knowledge of complex tariff structures, who can book autonomous vehicles in order to arrive without any incident at the destination. Within the conceptual framework of the lifeworld, especially Blumenberg's notion of the ‘Technisierung’ of the lifeworld, the paper sets out to describe the ongoing process of different forms of digitalisation becoming relevant for all parts of the chains of trips of travellers and subsequently an unquestioned part of the lifeworld of travellers. This process is driven on the one hand by the many resulting opportunities for the travellers. On the other hand, several interest groups are pushing the digitalisation of transport information, booking, and pricing as well as the automation of vehicles: transport companies, car manufacturers, insurance companies, and public institutions. The consequences of the subsequently further increasing motorised transport, the shift of the responsibilities away from drivers, and the large amount of collected data result in the need of an increasing institutional framework of travellers.",2590-1982,Not found
An overview of air delay: A case study of the Brazilian scenario,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100189,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Delay is a key point in air transportation activity. As a performance metric, it affects common policy concerns. Delay impacts passenger satisfaction and imposes costs. The complexity that sets in for the air traffic manager is how to mitigate delay, especially in an environment with several stakeholders. The present article applied a problem-structuring method (PSM), named value-focused thinking (VFT), to structure the problem of the air traffic flow management arrival delay. The inflexibility of incorporating a flight operator's specific needs is considered one of the reasons for the limited success of air traffic flow management (ATFM) programs. PSM allows participants to clarify their dilemmas, converge on a mutually liable problem, or agree to the proposed solutions and compromise on what partially solves the issue. The problem is that most papers focus only on the applied solution for air delay mitigation. Before implementing operational research techniques, we investigated the nature and characteristics of air delay. Results showed that there were several stakeholders with distinctive requirements for their business and many of their objectives are interconnected. The use of VFT provided an objective map that can be used as a guide for future solutions.",2590-1982,Not found
Understanding social processes of shopping destination choice - An approach to model stability and variability,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100183,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Transport systems are affected by fundamental technical and social dynamics. For planners and researchers, travel demand models are an important tool to gain insights into possible effects of these dynamics and to find appropriate ways of dealing with them. However, most state-of-the-art travel demand models underestimate social aspects of travel choices, which we consider essential for understanding stability and variability of travel behavior. Based on a qualitative interview study, the paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to consider social aspects for modeling shopping destination choice. Starting point for our considerations is that people are social beings, moving around to build and maintain relationships, and that these relationships only unfold in relation to overall sociotechnical structures. The interview study provides evidence for relationships between stores and customers. Relationships can be distinguished in two dimensions. First, in terms of the nature of a relationship: having a relationship either with the owner of a specific store or towards specific brands. Second, in terms of the meaning: if the relationships is perceived meaningfull or obligatory. Findings are represented in a first modeling approach. The results show that the more seldom relationships to owners of a store can be modeled easily, while the more typical relationships to brands require further research.",2590-1982,Not found
COVID-19 indoor exposure levels: An analysis of foot traffic scenarios within an academic building,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100185,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Minimizing all aspects of COVID-19 exposure is a high priority as universities prepare to reopen. One of those aspects includes developing protocols for interior spaces such as academic buildings. This paper applies mathematical modeling to investigate different virus exposure levels due to traffic patterns within academic buildings. The assumption used are: 1) Risk of infection is a product of exposure rate and time and 2) the exposure rate decreases with distance. One-way vs. two-way pedestrian traffic scenarios within hallways were modeled and analyzed for various configurations. The underlying assumption that a small exposure to a large number of people is similar to a large exposure to a few people is the driver to minimize exposures levels in all aspects. The analysis indicates that minimizing the time spent in passing between classes is the driving factor in minimizing risk, and one-way traffic may increase the time required to pass between classes. While the case presented is limited, the modeled approaches are intended to provoke future research that can be extended and applied to larger populations to help provide decision makers with more rigorous tools to shape future policies regarding traffic flow within buildings.",2590-1982,Not found

Implication of repatriating migrant workers on COVID-19 spread and transportation requirements,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100187,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Nationwide lockdown for COVID-19 created an urgent demand for public transportation among migrant workers stranded at different parts of India to return to their native places. Arranging transportation could spike the number of COVID-19 infected cases. Hence, this paper investigates the potential surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infection and assesses the train and bus fleet size required for the repatriating migrant workers. The expected to repatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011 census data and comparing it with the information reported in the news media. A modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 patients in India's selected states with high outflux of migrants. The developed model considered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of migrant workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the origin of the trip dependent symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily arrival rate of migrant workers for states with very high outflux of migrants (i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in confirmed and active cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days needed to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence, travel arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, about 50,000 per day to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 20,000 per day to Maharashtra and less than 20,000 per day to other states of India was recommended.",2590-1982,Not found
Modeling social network influence on hurricane evacuation decision consistency and sharing capacity,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100180,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Evacuations in major disasters such as hurricanes involve complex decision-making and depend on several interrelated factors. Mass evacuation created traffic gridlocks with hours of added travel time in previous hurricane evacuations. To leverage this, shared mobility as an alternative evacuation strategy can ensure compliance to evacuation orders. Besides, previous evacuation studies examined evacuation decision-making for a given hurricane, however the empirical literature is inconclusive of what governs evacuation decision consistency of previous (evacuated or not) and future (will evacuate or not) hurricanes. As such, the purpose of this study is to explore the influence of personal social networks and day-to-day sharing activity on hurricane evacuation decision consistency and shared evacuation capacity (number of people with whom one will evacuate). By adopting a Personal Network Research Design (PNRD) framework and conducting an online survey of south Florida residents, the evacuation decision consistency of people is modeled using multinomial logistic regression method. An ego-centric social network analysis is also conducted which focuses on the survey respondents (egos) and the people in their close contacts (alters). Shared evacuation capacity is modeled using zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) approach. Tobit regression techniques are used to estimate the influence of day-to-day joint activities on shared evacuation decisions. Results showed that these variables are influenced by similarity in race, religion, marital status, bike ownership, use of social media and day-to-day shared activity. The age and income of people also significantly affect these decisions. The results will help in developing decision support frameworks for evacuation management applications and encourage emergency planners to promote shared evacuations in vulnerable communities.",2590-1982,Not found

Given that public transport has been identified as a high-risk environment for transmission, it was of interest to ascertain user and operator compliance to guidelines for public transport operations during the period, as a measure of its risk level. A roadside observer survey, of over 850 of the most popular paratransit (trotro) buses was carried out on one of the major roads in Kumasi. Compliance to the policy on physical distancing was determined using guidelines from the Ministry of Transport, while compliance to the policy on face masks was determined by the researchers themselves based on the number of commuters with/without face masks per bus. The results suggest that majority (98.0%) of buses comply with the social distancing guidelines established by the Ministry of transport, however the policy on face masks was complied with only partially in most vehicles. About 12.6% of the vehicles had fewer than three commuters without face masks, while 21.3% of buses that had fewer than 3 people with face masks. The results suggest public transport remains an area of high risk in the fight against COVID-19.

Nevertheless, no scientific evidence has been reported so far with regards to the impact on road safety and driving behavior. This paper investigates the effect of COVID-19 on driving behavior and safety indicators captured through a specially developed smartphone application and transmitted to a back-end platform. These indicators are reflected with the spread of COVID-19 and the respective governmental countermeasures in two countries, namely Greece and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which had the most completed routes for users of the smartphone applications. It was shown that reduced traffic volumes due to lockdown, led to a slight increase in speeds by 6–11%, but more importantly to more frequent harsh acceleration and harsh braking events (up to 12% increase) as well mobile phone use (up to 42% increase) during March and April 2020, which were the months where COVID-19 spread was at its peak. On the bright side, accidents in Greece were reduced by 41% during the first month of COVID-19-induced measures and driving in the early morning hours (00:00–05:00) which are considered dangerous dropped by up to 81%.

There is also a lack of a universal understanding of the various dimensions of a communication interface, which has impeded a consistent and coherent addressal of the different aspects of the functionalities of such interface concepts. In this paper, we present a unified taxonomy that allows a systematic comparison of the eHMI across 18 dimensions, covering their physical characteristics and communication aspects from the perspective of human factors and human-machine interaction. We analyzed and coded 70 eHMI concepts according to this taxonomy to portray the state of the art and highlight the relative maturity of different contributions.

Using qualitative analytical methods, this paper analyzed the characteristics of road rage incidents resulting from the illegal use of high beams based on 20 typical cases collected in China. The results showed that when drivers were flashed by the high beams of an oncoming vehicle, they sometimes became angry and chased or insulted the other driver, flashed their own high beams in retaliation or drove into the opposite lane and blocked the oncoming car. When drivers were flashed by the high beams of a following car, they sometimes blocked the car or used other means to disrupt its travel. In addition, it was found that more than half of road rage incidents resulted from the illegal use of high beams on country roads or highways. Moreover, most of the incidents were caused by the high beams of an oncoming car. Most of the people involved in such incidents were young men. Finally, strategies to avoid serious injuries in such incidents were discussed.",2590-1982,Not found
Travel behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: Analyzing the effects of risk perception and social influence on going-out self-restriction,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100181,7,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This article analyzes factors affecting travel behavior changes at the individual level in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, in the context of non-binding self-restriction requests. In particular, this study focuses on the effects of risk perception and social influence. A panel web-survey was conducted targeting residents of the Kanto Region, including the Tokyo Metropolis. In addition to describing the observed patterns in behavioral change, we modeled behavioral changes of four key, non-work-related activities: (i) grocery shopping, (ii) other types of shopping, (iii) eating out, and (iv) leisure. For eating-out and leisure the distinction was made between going alone or in groups. Based on the observed distributions of these activities, regression models of going-out frequency were estimated for shopping, while for eating-out and leisure, which showed considerably smaller frequencies, a discrete choice approach was used. Findings showed that as a measure of social influence, the perception of degree of self-restriction of others was associated with small reductions in shopping frequencies, and moderate yet non-negligible increases in going-out self-restriction probability for eating-out and leisure activities. Risk perception, measured as COVID-19 dread, was also associated with higher probabilities of going-out self-restriction for eating-out and leisure. These findings suggest that in the context of non-binding requests, soft measures such as campaigns to promote a reduction of non-essential travel might be more effective if they (i) properly convey the severity of the threat posed by COVID-19 as well as its coping mechanisms, and (ii) appeal to the group, rather than the individual, emphasizing the behavior (or at least the perception of behavior) of others.",2590-1982,Not found
When connectivity makes safer routes to school: Conclusions from aggregate data on child transportation in Shanghai,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100267,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Following a rapid urban development and mass motorisation, Chinese city planning has started to refocus its attention towards active transportation. It is therefore an opportune time to address the under-investigated issue of young children’s transportation. Indeed, in the Shanghai city centre, more than a third of the pre-school students are walking to school while almost half of them are transported on two-wheeled vehicles, highlighting the necessity for appropriate urban design solutions. In a previous study Chevalier and al. initiated this work and examined the barriers to cycling on the way to kindergartens. Based on their conclusions, minor adjustments to existing infrastructure could help to meet the population’s expectations in terms of safety and comfort. Using a survey questionnaire on safety perception and drawings of the detailed route to school, together with its corresponding points of danger, over 400 responses were collected at kindergartens in inner Shanghai. Data analysis underscores the increase in perceived danger at crossroads, hinting us to the need for a refined study of the trajectories at major intersections. As a proof of concept we isolate a crossroad, thoroughly evaluate its surroundings, and suggest simple design solutions, which could result in drastic improvements for soft mobility. In particular we show that improving connectivity could foster solutions significantly lessening the perceived danger. We believe this approach represents a valuable asset to the development of active transportation, as it can be applied at little cost, allowing city planners to improve the existing infrastructure and vulnerable road users to feel safer.",2590-1982,Not found
Image-based activity pattern segmentation using longitudinal data of the German Mobility Panel,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100264,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"In this paper, we present an approach to segment people based on a visualization of the longitudinal week activity data from the German Mobility Panel. In order to perform segmentations, different clustering methods are commonly used. Most of the approaches require comprehensive prior knowledge about the input data, e.g., condensing information to cluster-forming variables. As this may influence the method itself, we used images with a high degree of freedom. These images show week activity schedules of people, including all trips and activities with their purposes, modes as well as their duration or their temporal position within the week. Thus, we answer the question whether using only this type of image data as input will produce reasonable clustering results as well. For the clustering, we extracted the images from an existing tool, processed them for the method and finally used them again to select the final cluster solution based on the visual impression of cluster assignments. Our results are meaningful as we identified seven activity patterns (clusters) using this visual validation. The approach is confirmed by the data-based analysis of the cluster solution showing also interpretable key figures for all patterns. Thus, we show an approach taking into account many aspects of travel behavior as an input to clustering, while ensuring the interpretability of solutions. Usually, key figures from the data are used for validation, but this practice may obscure some aspects of the longitudinal data, which are visible when looking on the images as validation.",2590-1982,Not found
Succeeding without success: Demonstrating a residential bicycle sharing system in Sweden,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100271,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Various services based on sharing have recently emerged in cities across the globe. They entail promises of a more sustainable mode of transportation. Through an in-depth case study, this paper follows the undertakings within a recent demonstration project aimed at implementing a residential bike-sharing service. The involved actors succeeded in presenting a functional service but failed to make the service commercially viable. Consequently, the configuration did not spread beyond the niche level. Based on this finding, the paper identifies a risk in enforcing progressive solutions to becoming commercialised, and urges public actors to play a greater role in steering the transition towards a more sustainable future transport system. By shedding light on the process of failing, the paper contributes important lessons concerning the setup of future bike-sharing systems that can challenge the automobility regime.",2590-1982,Not found
Modelling the effects of COVID-19 on travel mode choice behaviour in India,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100273,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented changes in the activity patterns and travel behaviour around the world. Some of these behavioural changes are in response to restrictive measures imposed by the Government (e.g. full or partial lock-downs), while others are driven by perceptions of own safety and/or commitment to slow down the spread (e.g. during the preceding and following period of a lock-down). Travel behaviour amidst the stricter of these measures is quite straightforward to predict as people have very limited choices, but it is more challenging to predict the behavioural changes in the absence of restrictive measures. The limited research so far has demonstrated that different socio-demographic groups of different countries have changed travel behaviour in response to COVID-19 in different ways. However, no studies to date have either (a) investigated the changes in travel behaviour in the context of the Global South, or (b) modelled the relationship between changes in transport mode usage and traveller characteristics in order to quantify the associated heterogeneity. In this paper, we address these two gaps by developing mathematical models to quantify the effect of the socio-demographic characteristics of the travellers on the mode-specific trip frequencies before (January 2020) and during the early stages of COVID-19 spread in India (March 2020). Primary data collected from 498 respondents participating in online surveys have been used to estimate multiple discrete choice extreme value (MDCEV) models in this regard. Results indicate – a) significant inertia to continue using the pre-COVID modes, and b) high propensity to shift to virtual (e.g. work from home, online shopping, etc.) and private modes (e.g. car, motorcycle) from shared ones (e.g. bus and ride-share options). The extent of inertia varies with the trip purpose (commute and discretionary) and trip lengths. The results also demonstrate significant heterogeneity based on age, income, and working status of the respondents. The findings will be directly useful for planners and policy-makers in India as well as some other countries of the Global South in better predicting the mode-specific demand levels and subsequently, making better investment and operational decisions during similar disruptions.",2590-1982,Not found
"Motoboys in São Paulo, Brazil: Precarious work, conflicts and fatal traffic accidents by motorcycle",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100261,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The professional activity of “motoboys” (motorcycle couriers), which is based on fast motorcycle delivery, is a relatively recent phenomenon in the urban landscape of the city of São Paulo. Due to their rapid growth, coupled with the dynamics of their professional activity in São Paulo traffic, “motoboys” have become targets for the most diverse traffic conflicts and prejudice in the city of São Paulo. The purpose of this article is to understand the emergence and the dynamics of this professional activity as a consequence and a necessity of the city of São Paulo. This professional activity partially reveals the socio-spatial transformations that took place in São Paulo in the transition from the 20th to the 21st century, which are marked by the new condition of the city, based on the need for rapid circulation in a congested urban space, as well as on the world of work, which resulted in increased unemployment and precarious employment relationships for “motoboys.” These combined factors increase the risk of fatal traffic accidents involving “motoboys” in the city of São Paulo.",2590-1982,Not found
City logistics: Towards a blockchain decision framework for collaborative parcel deliveries in micro-hubs,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100274,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The growth in e-commerce has led to increased pressure within the courier, express and parcel (CEP) sector to tackle the ‘last-mile’ issue and come up with solutions that not only satisfy the customers, but also other stakeholders such as city councils and other regulatory bodies. Scholars have highlighted micro-hubs and the associated horizontal collaboration as a possible solution, which might help alleviate problems associated with last-mile logistics in inner-city centers. However, trust and data exchange issues are considerable barriers to the introduction of horizontal collaboration, in particular between CEP carriers. To address the lack of trust and the issue of data exchange between carriers, the use of blockchain technology may present a solution, but existing research so far is limited concerning frameworks that specifically discuss blockchain technology in the context of micro-hubs and last-mile deliveries. In response, this paper presents a blockchain decision framework for a horizontal collaboration between CEP carriers based on key characteristics of existing blockchain decision models and relevant related research in the area of logistics and last-mile distribution. This is the first study that specifically addresses the use of blockchain technology for horizontal collaboration in the context of micro-hubs and last-mile deliveries.",2590-1982,Not found
Re-claiming the responsivity gap: The co-creation of cycling policies in Berlin's mobility law,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100270,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Calls for more bicycle use have been heard from across the political spectrum in Germany for years. Nonetheless, policies that lead to a transition away from car use and toward the bicycle in urban mobility remain absent. Against this background, we explore a mode of citizen engagement in the policy process in which citizens take the initiative and claim a political space to include their user expertise in the policy process. The case is a recent development in the field of urban mobility in Berlin, Germany in which citizen activists directly integrated citizen knowledge into policy outcomes. This was enabled by claiming the political space and thereby determining the spectrum of possibility, ultimately leading to an unprecedented process of co-creative legislation that marked a unique shift in German mobility policy, with the result that Berlin became the first German state to pass a bicycle law in June of 2018. We argue that the political space these citizens claimed was a key factor for enabling policy change, as previous attempts in invited political spaces had not led to a departure from the status quo. In a first empirical step, we establish evidence of citizen knowledge in policy output by comparing the citizen-authored bill with the 2018 Mobility Law. In the second empirical step based on 13 semi-structured interviews with the citizens responsible for the law, we offer a closer look at the type of knowledge relevant for enabling direct integration of user knowledge into policy output. We end with a discussion on the broader importance of the interplay of citizen knowledge for their impact on transformative policymaking.",2590-1982,Not found
Investigating the factors affecting the distance travel and health conditions of e-bike users in Toronto,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100265,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper investigates the factors influencing the physical health condition and the trip distance of e-bike users’ in Toronto, Canada. The research is based on a survey of e-bike and bicycle users' health condition and travel behaviour in Toronto. A Bivariate Ordered Probit model is used to draw links between different factors that affect the health conditions and trip distance of the users. It is important to note that modelling results at best indicate an association (not causation) between the dependent and independent variables. The health condition model reveals that e-bikers from low-income households have higher health risk than the e-bikers from the high-income household. In terms of the trip distance, the model results indicate that the individuals who typically make longer distance trips using e-bikes are more likely to be in an excellent health condition than the individuals who make shorter distance trips using e-bikes. In terms of policy recommendations, a Monte Carlo analysis based on the estimated model reveals that strategies targeted at different demographics (e.g., income, age) are more likely to be effective. The implications of these empirical findings provide essential elements of guidance to the policymakers, and these findings are transferable to the other North American cities.",2590-1982,Not found

An urban-based integrated automated public transportation system (APTS) that serves both people and freight is examined which leverages on emerging technologies such as information communication technology and automated vehicle. An illustrative example of an APTS, namely Dynamic Autonomous Road Transit (DART), is introduced, and the technical challenges are summarised.

Mode choice and spatial distribution in long-distance passenger transport – Does mobile network data deliver similar results to other transportation models?,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100254,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Sound knowledge of travel behavior is important for many findings and decisions in science, business and transport policy. This is not only about spatial distribution, but also and above all about the choice of transport mode. Anonymized mobile network data (MND) can provide valuable information here. This relatively new method is fundamentally superior to other approaches in many respects, but a comprehensive scientific evaluation is still pending. In this context, the present study should help to close research gaps by comparing the results of an MND analysis with the output of an existing transportation model based on System Dynamics. The comparison includes the number of trips within one year, the choice of means of transport and the spatial distribution in long-distance passenger transport within Germany (for all trips with a distance of 50 km or more). We found that the results for travel frequency and modal split were very similar at high aggregation (total annual values for the study area). Also, for distance categories (with an interval of 100 km each) the deviations were very small. However, there were significant differences for origin-destination pairs. In order to be able to make a well-founded comparison here, more in-depth research is necessary in the future.",2590-1982,Not found
Risky behaviors of older taxi drivers and suggested requirements for renewing their professional driver's licenses,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100272,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper investigates how specific risk factors affect the severity of injuries in crashes involving male taxi drivers 60 years of age and older in Taiwan. The heteroscedastic logit model is used to identify these significant risk factors and variations that affect the severity of crashes. The marginal effects show that older taxi drivers with risky behaviors of driving while fatigued and driving while drunk significantly increase the probability of crashes with injuries by 16.7% and 7.9%, respectively. Driving at night from 8:00 pm to midnight and from midnight to 6:00 am also significantly increase the probability of crashes with injuries by 4.0% and 2.6%, respectively. Furthermore, significant variations are found in notwearing a seat belt in older taxi drivers involved in crashes causing injuries. To reduce the likelihood of such crashes, in addition to the mandatory physical examinations, a sleep apnea test, an alcohol assessment, and a cognitive impairment assessment are recommended for renewing a driver’s license for taxis drivers age 60 older.",2590-1982,Not found
Evaluation of dynamic passive pedestrian detection,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100268,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Dynamic passive pedestrian detection (DPPD) has the potential to enhance the operational efficiency and safety of signalized intersections by cancelling unnecessary pedestrian service calls or extending the pedestrian phase to allow a pedestrian to safely finish crossing the street. This paper examines the accuracy and reliability of two thermal sensors and one optical sensor for DPPD at one mid-block crossing location and one signalized intersection in Washington County, Oregon. Results indicate the average accuracy rate for the thermal sensors was 89% at the signalized intersection and 82% at the mid-block location. The most common inaccurate detection types for the thermal sensors were Late, Held, and Miss calls. Average accuracy rate for the optical sensor was 26% at the signalized intersection and 83% at the mid-block location. The most common error types for the optical sensors were Spotty, Late, and Miss calls. False detections most often occurred for both sensors when vehicles and bicycles in the roadway crossed into the detection zones. Weather and lighting conditions affected thermal sensor accuracy, while only pedestrian type affected optical sensor accuracy.

UK and China: Will electric vehicle integration meet Paris agreement targets?,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100245,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"It is widely accepted that the true environmental benefit of electric vehicles (EVs) is dependent upon non-tailpipe emissions from fuel/energy production. Through a comparison of EV and conventionally fuelled vehicle (CFVs) tailpipe emissions in China and the UK, considering their different EV integration plans, were projected between 2017 and 2050. For this analysis, three scenarios were modelled for private vehicles using ‘two degree’ scenario data for electricity generation: (1) 100% CFVs; (2) 100% EVs; and (3A) 50:50 mix of CFVs and EVs integrated in 2030; and (3B) 50:50 mix integrated in 2040. Results indicated that between 2017 and 2050 for (1) emissions decreased by 56% in China and 91% in the UK, accounting for technological improvements, with emissions per vehicle decreasing by 89% and 24% respectively. Under (2) emissions decreased by 55% in China and by 92% in the UK and decreased by 88% in China and 88% in the UK per vehicle. Under (3) emissions increased by 10% in China and decreased by 43% in the UK, with emissions per vehicle decreasing by 70% and 95% respectively. Results demonstrate EV deployment is related to economic status of the country, so decarbonisation of the energy sector should be targeted. By transitioning towards EVs in 2030 or 2040 as opposed to 2050, both countries are more likely to meet emission goals. Therefore, policymakers should focus on introducing policy which combines carbon taxes, non-fossil fuels and energy efficiency with any financial profits reinvested to subsidise construction of renewable energy infrastructure.",2590-1982,Not found

People with disabilities experience numerous barriers to using transportation to access essential goods, like fresh food, and services, like medical care, that are necessary for maintaining health. The pandemic and the pandemic response threaten to exacerbate persistent health disparities and add to transportation barriers that disadvantage people with disabilities. To better understand difficulties that individuals with disabilities are facing using transportation and meeting their needs during the pandemic, I conducted in-depth interviews with 21 San Francisco Bay Area residents with disabilities between March 20 and April 6, 2020, immediately following adoption of the first shelter-in-place orders in the region. Analyzing these interviews, I find that the pandemic is aggravating many difficulties accessing transportation and other essentials that people with disabilities regularly encounter. These include challenges accessing reliable and safe transportation as well as up-to-date communications about transportation and public health, and difficulties getting needed assistance using transportation and completing activities of daily living ranging from personal care to getting groceries.

The ideas of bounded rationality have been used to model this behavior, and relax the main assumption of travel time minimization of the User Equilibrium principle. In this paper, we propose an extension of an existing dynamic traffic assignment framework, for aggregated traffic models based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram and regional networks, that extends the principle of the User Equilibrium to account for bounded rational drivers. We focus on drivers with indifferent preferences, and with preferences for more reliable travel times. The network equilibrium is calculated through Monte Carlo simulations and the classical Method of Successive Averages. We first investigate how the drivers' preferences for reliable travel times influences the traffic dynamics in the regional network. We then discuss a potential application example of the proposed methodological framework for estimating the emissions of Carbon Dioxide CO 2 and Monoxide NO x at the network level. The results shed light on the importance of properly accounting for more realistic drivers' behavior for estimating emissions. The main contributions of this study lie on the edge between the disciplines of traffic flow theory and network modeling, with a great potential of application for practitioners to assess traffic emissions on large metropolitan areas.",2590-1982,Not found

First, a regression model was developed that estimated transit ridership in small urban areas as a function of service quantity, service characteristics, the unemployment rate, demographic characteristics, and population density. A three-stage least squares estimation model was used to account for the simultaneity between ridership and service quantity. A second model, using American Community Survey data at the Census block group level, estimated the relationships between density and use of transit for commuting, as well as the impacts of living or working in the metro area’s principal city on commuting behavior. Lastly, data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey were used to model relationships between dwelling type and age with household transportation expenditures. Density was shown to be positively associated with transit ridership. The estimated elasticity is 0.09. The use of transit for commuting was found to increase with block group density, total metro population, if the area is within the principal city, and if a large percentage of workers commute to the principal city. Household transportation expenditures were found to be greater for those living in single-family detached structures and lowest for those living in high rises. Among households living in single-family detached structures, those in older homes were found to spend less on transportation. Older homes tend to be in neighborhoods that are more accessible by walking, biking, and transit.",2590-1982,Not found

From the urban fabrics perspective, the basic sustainability challenge for cities is the automobile fabric and its impact on walking and transit fabrics. We introduce a GIS-based method to identify and delineate areas of walking, transit and automobile urban fabrics in four Finnish city regions. Existing delineation that identifies public transport supply is used as a starting point and a reference. The emphasis is on delineating the boundary between areas of transit fabric and areas of automobile fabric. The methodology relies on an overlay analysis and thresholds for three variables that represent basic determinants of the transit fabric in intermediate city regions. These include: the combined density of the population and jobs, the proximity of bus stops with a sufficient level of transit services, and the availability of grocery shops within walking distance. The results are tested using data on modal share and car ownership. The results show that with the inclusion of two new variables (density and grocery shops) the delineation is more accurate for identifying those areas that accommodate a higher share of carless households and sustainable transport modes compared to those with only public transport supply. The results show the similarities of each fabric area type in different cities and great differences between fabric areas inside each city region, which indicates that the application is useful. It also reveals the need for more detailed analysis.",2590-1982,Not found

Consequences for design,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100251,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"To maximize road safety, driver trust in an automated vehicle should be aligned with the vehicle’s technical reliability, avoiding under- and over-estimation of its capabilities. This is known as trust calibration. In the study reported here, we asked how far participant assessments of vehicle capabilities aligned with those of the engineers. This was done by asking the engineers to rate the reliability of the vehicle in a specific set of scenarios. We then carried out a driving simulator study using the same scenarios, and measured participant trust. The results suggest that user trust and engineer perceptions of vehicle reliability are often misaligned, with users sometimes under-trusting and sometimes over-trusting vehicle capabilities. On these bases, we formulated recommendations to mitigate under- and over-trust. Specific recommendations to improve trust calibration include the adoption of a more defensive driving style for first-time users, the visual representation of the objects detected by the automated driving system in its surroundings in the Human Machine Interface, and real-time feedback on the performance of the technology.",2590-1982,Not found
Impacts of assimilating observations from connected vehicles into a numerical weather prediction model,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100253,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Numerical weather prediction (NWP), a method of weather forecasting using equations that describe atmospheric flows and behavior, is used extensively to help predict weather conditions along roadways and has important implications for maintaining safety and efficiency on the transportation network. An insufficiently dense surface observation network presents a major limitation in obtaining the current state of the atmosphere for NWP at high spatial and temporal resolutions, such as required by road weather applications. Connected vehicle technologies, where public, private, and commercial vehicles serve as weather-observing platforms, can be used to fill in these gaps in the surface weather observation network. A pilot study was formed to quantify the impact of a dense network of observations along roadways, such as would exist with fully implemented connected vehicle technologies, on NWP. First, a simulated vehicle probe dataset was created. This dataset was assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for select case studies, and the resulting output compared against observations and a baseline WRF run without the vehicle data assimilation. It was found that these observations had an overall positive impact on precipitation and other surface variable outputs, though in several cases the impact was slight. Major improvements occurred when using wiper status as a proxy for precipitation to apply forward error correction to a point model forecast of probability of precipitation and quantitative precipitation forecasts.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring the impacts of COVID-19 on travel behavior and mode preferences,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100255,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Various measures were recommended or imposed by the governments to control the spread of COVID-19. Travel behaviors are significantly influenced due to such measures. However, people have various travel needs ranging from grocery shopping to work. This study examines the changes that occurred in travel behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected through an online questionnaire survey that included questions on trip purpose, mode choice, distance traveled, and frequency of trips before and during COVID-19. 1203 responses were collected from various countries around the world. Results explained that trip purpose, mode choice, distance traveled, and frequency of trips for the primary travel were significantly different before and during the pandemic. Further, the majority of trips were made for shopping during the pandemic. There was a significant shift from public transport to private transport and non-motorized modes. People placed a higher priority on the pandemic related concerns while choosing a mode during the pandemic as compared to the general concerns. Gender, car ownership, employment status, travel distance, the primary purpose of traveling, and pandemic-related underlying factors during COVID-19 were found to be significant predictors of mode choice during the pandemic. Outcomes of this study could be useful in transport planning and policymaking during pandemics based on the travel needs of people. In particular, government authorities could utilize such knowledge for planning smart and partial lockdowns. Service providers, e.g., taxi companies and retailers, could use such information to better plan their services and operations.",2590-1982,Not found
Dissimilarities between the national cost/benefit models of road projects: Comparing appraisals in Nordic countries,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100235,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The Nordic Council has a vision to create the most integrated region globally by 2030. Nevertheless, Nordic cross-border infrastructure projects are generally developed by each nation individually. Joint Nordic infrastructure planning is thus fragmented. An example of this, as reported herein, is how road projects are assessed by the infrastructure planning authorities in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, the latter to which is included in the comparison for the first time. In each country, cost/benefit analyses (CBAs) are used. In each nation, the monetary values of changes in travel time, accidents, and environmental externalities are estimated. We then apply those values to the three national CBA models to assess an illustrative hypothetical road project. Theoretically, the models should provide similar outcomes when using a common set of parameters. Instead, we show that the choice of national model is crucial to the outcome. The Swedish model, for example, generates a higher cost of travel time than the other models irrespective of the nation from which we choose the parameters. Consequently, CBA-based assessments in the Nordic area depend strongly on the model applied and peculiarities in its coding. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our findings for appraising national and Nordic projects.",2590-1982,Not found

Back-propagation neural network model to predict visibility at a road link-level,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100250,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Fog and rain influence the ability of the drivers to see other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and fixed objects, and, hence, increase the likelihood of getting involved in a crash on a road. Resource constraints limit installing weather monitoring sensors at regular intervals (for example, every 1, 2, 3, or 4 km) on a road. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model to predict fog / low visibility condition, and, apply at a road link-level. Five years of meteorological data were collected from 238 weather monitoring stations in and around North Carolina to develop and validate the BPNN visibility model. The predicted visibility using meteorological data was compared with visibility from the weather monitoring sensor installed at five geographically distributed locations in North Carolina. The BPNN visibility model has better visibility prediction capability during a normal foggy condition when compared to visibility during thick/dense fog condition.",2590-1982,Not found

Evaluate the impact of COVID-19 prevention policies on supply chain aspects under uncertainty,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100240,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Supply chain operations are disrupted due to natural disasters or epidemics. In the recent period, the supply chain suffers from obstacles and major challenges that affect its stages directly due to the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic around the world. The impact of this epidemic on supply chain performance is clear in terms of supply, demand, or logistics. This epidemic is characterized by a rapid spread, so countries have taken preventive policies in an attempt to limit its spread. These policies are direct impacts on the performance of the supply chain in all scopes. The extent of its impact varies from one supply chain to another, according to the activities that the supply chain provides. In order to provide a more accurate study of the impact of the measures taken to limit the spread of the epidemic, this research presents a proposed framework that evaluates the impact of these policies on the three main aspects of the supply chain (supply, demand, and logistics). The proposed framework is build using BWM and TOPSIS based on plithogenic set. Plithogenic set provides a more accurate evaluation result that addresses the uncertainty problem.

Stepping over the threshold linking understanding and usage of Automated Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),10.1016/j.trip.2020.100252,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Automated Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), which aim to enhance safety and comfort while driving, are becoming increasingly popular in vehicles today. However, ADAS are not yet operative in every situation due to technical limitations, and therefore do not cover all driving situations, traffic, weather and/or road conditions. In order for drivers to use these systems in a safe manner, they need to understand the different modes of operation, as well as the limitations of the systems, or they will not be able to build appropriate trust and adequate usage strategies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the factors influencing user understanding of ADAS by implementing an Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods design. This was done by triangulating data from a Naturalistic Driving (ND) study (132 vehicles) with explanations and reflections from in-depth interviews of purposefully selected participants (12 drivers from the vehicle pool) who were showing different usage patterns. The results show that users’ understanding is influenced by preconceptions about the system, as well as the perceived system performance and usefulness, leading to different levels of trust that affect the users’ engagement with the ADAS. It was found that the driver’s perception of a system does not just change over time, but changes through different situations presented, challenging the expected events and the users’ mental model of the interaction with the system. Therefore, to gain trust and appropriate usage strategies for the ADAS the user needs to overcome potentially negative experiences and challenge the current understanding of the ADAS, by stepping over the threshold.",2590-1982,Not found

Justification for considering zero-inflated models in crash frequency analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100249,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"One common challenge of modeling intersection related crash data is the high proportion of sites with zero crashes. Extensive research has been done on appropriate methods to handle excess zeroes. There is some reluctance to use zero-inflated models in the traffic safety literature. The primary purpose of this paper is to evaluate zero-inflated models to determine if they are a suitable method for modeling crash counts. An appropriate approach to model selection is to choose the model that best accomplishes research objectives rather than attempting to discover the true underlying data generating process. Thus using zero-inflated models is warranted when they outperform other models relative to research objectives. In addition, using zero-inflated models does not assume sites are in an inherently safe or unsafe state, and should not be summarily dismissed on the basis of disagreement with the hypothesized underlying data generating process. Secondarily, we compare implementations of zero-inflated Poisson, zero-inflated negative binomial, and negative binomial-Lindley Bayesian hierarchical models using intersection related crash data for the state of Utah from 2014 to 2018. We specifically compare the quality of fit as determined by a Bayesian χ 2 test for goodness-of-fit and their relative predictive accuracy. The zero-inflated negative binomial performs best overall. We conclude that there are cases where zero-inflated models perform as well or better than other comparable models and may be considered as a viable option to model crash counts.",2590-1982,Not found
Development of freight travel demand model with characteristics of vehicle tour activities,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100241,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The actual movements of freight vehicles demonstrate comprehensive tour activities instead of a single trip. Freight vehicle tours activity represent trip chaining relationship between shippers, receivers, and carriers as a journey of tours. In India, identifying and modeling tour activity is complex because disaggregated freight tour activity data are generally not available to access. Hence, there is a need to identify the most suitable and sufficient modeling framework, which explains the non-linear behavior and complexity of tour-based freight travel demand. Thus, the objectives of this study are to identify the driver, vehicle, and journey characteristics of freight vehicle movement and their tour activities using the conventional non-linear and soft computing methods to estimate the number of tours and to identify the most suitable and effective modeling method. The questionnaire form designed, and study locations were selected in Tiruchirappalli, India. The selected survey locations were identified based on the availability of fright drivers who were making tours. An extensive face to face data collection process was performed, and a total of 600 drivers' data were collected from survey. A detailed description of the collected data was obtained through descriptive analysis. Next, significant relationship between characteristics of freight vehicle drivers and their tour activities was identified based on various correlation tests. Further, a non-linear regression method was adopted for explaining non-linear behavior and complexity of tour-based freight travel demand. Followed by soft computing models using Support-vector machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) algorithms were developed to predict tour-based freight travel demand, which performed better than conventional non-linear model. Among all, ANN model outperformed and explained the variations with better accuracy. Finally, the outcome of this study will be helpful to transport planners and researchers for understanding the characteristics of freight vehicle tour activity and estimating tour-based freight travel demand.",2590-1982,Not found

Distributed to adults (18–25 years old) in Connecticut, the survey gathered retrospective data on their travel behaviors as teenagers, as well as associated attitudes and beliefs about different transportation modes. Seventy-one percent of participants indicated that a family car was their predominant source of transportation. Public transportation was the main source for 14% of participants. Fewer than 10% of participants indicated that a personal car, walking, or other means was their primary source of transportation. Participants who lived in less densely populated areas as teenagers were more likely to report barriers to public transportation access. These same participants were also more likely to report neighborhood walkability issues, including the absence of continuous sidewalks and bike paths. These factors are likely associated with teenagers' reliance on family cars for transportation.

Core and comprehensive ports: The new challenge for the development of the Spanish port system,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100243,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The characteristics of the Spanish port network, with its heterogeneity, cause the need for different specialized facilities which directly impacts the need for significant investments by the Port Authorities. These Port Authorities are the institutions in which it is articulated the Spanish port system nowadays. However, the European Union has developed the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) project that classifies European ports as core or comprehensive. After this regulation, some countries have reformulated their port systems in relation to the powers of the institutions that make up this structure. Thus, Spain has to carry out this modification, but there are many factors that must be taken into account for this. The objective of this paper is to analyze the importance of the Spanish port system considering the heterogeneity of ports, the high grade of competences that have the different regions and analyses the concentration of cargo and its specialization. The methodology used are the Herfindahl Hirschman Index and the cargo specialization index. The results arise that ports with a high specialization, but lower volume cargo, would lose visibility, and could harm the specialization of the territory.",2590-1982,Not found

"Impacts of COVID-19 on public transport ridership in Sweden: Analysis of ticket validations, sales and passenger counts",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100242,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The paper analyses the impacts of COVID-19 on daily public transport ridership in the three most populated regions of Sweden (Stockholm, Västra Götaland and Skåne) during spring 2020. The analysis breaks down the overall ridership with respect to ticket types, youths and seniors, and transport modes based on ticket validations, sales and passenger counts data. By utilizing disaggregate ticket validation data with consistent card ids we further investigate to what extent fewer people travelled, or each person travelled less, during the pandemic. The decrease in public transport ridership (40%–60% across regions) was severe compared with other transport modes. Ridership was not restricted by service levels as supply generally remained unchanged throughout the period. The ridership reduction stems primarily from a lower number of active public transport travellers. Travellers switched from monthly period tickets to single tickets and travel funds, while the use and the sales of short period tickets, used predominantly by tourists, dropped to almost zero. One-year period tickets and school tickets increased from mid-April, which could indicate that the travellers using these tickets are particularly captive to the public transport system. Collaborative effort is required to put the results in the international context.",2590-1982,Not found
Are women greener than men? A preference analysis of women and men from major German cities over sustainable urban mobility,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100236,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Travel patterns in daily life differ greatly between women and men, and differences in socialisation substantially impact travel mode choice. The literature has demonstrated a higher affinity towards local public transportation and sustainability for women. Men, by contrast, show a higher affinity towards cars, technology, and innovation. However, sex and gender factors have not been considered when examining innovative, sustainable urban mobility so far. A gender-sensitive perspective, therefore, is necessary to increase the possibility of using sustainable modes of transportation, including carsharing with battery-powered electric vehicles and, therefore, improve the quality of life in larger cities. This article closes this research gap with an analysis of a representative sample of 2400 respondents from four major cities in Germany based on Robin Law's theoretical framework of gendered daily mobility from 1999. In addition to socio-demographic, economic, and mobility-related factors, attitudes towards transport modes and the preferences for e-carsharing services are analysed to provide deeper insights into gender differences of urban dwellers. Grouped by age and gender, the presence of a child in the household is associated with different changes in preferences for specific modes of transport for women and men. Although the results indicate that urban women are more concerned about environmentally-friendly mobility in general and use cars less often than men, more women than men prefer going by car if there is a child under the age of 14 years in the household. There is unequal access to resources in mobility, which is in line with financial aspects being the main reason against car ownership for urban women. Parenthood has a positive effect on the acceptance of carsharing with battery-powered electric vehicles for women and men. In conclusion, gender differences result from different daily tasks, but there are also significant differences beyond this aspect that show a socially constructed gendered meaning of sustainable urban mobility. This research improves the understanding of sustainable urban mobility regarding gender differences, that is, the increase of car use of women with children, and the rejection of women of new mobility services. Only when gender differences are considered in planning processes, it will be possible to improve the quality of living in urban areas by reducing urban space scarcity, local and global emissions, and noise exposure.",2590-1982,Not found

Socio-economic and household factors, spatial characteristics, perception of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virtual activities behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic were explored to understand the magnitude of respondents' intention to undertake out-of-home activities during new normal conditions. Based on a questionnaire survey, the study, with 834 respondents, was conducted in the middle to the end of May 2020. By applying the ordered logit model, the model results revealed that younger people tend to participate more in maintenance activities of shopping and outside eating and leisure activities of recreation and social. Meanwhile, the factor of gender, income, and education level had no significant impact on participation intention of mandatory, maintenance, and leisure activities. Excluding non-grocery shopping, there was also no significant difference in activity participation intention between people living in the Greater Jakarta as epicentrum of COVID-19 in Indonesia and people living outside the Greater Jakarta. Furthermore, people living in a household with a high number of motorcycle and car ownership had a greater propensity to pursue outside eating activity. The activity behaviour change from physical to virtual activity participation during new normal conditions could not be replaced by the experience of virtual activities, including e-working, e-learning, non-grocery e-shopping, food delivery, and movie streaming during the pandemic.

A decentralized optimization approach employing cooperative cycle-regulation in an intersection-centric manner: A complex urban simulative case study,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100232,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The upcoming high population density rise in metropolitan areas is anticipated to further deteriorate the traffic conditions. To tackle this problem, advanced ICT applications have been employed, able to monitor and manage traffic in real time. In practice, to efficiently correspond to dynamic traffic conditions those applications require to be frequently reconfigured – an operation that usually involves expert-teams manually adjusting the traffic-regulating strategies regularly. However, these manual procedures are not adequately aligned with the traffic situation since complicated stochastic dynamics, model unavailability and data inner-transmission constraints usually emerge. In order to overcome such cumbersome and expensive adjustment procedures modern decentralized adaptive optimization is widely accepted and recognized as an efficient automated solution for tuning the control strategy on-the-fly. Motivated by the above, L4GCAO, a decentralized, model independent, flexible optimization technique has been designed for optimizing cycle management at a local level to improve network performance at the global level, by automatically adjusting the cycle-regulating parameters in an intersection-centric manner, through cooperating self-learning agents. This paper studies L4GCAO's first application on a realistic traffic-network simulation scheme that examines the online fine-tuning process of the cycle-regulating parameters. Moreover, in order to evaluate the decentralized L4GCAO performance, two levels of performance benchmarking have been considered: a comparison with CAO - its well-established centralized counterpart; an already well-designed fixed-time management plan. In all cases, L4GCAO exhibits an almost equivalent performance improvement compared to CAO, both with respect to a properly fixed-time traffic management plan, while utilizes less parameters in a non-centralized manner.",2590-1982,Not found

Then a multi-vehicle multi-trip routing problem for contactless joint distribution service is proposed, and a mathematical programming model for this problem is established. The goal of the model is to increase residents' satisfaction with food distribution services. To solve this model, a PEABCTS algorithm is developed, which is the enhanced artificial bee colony algorithm embedded with a tabu search operator, using a progressive method to form a solution of multi-vehicle distribution routings. Finally, a variety of numerical simulations were carried out for statistical research. Compared with the two distribution services of supportive supply and on-demand supply, the proposed contactless joint distribution service can not only improve residents' satisfaction with the distribution service but also reduce the contact frequency between couriers.

A data-driven approach to calibrate microsimulation models based on the degree of saturation at signalized intersections,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100231,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Microscopic traffic simulation is considered as a reliable tool in transportation planning and management. Rational solutions from such simulations are contingent upon how well the simulation software is calibrated and validated to replicate real-world road network scenarios. Most of the existing calibration and validation efforts are normally based on the comparative analysis between the built-in attributes of VISSIM and the real-world scenarios using measures of effectiveness (MOEs). VISSIM attributes such as the volume-to-capacity ratios, vehicle delay, and queue lengths, are normally used during the validation process of signalized intersections. However, validating VISSIM based on a non-inbuilt attribute is yet to be explored. This paper proposes a step-by-step procedure for calibrating signalized intersections in VISSIM based on a measurable variable, which is the degree of saturation. The approach was applied to a case study of four signalized intersections in Miami, Florida. The methodology utilized real-world vehicle trajectory data to determine the optimal values of VISSIM car-following parameters required for calibration. Statistical results revealed that both the saturation headways obtained from VISSIM and the saturation headways observed in the field follow the same distribution. The results signify that VISSIM could be calibrated using a non-inbuilt attribute, and moreover generates accurate data compared to the field measurements.",2590-1982,Not found
The acceptability value of autonomous vehicles: A quantitative analysis of the willingness to pay for shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) mobility services,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100224,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The massive diffusion of autonomous vehicles will allow making transportation systems safer, efficient and less pollutant. Nevertheless, there are still some obstacles in the adoption of driverless vehicles of a technological, normative, ethical and social nature. Many surveys observed a priori reluctance towards autonomous vehicles, due to their implications for personal safety. This reluctance could mean a sort of lack of trust (unwillingness to use/pay) that several authors have observed, but only few have measured. Although the main interest of manufacturers/policy-makers is the diffusion of autonomous vehicles in the private car market, it is probably in the public transport sector that this technology will be used first. The aim of the research was to propose an estimation of the value of this reluctance to change (acceptability) towards shared autonomous services. A discrete choice experiment was performed in Naples (Italy) among bus/taxi users. A Mixed Logit model with random coefficients and panel data was estimated. The results show that the average transport user has an a priori reluctance to use fully-automated bus/taxi of −2.31 Euro/trip. Category-specific estimates were also performed resulting that male 18–40 year-old (>40 year-old) have a reluctance in using driverless transit services 53% (36%) lower than females. Of interest are the results relative to those who commonly use on-board automation features, for which a positive willingness to pay for driverless vehicles was estimated (+1.21 Euro/trip). Obtained results strongly suggest that the main barrier preventing mass adoption of autonomous vehicles may also be psychological besides technological.",2590-1982,Not found

However, little is known regarding time perspective, driving skills, and driver behaviors, even though time perspective is an important predictor of many risky behaviors. Time perspective is a general construct of the thoughts relating to present, past, and future. Broadly, (i) past time perspective is related to the recall of reconstructed past scenarios; (ii) present time perspective means attending to immediate and salient stimulus; and (iii) future time perspective is related to anticipation and imagining future consequences. In the present study, we investigated the effect of time perspective on driving skills and driver behaviors. Young drivers (N = 203, aged 18 to 30, M = 25.36, SD = 3.09) who drive their own vehicle at least 1000 km per year completed the Driving Skill Inventory, Driver Behavior Questionnaire, and Time Perspective Inventory. The canonical correlation findings revealed significant associations between the study variables. Lower scores on present hedonistic time perspective were associated with lower scores on perceptional-motor skills. Lower scores on past negative and present fatalistic time perspectives, and higher scores on past positive and future time perspectives were associated with higher scores on safety skills and lower scores on errors and traffic violations.

Although helping single parents obtain private vehicles (e.g., car donation programs) would be a potential solution, we cannot ignore the high expense of maintaining and operating a vehicle, which may impose a heavy financial burden on single-parent families and constrain their ability to access opportunities and services. In contrast, public transit could be a more accessible and affordable transportation mode that benefits single-parent families. This study examined the association between public transit use and single parents using 2017 National Household Travel Survey and American Community Survey data for Maryland, United States. Using zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression, we found that single parents used transit more than the average resident, and census block groups with more single-parent families had more transit commuters, holding other demographic and socioeconomic variables constant. This association was more significant in large metropolitan and urban areas than the state average. The findings highlight the vital role of public transit in single parents' daily travel. We discussed policy implications related to helping single parents access opportunities and services.",2590-1982,Not found

Agents are considered on a spectrum from human to artificial actors. Environments are considered on a spectrum from simulated to real. Scenarios are considered on a spectrum from constrained to unconstrained. It is argued that these three dimensions capture key differences in research approaches within the field of human-vehicle interaction, and that explicitly situating research and discussions within this framework will allow researchers to better compare and contrast research outcomes and contributions. The framework is used to locate different disciplines in the community with respect to one another, and to identify areas which are as-yet unexplored.",2590-1982,Not found
Urban transportation in Libya: An overview,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100161,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Urbanization and industrialization are becoming increasingly important in developing nations, requiring infrastructure to support and facilitate progress and development. Moreover, growing population prompts growing infrastructure to meet ever-changing demands as well as stimulating urbanization. In recent decades, Libya has witnessed a revolutionary development due to the discovery of oil in the early sixties which has led to an ever-increasing number of users of transportation infrastructure. This paper aims at providing an overview of urban transportation in Libya, in addition to some of the issues that face the whole transportation system. The article would help planners understand and anticipate problems to assist the Libyan government improve the system and encourage investments in the transportation sector. Therefore, available statistics on aspects related to the subject have been collected and represented. The different aspects of transportation that were covered in this paper include transportation systems and infrastructure, pollution, safety, and urban population, as well as parking. Results indicate that there is an urgent need to improve the transportation system in the country.

Is bicycling getting safer? Bicycle fatality rates (1985–2017) using four exposure metrics,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100219,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration cites decreasing bicyclist fatalities in the United States over the past several decades as evidence of improved bicycling safety. However, with users possessing a diverse range of tolerances, purposes, and socio-demographics, bicycle safety is an important yet complex problem, one that does not have a simple yes/no answer. To gain a better understanding, we need to take a variety of perspectives. Traditional bicycle safety analyses take a transportation engineering perspective by using distance-based exposure metrics or those based on the number of trips. But there are other perspectives – such as public health (using population) and transportation planning (using bicycle participation) – that could provide us with a fuller picture. This paper applies four measures of bicycling exposure to take a broad, interdisciplinary perspective on bicycling safety to answer the question of whether bicycling is actually getting safer and, if so, for whom. We first explore age differences with respect to the direction and magnitude of bicyclist fatality rates in the United States between 1985 and 2017. We then investigate whether any safety benefits are shared equally among commuters and recreational riders. Using fatality data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and exposure data from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), the American Community Survey (ACS), the U.S. Census, and the National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA) – a relatively novel approach to measuring exposure through a comprehensive national bicycling participation survey – we derived trends of age-specific bicyclist fatality rates and corresponding confidence intervals for children and adults. We also compare exposure to fatality outcomes by deriving Pearson's correlation coefficients. This is the first research to provide a longitudinal, age-specific statistical analysis of bicycle fatality rates using these four exposure metrics. Results suggest that overall declines in bicycle fatality rates have been primarily driven by a sharp decline in child bicyclist fatalities while adult bicycle fatality rates have generally trended upwards (especially for the general population) or remained stagnant (for commuters). This work adds to the understanding of bicyclist safety and gives direction to future research regarding the importance of considering age and exposure sources.",2590-1982,Not found

We used data sets of cases from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University and air transport (passengers carried) from the World Bank. Besides, we computed Poisson, QuasiPoisson, Negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial models with cross-validation to make sure that our findings are robust.

The association between lifestyle and aberrant driving behavior among Iranian car drivers,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100221,8,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Aberrant driving is one of the most important contributors to traffic crashes, and drivers' lifestyle attributes might affect aberrant driving behavior. However, people in developing countries, especially in the Middle East, usually reflect crucial differences in lifestyle compared to people in Europe and the United States. Iran may be perceived as a society with multiple cultural and lifestyle facets, and people reflect a mixed Islamic and Western lifestyle. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between lifestyle dimensions and aberrant driving behavior among Iranian drivers. For this purpose, 1260 drivers with driving license responded to a questionnaire including items about socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle dimensions, and the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ). Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that most of the lifestyle dimensions (Car hobby, Religion, Morality, and Culture) had significant associations with driving behavior. Car hobby (driving for recreational purposes) positively predicted driving errors, lapses, ordinary violations, and aggressive violations. Religion and Morality (a focus on ethical aspects in life) were negative predictors of all the aberrant driving behavior factors. Ordinary violations and aggressive violations were further negatively predicted by culture, operationalized as participation in cultural activities (e.g. reading books). Policies aimed at reducing drivers' car hobby can be focused on the process of education for obtaining and extending the driver's license. The syllabus can be updated to shed light on disadvantages of driving for pleasure/fun. Promotion of cultural activities through the mass media and educational institutions such as schools, libraries, and universities may also increase awareness and calm people, which in turn may be associated with a reduction in aberrant driving behavior.",2590-1982,Not found

During the studied period of the lockdown (March 16 - April 26 2020) the number of accidents per day fell by 74,3% in coparison with those in February 14-20 (reference week) and 76% in respect to the equivalent period in 2018-2019. This reduction of accidents has been higher than the decrease of mobility during the same reference period (62.9%). This suggests a multiplicative positive effect of traffic reduction on roads safety.

A fallback mechanism or a commander? A discussion about the role and skill needs of future drivers within partially automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100337,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Vehicle automation promises to improve safety. However, it also raises concerns about human performance. Many current research and policy efforts address automation effects on operational levels of driving control. However, the driving task encompasses more than just operational control. So, in this paper, we ask whether a more holistic view of the driving task should be considered. Would such a framework imply that the human role is more than just a “fallback” mechanism for automation systems, especially for partial automation systems? If the human role were conceptualized more as a “commander role” (than an “operator”), would it enable system-level performance to be optimized more effectively? If so, would this lead to changes in design of the vehicle and interface—as well as in skills needed by human users? New skills like strategic planning, delegation of control responsibility, tactical avoidance, and effective mediation of hazardous situations could become important. A more holistic approach for integrating automation may facilitate role change for human users while also improving safety.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring the travel behavior changes caused by the COVID-19 crisis: A case study for a developing country,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100334,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This study aims to examine the extent to which SARS-Cov-2 and associated governmental interventions to mitigate virus transmission has affected daily travel decisions in Bangladesh. A questionnaire survey was used to record opinions of respondents hailing from diverse socio-economic backgrounds on trip number and mode preferences for a variety of trip purposes for “before” and “during” COVID-19 situation. This was used to assess changes in (i) trip frequencies, and (ii) travel mode preferences using contingency tables, ordinal logistic regression and Sankey diagrams. Analyses revealed that COVID-19 caused large variation in mode preferences but small variation in trip frequencies. Males still go outside for work and shopping, putting them at greater risk than females. COVID-19 has drastically cut recreational trips, but not so many work trips. Although online work or education (950%) and shopping (170%) has risen, this seems to be limited to urban areas. Besides, buses continue to be preferred the most during pandemic for trips involving short distance recreation (26.75%), markets (43.18%), and long distance recreation (35.66%). Results suggest the lack of online penetration in rural and suburban areas have prevented worktrip reductions in those places, putting the inhabitants at heightened risk from virus. Moreover, majority of the people continue to use buses at the expense of their health for lack of cheaper alternatives. Results imply that the government needs to ensure proper hygiene practices in public transit and non-motorised paratransit vehicles.

The role of route familiarity in traffic participants’ behaviour and transport psychology research: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100331,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Studies of how transport behaviour (e.g., driving, cycling, and walking) is affected by practice and familiarity are not commonplace, in spite of the fact that much of our travel takes place on familiar, well-practiced routes. In other areas, it is well-established that repetition affects cognition, particularly memory and attention. The goals of the current systematic literature review were 1) to explore how researchers have described and examined the effects of people’s familiarity with routes and road types, and 2) to obtain a better insight into the cognitive processes, and behaviour that occur in familiar road environments. The systematic review was conducted based on the principles described in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Scopus’ database was searched systematically using predefined search combinations which involved (1) the transport modes of driving, cycling, and walking; (2) research methods that typically involve route- or situation-familiar participants (e.g., naturalistic studies, observational studies and field operational tests); and (3) various words associated with route familiarity (e.g., familiar, everyday, and commute). Ninety-four studies met all inclusion criteria. Results were analysed in terms of the cognitive and behavioural changes associated with familiarity, as reported in the studies. Route familiarity was typically reported to reduce the amount of cognitive control used to process the immediate environment and to increase mind wandering, compared to unfamiliar situations. Familiarity also increased recall accuracy and opportunities for self-regulatory behaviour, and decreased task difficulty. Familiarity appears to have large effects on how people attend to and process the environment. Given the proportion of time people spend travelling in familiar situations, this low attention, high familiarity state should be considered the default mode and as a more integral context for experimental, naturalistic and observational research in transport psychology.",2590-1982,Not found
Modelling traffic during Lilac Wildfire evacuation using cellular data,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100335,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Southern California is prone to wildfire events that spark major evacuations of communities in the Wildland-Urban Interface. Highly developed regions such as Southern California have a number of transportation data sources to draw from that can support emergency managers’ decision-making processes. Up to date traffic sensors such as those found on the majority of California’s highways can inform emergency managers on current traffic densities, flows and speeds. Yet, in many wildfire prone regions of the United States, this is not the case. Despite this data shortfall, many regions do have robust cellular networks that inherently produce substantial amounts of location data. The location data produced by cellphone users can be used to predict vehicular densities on evacuation routes. This study examines how cellular data can be used to predict vehicular densities on evacuation routes. A mathematical model was developed to aid in the prediction of vehicular densities on evacuation networks. Correction factors were produced to adjust for the overestimation of users on roadways by cellular networks. Extrapolation factors were also developed for estimation of the number of cellular users based on a single cellphone counts data point. The Lilac Wildfire data in Dec 2017, was used to test and validate the developed model. This methodology may prove useful to transportation planners and emergency managers in planning evacuations in areas not served by a network of traffic sensors.",2590-1982,Not found
A model for modifying the public transport service patterns to account for the imposed COVID-19 capacity,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100336,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"As public transport operators try to resume their services, they have to operate under reduced capacities due to COVID-19. Because demand can exceed capacity at different areas and across different times of the day, drivers have to refuse passenger boardings at specific stops to avoid overcrowding. Given the urgent need to develop decision support tools that can prevent the overcrowding of vehicles, this study introduces a dynamic integer nonlinear program to derive the optimal service patterns of individual vehicles that are ready to be dispatched. In addition to the objective of satisfying the imposed vehicle capacity due to COVID-19, the proposed service pattern model accounts for the waiting time of passengers. Our model is tested in a bus line connecting the University of Twente with its surrounding cities demonstrating the trade-off between the reduced in-vehicle crowding levels and the excessive waiting times of unserved passengers.",2590-1982,Not found

The PID was modelled and evaluated at the intersection of Tyvola Rd and South Blvd in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. Traffic was modelled considering the existing intersection design and proposed PID using Vissim microscopic traffic simulation software under conditions of 0% bicycles to 15% bicycles. Safety was then analysed using Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM), and conflicts were defined as a 1.5-second intersection of two or more trajectories. There is no conclusive evidence that PID negatively effects operational performance (vehicle delay and level of service) at the selected study intersection. The type and total number of bicycle-related conflicts per bicycle varied with the percentage of bicycles. As much as an 80% reduction in the total number of bicycle-related conflicts could be observed if the percentage of bicycles exceed 10%. Benefits due to the implementation of PID could be greater at intersections with high bicycling activities. The findings support the hypothesis that the PID reduces the number of conflicts, and therefore improves safety.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring equity: How equity norms have been applied implicitly and explicitly in transportation research and practice,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100332,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"By definition, equity is concerned with justice. On a societal level, equity is concerned with the just distribution of resources in society. Because a wide range of theories of just distribution exist, equity considerations are multifaceted and create a normative conceptual space in which theories can be considered, argued, and applied. In the past few decades, the concept of equity has received increasing attention within the transportation literature, both within academic journals and practice-oriented books and reports. These works present various theories of justice, either implicitly or explicitly, within the context of transportation financing, investments, and service allocations. While explicit normative reviews as well as arguments have been presented, implicit applications and imprecise definitions of equity theories have largely obfuscated and over-simplified this expansive topic.

First, seven semi-structured interviews with potential customers and industry experts served the subject exploration. Second, survey data from 76 potential customers, obtained using an online questionnaire, quantified perceptions and retrofitting requirements. Thematic analysis, statistical techniques and data triangulation provided rich insights. Informed by industry transition, transportation and strategy literature, this study contributes to the largely unexplored field of ICE to EV retrofitting.

To study the influence of this type of crisis on flight operations at Charles De Gaulle airport, an existing energy atypicality metric is applied on a reference period before COVID-19 and compared to the COVID-19 period. Whereas the traffic at Charles De Gaulle airport has decreased by around 90% on April 2020, the obtained statistics underlined an increase in the atypical flight ratio of around 50%. This trend can be explained in part by the appearance of glide interceptions from above as a result of trajectory shortenings, and an increase in the proportion of high speed approaches.",2590-1982,Not found

Theoretical and analytical advancements in network science have furthered our understanding of the effects of social network characteristics on peer influence and engagement. Influence of social network occurs when network players alter their decisions and behavior based on others’ influence in the social network which is evident in different disciplines. Crisis communication networks have significant impact during disasters as people often spread pertinent information in social media due to presence of limited access to conventional information sources. Existing researches in social science and sociology indicate that social networks benefit spreading warning message and disseminate information about an imminent risk, nevertheless, the existing studies do not provide enough understanding on how to quantify such influences and how this map into decision-making during emergency evacuations. This study provides a robust review of the studies exploring how individuals are socially influenced, both on-line and off-line, while communicating risk during extreme weather events such as hurricanes. The scope of this review primarily includes studies that look into how our social networks influence the way we decide to evacuate and how crisis information spread from one agent to another agent in a network.

Although characteristics identified in previous studies explain this phenomenon in a general way for the rest of the U.S.-Mexico binational spaces, it is not clear if it occurs in the same way in smaller regions due to their border condition. This research aims to fill this literature gap by understanding cross-border mobility in medium-small Mexico-U.S. binational regions and exploring the role of the urban scale and geographical position, using Mexicali-Imperial Valley binational region as a case study. A methodology is proposed considering the limited data scenario of Mexican cities, and it is expected it could be applied in other cases to understand cross-border mobility. It has two main approaches; the first one is a historical analysis using official data. The second is a disaggregate analysis based on a zoning system and a household survey design and application; it was applied in Mexicali in 2019. It is concluded some cross-border dynamics depend on the urban scale of cities that make up binational regions; however, it is the American urban area that largely defines this mobility, while Mexican cities’ territorial dimension seems to have less incidence. Moreover, some cross-border mobility characteristics depend on the border condition, as demonstrated by the findings in medium areas, despite their territorial scale, having border-crossing growth trends similar to the larger ones. Moreover, the case study’s particular results could serve as parameters for designing strategies to promote efficient and sustainable cross-border mobility",2590-1982,Not found

Yet, municipal highway funding allocation methods do not typically consider these differences. Throughout the United States, municipal highway funding allocation is based upon fixed formulas that often only account for highway mileage and/or population size rather than equal benefits and funding outcomes across different population groups. This potentially creates an inequitable funding allocation process leading to safety and accessibility disparities between different population groups. This research investigates the extent to which the distribution of resources is not equal when evaluated by population group. Specifically, the relationship between municipal highway expenditures and poverty levels, population aged 65 years and older, race, and remoteness is investigated using data from the states of New York and Massachusetts. Using linear regression techniques, several models were developed that relate municipal highway expenditures with the socio-economic and socio-demographic characteristics of municipalities. The results revealed that there are clear municipal highway expenditure disparities between different population groups. Municipalities that have higher poverty levels experience a lower highway expenditure rate per local mile. Further, municipalities located in remote areas far from large metropolitan regions experience a disproportionately lower highway expenditure rate per local mile.

Cities around the world responded by instituting a variety of policies and programs meant to address this shift, such as carving out roadway space for non-car uses, putting pedestrian walk signals on recall, reducing speed limits, and subsidizing bike share schemes. The extraordinarily rapid pace and global scale of these responses—and the public’s reactions to them—suggest that the transport planning, policy, and engineering professions may be at an inflection point with respect to equitable accommodation of non-car transport modes. In this paper we describe an effort to support potential shifts in practice by documenting and cataloging over a thousand COVID-19-related mobility responses into a publicly available database.

"Mathematical modeling and heuristic approaches to optimize shared parking resources: A case study of Beijing, China",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100317,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Sharing unused private parking spaces with public travelers can improve parking resource utilization. However, a challenge lies in the approach to maximize the utilization of such parking resources without time colliding with the needs of these resources between public travelers and owners over time. To address this challenge, this study presents a methodology aiming at efficiently obtaining the optimum matches between parking supply and demand with time-window constraints. First, a framework for shared parking is proposed to guide the development of the computation algorithms. Based on this framework, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and its solving algorithms are then developed to maximize the spatial-temporal utilization. Further, the feasibility and validity of the proposed model and algorithms are tested by empirical data collected in our real-world. The results indicate that the non-increased demand durations and non-descending supply durations (NI-ND) heuristic performs the best under both small- and large-scale supply and demand settings with extremely high solution efficiency. Moreover, the solutions based on the NI-ND algorithm are very close to the optimal objective, implying that the proposed shared parking allocation method based on the dual bin-packing principle is an effective way to address the realistic supply–demand relationship of parking resources under time-window constraints. Finally, the potential of shared parking is estimated based on the statistics of the number of private parking spaces and parking behavior data in Beijing.",2590-1982,Not found

Optimizing actuated traffic signal control using license plate recognition data: Methods for modeling and algorithm development,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100319,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Primary control parameters (e.g., minimum and maximum green times) at actuated traffic signal controllers are traditionally determined based on the limited historical or sample traffic data, along with engineering experience, which actually cannot well respond to the real-time traffic demands in operation. Meanwhile, License Plate Recognition (LPR) data detected by Electronic Police devices have become more and more available at urban signalized intersections in China. Therefore, this paper presents a novel idea in developing a set of innovative algorithms to dynamically determine the control parameters against varying traffic conditions measured by the LPR data. The designated computational loop is developed to determine from the LPR data: (1) traffic parameters (e.g., traffic arrivals of the target intersection in the future unit time) dynamically at small time intervals; (2) traffic arrival states and initial states of all the approaches at the subject intersection using the estimated traffic parameters from previous time interval, and then predict the traffic states for the next time interval; (3) traffic signal optimization alternative to maximize the total throughput while minimizing the overall control delay. At the same time, the delay and queue length of the subject intersection are used as a performance feedback to the next cycle of calculation for continually optimizing the actuated control timing parameters. The simulation-based comparison of the improved actuated signal control scheme with the existing pre-timed control scheme indicates an obvious improvement by the developed algorithms based on the LPR data obtained at typical intersections in Jinan, Shandong Province, China.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring work zone late merge strategies with and without enabling connected vehicles technologies,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100316,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Typical traffic control and operations at work zones are not effective in mitigating the work zone bottleneck, as the common early merge behavior limits utilizing the available capacity in the closed lane. Recently, using late merge strategy is encouraged to fully utilize the closed lane, therefore increasing efficiency of the work zone. In practice, the late merge strategy does not work effectively due to the lack of compliance by drivers. This paper is aimed at exploring two work zone late merge strategies with and without enabling connected vehicles (CV) technology. This first strategy is the late merge without CV enabled. The second strategy incorporates CV-enabled cooperative merge to enhance the work zone efficiency through communications between vehicles in the open and closed lanes. The CV-enabled strategy employs a rule based decentralized control algorithm. The paper has implemented both late merge strategies in microsimulation and evaluated the operational performances. Three major performance measures, which are throughput, delay and queue length, are used in the evaluation. The results indicate that the operational performance of the CV-enabled cooperative late merge is superior to the late merge strategy without CV in most cases, especially when traffic demand is moderate, while both late merge strategies outperform the traditional early merge strategy. Moreover, effects of the control variables including the traffic demand, heavy vehicle percentage, lane distribution percentage, late merge length, reduction of gap acceptance factor, and compliance rate, have been analyzed. Ultimately, sensitivity analysis has been performed to investigate the trend of effects from the significant variables control.",2590-1982,Not found
Electronic crash reporting: Implementation of the Model Minimum Uniform crash Criteria (MMUCC) and crash record life cycle comparison,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100318,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Electronic crash records have become the standard crash reporting method in most states, but crash report elements vary between states and there is little publicly available information detailing the data provenance and life cycles for these records. As crash report granularity increases, proper data management is critical to ensure report quality with minimal errors. States are encouraged to meet federal standards for minimum crash report elements detailed in the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria. MMUCC standardization helps states manage long-term crash data, enables multi-state analysis, and promotes sound traffic safety policies. This paper details how the states of Alabama and Wisconsin manage crash reports by evaluating their compliance with MMUCC standards as well as tracking the life cycle of crash reports in the two states from provenance, through approval and validation processes, to preservation as official records. A web-based MMUCC Compliance Tool was developed using elements from Alabama and Wisconsin crash reports, and aids other states in mapping existing crash report elements to MMUCC standards. The tool uses an automated check to map crash report elements and flags missing elements. The output of the tool includes a report detailing changes needed for the crash report to more closely align with the MMUCC standards. Common crash report lifecycle elements in Alabama and Wisconsin were identified, including initial web service validations, supervisor review, transactional database backups, linkage to driver record systems, and processes in place to manage and fix void requests.

"Investigating heterogeneous car-following behaviors of different vehicle types, traffic densities and road types",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100315,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"For realistic traffic flow simulation and analysis, it is essential to discuss car-following behaviors in detail, while most studies only concentrate on the heterogeneity according to vehicle types based on the unstable observable variables. To overcome such shortcoming, this paper introduces car-following properties to represent car-following behaviors in different driving conditions. Based on a naturalistic trajectory dataset named The Next Generation Simulation Program (NGSIM), vehicles are divided into 7 classes based on driving conditions. The car-following model parameters of each vehicle, which have practical meanings, are considered as the car-following properties, and are calibrated by genetic algorithm (GA). And then, the heterogeneity of property is discussed based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test) and the rangeability to understand car-following behaviors. Results show the heterogeneity of car-following behaviors according to vehicle type and road type, while traffic density has tiny effect on car-following behaviors. And car-following properties are also heterogeneous, as the comfortable deceleration is stable, while other properties change differently with driving conditions. Besides, there is a similar pattern of change on vehicle properties and vehicle trajectories. Furthermore, potential applications of the research are provided, for instance, model more realistic traffic simulations and give support to adaptive cruise control systems (ACC) for vehicles in different conditions.",2590-1982,Not found

However, in some special scenarios, the location information of vehicles might become inaccurate or lost, e.g., the vehicle loses contact with the road-side unit (RSU). To improve the reliability of vehicle location information, we concentrate on solving two kinds of tracking problems, i.e., vehicle location information is inaccurate and lost in this paper. First, a predicted method using vehicle dynamics is presented to recognize the scenarios in which the vehicle location information becomes inaccurate when the vehicle moves. Then, a modified Kalman filter is employed to adapt to a more complex scenario with variable position error. After that, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model is designed to predict vehicle location information when vehicle location information is lost. At last, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods have a marked influence on handling the driving scenario and make our path tracking algorithm more robust.",2590-1982,Not found
A time-independent trajectory optimization approach for connected and autonomous vehicles under reservation-based intersection control,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100312,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Rule-based and optimization-based autonomous intersection management (AIM) policies have been evaluated against traditional signal controls in terms of intersection safety, efficiency and emission. As one of AIM policies, reservation-based control has further taken advantage of the benefits of AIM, especially via optimization approaches. This paper presents a time-independent trajectory optimization approach for connected and autonomous vehicles under reservation-based intersection control. The existing approaches assign an arrival time and speed to vehicles ahead of entering the intersection. However, the vehicles may not follow the planned trajectory once the traffic condition varies sharply and thus the trajectory solution becomes infeasible with respect to the assigned arrival time and speed. The proposed approach aims to solve the fail-follow problem by separating the optimization between arrival time, speed, and trajectory planning by optimizing the trajectory without arrival time and speed predetermined. The approach finds the optimal solution in terms of the intersection efficiency meanwhile keeps the feasibility of trajectory planning by formulating the variation of acceleration rate and breaking a whole trajectory into an enlarged set of segments. Two different control strategies, BATCH and ZONE, are also proposed to test the performance of the optimization approach in comparison with another Dynamic Batch strategy. The results validate that the proposed approach can adapt to extremely high traffic demand scenario. Sensitivity analyses also evaluate the performance of the proposed approach under different problem settings in terms of intersection efficiency.",2590-1982,Not found
A cooperative lane change model for connected and autonomous vehicles on two lanes highway by considering the traffic efficiency on both lanes,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100310,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Lane change maneuver is one of the critical resources of traffic oscillation which will jeopardize traffic efficiency and safety. Emergent connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology provides the opportunity to cooperate with CAV movements and conducts cooperative lane change. However, the state of the art indicates that most studies only cooperatively control the host vehicle and the vehicle on the target lane but ignore the traffic flow on the subject lane. Motivated by this research gap, a centralized two-stage optimization-based cooperative lane change (CTO-CLC) approach is introduced for a pure CAV flow in a two lanes highway. The lane change process is studied independently from the aspect of lateral and longitudinal movement. A sine function curve is used for the lateral movement and the cooperative longitudinal movement is divided into two stages according to the physical lane position, i.e. lane change process in original lane (LC-O) and lane change process in target lane (LC-T) stages. The control input and terminal tracking states are considered in the objective function to ensure both the traffic flow smoothness and the tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through numerical experiments in MATLAB. The results indicate the cooperative lane change model is available and practical, which can be well carried out in multiple vehicles with a simple real lane change scenario.",2590-1982,Not found

However, how logistics land uses have been reshaped to accommodate the e-tailing demand has not been adequately studied. By examining the trajectory of logistics space development during the last decade in Shenzhen, an e-tailing hub in China, this study reveals a less common trend of logistics space restructuring that has been identified in a series of existing studies. Results from spatial data analysis indicate a more clustered logistics space across the city, in spite of a slight decrease in the total number of facilities. We argue that e-tailing has acted as a catalyst for determining how logistics facilities are designed, redeveloped, relocated, and utilized to match with changing requirements in supply chain management. Development of new multi-story facilities, renovation of obsolete facilities, and reorganization of existing facilities at regional level, are the major types of land-use efforts to fill in the supply-demand gap in logistics space in this rapidly-urbanizing city with shrinking land availability. The findings could help the governments reconsider the interactions between e-tailing, logistics demand, and sustainable land use patterns in policymaking.",2590-1982,Not found

However, due to insufficient research on the parking choice behavior and its influence factors, the shared parking mode has not been effectively promoted and applied. In order to study the parking choice behavior of the demander in the shared parking mode, this paper establishes a choice intention model of shared parking demander based on Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), and divides effect route in the process of promoting shared parking mode into central route and peripheral route. Firstly, we study the external influence factors that correspond to central route and peripheral route. And then we establish the connection between external influence factors and attribute factors of the demander by assuming 20 correlations. Finally the hypotheses in the model are verified by questionnaire investigation and statistical test. The research results indicate that the walking distance and parking time are significantly correlated with the travel purpose of the demander; the parking fee is significantly correlated with the income of the demander; the security risk factor is significantly correlated with the age of the demander.

Land transport greenhouse gas mitigation scenarios for Mauritius based on modelling transport demand,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100299,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"A model has been applied to quantify land transport demand in Mauritius from the perspectives of both passenger transport and freight transport. The first objective of the paper is to present the model, including the 2-layer calibration that has been carried out for assuring energy balance using official statistics. The second objective of the paper is to demonstrate the use of the model to develop greenhouse gas mitigation scenarios based on policies including: (i) improved fuel efficiency of vehicles; (ii) improved vehicle inspections; (iii) the scaling up of low-carbon technologies including hybrid and electric vehicles, as well as the use of bioethanol produced in Mauritius; and (iv) the proposed light-rail system in Mauritius. The results show that the ‘business-as-usual’ land transport emissions are expected to reach ~1.68 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2050. The combination of all scenarios could result in ~0.31 MtCO2e reductions by 2050, with over 57% of all reductions are expected to accrue from (iii). Since energy used in transport makes up for more than 56% of the primary energy requirement of Mauritius, the macroeconomic effects of decarbonizing land transport is significant from an energy security standpoint. The modelling approach can be used to inform the formulation of a low-carbon land transport strategy for Mauritius, as well as for increasing the mitigation ambition of its Nationally Determined Contribution. Further, it is argued that the approach would be useful in the context of other small islands developing states that face land availability constraints like Mauritius.",2590-1982,Not found
Impact of vehicular traffic stream on pedestrian crossing behavior at an uncontrolled mid-block section,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100298,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"A term Total Crossing Time (TCT) is coined in this study. TCT of a pedestrian includes the time spent by the pedestrian in waiting and his/her crossing of a road. This paper argues that considering a distribution of TCT is required for analysis instead of analyzing a crisp value of TCT of pedestrians. This study quantifies, perhaps for the first time, that by what extent vehicular traffic streams affect TCT distribution of pedestrians crossing an uncontrolled mid-block section of an urban road. For this, a suitable parameter of traffic stream that influences TCT distribution is identified. The suitable parameter of traffic is found to be the traffic density. Further, it is hypothesized that pedestrians can only perceive a range of traffic density and not discrete values of density. In order to incorporate this, traffic density observed on the road is categorized into nine groups; and, for each group of densities corresponding TCT distribution is computed. Curve fitting, using two kinds of density functions, for each of the nine TCT distributions is performed and Pearson Type-III density function is found to be a more appropriate distribution. Additionally, the parameters of the fitted Pearson Type-III distribution are found to be dependent on the corresponding mean of the traffic density group. Hence, a simple regression model is also suggested using which one can predict TCT distribution if traffic density of the stream is known. The findings of this study is going to be useful for researchers/practitioner those who are interested in simulating pedestrians, crossing an uncontrolled mid-block section of a road.",2590-1982,Not found

In this study, we harness state-of-the-art datasets to model cyclists’ route choice based on a case study of the City of Glasgow, Scotland. First, the social fitness network Strava was used to obtain datasets containing the number of cycling trips on each street intersection for the years 2017 and 2018. Second, we employed a Python toolkit to acquire and analyse the street networks. OSMnx was subsequently employed to quantify several commonly used centrality indices (degree, eigenvector, betweenness and closeness) to measure street layout. Due to the presence of spatial dependence, a spatial error model was used to model route choices. Model results demonstrate that: (1) cyclists’ movement models were consistent for the years 2017 and 2018; (2) the presence of a spillover effect suggests that cyclists tend to cycle in proximity to each other; and (3) cyclists avoid streets with high degree centrality values and prefer streets with high eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality.

The factors used for the measurement of driving behaviors concern violations, errors, lapses, and aggressiveness. Moreover, the modified DBQ regarding texting and social media, as well as drug and alcohol consumption, was used for the measurement of driving behaviors as well. The questionnaire can be used to measure Thai drivers’ behaviors and meet the goodness-of-fit statistics criteria of every measurement model and develop self-assessment reports to evaluate risky behaviors before people obtain a driving license.

Social impact assessment towards sustainable urban mobility in Qatar: Understanding behavioral change triggers,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100295,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In Qatar, majority of the citizens rely on private automobiles compared to public transport. For this reason, it is imperative to consider public views on sustainability issues within the transport sector. This study examines some behavioral change triggers as Qatar moves towards a sustainable public transport system. The dominant view is that using public transport is more sustainable; therefore, the objective of the study was two-fold: to assess public travel behaviors and attitudes with respect to the use of public transportation and to formulate strategies designed to encourage commuters to use sustainable public transport. For this purpose, the study employed a descriptive, correlational research design in the collection and analysis of pertinent data. Primary data was obtained using survey research. Electronic surveys created by Survey Monkey were sent to prospective respondents online with a total sample size of 435. The framework of the questionnaire was: the respondents’ demographic profile, their overall knowledge about automobiles’ impact on the environment, their opinion concerning metro acceptance and initiation about the possible use of a sustainable transport system to the public, their knowledge on the metro project challenges, and their willingness to use the metro. Results indicated that the majority of respondents resisted using public transport, as most of them owned automobiles. Only 24% of respondents said that they would consider using public transport for environmental conservation purposes. The four major setbacks to using the metro system were: the need to wait for the metro to operate (21.4%), lifestyle and culture (16.9%) – respondents used to drive their own cars, climate concerns (16.9%), and the location of metro stations (17.5%).

Sharing or owning autonomous vehicles? Comprehending the role of ideology in the adoption of autonomous vehicles in the society of automobility,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100294,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This article investigates the role of hegemonic ideology and the symbolic meaning of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) ownership in the society of automobility. Emerging mobility technologies, including connected shared platforms and automation, are disrupting urban transportation. There is a pervasive expectation that the utilisation of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), by offering an efficient, flexible and affordable on-demand mobility, will eventually replace ubiquitous private car ownership. Researchers have mostly considered the transition of car ownership to SAVs based on positivist-empiricist approaches. The meaning of the car and its functions are not limited to the instrumental usage that facilitates mobility; instead, the car has other functions such as demonstrating the socio-economic status of its owner and symbolising his/her subjective identity, which is embedded in the dominant ideology and its symbolic structure. Automobility is a component of hegemonic ideology and its symbolic system that has shaped our car-dependent societies over the last century. The ideological and symbolic functions of car ownership have often been neglected when discussing AVs of the future. This research uses Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) to analyse a mixed data set including 3 focus group interviews and 192 residents’ responses to a questionnaire-based survey in Auckland. The results indicate that there was considerable heterogeneity in participants’ preferences for using AVs, but relatively less heterogeneity in sharing mobility services. The research reveals that the provision of alternative smart shared mobility options does not subsequently reduce pervasive car ownership. The research concludes that the hegemonic ideology and its symbolic mechanism promote automobility that will significantly steer private car owners towards AV usage instead of the expected shared mobility. Therefore, in the context of the society of automobility, AVs should be considered as a technological transformation rather than a paradigm-shift towards shared mobility services.",2590-1982,Not found

Vulnerable road users and the coming wave of automated vehicles: Expert perspectives,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100293,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Automated driving research over the past decades has mostly focused on highway environments. Recent technological developments have drawn researchers and manufacturers to look ahead at introducing automated driving in cities. The current position paper examines this challenge from the viewpoint of scientific experts. Sixteen Human Factors researchers were interviewed about their personal perspectives on automated vehicles (AVs) and the interaction with VRUs in the future urban environment. Aspects such as smart infrastructure, external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), and the potential of augmented reality (AR) were addressed during the interviews. The interviews showed that the researchers believed that fully autonomous vehicles will not be introduced in the coming decades and that intermediate levels of automation, specific AV services, or shared control will be used instead. The researchers foresaw a large role of smart infrastructure and expressed a need for AV-VRU segregation, but were concerned about corresponding costs and maintenance requirements. The majority indicated that eHMIs will enhance future AV-VRU interaction, but they noted that implicit communication will remain dominant and advised against text-based and instructive eHMIs. AR was commended for its potential in assisting VRUs, but given the technological challenges, its use, for the time being, was believed to be limited to scientific experiments. The present expert perspectives may be instrumental to various stakeholders and researchers concerned with the relationship between VRUs and AVs in future urban traffic.",2590-1982,Not found
"Difference in travel behavior between immigrants in the u.s. and us born residents: The immigrant effect for car-sharing, ride-sharing, and bike-sharing services",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100296,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Understanding immigrants’ travel behavior is important to transportation planners and policymakers working to implement better transportation planning and public policies to serve those needs. The recent changes to the transportation system, specifically, the recent emergence of shared mobility services, such as car-sharing, ride-sharing, and bike-sharing, may have resulted in changes in how immigrants travel. Thus, we explored two research questions: (1) whether immigrants in the U.S. are more likely to rely on the three newly emerging transportation modes than US-born persons, and (2) whether the assimilation theory can be applied to the modes. To answer these questions, we used data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey and employed Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial regression models to understand the specific behavior of immigrant travelers. The models found the “immigrant effect” only for car-sharing services and bike-sharing programs; that is, relative to U.S. born residents, immigrants in the U.S. use car sharing and bike-sharing services more frequently, while we found an insignificant association in ride-sharing apps use. However, the negative binomial models suggested that immigrants use car sharing and ride sharing less frequently than expected. Immigrants who are in their first few years of living in the U.S. use smartphone rideshare app more frequently, confirming the “assimilation theory.” The results of the predicted frequency of the use indicated that with all other independent variables held constant, U.S. born residents use car-sharing and ride-sharing services more frequently than immigrants, though the difference is marginal. However, immigrants would still tend to use bike share programs more frequently rather than U.S. born residents.",2590-1982,Not found

There is not only a knowledge gap to building this infrastructure, but also an organizational learning gap, as planning organizations are stepping into new waters. This research investigates how well an agile (an iterative, collaborative) way of working may be well-suited to address this through the case of the Municipality of Amsterdam’s Bicycle Program. We explore what this way of working looks like in the bicycle planning context through the stories of Amsterdam practitioners. This is done through 12 semi-structured interviews and 2 narrative interviews with process mapping exercises, the latter of which explore one project in more detail: an intervention at the Alexanderplein intersection. In the Alexanderplein project, collaboration, experimentation, and analysis were tightly connected and enabled learning by the municipality. We present how the way of working in this project and in the Bicycle Program as a whole relate to agile characteristics, practices, and barriers, and we discuss the implications for planning for cycling.",2590-1982,Not found

"Measuring potential assisted-transport demand for older adult care-recipients in Hamilton, Canada",10.1016/j.trip.2020.100284,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Introduction Carer-employees are defined as individuals who are providing unpaid care usually to a loved one or friend while simultaneously working in the paid labour force. This specific population group is vulnerable to ill-health due to the various challenges faced in managing work-life balance. One of the most demanding and common caregiving tasks in Canada is assisted-transport, which involves running errands for the care-recipient, or driving the care recipient to appointments. Little is known about assisted-transport, except that the frequency of assisted-transport is based on the links between daily constraints and carer-employees’ care tasks; thereby, directly impacting work-life balance. An alternative to mitigate assisted-transport demand is to improve the independent mobility of care-recipients (older adults) using accessibility to services as a demand measurement index. Therefore, this research explores potential accessibility to vital services for the older adult, suggesting areas that may require service intervention within the Hamilton census metropolitan area (CMA) in Ontario, Canada. Methods The Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area method was used to analyze potential accessibility from residential addresses of those aged 65+ to vital services; access zones were then outlined. Older adult populations for each access zone were calculated using census data. Suggested areas for service implementation were identified using quadrat analyses of addresses via hexabins. Results Results inform the location of care-recipients living in potentially underserved areas (high assisted-transport demand) of the Hamilton CMA and, in so doing, provide visual insight for decision-makers and city planners to better mitigate mobility dependence.",2590-1982,Not found
Unruly users: Cycling governance in context,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100281,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This paper provides an analysis of the turnaround in urban cycling participation during the 1970s and 1980s when it rebounded in many European cities. Understood as a profound process of sociotechnical change, particular attention is paid to the role of the users. Based on a case study of Graz in Austria, the paper seeks to answer what has led to the observed sociotechnical change and how governance processes have contributed to that. To this end, the paper introduces the reader to the specific circumstances in which the turnaround in urban cycling in Graz occurred. In doing so, the paper looks into significant traffic controversies at the time to study their impact on related governance practices. In a larger context of social and cultural change, the citizens of Graz desired to engage and participate in the shaping of their city and make it a better place to live. The events in Graz are discussed in relation to prominent Science and Technology Studies literature to highlight the profound context-dependency and contingency of sociotechnical change. Grounded in empirical analysis, the paper proposes to reconsider the role of users in cycling governance. Rather than framing the citizens of Graz as passive receivers of policy interventions, they are better understood as active agents of cycling governance. It is shown that alliances across policymakers and civil society actors turned out to be especially effective when responding to the needs of cyclists and their desire for change.",2590-1982,Not found
Bikeshare and safety: Risk assessment and management,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100276,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"There has been growth in bikeshare programs in cities across the world. While the benefits of shared bicycle use in terms of increased mobility, accessibility, and urban environmental quality are understood, the impacts of increased bicycling on traffic safety need further assessment and management. Based on observational studies in one of the nation’s most extensive and successful bikeshare programs (Honolulu, Hawaii), helmet use and behaviors of bikeshare users and other bicylists are compared. A total of 5431 bicycles, mopeds, motorcycles, and other two-wheeled equipment were observed in 25 locations across the city. The locations were selected with a stratified sampling approach. Two logistic regression models are constructed to understand the relationships between helmet use, traffic infractions, bicyclist characteristics, location, roadway, and environmental factors. Bikeshare users (OR = 0.155), visitors (OR = 0.551), females (OR = 0.764), and those wearing earphones (OR = 0.369) are less likely to use helmets than other groups. Peak hour (OR = 1.655) and weekday bicyclists (OR = 1.604) and those cycling on regular road lanes (OR = 2.576) are more likely to use helmets. Bikeshare riders (OR = 1.785) are also more likely than other bicyclists to commit traffic violations. In addition to raising awareness as to traffic safety risks associated with the growth of biking and bikeshare, recommendations for enforcement, education, engineering, and management of safety risks are provided.

This study attempts to assess the effects of COVID-19 on biking. Bikeshare data was used to understand the impacts of COVID-19 during the initial wave of the disease on biking in New York City, Boston, and Chicago. As the cases increased, these cities experienced a reduction in bikeshare trips, and the reductions were different in the three cities. Correlations were developed between COVID-19 cases and various bikeshare related variables. The study period was split into three phases—no COVID-19 phase, cases increasing phase, and cases decreasing phase—to examine how the residents of the three cities reacted during the different phases of the coronavirus spread. While bike trips decreased, the average duration of the trips increased during the pandemic. NYC’s average trip duration was consistently less than that of Boston and Chicago, which could be due to its sprawl (NYC is considered as more compact and connected compared to the other two cities).",2590-1982,Not found
COVID-19: Are you satisfied with traveling during the pandemic?,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100292,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The outbreak of COVID-19 and preventive measures to limit the spread of the virus has significantly impacted our daily activities. This study aims to investigate the effect of daily activity engagement including travel activity and sociodemographic characteristics on travel satisfaction during COVID-19. This study develops a latent segmentation-based ordered logit (LSOL) model using data from the 2020 COVID-19 Survey for Assessing Travel Impact (COST), for the Kelowna region of British Columbia, Canada. The LSOL model accommodates the ordinal nature of the satisfaction level and captures heterogeneity by allocating individuals into discrete latent segments. The model results suggest that the two-segment LSOL model fits the data best. Segment one is more likely to be younger and older high-income workers; whereas, segment two includes middle-aged lower-income, unemployed individuals. The model results suggest that daily activity engagement and sociodemographic attributes significantly affect travel satisfaction. For example, participation in travel for routine shopping, recreational activity, and household errands has a positive effect on travel satisfaction. The use of transportation modes like bike/walk depicted a higher probability to yield travel satisfaction. The model confirms the existence of significant heterogeneity. For instance, travel for work showed a negative relationship in segment one; whereas, a positive relationship is found in segment two. Access to higher household vehicle yield lower satisfaction in segment one; in contrast, a positive relationship is found in segment two.

Considerations for the transportation of school aged children amid the Coronavirus pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100290,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Close proximity seating and the distinctive anthropometric characteristics of young children introduce unique challenges when implementing control strategies to promote safe transportation on school buses. Though face coverings may become one of the most commonly used controls on mass transportation to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the lack of personal protective equipment specifically designed for young children requires further investigation into control strategies to potentially reduce the spread of COVID-19 among school bus passengers. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential concerns and countermeasures (immediate and long term) to be considered for the safe transportation of children amid the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis by taking into consideration the design of school bus cabins and the anthropometric characteristics of children. COVID-19 mitigation strategies concerning cabin design and busing operations are discussed to provide general recommendations for operating fleets while providing as safe and healthy a passenger environment as possible considering both practicality and cost-effectiveness. The risk of virus transmission among school bus passengers may be reduced by adhering to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, and additional bus specific considerations such as structured loading and unloading criteria, face coverings guidelines, incorporation of a bus monitor, and potential modifications/design changes for existing/future school buses. Several controls being used to protect passengers from virus transmission in other modes of mass transportation could also have the potential for immediate incorporation into school buses.",2590-1982,Not found

The purpose of this paper is to explore a potential relationship between United States residents’ daily trips by distance and the COVID-19 infections in the near future. The study used the daily travel data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and the COVID-19 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. Time-series forecast models using Autoregressive Moving Average (ARIMA) method were constructed to project future trends of United States residents’ daily trips by distance at the national level from November 30, 2020, to February 28, 2021. A comparative trend analysis was conducted to detect the patterns of daily trips and the spread of COVID-19 during that period. The results revealed a closed loop scenario, in which the residents’ travel behavior dynamically changes based on their risk perception of COVID-19 in an infinite loop. A detected lag in the travel behavior between short trips and long trips further worsens the situation and creates more difficulties in finding an effective solution to break the loop. The study shed new light on efforts to contain and control the spread of the coronavirus. The loop can only be broken with proper and prompt mitigation strategies to reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems and save more lives.",2590-1982,Not found
Optimal competitive pricing in European port container terminals: A game-theoretical framework,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100287,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Containers’ handling in dedicated port terminals correspond to a highly competitive market where pricing strategies play a decisive role in their economic and operational performance. For that reason, the formation of an appropriate pricing strategy should follow a thorough methodological treatment supporting policy-making and state-of-the-practice. In the current paper, such a methodological framework is developed and applied to a realistic system, incorporating the concept of pricing differentiation among competing container port facilities. Such an approach may identify pricing strategies that significantly differ from the marginal cost pricing practice, typically adopted by the majority of port authorities. As so, the proposed framework uses elements from non-cooperative game theory and equilibrium network design, enabling its application in realistic large-scale cases. Two distinctive instances are analysed in an additive manner, (a) one simplified case demonstrating the properties of the methodological framework and (b) a generalized case reflecting the market of European container terminals. Moreover, optimal pricing strategies are estimated by two distinctive game formats: a strategic/matrix form of discrete strategies and a continuous game form, each confirmatory of the other. The results provide evidence of the pricing opportunities associated with ports’ geographical location especially in relation with the demand profiles manifested in such spatially separated markets.",2590-1982,Not found
Understanding the formation of rubbernecking queues on urban freeways,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100266,9,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Rubbernecking on freeways is a common problem that arises when queuing traffic develops in the opposite direction of a freeway incident. The goals of this study are to evaluate the effects of rubbernecking on traffic, investigate incident and freeway characteristics associated with it, evaluate rubbernecking models, and analyze drivers’ behavior in relationship to rubbernecking. To this end, traffic data around a major incident were analyzed. Results revealed that rubbernecking can instigate significant queue lengths, congestion durations, and traffic delays. In addition, analysis of 637 incidents revealed that 12% of incidents instigated rubbernecking queues. A logistic regression model was also fitted to the data. Results from the model suggest that on-ramps, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, and percent of trucks are factors associated with rubbernecking. In addition, validation analyses of rubbernecking models pointed to limitations of estimated statistical models in effectively predicting rubbernecking events. Furthermore, results from a drivers’ behavior self-reporting survey suggest that a majority of drivers tend to decrease their speed around an incident in the opposite direction of traffic. It was also observed that respondents attributed these actions to habits and behavior more frequently than incident and freeway characteristics. Findings from this work can be used to help develop targeted rubbernecking traffic control measures, enhance rubbernecking data collection methods and modeling, and advance behavioral interventions to reduce the onset of rubbernecking queues on freeways.",2590-1982,Not found

However, existing research is so far limited concerning studies to what extent CEPs impact and contribute to urban road traffic, particularly in comparison with other commercial sectors and passenger cars. In response, collecting data through an extensive empirical survey, counting urban road traffic in the city of Vienna in Austria, this paper identifies the share of CEPs and other selected categories of road vehicles. Results show that the share of CEPs in urban road traffic consists of merely 0.8 per cent, while the delivery vans’ share of craftsmen/technicians is almost eight times bigger with 6.0 per cent. Overall, delivery vehicles comprise 13.5 per cent of the total urban road traffic in Vienna, thus policies to reduce traffic should include not only other commercial sectors, but should also focus on passenger cars comprising the majority with 86.5 per cent of total urban road traffic.

Previous studies examined their effect on spatial knowledge predominantly on pedestrians or in virtual environments. Drivers' spatial knowledge was experimentally compared in two random groups: audiovisual route guidance using the TBT navigation feature of the Google Maps app installed on a mobile phone, and a paper map. Participants drove their own vehicles to a predesignated destination in an unfamiliar residential neighborhood. Spatial knowledge tests (orientation, landmark recognition and route recognition) were subsequently administered. The scores of map-assisted drivers were uncorrelated and, on average, higher in orientation (deviation in direction), landmark recognition and route recognition (error percentage). The landmark recognition scores of drivers assisted by TBT route guidance were significantly lower with a very large effect size. The route recognition scores of drivers assisted by route guidance showed strong correlations with orientation and with landmark recognition scores. Results can be attributed to the differences in cognitive effort required to complete the wayfinding task: unlike memorizing a global map survey, passively following TBT audiovisual instructions does not require drivers to actively encode, transform, and continuously monitor their egocentric position in space. Drivers also showed somewhat poorer performance relative to studies with pedestrians which can be explained by the greater mental effort, compared to wandering on foot, involved in wayfinding while safely driving a rapidly moving vehicle. The future implications of the increasing dependence on mobile navigation technologies are further discussed.",2590-1982,Not found

The study also revealed that male peers were more likely to encourage speeding, while family members, employers, and enforcement agencies were the important others who will disapprove of it.

Safety and experience of other drivers while interacting with automated vehicle platoons,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100381,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"It is currently unknown how automated vehicle platoons will be perceived by other road users in their vicinity. This study explores how drivers of manually operated passenger cars interact with automated passenger car platoons while merging onto a highway, and how different inter-vehicular gaps between the platooning vehicles affect their experience and safety. The study was conducted in a driving simulator and involved 16 drivers of manually operated cars. Our results show that the drivers found the interactions mentally demanding, unsafe, and uncomfortable. They commonly expected that the platoon would adapt its behavior to accommodate a smooth merge. They also expressed a need for additional information about the platoon to easier anticipate its behavior and avoid cutting-in. This was, however, affected by the gap size; larger gaps (30 and 42.5 m) yielded better experience, more frequent cut-ins, and less crashes than the shorter gaps (15 and 22.5 m). A conclusion is that a short gap as well as external human–machine interfaces (eHMI) might be used to communicate the platoon’s intent to “stay together”, which in turn might prevent drivers from cutting-in. On the contrary, if the goal is to facilitate frequent, safe, and pleasant cut-ins, gaps larger than 22.5 m may be suitable. To thoroughly inform such design trade-offs, we urge for more research on this topic.",2590-1982,Not found

This paper explores how driving style properties – as a type of tangible attribute – are perceived by users, and how they affect users’ interpretations of AVs. 18 participants experienced a seemingly fully automated vehicle on a test track and were interviewed regarding the experience, both during and after. The findings show that the participants noticed most driving style properties but to different degrees, and that participants assigned four groups of intangible attributes: functionality attributes, ability, awareness, and character, where the last three represent higher-order attributes. These intangible attributes were directly affected by the driving style properties but was also formed by a chain of assigned intangible attributes. The findings also indicate two major themes of attributes which users perceive when experiencing an AV: the vehicle’s capability and the consideration it shows towards its occupants and other road users. Because users assign attributes regarding capability and consideration, it is important to take into account that the vehicle is perceived in both these respects already in the early development stages, including in the vehicle’s control algorithm development.",2590-1982,Not found

The focus of this research was to study the behavior of travelers with multiple trip objectives when they are provided real-time information, and assess their ability to determine “optimal” routing policies, compared to exact solutions based on the online shortest path problem. A web-based experiment was carried out to simulate a traffic network with limited information provision. The decision strategies of participants were analyzed and compared to a variety of decision policies established in the literature – optimal, greedy, and a priori – and a general model to describe the observed travelers’ decision strategies was calibrated from over 40,000 decision points extracted from the collected data.

"Understanding the relations between crowd density, safety perception and risk-taking behavior on train station platforms: A case study from Switzerland",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100390,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Railway platforms are becoming increasingly crowded, especially at peak hours. In this observational study, we investigated how the density of people is perceived by passengers and how this perceived density correlates with safety perception and risk-taking behavior. Risk-taking behavior here means stepping into the danger zone, the area of the platform bordering the tracks where individuals are at risk to their physical integrity by a train passing through, arriving at or leaving the station. The investigation of perceived density and actual behavior on the platform poses methodological challenges. Therefore, we used a stereo sensor technology to collect anonymized behavioral data on a train station platform over two months. Data regarding passenger density and oversteps into the danger zone was collected during rush hours and analyzed for this study. Additionally, subjective data, such as estimation and perception of passenger density and safety perception were collected in a survey with 179 participants. Survey links were distributed during rush hours in three different train stations on platforms over two weeks. While distributing the links for the online survey in the field (two-hour sessions during rush hours), an observation was conducted (i.e., oversteps into the danger zone, general passenger behavior). The results indicate that increased measured passenger density is related to more oversteps. Subjective perception of crowd density, regarding how comfortable someone feels in the given situation, correlates with safety perception and also significantly predicts overstepping into the danger zone. Increased estimated density also correlates with reduced safety perception but is not a predictor of oversteps. We suggest optimizing the passenger distribution on the platform by motivating passengers to move to less crowded areas, e.g. with approaches such as “nudging” so that passengers feel more comfortable on the platform. This can both improve both safety and the customer experience on the platform.",2590-1982,Not found
An overview of the impact of COVID-19 on the cruise industry with considerations for Florida,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100391,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper provides an overview of the current state of the world’s cruise industry, with a focus on the chronology and the main impacts that the COVID-19 has had on the industry. Florida is presented as a micro context of the pandemic’s impacts on the local economies of cruise-dependent regions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the many infected ships in the first quarter of 2020, the entire cruise industry was stopped and a prohibition on resuming this industry was impose worldwide. This paper presents some of the consequences of stopping the cruise industry and the recommended protocols for resuming. Due to the dramatic impacts on the entire industry, some cruise lines are trying to resume despite the fact that the COVID-19 is not yet under control. The first aim of this paper is to cover the cruise industry and its importance for society, introduce the main facts of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the correlation between cruise ships and the spread of this disease. The second aim is to present the new pattern to resume the cruise industry and its challenges.",2590-1982,Not found
Impact of political and market-based measures on aviation emissions and passenger behaviors (a Swiss case study),10.1016/j.trip.2021.100405,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The global aviation industry has been increasingly urged to reduce their CO2 emissions. To achieve this, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have successfully adopted various operational, technological, and air traffic management/infrastructural measures. However, they have also implemented market-based regulatory measures, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Additionally, regional measures, such as the Europeanemission trading system (ETS), nationwide political measures, such as flight taxes, and compensation programs by airlines also exist. Therefore, this study surveyed the impact of such measures, primarily on business travelers and their behavior, with a focus on Switzerland. Additionally, not only the impact of the first-last mile (airport access) was discussed, but also intermodal aspects like high-speed rails were debated. Results indicated that flight tax programs were found to have a weak impact on demand. The impact of COVID-19 was addressed and decreased travel frequency from COVID-19 may impact global flight emissions in the long term. Furthermore, passengers supported investments of flight-tax revenues in sustainable aviation technology; they did not support flight contingents. Conclusions are that taxes might generate additional airport traffic. An analysis about booking behaviors revealed fundamental differences in environmental terms. Finally, voluntary compensation was highly favored.",2590-1982,Not found
"Autonomy loss, privacy invasion and data misuse as psychological barriers to peer-to-peer collaborative car use",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100403,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The present study aimed to identify psychological barriers which potentially prevent individuals from implementing collaborative car use in their every-day mobility behaviour. We suggested a model consisting of four psychological barriers: Autonomy Loss, Privacy Invasion, Interpersonal Distrust, and Data Misuse. Perceived Financial Benefit was included as a main incentive for collaborative car use. Using two samples, a community (N = 176) and a student sample (N = 265), three forms of peer-to-peer collaborative car use were examined: lending your own car to another private person (Lending To), renting a car from another private person (Renting From) and sharing rides with others (Ridesharing). For all three forms, a standardised questionnaire was developed which included the psychological barriers, self-reported collaborative car use intention and behaviour, and evaluations of scenarios. The results showed that different barriers predicted specific forms of collaborative car use: Autonomy Loss was connected negatively with Ridesharing and Privacy Invasion predicted Lending To negatively. Data Misuse was related negatively with Renting From, when the renting was arranged via internet. Interpersonal Distrust showed no predictive value for collaborative car use. Perceived Financial Benefit was a consistent incentive for all forms of collaborative car use. Overall, the results confirm the relevance of psychological barriers for collaborative car use. Practical implications to overcome the psychological barriers are discussed.",2590-1982,Not found

The current approaches for designing the needed infrastructure for such operations are not comprehensive. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the basis and the use of an integral methodology for defining better loading/unloading bays in terms of location, capacity and number. The methodology is used in a congested Mexican medium size city: Queretaro. The procedure consists of several steps that start with the modeling of the freight generation in order to build scenarios under micro-simulation techniques, thus creating a potential solution under the consideration of such infrastructure as service areas. Having as inputs the number of attracted local freight trips; the commercial activity needs; the types of vehicles, and the geometry of the streets, the output from such procedure consists of a proposal for the ideal of such infrastructure in terms of its location, size and number. The use of such methodology could become a valuable tool for planners and practitioners in the field of urban logistics, to better manage the delivery of goods and the urban space in congested areas, further mitigating the nuisances due to urban freight.",2590-1982,Not found
Can mobility on demand bridge the first-last mile transit gap? Equity implications of Los Angeles’ pilot program,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100396,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Transit agencies and advocates see removing or bridging the first-last mile gap as an important way to increase transit ridership and reduce vehicle use. Some transit agencies see the advent of ride-hail services like Uber and Lyft as an opportunity for a nimble and flexible solution to first-last mile problems able to deliver more riders to and from transit stations. While agencies across the US have piloted such programs, limited evaluation to date means the outcomes of such partnerships remain unknown. Using just over a year of trip data from the Los Angeles Metro Mobility on Demand (MOD) pilot program, we answer two related questions about ride-hailing and transit access: first, do people use ride-hailing to go to and from transit stops? And second, what are the equity implications of such a program? In other words, do such programs boost access to transit among populations historically excluded or underserved by transportation systems? Our findings suggest that the MOD program successfully delivered thousands of riders to and from transit stations during its first year. Whether these rides were delivered to vulnerable groups with limited access to the transit system, however, is less clear. Survey results suggest that compared to transit riders as whole, program users overall were whiter and more likely to own smartphones and have bank accounts. Thus while people are clearly interested and willing to use subsidized ride-hail services to access transit, the program in its current design does not appear to meaningfully increase access for disadvantaged groups. This result may stem more from the design of the pilot itself, as opposed to suggesting the limited potential of ride-hailing more broadly to solve access problems.",2590-1982,Not found
COVID-19 – A window of opportunity for the transition toward sustainable mobility?,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100374,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The mobility sector was one of the sectors most affected by COVID-19 and its political restrictions, with, inter alia a huge drop in mobility behavior due to travel bans, lockdowns, and a reduced need to be mobile. The present study examined the potential of COVID-19 restrictions aiming at containing the spread of the virus to be a window of opportunity for the transition toward sustainable mobility by breaking up strongly habitualized daily and travel mobility behaviors through changes of behavioral contexts. We conducted an online survey in a sample representative for the German population (N = 3092) to study the consequences of the COVID-19 restrictions on Germans’ daily and travel mode choices and on their wishes for future mobility. Furthermore, we examined the moderating effects of Germans’ personal norms to protect the climate on changes in their mobility behavior toward sustainable mobility, both within and beyond the corona pandemic. In line with previous research, the present study shows an overall reduction of mobility across almost all modes of transport for daily and travel mobility during time periods of COVID-19 restrictions compared to pre-COVID-19-times, with different transport modes being affected differently. Our findings additionally point out the relevance of personal norms to protect the climate for the transition toward sustainable mobility behavior. Altogether, the present study provides first empirical evidence for the corona pandemic to represent a window of opportunity for the transition toward sustainable mobility.

Evaluating the performance of highway concessions through public-private partnerships using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making procedure,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100399,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper presents a procedure to assist the analysis of the performance of highway concessions through public-private partnerships with the combined use of quantitative and linguistic variables, differing from the traditional evaluation that uses only quantitative variables in its applications. The proposed procedure uses fuzzy logic to model the linguistic variables that represent the importance of the performance evaluation categories. The procedure was applied in two Brazilian highway concessions through public-private partnerships, the concessionaires AB Nascentes das Gerais (MG-050, BR-491 and BR-265 highways) and Rota dos Coqueiros (PE-024 highway), in which weights were evaluated among the performance evaluation categories from the perspective of specialists in the field of transport engineering. The two highway concessions present the same categories of performance evaluation (that is, operational, environmental, financial and social), facilitating the application of the proposed procedure. The results show that in the evaluation of the specialists there is a tendency to attribute greater importance to the operational category in relation to the other three categories and that the current concession contracts of the two case studies are not the most adequate to present the weights of categories considering the views of experts.",2590-1982,Not found
Establishing the basis for a school bus emergency evacuation time standard,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100389,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Though it is commonly accepted that transporting children by school bus is the safest way to move them to and from school, the frequency of events causing full or partial evacuations each year is relatively unknown. As research demonstrates that the interior of a bus can be completely burned-out in as few as three minutes, it raises the question as to why there is not a federal school bus evacuation time standard in place. The objective of this paper was to present the need of a school bus evacuation time standard that can enhance post-accident school bus passenger safety. Passenger train and commercial aircraft evacuation standards were studied to identify how school bus evacuation standards compare to those of other modes of mass transportation. Considerations for the proposal of an evacuation time standard while focusing on the unique challenges associated with school buses are discussed.",2590-1982,Not found
An estimation of the effects of social distancing measures on transit vehicle capacity and operations,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100398,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The COVID-19 pandemic has a direct impact on public transport operations. In this paper, impacts on transit operations of the physical distancing measures deployed to slow the spread of the virus are analyzed and recommendations are provided. At first, two social distancing optimization solutions are provided in order to keep riders at a safe distance. The first is a discrete optimization that can be used in buses with fixed seats, while the second is a continuous optimization that can be used to distribute riders on a grid and be applied on a bus or subway platform. Assuming that the ridership will eventually go back to its level before the pandemic, the second objective of this research is to address the transit operation parameters that need to be changed in order to serve the pre-COVID ridership level, while respecting the social distancing measures. An O-D distribution has been developed in this paper for New York City (NYC) subway line 1, based on the 2018 NYC Travel Survey conducted by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Five scenarios of physical distancing are simulated and analyzed in this paper: 3ft, 4ft, 5ft, 5.4ft, and 6ft of separation between passengers. The results show the number of additional trains required to accommodate the hypothetical pre-COVID ridership demand while maintaining social distancing. An interesting key finding is that, by decreasing the minimum distance from 6ft to 5.4ft, the number of additional trains required to serve the transit demand drastically decreases and hence more resources are saved.",2590-1982,Not found
Attitude vs. infrastructure: Influences on the intention to overtake bicycle riders,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100397,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) has recently gained some heightened attention in the traffic safety community in predicting risky behavior. On the other hand, infrastructure layout has often been shown to influence road user behavior in direct ways in traffic observations. In an online survey, 108 holders (81% female) of a valid car-driving license reported on their attitude, social norms, and perceived behavioral control towards overtaking bicycle riders with a smaller than legal margin. Additionally, they rated their willingness to overtake a bicycle rider as well as perceived risk for six traffic sketches. In these sketches, infrastructure layout was systematically varied on two dimensions: (1) streets with or without a center-line between directions of travel and (2) streets marked with either a cycle lane, an advisory lane for bicycle riders or none of these. A repeated measures ANOVA with center line and cycling street markings as independent variables and attitude, social norms, and perceived behavioral control as covariates showed that intention to overtake was only influenced by street markings and the interaction of attitude and street markings, showing that intention to overtake was higher with markings than without, and even higher when attitude towards illegally small distances to overtake was more positive. Ratings of risk while overtaking were only influenced by street markings, showing that ratings of risk were lower for any of the marked designs than those without. Data analysis suggests that personal motivations play a far less important role in the intention to overtake bicycle riders with a non-safe distance than infrastructure designs do. Even the judgement of risk for a given situation seems to be influenced by some markings on the street but not by personal motivations.",2590-1982,Not found
Retooling local transportation financing in a new mobility future,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100388,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Federal, state, and local governments in the United States are highly dependent on motor fuel taxes, vehicle registration, licensing, and parking and traffic citation revenue for transportation. The three revolutions of electrification, automation, and sharing pose threats to major revenue sources for transportation. Automation is expected to intensify the trends in revenue started by transportation network companies (TNCs.) Electrification is expected to impact tax receipts from gasoline and diesel. Shared mobility is becoming more common either through individual rides (e.g., UberPool) or sharing use and/or ownership of a vehicle (e.g., ZipCar). Automation and sharing of vehicles through fleets are expected to impact registration, licensing, parking, and citation revenue. This study estimates revenue loss attributed to new mobility and evaluating revenue sources to fund transportation in a new mobility future. In this study, we use case studies of five Oregon cities ranging in size from 10,000 to 500,000 to: 1) describe how transportation is currently funded; 2) identify scenarios of electrification, automation, and sharing; 3) apply scenarios to estimate revenue loss; and 4) describe how revenue loss varies by city revenue structure. We relied on budget data from local government budgets and created a spreadsheet tool to analyze revenue impacts. We base our scenarios on the trends in autonomous vehicles predicted by various industry sources. The results of this study have important consequences for practitioners and policymakers. We recommend that policymakers adopt new revenue streams alongside incentivizing or regulating new technology. Further, we recommend that practitioners collect data and monitor revenue impacts as new technology is adopted.",2590-1982,Not found

The comprehensive timeline of actions taken by governments and public transport providers in Austria and Norway, and their impact on public transport ridership in the first and second waves of the pandemic form the basis of a descriptive study. Comparing the data, a strong negative impact on the public transport patronage in the first wave of the pandemic was found, despite a comparable low number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Furthermore, a smaller impact of the second wave of the pandemic on the ridership was registered. The study provides valuable first insights on how the pandemic affected different settlement types. It also documents, in detail, the measures taken by two distinct European countries to curb the pandemic infection rates and how these actions impacted public transport patronage. The results pointed in the direction of a need for further analysis of aspects such as “fresh fear” and “lingering fear” in relation to the effect of a pandemic on public transport. Data availability limitations show the necessity of upgrading and aligning ridership and ticketing monitoring systems across Europe, to allow for better understanding of pandemic impacts on public transport in a more unified manner.",2590-1982,Not found
A study of the scheduling effect on shared autonomous vehicles adoption,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100394,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Adopting the concept of ridesharing, shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are introduced to provide low-cost and convenient mobility-on-demand services. Previous studies have investigated the trip purposes and user's characteristics in adopting on-demand ride services and SAVs. However, very little attention has been paid on the traveler's trip making decisions, including departure time choice and mode choice. Hence, this study aims to conduct the Revealed Preference (RP) and Stated Preference (SP) surveys and to develop a joint model of mode and departure time choice to determine the contributing factors affecting traveler’s choice decisions, particularly concerning SAV adoption. Both the RP and SP survey suggest that middle-income travelers with an age range between 20 and 39 years are more likely to adopt SAVs. It was found that the travel time and walking time were the two most significant service attributes in SAV adoption. The increase of 10% of SAV travel time and the introduction of 2 min walking time reduce the SAV adoption by 15% and 90%, respectively. In addition to that, the results suggest that the value of schedule delay early (SDE) is much lower than the value of time and schedule delay late (SDL), as more than 80% of travelers prefer to depart early. These findings can be used to further assist in developing dynamic traffic modeling to aid travel demand management (i.e., congestion charging) that involves SAVs adoption.",2590-1982,Not found
A low-cost approach to identify hazard curvature for local road networks using open-source data,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100393,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States. Curvature in local roadways has been identified as one of the most significant factors that lead to fatal crashes. Given the large number of local roads and their relatively low traffic volume - compared with interstates or freeways - most local roads may not receive priorities in the first phase of highway upgrades, and critical locations, e.g., sharp curves (vertical and/or horizontal), in the network may be a deadly threat for both advanced autonomous vehicles and conventional vehicles. Furthermore, identifying local roadway curvatures presents various obstacles, such as high budgets and lack of survey data. To fill this gap, this study offers a low-cost approach to constructing three-dimensional geometric profiles for local roads in a relatively large study area using open-source data. Given these profiles, critical road segments, including extreme horizontal and vertical curves and their combinations, can be identified. This study re-classifies the local road segments into 20 sub-categories based on the calculated vertical grades and curve radii and incorporates those segments into a zero-inflated native binomial model for crash occurrence. Model results showed that grades or curves were associated with decreased crash frequency compared with straight and flat roads. However, segments with larger horizontal curve radii and low grades were found to be associated with increased crash frequency. Further implications are discussed in the paper.",2590-1982,Not found

The survey was in the field from 3 August to 16 September 2020 with purposive sampling. A total of 699 respondents participated, with 444 complete surveys. Key questions we seek to address include: Did cycling activity increase during the pandemic shutdowns? How did cyclists from under-represented groups experience the pandemic lockdowns? The findings are twofold. First, cycling activity increased among most respondents during pandemic lockdowns for exercise and wellbeing, but not for transport. Our survey reports that for respondents the pandemic lockdowns did not result in an uptake of active transport, despite the appearance of ‘pop-up’ cycle lanes. Second, the reduced traffic of the pandemic shutdown period created a particular opportunity for women to ride bikes.

This study cross-linked data from the federal National Register of Historic Places database (and parallel sources at state and local historic registers) with a national data source on transit-oriented development (TOD). Findings revealed that half of all transit station areas (area within a half-mile around fixed-route transit stations) intersect with a federally designated national historic district. Moreover, 15.6% of all transit stations in the United States are located within a historic district, and 9.5% of nationally registered historic buildings are within half-mile of a fixed station. The study also found that more than half of all individually listed historic buildings in station areas were located in stations categorized as TODs. There was also a closer spatial cross-linkage between historic resources in higher density and more transit-oriented New Jersey than in Florida. Thus, there is some spatial relationship between the location of fixed-route transit stations and the location of historic resources, albeit the closeness of this interconnection varies by place. That spatial interconnections evokes consideration of how TOD and historic preservation can be complimentary “good neighbors.”",2590-1982,Not found

The study uses hypothetical scenarios of land use density to analyze transportation demand. A regression model is used to assess the relationship between the generated transport demand from each type of land use, which shows that the land-use type can substantially impact the ridership of a mass transit system. Based on the analysis conducted in this paper, it can be concluded that if ridership in a particular area is to be increased, its development for mixed land use might be a good option.

This study aims to examine the willingness to pay for attributes of different types of electric vehicles and for car sharing in order to derive recommendations for marketing and policy. The representative study is based on a survey of 405 car users in Germany using a discrete choice experiment with the attributes price, power, running costs, bonus, range and availability of charging stations. 12 choice situations were presented to each respondent. A latent class model was used to analyze socio economic determinants of the willingness to pay for single attributes.

Moreover, there is a lack of research on contributing factors by time-of-day. To accomplish this, first a mixed logit model was used to determine statistically significant crash severity contributing factors and their effects. Significant factors in both models included work-zone-specific characteristics and crash-specific characteristics, where environmental characteristics were only significant in the daytime model. In addition, results from parameter transferability test provided evidence that daytime and nighttime crashes need to be modeled separately. Further, to explore the nonlinear relationship between crash severity levels and time-of-day, as well as compare the effects of variables to that of the logit model and assess prediction performance, a Support Vector Machines (SVM) model trained by Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm was utilized. Opening the SVM black-box, a variable impact analysis was also performed. In addition to the characteristics identified in the logit models, the SVM models also included the impacts of vehicle-level characteristics. The variable impact analysis illustrated that the termination area of the work zone is most critical for both daytime and nighttime crashes, as this location has the highest increase in severe injury likelihood. In summary, results of this study demonstrate that work zone crashes need to be modeled separately by time-of-day with a high level of confidence.

Continuous exposure to traffic noise can lead to mental instability and reduce the learning rate of children. Many cases of cardiovascular diseases, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment have been reported as a result of traffic noise. With increasing population of cars, health problems resulting from traffic noise will continue to increase and it is of utmost priority to abate this noise. Noise abatement is one of the most effective strategies in reducing noise level for communities close to roadways, although it is also one of the major cost drivers in highway projects to reduce noise. Extensive noise modeling is required to determine the feasibility of abatement choices; however, traffic noise models usually do not interact with highway geometries in selecting optimized noise abatement options. The Traffic Noise Model (TNM) developed by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) was used to compute highway traffic noise and evaluate the effect of noise abatements. A parametric study was conducted on a total of 23,093 scenarios generated to examine ten major variables influencing roadway noise level. A noise prediction model was developed using multiple regression analysis incorporating parameters such as roadway geometry (horizontal offsets and elevation differences), barrier height, receiver height, traffic volume, roadway section, road-surface material, barrier types, speed and roadway section.

Still, many sketch planning models require extensive data collection/preparation and are overly complicated. This paper discusses an approach for a simple sketch planning method based on a Random Forest (RF) algorithm with a machine learning technique that practitioners may use to predict emissions with significantly short time and effort in data preparation and model execution. In this study, the algorithm is trained to simulate emissions estimates based on multi-year Constrained Long Range Plan (CLRP) data in the National Capital region for eight case studies. The study results showed that the proposed model predicted mobile source nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gas emissions within +/- 10 percent of accuracy against MOVES counterparts with fewer resources in a shorter amount of time.

Studies have shown that pollution from motor vehicles are a major cause. But at least 85% of Africa’s vehicle fleet are used vehicles, some of which are obsolete with outdated technologies. This paper examines the present and future vehicle regulations in various countries in Africa and their effect in curbing used vehicle import, new vehicle sales, and production. The investigation includes providing detailed data for used vehicle import into Africa from 2015 to 2019. The findings show that used vehicle imports continue to increase in countries like Nigeria and Libya. Where present, vehicle standards have neither translated to the increase in purchase nor production of new vehicles anywhere in Africa. The age restriction and ban on used vehicles has not led to an increase in new vehicle sales as many policymakers had hoped for. Growth of used vehicles dropped by 8.6% and new vehicles by 6%. The research discovered that though zero-rated new vehicles equipped with obsolete technology are sold in Africa, the policies have broadly overlooked their impact. Further recommendations have been made on the unified vehicle standards for Africa to adopt.",2590-1982,Not found
Predictor variables influencing merging speed change lane crash risk by interchange type in urban areas,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100375,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The objective of this research is to model and examine the influence of predictor variables on merging speed change lane crash risk by interchange type in urban areas. Data for selected merging speed change lanes in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, for five-years, were collected and used in this research. Multinomial logistic regression models were developed to examine the risk of getting involved in a fatal or injury crash and property damage only (PDO) crash by interchange type. The findings indicate that merging speed change lanes at multi-lane ramps are safer than single-lane ramps (odds ratio > 50). The ramp average daily traffic (ADT) and the speed difference between the freeway and the ramp influence merging speed change lane crash risk at a cloverleaf interchange while the freeway annual average daily traffic (AADT) and the speed change lane length influence merging speed change lane crash risk at a diamond interchange (odds ratio > 1.4). The risk of getting involved in a fatal-injury crash in the merging speed change lane increases (odds ratio > 1.6) if an upstream or downstream ramp is too close to the subject cloverleaf interchange ramp or if a downstream ramp is too close to the subject diamond interchange ramp. Contrarily, the upstream ramp distance does not influence the merging speed change lane PDO crash risk at a cloverleaf or diamond interchange. It can be concluded that predictor variables influencing the merging speed change lane crash severity risk are different for cloverleaf, diamond, and other interchange types.",2590-1982,Not found
Are multimodal travellers going to abandon sustainable travel for L3 automated vehicles?,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100380,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Reducing car dependency supports the creation of a more sustainable transport system. However, automated vehicles (AVs) are predicted to increase the attractiveness of car travel and decrease the use of public transport and active travel. This current study explored how travellers’ intention to use AVs and their current travel behaviour influence their expectations of how they will use public transport and active travel, once conditionally automated (SAE L3) vehicles (L3 AVs) are available. Survey data (collected during the EU H2020 L3Pilot project) from among current car users from eight European countries (n = 9118) was used. Respondents were asked about their current travel mode usage, intention to use L3 AVs, and expected changes in the use of public transport and active travel once L3 AVs are available. The respondents were divided into nine user segments based on their level of intention to use L3 AVs and multimodality. Most respondents did not foresee changes in their use of public transport (62%) or active travel (67%). A higher intention to use L3 AVs increased the probability of a traveller expecting to decrease their use of public transport and, to a lesser extent, active travel. Multimodal travellers used public transport and active travel regularly and were also more likely to see a change, either up or down, in their use of public transport and active travel. The results suggest that L3 AVs may pose a challenge to the sustainability by encouraging current users of public transport and active travel to switch to personal AVs.",2590-1982,Not found

It is important to consider impact on all types of passengers when contemplating interior design, particularly for vehicles that may be used by families with children. We developed a fixture that enables us to change the orientation of each of 4 car seats and used it to simulate three different vehicle interiors. Ten families with children aged 3 months to 7 years interacted with each of the simulated interiors as part of a usability study. Times to install and remove child restraint systems were not significantly different across the three simulated vehicle interiors, but parents were able to release children fastest when using the “X” configuration, which had all seats on a diagonal facing the middle of the vehicle. While overall experience ratings didn’t differ significantly, seven out of ten parents indicated that they liked the “X” configuration better than the other two configurations tested. Reasons included: ability to interact with other passengers, ability to see the road, and legroom/comfort. However, many participants disliked having some passengers not facing forward. Overall, parents liked facing their children, but several said that they would only be comfortable if they could see out of the front windshield; meanwhile, children liked seeing their parents’ faces but also preferred to face forward.

Data driven methods for effective micromobility parking,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100368,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"In this work, we propose a data-driven method to use proven clustering algorithms for establishing shared electric scooter (SES) parking locations and assessing their anticipated utilization. We first address the problem of finding locations for a given number of parking facilities, based pur0ely on demand, that maximize the number of trips that would likely be parked at these facilities. We then formulate an enhanced version of the SES parking facility problem in which exogenous environmental factors are considered, such as sidewalk width. Parking SESs on narrow sidewalks raises accessibility concerns for other users of this infrastructure and capturing these trips in dedicated parking facilities is a valid priority to trade off with pure demand maximization. These methods are demonstrated in two case studies, which use a large SES dataset from Nashville, Tennessee, USA. We provide empirical results on how many facilities are needed to serve demand of SESs and necessary capacity allocation of the facilities. When the methodology considers sidewalk width in facility placement, the refined parking locations can address 300% more problematic trips parked along narrow sidewalks, with only a nominal sacrifice, around 13%, in the overall number of trips served.",2590-1982,Not found
Smart transport: A comparative analysis using the most used indicators in the literature juxtaposed with interventions in English metropolitan areas,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100371,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The development of smart transport technologies, methods, strategies and infrastructures has drawn much attention in recent years, owing to the rise of smart cities paradigms and the rapid technological advancements in the transport sector. New transport technologies create opportunities and challenges for English cities to move towards a more sustainable and integrated future. Smart governance and interventions in the English metropolitan areas are reviewed to provide a background of the smart city and transport development in the UK. Despite the increasing commercial and political attention, there is still a lack of understanding and proposals for a robust framework to evaluate the smart transport system. It is challenging to build a toolbox that suits both academics and practitioners when developing transport interventions and investments. This paper proposes a comprehensive and up-to-date framework to assess smart transport development in cities. A systematic literature review is conducted to identify the most used indicators and important indices. New indicators that illustrate trending themes are added to the existing toolbox. In total, 49 indicators are listed in this study, including five new ones. We also show several aspects and the overall performance in the new evaluation framework by aggregating indicators into indices in the following groups: 1) private, public and emergency transport indices; 2) accessibility, sustainability and innovation indices; and 3) a composite index. The new evaluation framework is applied in eleven English metropolitan areas. The empirical results show that Greater London has the best development in smart transport, followed by West Midlands and West of England. The findings can provide useful insights for metropolitan authorities and their transport authorities when key devolution strategies are in place and substantial investment packages are considered.",2590-1982,Not found
Performance assessment of high capacity trucks: Understanding truck selection and deployment economics,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100363,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"High capacity trucks (HCT) present an interesting opportunity to improve transportation efficiency and reduce emissions. This study focuses on implementation in Finland where legislation allows a maximum weight of 76 tonnes, 34.5 m length and 4.4 m height, which would be a 20% and 4.5% increase in weight and height compared to the current European modular system. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the economic performance (cost and revenue) of such high capacity transportation vehicles compared to traditional smaller trucks. Data has been collected from real transport logistics service providers. A performance evaluation model called COREPE was designed to present quantitative evaluation of one year of operating data: this model evaluates the economic performance of HCT and traditional trucks on three different long hauls using telemetry data and monthly truck operating data. The results show that HCT has overall higher cost compared to traditional. The size advantage HCT has over traditional translated into moderately higher revenue and profitability based on the available data.

Applying optimization algorithms for spatial estimation of travel demand variables,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100369,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Using spatial statistics techniques is a way to improve the forecast of travel demand variables considering their spatial dependence. The semivariogram is a proper geostatistic tool for represent the spatial structure of a Regionalized Variable. Therefore, the semivariogram modeling is a fundamental step and is often done visually, based on data knowledge and researchers’ experience, as well as taking into account automatic criteria, such as weighted least squares function. Moreover, these automatic procedures generally assume that data distribution is Gaussian. This research aims to evaluate the combined use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and geostatistical methods to forecast travel demand variables, in order to optimize the calculation and fitting of semivariograms. Car Trip rates and Income by household were estimated using the GA application in variographic models, and therefore enabled us to obtain numerous semivariogram parameters. Consequently, intervals of the most frequent parameters were obtained and those with better performance (based on the fitness value) were chosen to carry out the modeling procedure using geostatistical software. The geostatistical modeling optimization procedure, proposed in this study, was validated considering not only a non spatial model (traditional Linear Regression) but also a different spatial approach, the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The validation was carried out using a bivariate example. Thus, the procedure enabled us to compute and fit semivariograms more accurately, contributing to knowledge about spatial structure and variographic parameters related to almost optimal solutions. It is important to consider that the code developed from this article is available for applications in other knowledge areas with spatial dependence data.",2590-1982,Not found
Car access and travel behaviour among men and women in car deficient households with children,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100367,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Household car ownership does not necessarily reflect the access to use car, especially if there are more licenced household members than cars in the household. The research questions are: 1) Do men and women aged 18–64 years with driving licence and living in households with at least two adults, children and a car state the access to use a car as a driver in their trips differently? 2) How much do these men and women use car and other modes in their trips in relation to stated access to a car as a driver? 3) How does the stated access to use a car affect the average daily trip frequency, travel time and trip lengths? and 4) Are there differences in household income or work status between men and women aged 18–64 years with driving licence and living in households with at least two adults, children and a car who state the access to use a car as a driver in their trips differently? The results indicate that men have access to the household car more often than women. The stated access to use car is reflected in trip modal share and in some cases trip frequencies, travel time and trip lengths. The results suggest that objective indicators for mobility possibilities, such as car ownership and driving licence ownership, should be supplemented with subjective indicators about mobility options. Beneath the objective indicators may lie groups of people who are measured to have better options for mobility than they actually have.",2590-1982,Not found

Assessing the sustainability of transportation system in a developing city through estimating CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and bio-capacity for vehicular activities,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100361,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The key and fundamental aspects of long-term sustainable urban development are to ensure a sustainable transport system and mobility. The study assessed the sustainability of the transportation system through using the Emissions and Bio-capacity Index (EBI) approach for a developing city, named Khulna City Corporation which has different public transport modes. Vehicular CO2 emissions, carbon uptake land, and biocapacity of fourteen traffic nodes were estimated for identifying the responses of existing landforms to vehicular CO2 emissions. To calculate net CO2 emissions at specified traffic nodes, traffic volume, fuel-use types, and vehicle travel distance data were utilized. The bio-capacity of the land covers of the selected nodes to absorb vehicular CO2 emissions was calculated by GIS-based Remote Sensing methods. Total vehicular CO2 emissions have been calculated 30232.60 tons/year where 50.71% emits from Mahindra. Six of the fourteen nodes had very lower EBI values, corresponding to a higher level of CO2 emissions and low biocapacity which have been considered unsustainable as future traffic nodes. The use of vehicles capable of carrying fewer people, excessive trip generation, inadequate public transport options, narrow road-width, and declination of bio-productive areas are found mainly responsible for unsustainability. The recommended policies will help the urban managers and policymakers to build a sound and sustainable urban environment by controlling emissions.",2590-1982,Not found
Evaluating heavy metals emission’ pattern on road influenced by urban road layout,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100362,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Road traffic sector comprises a small percentage of urban land uses while acts as a sink of pollutants among which heavy metals such as, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb are often found in elevated concentrations influenced by urban road layout in addition to traffic volumes and are found hazardous due to their persistent and low degradation nature. This study aims to evaluate heavy metals of Zn, Cu, Ni and Pb in road deposited sediment (RDS) and tree leaf sediment (TLS) influenced by typical urban road layout taking a road section in Chittagong city, Bangladesh. The RDS and TLS at different sites were collected using dry sweeping and then were air dried in a controlled environment at the laboratory. The samples were then sieved through 75 µm size. The selected heavy metal concentrations in RDS and TLS were determined using ICE spectrophotometer followed by strong nitric acid digestion. The different statistical analyses, e.g., correlation analysis, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were carried out to explore the source appointment, interdependences, significant differences in metal concentrations among the selected sites. The mean concentrations of the heavy metals are found in the order of Zn > Cu > Pb > Ni with their magnitude of 160, 36, 30 and 11.5 mg kg−1, respectively, across the site and sampling types. The RDS and TLS are found substantially enriched, having enrichment factor range 1.13 to 1.83 than their respective background values indicating anthropogenic input in the samples illustrating emission from the road traffic environment. In general, the higher metal concentrations are found in TLS than in RDS with considerable variability exist among the sites. Considering the heavy metal induced pollution level, the sites rank is in the order of controlled intersection > road bend > road with speed control > uncontrolled intersection > straight road section > bus stop > uncontrolled intersection with flyover site. These results highlighting site specific characteristics notably with traffic volume and traffic movement pattern influenced by stop-start phenomenon linked to a typical urban road lay out design.

Super-tailoring: Using self-persuasion to reduce drivers’ car use,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100359,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Car use is a common travel mode in many societies but it has negative impacts on the environment and public health. There have been various interventions to reduce car use but self-persuasion has not been tested as a potential intervention. Self-persuasion involves asking people to generate arguments in favour of a specific issue. Our goal was to investigate the effectiveness of self-persuasion in changing drivers’ car use attitudes and behaviours. A sample of New Zealand drivers (n = 183) completed two online questionnaires; one immediately after and one at least 2 weeks after the intervention. We randomly assigned the drivers to one of three conditions: self-persuasion (generating arguments on the benefits of reducing car use), direct-persuasion (reading arguments on the benefits of reducing car use), and control (completing a different travel-related task). There were no significant differences between the three groups of drivers on car use intentions for commuting trips, weekly car use for commuting and non-commuting trips, or attitudes towards reducing car use. We attributed the ineffectiveness of self-persuasion to the average quality of arguments generated, the effortful nature of reducing car use, and the COVID-19 situation in New Zealand. Although self-persuasion may not be an appropriate intervention in the travel behaviour domain, future research needs to continue identifying new ways to reduce car use to reduce its detrimental effects.",2590-1982,Not found
Japan and the UK: Emission predictions of electric and hydrogen trains to 2050,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100344,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Electric trains (ETs) and hydrogen trains (HTs) offer an opportunity for both Japan and the UK to meet their national targets as part of the Paris Agreement. Although ETs and HTs are considered zero emission at the point of use, their true environmental impact is dependent upon non-tailpipe emissions from fuel/energy production and vehicle manufacture, maintenance and disposal. To assess and compare the carbon dioxide emissions produced from ETs and HTs in Japan and the UK from 2020 and 2050, the operating emissions of these trains were projected. Results compared ET and HT emissions with diesel fuelled trains (DFTs) to better assess which fuel type was the most environmentally friendly. Emissions per train, cumulative emissions and total energy required for ETs and HTs were compared. Results indicated that even with technological improvements, DD DFTs produced the highest level of emissions in both countries, followed by HTs. Although ETs produced the lowest level of emissions, it is likely that a mix of both ETs and HTs will be required to meet passenger demand and for travel within rural areas. As Japan has already transitioned towards ETs, future policy focus should be placed on decarbonisation of their energy sector and a shift away from fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy, otherwise environmental benefits of ETs will be diminished. As the UK is decarbonising its electricity network, focus needs to be placed on electrifying the majority of the rail network and running the rest on hydrogen to decarbonise rail transport.",2590-1982,Not found

Using the Residential location choice theory, which assumes that household's demand for travel and housing is derived by their location choice. While choosing a location the monetary calculus of rent and commuting cost also play an important role in deciding to choose where to live, as there is a trade-off between rent and commuting cost in the monocentric city model. Results of comparative static suggest that transport accessibility to the house will lead to an increase in house rent and demand for housing in that area. Moreover, due to availability of transport, in the form of a diverse choice of frequent and affordable public transport, increases the travel demand as the commuting cost will be significantly reduced. Similarly, the effect of income on the commuting cost and house rent shows that due to the rise in income, commuting cost and house rent will increase.

Mining crowdsourced data on bicycle safety critical events,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100360,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Cycling has become a popular transportation mode for short term trips. Due to the high exposure bicycle trips, the number of collisions and near miss events has been increasing significantly. This study explores the pattern of the bicycle-related collision or near miss events by using a unique crowdsourced dataset collected from BikeMaps.org. The dataset not only contains near miss events, which are not included in the conventional state-maintained crash databases, and it also includes the psychological impact of the event on the cyclist. The taxicab correspondence analysis (TCA) results reveal patterns for bike-related collision or near miss events and associated impact on the cyclists involved. Several factors such as inclement weather, windy condition, poor lighting conditions, wet ground, loose sand, or dirt pavement are associated with the increasing probability of the collision or near-miss events. The study indicates that collision or near miss events have a greater impact on cyclists if the events occurred when cyclists already have taken extra caution while cycling. These cyclists tend to cycle less and be more careful after these events. Interestingly, the results find that frequent cyclists are not psychologically affected by collisions occurred during recreational trips. The finding of this study could help researchers further understand bike collisions/near miss events and provide better countermeasures to mitigate the frequency of bike collisions.",2590-1982,Not found
Dueling emergencies: Flood evacuation ridesharing during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100352,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Volunteered sharing of resources is often observed in response to disaster events. During evacuations the sharing of resources and vehicles is a crucial mechanism for expanding critical capacity and enabling inclusive disaster response. This paper examines the complexity of rideshare decision-making in the wake of simultaneous emergencies. Specifically, the need for physical distancing measures during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic complicates face-to-face resource sharing between strangers. The ability of on-demand ridesharing to provide emergency transportation to individuals without access to alternatives calls for an understanding of how evacuees weigh risks of contagion against benefits of spontaneous resource sharing. In this research, we examine both sociodemographic and situational factors that contribute to a willingness to share flood evacuation rides with strangers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that the willingness to share is significantly correlated with traditional emergency resource sharing motivations and current COVID-19 risk factors. To test these hypotheses, we distributed an online survey during the pandemic surge in July 2020 to 600 individuals in three midwestern and three southern states in the United States with high risk of flooding. We estimate a random parameter multinomial logit model to determine the willingness to share a ride as a driver or passenger. Our findings show that willingness to share evacuation rides is associated with individual sociodemographics (such as being female, under 36 years old, Black, or republican-identifying) and the social environment (such as households with children, social network proximity, and neighborly sharing attitudes). Moreover, our findings suggest higher levels of income, COVID-19 threat perception, evacuation fear, and household preparedness all correspond with a lower willingness to share rides. We discuss the broader implications of emergency on-demand mobility during concurrent disasters to formulate strategies for transportation agencies and on-demand ridehailing providers.",2590-1982,Not found

Legal requirements differ between vehicle types and, for bicycle lighting, also between countries. So far, in spite of some indications, there is no definite evidence of a relationship between crashes involving cyclists and darkness, nor on the presence of bicycle lighting and crash risk in darkness, possibly due to a lack of prevalence data. There are no standards for scientific or consumer testing of bicycle lights, and visibility-related results are inconclusive. Three test methods were employed to evaluate generic bicycle light features such as beam shape, brightness, steady versus flashing beam, and mounting position for their effects on seeing and being seen, while investigating which method was best suited for which type of evaluation. In static indoor laboratory testing, brightness was measured and beam shape documented photographically. In static outdoor testing, visibility from 300 m was evaluated, subjective ratings were collected, and beam shape documented. Three front-light beam types were then evaluated for their effect on gap acceptance in a dynamic setting in an urban environment, and subjective ratings were collected. All 18 tested lamps fulfilled the legal requirements, with a bright, steady front beam receiving the highest subjective ratings. Gap acceptance was influenced only by cyclist speed, but neither by beam type nor mounting position. To capture the effect of generic bicycle light features on perception, behaviour, and acceptance, one single method is not enough, and standardised laboratory tests should be combined with research-question–specific dynamic testing.",2590-1982,Not found
Who lives in transit-friendly neighborhoods?

In particular, we explore the relationship between high-propensity transit users – who we define here as members of households classified as poor, immigrant, African-American, and without private vehicles – and high-transit-propensity places – which are neighborhoods that regularly host high levels of transit service or use. As housing costs have increased dramatically in California and neighborhoods change, many planners and transit advocates reasonably worry that in transit-friendly neighborhooods, lower-propensey transit users may replace residents who tend to ride transit frequently. Such changes in residential patterns could help to explain sharp transit ridership declines in California in the 2010s ahead of much sharper pandemic-related ridership losses in 2020. Indeed, we find that California’s most transit-friendly neighborhoods have changedin ways that do not bode well for transit use. The state's shares of poor, immigrant, African American, and zero-vehicle households have all declined modestly to substantially since 2000. Collectively, these trends point to changes in California’s most transit-friendly neighborhoods that are not very, well, transit-friendly.",2590-1982,Not found

The simulation results highlight the need to reduce the negative environmental impact produced by the aviation sector and suggest that policymakers should try to focus on creating ways to reduce the impact made by the aviation industry on the environment, through a coordinated environmental policy between countries, including the three that are the subject of the present case study in order to highlight these issues.",2590-1982,Not found
Relationship between Internet use and out-of-home activities during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100343,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Following the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Japanese government announced the declaration of a state of emergency in April 2020, which aimed to decrease contact between people and requested that residents refrain from outings. Even in the absence of penalties, outings decreased under the declaration. We are interested in how outings declined and studied the substitution relationship between Internet use and outings. A web-based survey was conducted to collect data on Internet use and outings in a retrospective manner. The period covered by our data is from mid-February to mid-May 2020. Multilevel analysis and binomial logistic regression analysis were performed to examine the relationship between Internet use and outings. The results clearly show that Internet use replaced outings. In particular, Internet use for socializing, exercise, and leisure/entertainment had a strong substitution relationship with outings. Internet use for socializing and leisure/entertainment was also associated with refraining from visiting restaurants. In contrast, there was a weak substitution relationship between Internet use for daily shopping and outings. Although telework tends to be an accepted focus of Internet use under the COVID-19 outbreak, it should not be overlooked that other uses of the Internet, such as for leisure/entertainment, also supported the decline in outings.",2590-1982,Not found
Bike share responses to COVID-19,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100353,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Bike sharing can leverage its physical distancing advantages for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, but system management and communication are essential to support healthy transportation. This study addresses the need to understand the range of bike share systems’ responses to the pandemic by reviewing bike share system cases in the United States and reports survey responses from bike share users in San Antonio (TX). Five out of eleven bike share systems communicated their responses to the pandemic online at the time of review. 43% of survey respondents who were unemployed due to the pandemic reported increasing use of the bike share system, whereas 36% of employed respondents decreased ridership. Most respondents were unaware of the bike share operator’s steps to control the spread of COVID-19 for users. Moderate-frequency riders (1–2 times per month) may increase bike sharing the most after Coronavirus restrictions are lifted, from 22% of respondents to 34%. Based on our findings, we suggest bike share operators should expand communication efforts about policies and actions to support community health, explore how to serve unemployed and low-income communities best, and prepare for the equitable expansion of ridership following the pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found
"COVID-19 lockdown measures and travel behavior: The case of Thessaloniki, Greece",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100345,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"In this paper, we investigate the travel behavior changes in Thessaloniki, Greece aiming to understand them and explore the factors that affect them under the COVID-19 mobility restriction measures. Socioeconomic and mobility data from two questionnaire surveys, one year before and during the COVID-19 lockdown of April 2020 (with 1462 and 196 responses respectively), were compared by utilizing a wide variety of inductive statistical tests. Ordinary Least-Squares regression models and Cox proportional hazards duration models were employed to explore any concurrent socioeconomic effect on travel behavior patterns. Results showed that the number of daily trips per person was on average decreased by 50% during the lockdown. This decrease was much greater for the non-commuting trips. Trips on foot were increased, private car was mainly used for commuting and public transport modal shares were heavily reduced. Trip durations were generally increased, as travelling was considered a recreational activity per se. The starting times of the first trips of the day were more evenly distributed throughout the day and many travelers only started their first trips late in the afternoon. Older travelers generally maintained their mobility behavior patterns despite their higher vulnerability to COVID-19 disease. Lower-income travelers were likely to make more daily trips. Male travelers tended to make higher-duration trips compared to their female counterparts. Since pandemics may become recurring events in the future, our findings provide for a better understanding of their influence on mobility and support the design of customized policies to fulfill sustainable mobility objectives during lockdown circumstances.",2590-1982,Not found
COVID-19 and social distancing: Disparities in mobility adaptation between income groups,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100333,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments have encouraged and ordered citizens to practice social distancing, particularly by working and studying at home. Intuitively, only a subset of people have the ability to practice remote work. However, there has been little research on the disparity of mobility adaptation across different income groups in US cities during the pandemic. The authors worked to fill this gap by quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income in Greater Houston, Texas. We determined human mobility using pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. A longitudinal study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring the total travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip distance in April 2020 compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent disparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular, there was a strong negative correlation (ρ = −0.90) between a traveler’s estimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility adaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic. The study illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and researchers alike in the wake of an epidemic.",2590-1982,Not found

A case study from Tampere, Finland",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100348,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The COVID-19 epidemic has created unforeseen effects in public transport in cities around the world, including Tampere, where a 70% decrease in the number of passengers occurred in spring 2020. The purpose of this paper is to study changes in public transport ridership, frequencies, and average fill rates during the epidemic in May 2020 compared to normal circumstances in January 2020 using map-based analysis. We used data provided by Tampere regional transport to create the public transport network and to assess the frequencies, ridership and average fill rates in different areas of Tampere. The paper presents the method used to analyze how the modified frequencies meet the decreased demand of public transport in Tampere. These results indicate that the decrease in ridership was great in almost all areas, except some eastern parts of Tampere. The frequencies were decreased in all areas but kept at a sufficient level. When analyzing fill rates, we found that the bus lines coming from east of Tampere were more crowded on average during the COVID-19 epidemic in May compared to January. In other areas, fill rates were lower. The results suggest that in Tampere, frequencies were mostly managed to maintain at a sufficient service level. However, the analyses also reveal that frequencies were not adjusted successfully in all areas with high fill rates in some routes. It is important to notice, that the public transport planners were facing a deviant situation with COVID-19 and that in future, there will be more information to help decision-making.",2590-1982,Not found
How is the COVID-19 pandemic shaping transportation access to health care?,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100338,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted both transportation and health systems. While about 40% of Americans have delayed seeking medical care during the pandemic, it remains unclear to what extent transportation is contributing to missed care. To understand the relationship between transportation and unmet health care needs during the pandemic, this paper synthesizes existing knowledge on transportation patterns and barriers across five types of health care needs. While the literature is limited by the absence of detailed data for trips to health care, key themes emerged across populations and settings. We find that some patients, many of whom already experience transportation disadvantage, likely need extra support during the pandemic to overcome new travel barriers related to changes in public transit or the inability to rely on others for rides. Telemedicine is working as a partial substitute for some visits but cannot fulfill all health care needs, especially for vulnerable groups. Structural inequality during the pandemic has likely compounded health care access barriers for low-income individuals and people of color, who face not only disproportionate health risks, but also greater difficulty in transportation access and heightened economic hardship due to COVID-19. Partnerships between health and transportation systems hold promise for jointly addressing disparities in health- and transportation-related challenges but are largely limited to Medicaid-enrolled patients. Our findings suggest that transportation and health care providers should look for additional strategies to ensure that transportation access is not a reason for delayed medical care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found

Worldwide mandates to slow down the spread of the disease resulted in significant reductions in travel. This study analyzes the changes in individuals’ travel outcomes and their risk perceptions related to exposure and specific travel modes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use data collected through an online survey with residents of Columbus, OH from April 30 to May 7, 2020. Employing multiple generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a logit link function, we analyze the perceived risk of infection while traveling with different modes controlling for socio-demographics. The findings show that on average individuals are more likely to find shared modes (i.e., transit, ride-hailing, carsharing) riskier as compared to individual ones (i.e., walking, autos) when it comes to COVID-19 exposure. This study also suggests that the associations between perceptions related to exposure and various travel modes vary across groups with (1) different primary mode preferences (auto users vs non-auto users (e.g., transit users, bicyclists, etc.)), and (2) different socio-demographics. For example, auto users are more likely to find shared modes such as ride-hailing or transit riskier as compared to personal car. The conclusions present recommendations for future transportation policies in the post-COVID era. These include building upon the emerging positive perceptions towards non-motorized modes as an opportunity to promote sustainable transportation as well as formulating viable solutions to address the high-risk perceptions associated with transit.",2590-1982,Not found
"COVID-19 and Travel: How Our Out-of-home Travel Activity, In-home Activity, and Long-Distance Travel Have Changed",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100350,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"COVID-19 has made unprecedented impacts on our daily life. This paper investigates individuals’ immediate response to COVID-19, exploring out-of-home activities, in-home activities, and long-distance travel. Data for the Kelowna region of Canada comes from a web-based COVID−19 Survey for assessing Travel impact (COST). In addition to analyzing the survey, this research models adjustments in travel decisions by developing ordered logit models for in-home and out-of-home activities, and a binomial logit model for long-distance travel. Data analysis suggests a reduction of about 50% out-of-home activities/day/person during COVID-19 compared to the pre-pandemic period, with the only exception being picking up online orders which significantly increased in frequency. Individuals were engaged in longer duration of in-home activities; the average duration of teleworking, online shopping for groceries and other goods at-home was around 5.5 h/day/person, 32 min/day/person, and 26 min/day/person respectively. The out-of-home activity model results suggest that higher income, younger and middle aged individuals, and full-time workers are more likely to decrease their out-of-home activity; whereas, males, lower income groups, health care professionals, and picking up online orders are more likely to increase. The in-home activity model suggests that older and younger adults, higher and lower income, full-time workers, and highly educated individuals are most likely to increase their in-home activity frequency; in contrast, health care professionals are likely to decrease. Long-distance travel model results reveal that seniors, students, and airline travelers are more likely to reschedule; whereas, trips to visit friends and family are more likely to be cancelled.",2590-1982,Not found
Integration of ridesharing with public transport in rural Switzerland: Practice and outcomes,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100340,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Using advanced technologies, ridesharing has transformed transportation in many cities. The effective integration of ridesharing into public transport systems can provide an opportunity for public transport authorities to solve the common problem of rural transport, namely poor accessibility due to the dispersal of the population. However, literature on the integration of ridesharing with public transport is rather scant. At the same time, while ridesharing has been extended to rural communities, so far this has attracted little research. To fill in these gaps, this paper seeks to explore the practice and outcomes of integrating ridesharing with public transport. The analysis is based on a case study of a community-based ridesharing scheme in four rural municipalities in central Switzerland. Using a mixed methods approach, the key findings show the public transport authority designing the integration with a goal to complementing public transport with ridesharing. To achieve this goal, three crucial approaches were adopted: the provision of information on the ridesharing scheme, the integration of ridesharing notice boards into the local bus stop and regional railway station networks; and the price strategies as a means to signify a contractual relationship between rider and driver and to reduce a potential competition. Even though ridesharing use is still only moderate, the authorities are satisfied with the outcome and do not consider cost-effectiveness to be important.",2590-1982,Not found

This investigation discusses results from a survey on end-user preferences for future e-Bikes that will be developed in the coming years. User preferences related to safety and convenience were defined using market reviews and responses gathered from 638 potential users mainly from Europe and North America. Data were analysed to rank the importance of desired functionality to improve the uptake of cycling within urban environments. In general, the results indicate that safety and convenience features were equally valued across the whole sample size. ‘Gradient Climb Assist’ and ‘Break Lights & Indicators’ were respectively the most preferred convenience and safety feature.

As an important part of urban transportation, the continuous optimization of bus network is necessary to improve the service level of bus transit. Aiming to evaluate the rationality and feasibility of bus optimization scheme, the paper discussed the factors about the bus service supply and demand, including the bus operation, passenger flow and service level. Firstly, based on multi-source data including bus smart card transaction data, bus location data and static attribute data of bus network, the evaluation indicator system of bus routes optimization effect is proposed. Secondly, a comprehensive evaluation model of bus route optimization is established by applying the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This paper systematically analyzes the various levels bus optimization scheme including bus route level, station level, bus scheduling scheme, and constructs an evaluation model covering the single bus route optimization and multi-routes combination optimization.

The most evident pattern of lower commute times in the inner city corresponded to college workers using transit. Regression results showed a complex interplay between socioeconomic variables, the urban form, and commute time. Overall, for car commuters there was limited and weak evidence of differential commutes among socioeconomic classes. However, for transit users, there was a trend of longer commutes for lower socioeconomic categories. Other socioeconomic factors associated with lower commute times were female, spouse, less educational attainment, the young, and the elderly. Important urban form determinants were the jobs-housing ratio at the destination associated with increased travel times and mixed-land use at the origin associated with a decrease in travel times.",2590-1982,Not found
Moving towards “mobile warehouse”: Last-mile logistics during COVID-19 and beyond,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100339,10,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Supply chains in general and last-mile logistics in particular, have been disrupted due to COVID-19.

We present a review of literature related to last-mile logistics and supply chain disruptions to identify the limitations of existing last-mile delivery practices during COVID-19. Using a stylized analytical model, we then propose that “mobile warehouse” can be an effective solution to last-mile logistics issues faced during COVID-19 and beyond under certain conditions. A mobile warehouse is a truck dedicated to a particular geographical location and carries the inventory of various products based on the estimated demand requirements for these products in that geographical location. We provide the condition under which the B2C e-commerce providers find it profitable to adopt a truck as a mobile warehouse to sell high demand items quickly.",2590-1982,Not found

We applied the Conditional Inference Tree method to identify combinations of amenity changes that characterized amenity installation patterns and examined the associations between changes in amenities and changes in ridership at stop-level. Compared to stops with the fewest changes, stops had a higher likelihood of increases in boardings if their combination of amenity changes included new RTIS, shelters, and bike hoops.

In the implementation of new mobility offers, it is essential to consider aspects of acceptability research, as their use may directly depend on acceptability. In this study, determinants of the acceptability of autonomous mobility were investigated using both a comprehensive questionnaire and a virtual reality study. The questionnaire results show that assessments of acceptability of autonomous driving, in general, are lower than the acceptability of specific autonomous vehicles, in this case, autonomous cargo bikes. For both, acceptability increases if (1) the object of acceptability is also expected to be highly beneficial, (2) environmentally friendly values or (3) an intention to use sustainable means of transport exist and (4) discomfort towards innovations such as digitalization is low. Furthermore, the assessment of acceptability varies depending on groups, e.g. between men and women, or between cyclists and car drivers.

Considering ‘non-acoustic factors’ as social and environmental determinants of health equity and environmental justice. Reflections on research and fields of action towards a vision for environmental noise policies,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100445,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Despite being an overall objective of European policies, health equity and environmental justice have not yet been systematically implemented in environmental policies. Taking control over one’s environment as an element of health equity, we consider intractable exposure to transportation noise as a highly relevant policy field. The European Environmental Noise Directive is designed as a sectoral policy dealing with one environmental health determinant (noise) and drawing on the Global Burden of Disease framework, whereas health equity demands an investigation of the manifold variations in the population by combining adverse noise exposure with salutogenetic (psycho-)social and environmental resources. Such resources or the lack thereof have been referred to as ‘non-acoustic factors’ in noise- and soundscape-related research and can presumably account for vulnerability to transportation noise exposure caused by social and environmental determinants. Thus, we aim to link the current discourse on ‘non-acoustic factors’ with health equity driven by the need to go beyond average exposure–response-relations. After summarising challenges of environmental noise-related health impact assessment from a health equity perspective, we focus on residents’ control – both procedurally and environmentally – to illustrate how social and environmental determinants can cause vulnerability. We advocate to consider ‘non-acoustic factors’ as leverage to promote health equity and environmental justice through three fields of potential action: (1) developing a theoretical and methodological groundwork and multi/interdisciplinary training of students and professionals, (2) introducing comprehensible information and inclusive participation methods, and (3) creating supportive institutional frames and governance modes.

As the aviation sector has faced disease outbreaks and extreme events before—albeit not at the same scale—and will, in all likelihood, face them again, we provide an assessment in this study that a) gives an overview of the effects of the pandemic, b) categorizes the response mechanisms that were observed, and c) proposes a framework for a coordinated global response to future disease outbreaks. We highlight that of the many lessons, recommendations, and suggestions that emerged during previous outbreaks, few were introduced effectively into civil aviation practices and operations. Based on multiple data sources for passengers, cargo, and flight schedules, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on the global aviation industry and compare the data of some prominent airports to highlight the need for a coordinated response to effectively deal with future disruptions. As global aviation navigates its ongoing recovery, we discuss different responses during the pandemic including guidelines issued by bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), operational decisions such as closing terminals, increased cleaning frequencies, and mask mandates etc. We emphasize the need for resilience to accommodate disease outbreaks in future planning, design, and preparedness strategies for airports and airlines. We further argue that the existing civil aviation system needs a coordinated global response mechanism to combat future outbreaks and propose a framework with a threat response matrix to keep aviation safe and operational during future pandemics and mitigate socioeconomic fallout.",2590-1982,Not found

A medical condition further impedes travel opportunities and hinders continued engagement in civic and social life, adversely impacting their quality of life. This study uses the 2001 and 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data and analyzes the socio-demographic, attitudinal, and travel characteristics associated with older population long-distance travel patterns to support policy changes that address their emerging travel needs. The study results find a shift in trend in the mode preference of the new generation of older people with a medical condition. They are less likely to drive a car and prefer riding a bus or some other transport modes. They are also more likely to travel more over the weekend and evening hours. The older individuals are also more likely to travel long distances for work/business, religious trips, visits to family, friends, and relatives, but not for shopping, medical, and recreational purposes. Income and education levels of the older population with a medical condition directly impact their long-distance travel and are likely to increase in the future. The new generation of older people with a medical condition (i.e., 2017 data) are less likely to self-regulate travel by limiting or giving up driving and are more likely to be self-dependent by refusing to ask for rides or use special transportation. As a result, more older drivers with medical conditions can be expected to drive on the roads in the future adding to their road safety risks as well as those of others. This warrants transport policy changes to support safer mobility options for older people for their continued active community life and well-being.",2590-1982,Not found
Assessing the economic benefits of active transport policy pathways: Opportunities from a local perspective,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100456,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Combined with concerns about climate change, air pollution and human health, the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed the use of and policy interest in active transport (AT) modes, namely cycling and walking. However, we note a high degree of uncertainty and lack of assessments addressing the economic benefits of AT policies; particularly when they are used as a mix of policies at the local level. This study aims to address this knowledge gap. We use the city of Oxford as a case study and apply the WHO Health Economic Assessment Tool and different baselines to assess four policy packages promoting a mode shift to AT for the 2030–2050 period. In total, 312 policy scenarios were produced and analysed. Results show that a policy mix that maximises economic benefits entails bike-sharing, cycle parking, training and education, low traffic neighbourhoods, e-bike grants, a workplace parking levy and increased use of a ‘cycle-to-work’ Scheme. Considering the health impacts from increased physical activity and avoided CO2 emissions, benefits are estimated in the range of: 62–256 prevented premature deaths; 18–50 million tonnes of avoided CO2e emissions; resulting in a total gross benefit of €3.45–11.28 billion. These impacts remain high and robust when key input parameters are tested via a sensitivity analysis. We conclude that investing in AT policy measures represents a multi-faceted low-carbon opportunity that should not be missed by policymakers.",2590-1982,Not found
Automotive UX design and data-driven development: Narrowing the gap to support practitioners,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100455,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The development and evaluation of In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVISs) is strongly based on insights from qualitative studies conducted in artificial contexts (e.g., driving simulators or lab experiments). However, the growing complexity of the systems and the uncertainty about the context in which they are used, create a need to augment qualitative data with quantitative data, collected during real-world driving. In contrast to many digital companies that are already successfully using data-driven methods, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are not yet succeeding in releasing the potentials such methods offer. We aim to understand what prevents automotive OEMs from applying data-driven methods, what needs practitioners formulate, and how collecting and analyzing usage data from vehicles can enhance UX activities. We adopted a Multiphase Mixed Methods approach comprising two interview studies with more than 15 UX practitioners and two action research studies conducted with two different OEMs. From the four studies, we synthesize the needs of UX designers, extract limitations within the domain that hinder the application of data-driven methods, elaborate on unleveraged potentials, and formulate recommendations to improve the usage of vehicle data. We conclude that, in addition to modernizing the legal, technical, and organizational infrastructure, UX and Data Science must be brought closer together by reducing silo mentality and increasing interdisciplinary collaboration. New tools and methods need to be developed and UX experts must be empowered to make data-based evidence an integral part of the UX design process.",2590-1982,Not found
The response of the U.S. aviation industry to demand and supply shocks in the oil and jet fuel markets,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100452,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The article disentangles shocks to the global crude oil and U.S. jet fuel markets into demand and supply shocks that underlie both markets, and then examines the effects of these shocks on the U.S. airline industry. I specify a block-recursive structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model that allows for global crude oil market variables to affect the jet fuel market contemporaneously, but not vice versa. Impulse response functions show that oil supply shocks have no significant impact on oil and jet fuel prices, while aggregate demand and precautionary demand shocks cause oil and jet fuel prices to rise. In addition, my results indicate that jet fuel shocks, whether demand or supply, have no significant effects on global crude oil prices. On the other hand, jet fuel demand and supply shocks both significantly increase the price of jet fuel. Furthermore, jet fuel demand shocks have positive impacts on the U.S. aviation industry, while the effects of jet fuel supply shocks are generally negative.",2590-1982,Not found
Transition of mobility in companies – A semi-systematic literature review and bibliographic analysis on corporate mobility and its management,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100462,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Advancement measures and negative externalities of the current transport system have been extensively researched but significant changes concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction is yet to be achieved. The expected mobility changes, triggered by the introduction of electric mobility, sharing concepts, modern vehicle concepts, new planning approaches and future autonomous vehicle concepts open up new options for an improved efficiency in the corporate mobility sector. The purpose of this article is to review literature between 2016 and mid-2020 on all transport-related activities of corporations and critically review research conclusions and their implication to determine research gaps for potential alternative ways of system transition. This is achieved by a semi-systematic review of international scientific journals and conference papers independently from their research field with a set of a-priori defined terms on corporate mobility and logistics. The article concludes with a summary of major research motivations and outcomes to the mobility transition in companies and identified research gaps with potential added value to the transport system. The review reveals that the major objective of analysed articles is the zero-emission future. An examination of new mobility solutions, technologies, and their potential impact is ongoing. The potentials to design future systems and ways of system transition have yet to be sufficiently examined. The relevant question is how mobility management in corporations could be upgraded. The integration into companies’ strategic management and inter-company mobility concepts could be potential fields. These findings are important for policymakers and mobility managers to jointly work on the zero-emission future.",2590-1982,Not found
The impacts of vehicle automation on transport-disadvantaged people,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100447,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"As an emerging technology, vehicle automation will have profound impacts on various aspects of society. Although recent studies have examined the impacts of the proliferation of vehicles with high/full-level automation, few have emphasized the implications for social equity. To better understand how autonomous vehicles (AVs) may influence equity, this study explores the potential influence of AVs on eight groups of transportation-disadvantaged people. Specifically, we synthesize prominent travel behaviors of the identified groups and explore possible impacts of AVs on these groups. We found that AVs tend to bring more benefits than harm to some people but may have mixed effects on others. Based on the findings, we provide policy recommendations for future policy decision-making, which will likely to play an essential role in maximizing AVs’ benefits and mitigating their challenges.",2590-1982,Not found
Driver's visual perception as a function of age. Using a driving simulator to explore driver's eye movements in vertical signs,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100460,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This research aims to evaluate the impact of age on the driver’s attention and perception of road signs, using a driving simulator. The sample focused on drivers aged between 20 and 60 years, since this age range accounts for the largest number of qualified drivers - almost 75% of the total. As drivers gain more experience on the road, the more likely they are to drive safely and therefore, less likely to crash. However, many young and adult drivers become overconfident in their ability to drive and mistakenly believe they are driving safely. The sample studied was analyzed according to the following age groups: Group I, “young” drivers and Group II, “adult” drivers. The collected data included that from the eye tracking system (SmartEye) and questionnaires applied after the experiment. The test scenario replicated a 10 km stretch of a Brazilian highway were the gaze tracking data allowed the measurement of the following variables: observation time, maximum fixation time of signals and the number of signs observed. Both groups had excellent performances in the Simulator’s Post-Drive Questionnaire, with an average correct rate of 94% for Group I and 89% for Group II. Regarding the data provided by eye-tracking system, Group II proved to be more attentive in perceiving speed signs, although in general, they needed to observe the speed sign for longer to be able to perceive it.",2590-1982,Not found
Assessment of electric vehicle repurchase intention: A survey-based study on the Norwegian EV market,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100439,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Electrification of vehicles is one of the most promising measures for decarbonising the transport system. Several countries worldwide have implemented policy incentives to promote mass electric vehicle (EV) adoption to mitigate the environmental and energy-related challenges caused by the increased demand for road transportation. As a result, the number of EVs on the road is growing in several countries. However, despite the growing demand, many consumers are still sceptical about EVs. The aim of this study is to evaluate consumers' EV repurchase intention by using an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Studies on EV adoption have found TPB determinants of intention to be relevant. Additionally, this study argues that the effects of satisfaction should be considered in addition to the TPB elements to better understand repurchase intentions. Consequently, this study includes EV users' satisfaction with relevant aspects such as range-recharge, environmental attributes, cost, availability, symbolic attributes, and use-based policy measures. A structural equation model (SEM) was established to analyse a survey dataset consisting of 278 Norwegian EV owners. To assess satisfaction with EV use and the behavioural intention of EV repurchases, only the responses from actual EV users were studied. This is important because consumers with no prior experience with EVs tend to inaccurately portray their interest in a new product or service. The findings are of interest for both policymakers and EV manufacturers seeking to gain actionable insights into EV owners' needs and perceptions concerning EV attributes, thus developing and implementing better strategies to increase EV attractiveness and performance.",2590-1982,Not found
A statistical assessment of work-from-home participation during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100441,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically transformed industry, healthcare, mobility, and education. Many workers have been forced to shift to work-from-home, adjust their commute patterns, and/or adopt new behaviors. Particularly important in the context of mitigating transportation-related emissions is the shift to work-from-home. This paper focuses on two major shifts along different stages of the pandemic. First, it investigates switching to work-from-home during the pandemic, followed by assessing the likelihood of continuing to work-from-home as opposed to returning to the workplace. This second assessment, being conditioned on workers having experienced work-from-home as the result of the pandemic, allows important insights into the factors affecting work-from-home probabilities. Using a survey collected in July and August of 2020, it is found that nearly 50 percent of the respondents who did not work-from-home before but started to work-from-home during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicated the willingness to continue work-from-home. A total of 1,275 observations collected using the survey questionnaire, that was administered through a U.S. nationwide panel (Prime Panels), were used in the model estimation. The methodological approach used to study work-from-home probabilities in this paper captures the complexities of human behavior by considering the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in a multivariate context, which allows for new insights into the effect of explanatory variables on the likelihood of working from home. Random parameters logit model estimations (with heterogeneity in the means and variances of random parameters) revealed additional insights into factors affecting work-from-home probabilities. It was found that gender, age, income, the presence of children, education, residential location, or job sectors including marketing, information technologies, business, or administration/administrative support all played significant roles in explaining these behavioral shifts and post-pandemic preferences.",2590-1982,Not found
Indicators for commuter's satisfaction and usage of high occupancy public bus transport service in Ghana,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100458,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"High occupancy public bus transport services in some countries have gradually dropped due to its less competitive service performance. This has resulted in deteriorating the sustainability of the transportation system especially in developing countries such as Ghana. The study mainly aims to identify the perception and expectation of service quality factors related to commuters’ satisfaction and usage of bus services in Ghana. Using two approaches, a sample of 816 public bus users completed a questionnaire on perception and expectation measures at terminals in six regional capitals in Ghana. The result of the preliminary analysis shows that in the gap analysis, there is a wide gap between commuters’ expectations and perception of Public Bus Transport (PBT) service quality attributes. The “path model” revealed that affordability and availability were the most significant service quality attributes related to perceived commuters’ satisfaction. With the expectation model, availability, security and reliability were the most significant service quality attributes related to passengers' expected satisfaction. The coefficient between satisfaction and usage of bus transport, and the variance explained in these variables (satisfaction and usage) by the expectation model is stronger compared to the perception model. This explains that passengers’ satisfaction and usage of PBT would be enhanced when transport operators provide services that accommodate the expectations of service required by passengers. The interventions suggested will stimulate passengers’ satisfaction, promote sustainable mobility, reduce energy consumption, and emissions.",2590-1982,Not found
A simulation-based analysis for effective distribution of COVID-19 vaccines: A case study in Norway,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100453,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Since December 2020, the vaccines from several manufacturers, e.g., Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, etc., have been approved for mass vaccination to control the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused more than 100 million infections and 2.4 million deaths. These vaccines are produced and transported in large quantities to suffice the needs of several countries. Before arriving at the end-users, the vaccines need to be stored at extremely low temperatures and distributed through reliable cold chain logistics networks. Thus, the timely and cost-effective distribution of COVID-19 vaccines via cold chain logistics has become a complex operational challenge. In this paper, we develop a simulation-based approach combining both route optimization and dynamic simulation to improve the logistics performance for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. A state-of-the-art simulation package called anyLogistix is used to perform a real-world case study in Norway. With the data of periodic vaccine demands, customer and warehouse locations, vehicle-related costs and emissions, and expected service levels, implications are obtained based on the analysis of several scenarios. Our experimental results reveal that the service level, cost-effectiveness, environmental performance, and equity of a cold chain vaccine logistics system can be significantly influenced by the fleet size, the fleet composition, the type of vehicle used, and the route optimization. Thus, these factors need to be holistically considered in the planning of an effective COVID-19 vaccine distribution system.",2590-1982,Not found
Recharging scenarios for differently electrified road vehicles: A methodology and its application to the Italian grid,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100454,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Promoting the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is essential to meet local environmental requirements. A way to favour the use of these vehicles is to improve the ability to recharge vehicles at home or at the workplace, and to predict their residual energy state of charge throughout the day. This paper presents a novel user-friendly methodology to assess different recharging scenarios. The methodology was applied to a real case study on an international car manufacturer based in Italy. Several scenarios were addressed regarding the recharge at home of electrified vehicles, considering meter upgrades and different recharging speeds. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) case was also investigated. The results show that PHEVs are the most flexible solution where domestic slow recharging is the only or preferred choice. BEVs become viable when at least a 4.5 kW supply contract is available together with a fast-recharging infrastructure with a suitable home grid, or where daytime parking lots with recharging facilities are available. The application of the proposed methodology to a real case study suggests that this approach can usefully help decision makers to identify the type of investments to be made and where they should be carried out.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in travel behaviour: A qualitative study,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100450,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"During the COVID-19 crisis, a series of measures were taken to restrict travel and social activities outside the home in order to curb the pandemic and ameliorate its negative effects. These unprecedented measures have had a profound impact on the number and purposes of trips and modes of travel. In China, although the pandemic is now generally under control and transport availability has returned to nearly normal, the extent of the changes in travel behaviour wrought during and after the pandemic still remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the differences in individual travel behaviours during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, using Huzhou as an example. Semi-structured interviews were used to examine the influence of COVID-19 on the travel behaviour and perceptions of different groups. The results indicate that, initially, travel demand was greatly reduced. Second, decreased travel reduced participation in activities, which can have adverse effects on people’s health as well as their subjective well-being. Third, the degree and duration of such impacts varied from person to person. Students, lower income cohorts, groups living in small communities with insufficient green spaces, and those working in tourism, catering, informal businesses and transport-related sectors were more vulnerable than others. Policymakers, urban and transport planners should therefore pay attention to the social inequities that arise from unequal access to transport and heterogeneity between individuals. Additionally, public transport systems require further development to promote social cohesion.",2590-1982,Not found
Social media response and crisis communications in active shootings during COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100420,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Active shooting, a man-made hazard, remains an unsolved challenge as communities get threatened more frequently than ever before. As a low-cost alternative to the traditional approaches of responding to such crisis, data-driven approaches can help to identify more tailored response strategies and guide towards more informed decision-making. Recently, social media platforms helped researchers and practitioners with sufficient details and coverage to understand how communities respond to natural hazards through social media interactions. However, the empirical literature does not provide any comprehensive guidance on public reactions to active shootings as observed through social media interactions. This study adopted a holistic data analytics approach to collect large-scale social media data from Twitter (~252 K tweets, 04.17.20–05.20.20). The 2020 Nova Scotia Attacks were among the major shooting events observed during this period in addition to the unprecedented experiences people were having due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used several natural language processing and data mining approaches (such as temporal heatmaps, word bigrams, and topic mining) to cluster the social media crisis communication patterns of active shootings and create infographics of the diverse needs, concerns, and reactions observed in the aftermath of such events. Key interactions include bailing out of shooters, shooting investigation, police response, gun violence, lessons learned from the previous school (Sandy Hook) and mass shootings (El Paso), vehicle ramming (Toronto Van Attack), mobility issues, and health concerns during COVID-19 pandemic, changes in economy and education systems. This study would allow first responders and emergency management officials to enhance the capacity of social sharing platforms and facilitate risk communication in no-notice scenarios. Additionally, the infographics could serve as a data dictionary in future active shooting scenarios to maximize peer influence.",2590-1982,Not found
"Assessment of traffic congestion scenario at the CBD areas in a developing city: In the context of Khulna City, Bangladesh",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100435,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Central Business Districts (CBDs) are impeccable areas of traffic attractions exacerbated by the increase of rapid population density, enormous urbanization, and increasing economic and commercial activities. Traffic congestion in the CBD areas is a perpetual problem for sustainable urban development. This study detailed the traffic congestion states and the factors influencing traffic congestion in the CBD areas of Khulna City. In this regard, spot speed, journey speed, running speed, and volume of all types of vehicles in the four CBD areas during peak and off-peak hours on both weekends and weekdays have been measured through manual counting and video recording methods. The traffic congestion state in the study area has been assessed through Level of Service, Speed Performance Index, Road Segment Congestion Index. The outcome of these indices revealed the worst congestion state in all CBD areas with breakdown flow. The Active Road Performance Index explained that inadequate parking facilities, illegal road occupancy by roadside vendors, and on-street parking decreased the road efficiency by 32 to 82% in different areas. The regular road users believed that congestion occurs mostly between 6.00 PM and 9.00 PM. This study found that rapid increase in vehicle population, poor public transport, pedestrians’ behavior, illegal road occupancy, and fragile enforcement of laws are leading the traffic condition of Khulna towards an unsustainable future. The outcome of this study will provide useful information for urban planners, policymakers, and practitioners to devise appropriate strategies for reducing congestion that would help to ensure a sustainable urban transport system.",2590-1982,Not found
Redesigning parking facilities using a parking service satisfaction survey at Izumo local airport in Japan,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100433,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This study aims to investigate the need to improve parking facilities at Japan’s Izumo Airport. The occupancy of on-site parking lots was analyzed using one-day, weekend, and long-term parking metadata, and passengers passing through the security gate were surveyed on their satisfaction with airport parking. More than 4,000 passengers were recruited for the survey, of whom over 1,000 passengers who drove a car were asked about their satisfaction with the number and size of the parking lots available, the space for vehicle traffic, and the pedestrian walkway to the terminal. Additionally, they answered questions regarding necessary parking lot improvements and if it was better to expand the parking space or charge fees for it. The occupancy metadata analysis found that parking lots near the terminal buildings were almost full, whereas those farther away were comparatively unoccupied. The ordered logit estimation results for satisfaction showed that older respondents, those who parked far away from the terminal building, and those who took morning flights had significantly negative satisfaction levels. Similar estimation results for parking services improvement showed that users dissatisfied with the number of parking lots wanted improved parking services and preferred parking space expansion over a new fee. The combination study of metadata and satisfaction survey sheds new light on occupancy asymmetry, which contributes the most to the dissatisfaction over the number of parking lots. Therefore, smoothing occupancy and traffic trajectories between these areas is key to improving drivers’ satisfaction.",2590-1982,Not found
Scenario planning for transport practitioners,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100438,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Scenario planning helps in contemplating how the future may develop and can be especially important when needing to make sense of uncertainty – something now pertinent to the transport sector. Accordingly, scenario planning is moving from the periphery of strategic transport planning towards becoming a more normalised and integral contribution. By examining rather than ignoring a range of uncertainties about the future, scenarios can be developed that enable an exploration of different futures, in turn improving transport planning. Scenarios can be narrative based, represented quantitatively, or combine ‘storytelling and number crunching’. Both the process of creating them and of representing the scenarios, deepen an appreciation of uncertainty about the future. In turn this allows planners and policymakers to better understand potential outcomes and challenges and determine how to address these. Scenarios can also be used to identify and assess candidate measures for influencing the transport system, testing these against a range of uncertain future conditions. This helps to identify measures that together can help form a strategy that is more robust. Drawing upon the combined experience of its authors, this paper provides insights into the development of scenarios and their use to improve decision making in transport planning. It offers advice on how to help ensure the scenario development process is credible, how to produce a coherent set of scenarios and how to ensure they are used to engage key stakeholders and to enable policymakers to confidently develop their strategic thinking and plans.",2590-1982,Not found

A survey was conducted that sampled 417 respondents. The survey was carried out using the convenience sampling method and was administered partly online and partly through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive analysis using SPSS was carried out for the variables using the chi-square tests to assess statistical significance. Most (66.4%) respondents were familiar with AVs. Majority (55.4%) had a positive opinion on AVs and most (78.2%) were interested in experiencing AVs. However, respondents still preferred to have some control (i.e., level-3 automation and below) should they experience using AVs. Respondents also expressed concern about AV use, with safety as the most important consideration. Respondents would utilize the free time available in use of AVs to be productive and work. Participants were optimistic, believing AVs will be available in the next ten years. To ensure public acceptance of AVs, government can: set out policies that make Ghana an attractive market for car manufacturers; put in place the necessary infrastructure to accommodate AVs into the existing transportation system; educate the public on the usefulness of AVs; highlight the positive impact AVs would have on the transportation system; introduce policies that would allow for AVs to be set at reasonable prices and for individuals to have subsidies and tax benefits associated with AV use.

We present findings from a series of Citizen Dialogues on driverless mobility attended by 945 citizens in 15 cities across North America, Europe and Asia. The dialogue used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and was deliberative in nature to instil realism and provide richer insights. In all cities we found optimism for driverless mobility. Nevertheless, citizens exhibited lower levels of trust and acceptance as vehicle automation increased and this is potentially related to how automation levels are currently presented; in an incremental fashion leading to the perception that vehicle automation gets increasingly difficult, complex, and thus potentially dangerous. We identified a need for further investigation into how trust and acceptance are related with perceptions and understandings of automation levels, and how vehicle automation should be communicated to citizens more effectively. Findings further showed that public transport was the preferred implementation model for driverless mobility. National governments were most trusted to lead the development and implementation of driverless mobility in all cities as they are trusted to safeguard the interest of citizens with integrity and hold the authority for developing and setting standards and regulating autonomous vehicle technology. Building on our findings, we discuss implications and propose recommendations for industry, policymakers and researchers.",2590-1982,Not found

Methods A series of qualitative interviews were conducted with 16 members of the public in Switzerland who were recruited online and through snowballing. Interviews were transcribed and coded, before being subjected to thematic analysis. Results Three main themes emerged from the interviews. These included differing perceptions of the level of self-automation of smart cars, across a spectrum from partial automation to fully autonomous vehicles; a variety of views on the perceived pros and cons of smart cars, including fewer accidents and potential loss of freedom; and opinions concerning whether a car would be ‘better than human’, and related issues including whether such cars should or could be subject to human override. Almost all participants saw the introduction of truly smart cars as beneficial, although many said they would not be early adopters and would always want humans to have the ability to take control. Significance Our results reveal generally positive attitudes to smart cars, but also some poor understanding of the different levels of automation that such cars can have, and potentially unrealistic expectations regarding the capacity of humans to re-assume control in emergencies. These factors must be considered by legislators and others involved in the introduction of smart cars onto our roads.",2590-1982,Not found
The effect of a functional prototype on user acceptance in transportation: Assessing the level of acceptance before and after the first demonstration flight of an air taxi,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100444,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Prototypes support the development of new technology by enabling to collect user feedback before full market readiness is achieved. However, this potential is often not fully exploited as physical prototypes are mainly used at more mature levels of technology development, after demonstrating full functionality. Using physical prototypes that are not fully functional at an early stage of technology maturity could lead to lower resource consumption as customer feedback could be incorporated faster and acceptance could be established. However, previous research has indicated differences in consumer attitudes toward technologies before and after users have experienced prototypes first-hand. Therefore, this paper investigates whether experiencing a functional physical prototype at an early stage of technology maturity affects consumer perception. For this purpose, we utilized the first flight of an air taxi in Europe since we were certain that the technology had not been seen in action or used before. We conducted two studies: Study 1, with 126 potential users in a within-subject design, and Study 2, with 539 potential users in a between-subject design. We did not detect significant effects on the participants’ attitudes before and after watching an air taxi flight in person in either study. Overall, the data suggests that a live demonstration of a technology is not necessary to gain a comprehensive picture of peoples’ attitudes toward it, which creates the possibility of examining the effects of more inexpensive technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality simulators in mobility research.",2590-1982,Not found

In Nigeria, there is paucity of studies addressing commuters’ satisfaction with the service quality (SQ) of informal modes of transportation. This study examines commuters’ satisfaction with SQ of taxis in Abeokuta, Nigeria using household travel survey. The sample comprised of 272 commuters selected from 31 electoral wards in the study area. Data collected using SERVPREF questionnaire, were analysed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, and multiple regression technique. The results indicate that the commuters’ satisfaction with taxis services is slightly above average (M = 2.69, SD = 1.29) on a scale of 1 to 5. The principal component analysis identified four factors which explained 59.06% percent of the total variance in commuters’ satisfaction with taxi services in Abeokuta. In addition multiple regression coefficients showed that only three of the factors (factor 1 (β = 0.098, P < 0.05), factor 2 (β = 0.154, P < 0.000), and factors 3 (β = 0.106, P < 0.05)) significantly influenced commuters’ perception of satisfaction with taxis. The study concludes that taxis service providers need to improve on aspects of services rated low by respondents and to embrace recent trend in taxis services provision as obtainable in advance countries, while the state government should plan towards introducing bus rapid transit system (BRT) in Abeokuta and other major cities in Ogun state in the nearest future.",2590-1982,Not found
Shared autonomous vehicles implementation for the first and last-mile services,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100440,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Many studies have been conducted on the feasibility of shared autonomous vehicles to solve the first-mile and last-mile (FMLM) connectivity problem of public transport (PT). Numerous implementation strategies mainly focused on the operational strategies, with little attention being paid to formulate the optimum strategy of SAV coupled with PT. Thus, this research develops a multimodal SAV implementation that couples with PT by considering the travelers' mode choice preferences and evaluating the integration of SAVs with PT in improving overall transport network performance and PT ridership. The simulation of SAVs was conducted on the road network of Kuala Lumpur during the morning peak hour. Results indicated that SAVs' implementation that coupled with PT increased the PT usage by 3% and reduced personal vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) by 6%, which may potentially solve the FMLM connectivity and reduce traffic congestion. Simulation through modification of SAV's waiting time, the operation cost of a personal vehicle, and riding cost for SAV were also conducted for a more comprehensive analysis. Results showed that when SAV’s passenger waiting time decreases, the passenger trips for SAVs increase, together with passenger trips for PT. However, when an extreme case was considered, that was a 20% decrease in the SAV's waiting time; a massive increase in passenger trips for SAVs with reduced PT ridership was observed. This potentially contributed to traffic congestion. As such, the results signified without proper planning of SAV-PT integration could worsen existing traffic network's performance.",2590-1982,Not found
The architecture of complexity in the relationships between information and communication technologies and travel: A review of empirical studies,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100432,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) has become an integral part of people’s lives, having complex interactions with different facets of human activity participation and travel behaviour. Studies over decades have tried to understand the relationships between ICT and travel. However, the fast evolution of ICT systems and the complex nature of these relationships have resulted in a limited understanding of the overall architecture, the sub-components, and their interactions. This study aims to achieve two objectives. First, we update the current state of knowledge on ICT-travel relationships by conducting an extensive literature review. Second, based on the findings of the review, we propose a conceptual model that identifies sub-components and their interrelationships that need to be better understood to accurately grasp the impacts of ICT on transportation. We summarized 186 empirical studies from the perspectives of survey methods, ICT devices, services, applications, direct relationships with travel behaviour related variables and higher-order or indirect impacts on other parameters such as emissions and congestion. It was observed that the nature of empirical results would depend on assumptions, objectives and type of data used. The findings of the review were then used to classify architecture in the relationship between ICT and travel into four distinct types. The merits, demerits, and challenges associated with the analysis across types were then illustrated. We then develop a conceptual model that highlighted and discussed the possible interactions between 1) ICT systems, 2) travel-related factors and 3) higher-order variables.",2590-1982,Not found
Horizon scanning for transport research and innovation governance: A European perspective,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100424,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The European Commission’s Transport Research and Innovation Monitoring and Information System (TRIMIS) is co-developed by the authors as an open-access transport policy tool to support implementation of the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA), covering all transport sectors and modes. Within the TRIMIS frame, horizon scanning has been piloted through a structured and systematic collaborative exercise contributing to the identification of new and emerging technologies and trends. It focused especially on those affecting the transport sector, supporting the assessment of current and future research needs. This exercise also feeds broader European Commission policies with transport insights, thereby contributing to policy integration. The TRIMIS horizon scanning pilot shed light onto various emerging technologies that can potentially disrupt mobility and transport. It highlighed the significance of the interaction of the energy and transport sectors, and the need to invest in related research and innovation to address complex emerging challenges identified in the expert workshop: Radical solutions to replace cars in urban environments; Electrification and escalation of power demand; Fleet modernisation through retrofitting; and Automation to maintain current system with less externalities. This paper provides an overview of the role, application and outcomes of the horizon scanning methodology co-developed and piloted by the authors to support transport research and innovation in a European Union (EU) policy context.",2590-1982,Not found
Taking the freeway: Inferring evacuee route selection from survey data,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100421,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Effective evacuation management plans can help reduce the negative impacts of disasters. Understanding evacuee travel behavior is critical for the design of evacuation plans. In this paper, we explore which factors contribute to evacuees selecting freeway vs. non-freeway evacuation routes. Freeways are of particular interest due to their ability to evacuate large volumes of traffic. This study used survey data collected for the Hampton Roads region of Virginia. Respondents were asked to provide their preferred route types in the event of a hypothetical Category 4 hurricane evacuation. A mixed (random parameters) logit model was proposed to determine factors that influence evacuees selecting between freeway and non-freeway route. The study found that several factors contribute to evacuees choosing a freeway over other routes. In the descending order of importance (i.e., marginal effects), these factors are: willingness to use the official recommended route, living in a single-family or duplex housing, expected travel time to reach the destination, being employed, and possessing prior evacuation experience. Conversely, a few factors had a negative effect on choosing a freeway. These factors are: willingness to evacuate two days prior to landfall and evacuating to a public shelter or a second home. The findings of this study can help emergency management and transportation agencies design effective traffic control plans to safely evacuate populations during a hurricane.",2590-1982,Not found
Pavement slipperiness detection using wheel speed and acceleration sensor data,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100431,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Faced with high rates of traffic accidents on slippery roads, it is recommended that road managers promptly identify the slippery spots, remove the slipperiness and inform drivers of the location of the dangerous spots on the route ahead, to allow them to prepare for the slipperiness. In this paper, the wheel slip-based and wheel acceleration-based approaches are suggested for detecting road slipperiness using sensor data from a digital tachograph (DTG), which is mandatory in commercial vehicles. Support vector machine algorithms were employed to categorize slippery and non-slippery states. The performances were outstanding (with accuracy more than 98%) when evaluated using experimental data, collected on a road weather-proving ground. Considering a large number of commercial vehicles equipped with DTG devices which are connected via cellular communications, the suggested methods could be practically applied to real-world DTG-based fleet management systems.",2590-1982,Not found
Factors associated with differences in initial pandemic preparedness and response: Findings from a nationwide survey in the United states,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100430,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Using data from a national survey conducted in the United States during the Spring of 2020, the study investigates the differences between emergency managers, transportation planners, and others involved in disaster response regarding pandemic risk perceptions and protective actions. Approximately 92 percent of respondents reported implementing voluntary actions, with 35 percent reporting quarantine and 37 percent reporting isolation actions. Respondent attributes and the agencies and communities they work in are categorized in terms of personal, disciplinary, or professional backgrounds, including urban versus rural locations, coastal versus non-coastal communities, and other factors. Three different dependent variables are modeled, including: 1) risk tolerance, 2) level of preparedness (including support for training), and 3) implementation of protective measures for social distancing, quarantine, and isolation to ascertain the influences of personal, professional, and locational characteristics. A risk tolerance score is used by asking, “What percentage of the population would need to be sick to execute voluntary and non-voluntary actions?” Poisson regression and correspondence analysis are used to identify patterns, associations, and clustering of respondent characteristics to show the relationships between risk perceptions, preparedness, and professional backgrounds. In addition to determining which places and people are more inclined to support protective actions against the pandemic, this analysis also demonstrates the intersections and mutual interests across public health, transportation, and emergency management. Overall, a low level of preparedness for the pandemic was found, with 70 percent of the respondents supporting additional training.",2590-1982,Not found

The residential property value premium of the proximity to carsharing and bikesharing services: Evidence from New York City,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100427,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"While significant existing scholarship has confirmed that accessibility to “macro” transportation systems, such as transit, creates some value for real estate, few studies have examined the capitalized effect of “micro” transportation modes on property values. Even, despite the increased ridership and market shares of carsharing and bikesharing services, empirical evidence on its property value capitalization effects of the emerging transportation services remains far less limited. In this context, this research examines the residential value uplift induced from the proximity to carsharing (Zipcar) and bikesharing (CitiBike) services in New York City by employing Spatial Durbin Models with sales transaction data that are reported in the New York City Department of Finance in 2018. The results indicate that all else equal, single-family housing near CitiBike station sold at higher prices; a 10 percent decrease in distance was associated with a 4.1 percent increase in its value.

Predictive policing in the context of road traffic safety: A systematic review and theoretical considerations,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100429,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Road traffic collisions are responsible for 1.35 million deaths per year in the World. Moreover, they are the main cause of death for young people. To reduce the hazardous impact of road traffic crashes, it is necessary to constantly improve road traffic safety policing. Predictive Policing is a new concept that seems to be effective in fighting crime. For this background, the objective of this review was to identify studies that used methods of predictive policing in the context of road traffic safety. The systematic search of four databases identified a total of six original research articles. The analysis of the included articles revealed that the predictive policing techniques of hot spot analysis and Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM) are used in research to identify possible high risk areas for future road traffic crashes. The best results were achieved by methods combining both hot spot analysis and RTM. However, there are no studies examining the effectiveness of preventive measures taken based on these models, thus the practical utility of the use of predictive policing is still an open question. Furthermore, no papers were found implementing other models or methods of predictive policing in the context of road traffic safety. In the interdisciplinary context of crime and crash prediction, the methodological and theoretical potential of predictive policing should be further explored. The integrated approach will be an effective way in fighting crime and crashes in the light of limited resources and increasing workload in law enforcement agencies.",2590-1982,Not found

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an extended period of disruption in peoples’ lives and could result in long-term changes towards travel attitudes, and use of transport services. There has previously been little research available on changes towards travel attitudes and use of domestic travel as a result of pandemics. To investigate the changes in attitudes to travel resulting from COVID-19 we distributed a survey to 787 respondents in Australia and New Zealand asking about car use, car sharing, public transport, and air travel before, during, and after COVID-19 travel restrictions. The results showed attitudes towards travel were negatively affected, particularly attitudes towards public transport and international air travel. Further, although respondents indicated some recovery in attitudes when asked to consider when travel restrictions were removed, they did not recover to the levels of positivity seen pre-COVID. There were slight differences between the two countries in their post-COVID attitudes, possibly due to their different experience of travel restriction. Both countries, however, may be useful as a preview for the rest of the world given the early cessation of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the survey.",2590-1982,Not found
Environmental performance of four different heavy-duty propulsion technologies using Life Cycle Assessment,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100428,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The goal of this study is to perform an environmental analysis using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology to compare different technologies for heavy-duty trucks: Diesel, Diesel Hybrid, Spark-Ignited Natural Gas, High-Pressure Direct Injection Natural Gas. The analysis considers five impact categories: climate change, particulate matter, ozone photochemical formation, terrestrial eutrophication and acidification. This paper also contains a Total Cost of Ownership analysis. The main results reveal a reduction between 5 and 6% of Greenhouse Gases for alternative propulsion technologies. Natural gas trucks show a considerable reduction (40–50%) compared to conventional diesel in terms of terrestrial eutrophication and acidification, besides, for particulate matter and photochemical ozone formation, there are also minor reductions (10%). The economic analysis indicates that diesel is an attractive alternative, despite its poor environmental behaviour, and natural gas trucks do not seem to be as economically competitive as diesel.

The team collected surveys from 1081 transit riders in Ohio. Shopping and work trips dropped the least (11–19%) while social visits and worship trips were reduced the most (49–61%). Bus, personal car use and paratransit dropped the least, while walking and ride share dropped the most. Regression analysis revealed that female, married, children at home, higher income, and areas with high COVID infection rates had the largest decreases in trips. Being unbanked and being employed (including while working from home) saw stable or increased trips. Females and those with children felt less connected to the community, but unbanked people did not.

An agent-based implementation of freight receiver and carrier collaboration with cost sharing,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100416,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Freight transport stakeholders can benefit from collaborative planning. Unfortunately, appropriate decision and planning support tools are lacking. Consequently, freight stakeholders remain unaware of collaboration opportunities and the potential benefit of those coalitions. This paper focuses on implementing collaboration between urban freight receivers and carriers. Collaboration takes the form of cost-sharing among coalition members when receivers are willing to extend their time windows. Rigorous experiments confirm the behavioural sensitivity of the model. A realistically-sized case study in the City of Cape Town, South Africa, demonstrates the usability of the agent-based simulation model. The case study considers the impact of collaboration on after-hour deliveries. Results indicate that delivery cost reduces significantly (nearly 30%) when carriers and receivers are willing to collaborate and adopt after-hour deliveries - the carrier’s fleet composition changes to favour fewer but larger vehicles.",2590-1982,Not found
What do teenagers think about driving? Insights from a bicycling-oriented community in the auto-dependent United States,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100422,11,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The decline in driver’s licensure among teenagers in the U.S. in recent decades has led some observers to speculate that the newest generation of adults will be less car dependent than those that preceded them. Previous studies have identified a variety factors that may explain the decline, including graduated licensing policies and economic conditions. This paper delves beneath these trends with the goal of generating a deeper understanding of what is going on with teenagers and their travel. We explore what teenagers think about driving and its alternatives through in-depth interviews with 20 high school students and their parents in Davis, California, an unusually bicycling-oriented community by U.S. standards. Although bicycling was an important mode of travel for the teenagers when they were younger, all had acquired or planned to acquire a driver’s license at the time of the interview. The reasons teenagers cite for needing a driver’s license are more practical than social, though the ability to socialize with friends is an important benefit of driving. Both teenagers and their parents liked the independence that having a license brings, though both expressed some fears about their driving – both the danger driving poses to themselves as well as the danger their driving poses to others. Teenagers and their parents saw driving as inevitable, as a natural step towards adulthood.",2590-1982,Not found

Partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) is applied to verify and analyze the model with empirical data. According to the purpose of non-commuting and the degree of dependence on private cars, comparative analyses are made in eight cases. The research results show that SSBC is applicable in the study of non-commuting behavior under parking constraints. The choice of non-commuting mode is influenced by psychological factors such as awareness of consequences, responsibility attribution, personal norms, social norms, perceived behavior control, behavior attitudes, parking supply strategy perception, action plan and coping plan. The psychological decision-making process can be divided into four stages, and the implementation intention, behavioral intention and goal intention are important psychological variables to promote the phase transition. Various psychological factors have different degrees of influence on the behavior decisions of people with different degrees of dependence on private cars under different non-commuting travel purposes (business, medical, shopping and entertainment).

This trend is, to a significant extent, the result of internal policies implemented by different countries around the world, primarily developed countries, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from traffic. PEVs have been the primary means for achieving this reduction. However, there are several barriers that make it harder to penetrate the market, among them the high acquisition cost and limited travel distance of these vehicles, as well as limited charging infrastructure deployment. To overcome these barriers, governments need to employ policy measures to encourage the formation and development of the PEV market. In this paper, we used a cost-benefit analysis to determine the most efficient policy tools to accelerate the PEV market in Israel. We composed three alternative policy sets, with each alternative differentiated and rated based on the extent of governmental support and investment required, as well as its estimated impact on PEV market growth and the benefits derived from the policies. We found that the optimal level of government incentives is the basic level. Extended governmental support doesn’t pass a cost-benefit analysis.",2590-1982,Not found

In total, 1221 participants completed a questionnaire battery that included different sets of questions for different types of road users. Chi-Square analysis was used to examine the similarities and differences in the evaluations and perceptions of different road users across five countries. The main findings suggest that all road users across the five countries evaluated environmental characteristics significantly differently from each other. No similar trend could be observed within and between road users and countries. This is a quantitative study that provides descriptive information about road users’ perceptions and evaluations across countries, which can be used for both conceptual and practical purposes.

The economic cost might become uncontrollable if radical policy changes are not implemented soon. Particulate matter emission is mostly attributed to road transport and power generation worldwide. This paper examines the state and adequacy of fuel and vehicle standards prevalent across the African continent. Experimental emissions tests were conducted on 200 vehicles each in Rwanda and Ghana to ascertain compliance to local and international standards. The result showed that even some new vehicles failed the emission tests while almost all the diesel cars tested in both countries failed the international standard. It was discovered that only five African countries have emission standards, most of which were not being implemented. The results also show that while there are approximately 72 million vehicles in use in Africa, only seven countries are responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in Africa is growing at a rate of 7% annually. Poor fuel quality, aging vehicle fleet, and lack of mandatory roadworthy emission tests were to blame for the deteriorating transport emissions.

Existing research studies are predominantly designed around stated preferences surveys on small subsets of a population. The massive use of smartphones and route recommendation systems, however, offers the possibility of interacting with users, opening the potential to better understand and influence mode choice behavior, compared to sole offline analysis. This study explores the ability to predict travelers’ mode choice behavior in Beijing based on a collection of 300,000 recommended transportation alternatives from Baidu. The unique context of Beijing, with its enormous congestion and excessive penetration of smart phones, provides a unique view on actual transportation mode choice at a large scale; and behavioral changes induced by mobile communication technologies. We use machine learning techniques to identify the effects of driving variables, including transportation mode accessibility, weather conditions, alternative trip costs, and time of day.

Different categories of community quarantine and granular lockdowns have since been imposed to curb the spread of the virus. An online survey was distributed to analyze socio-demographic characteristics and reasons for traveling in relation to weekly trip frequency before and during pandemic. These are presented and analyzed through data visualization and multinomial logistic regression. Results show that the major reason for traveling before pandemic was work-related but has since shifted to buying essentials or for leisure or recreation. Weekly trip frequencies were lesser when compared before pandemic, but several socio-demographic groups have shown otherwise. There is statistical significance for those less likely to travel when commuters are employed, self-employed or students compared to unemployed, earning PHP 10,000 or less compared to those earning above PHP 50,000, in a household size of 10 compared to all other household sizes, and those with college degree against elementary or no formal education. By determining the travel behavior of commuters when they have ample time to adjust to the new normal, their mobility needs can be best understood and consequently satisfied.

Satellite images are transformed into occupancy grids that divide the environment, obstacles (building, trees and pedestrian path etc.,) as black grids and free routes as white grids in order to find an obstacle free path. The proposed navigation control strategy is to localise the AGVs vehicle route until any approaching obstacle is detected and to turn to the safest area before continuing its path. The navigational model was developed in the MATLAB/Simulink 2D virtual environment to visualise the path navigation. Particle swarm optimization and its five variants were used to obtain the obstacle free path. Experiments were conducted in various environments to verify the efficiency and performance of the algorithm.

Implications of emissions analysis’ outcomes for climate and air policy,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100478,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Road transport electrification will form a substantial part of international strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. Targets for electrification of the road-transport sector are often set as the number of electric vehicles to be operating within the fleet by a certain date. There is recognition that timeframes for these transitions matter, but research focuses more on total numbers and upstream power considerations. Outcomes for varied uptake rates are often absent. This analysis builds multiple future electric vehicle uptake scenarios from granular fleet and activity data, using Ireland as the case study. The analysis quantifies the degrees to which the scale of ambition, early or late penetration, and a focus on passenger cars or goods vehicles affects emission outcomes. Results show that a faster electric vehicle uptake more than doubles the cumulative GHG emissions reduction by 2030. E-van and E-truck transitions are also particularly important. Impacts on air pollution are modest due to the continued improvement of Euro-standards. Broader vehicle choice, information campaigns, infrastructure investment, and fiscal policy incentives can all accelerate the rates of fleet change at a cost. Policy must therefore choose where, when, and how much to intervene with incentives, weighing the potential for positive emission outcomes against the level and timing of investment and supports to the market.",2590-1982,Not found
Constructing a network fundamental diagram using a sample of connected vehicles and stationary sensors,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100471,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD can be used to monitor and alleviate traffic congestion. Theoretically, one needs the trajectories of all vehicles in order to accurately estimate the NFD, which is not feasible. One solution is to construct the NFD using a sample of vehicles serving as probes together with an estimated market penetration rate (MPR). In a previous paper, we built a model to first estimate the MPR and then incorporated it in the NFD estimation. That model used data from probe vehicles (trip travel time, origin, destination, and route) and a few traffic count sensors on a hypothetical grid network. The results indicated that sensor locations have a significant impact on the accuracy of the estimated MPR and NFD. In this paper, we extend the model by adding more spatial criteria and test the approach on a real-world calibrated network, namely downtown Los Angeles. We examine the effect of selecting different probe vehicle samples on the model performance. After identifying the spatial rules for selecting sensor locations and the criteria to select probe vehicles, we present a methodology for estimating the NFD producing an acceptable NFD root mean square error. The significance of this study is that first, the model is validated using a real-world calibrated network; second, the data needed for the estimation are highly available, given that with connectivity the location and speed of a sample of vehicles is available; and third, the computational load to select detector locations and probe vehicles is minimum.",2590-1982,Not found
Towards an integrated mobility system: The first and last mile solutions in developing countries; the case study of New Cairo,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100469,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Urban mobility is a huge challenge facing megacities nowadays. Due to the vast urban expansion and the population growth, the transportation network needed to expand and develop to cover the new urban fabrics and connect them to the rest of the city. This expansion and development process is very challenging specially to developing cities. Cairo as a megacity is living this challenge nowadays in several areas. New-Cairo specially has this huge challenge due to its location that connects the New Administrative Capital to the old Capital. The mobility patterns of New Cairo residents, as well as their willingness to use first and last-mile options and its effects onto use mass transit ridership, are being examined through an online survey. A multinomial logit model was then developed to assess the variables affecting the modal choice. As a result of this research, there is an intra-city mobility deficiency that appears in the lack of First and Last miles’ solutions. Based on the analysis results, significant associations were captured between socio-economic variables and the choice of the first/last mile modes. Also, the lack of First and Last mile solutions significantly affects the mass transit ridership. This research acts as a base to explore the approaches of planning an integrated mobility system in developing countries, especially satellite cities. Further research needs to build on this research’s findings and explore the potential solutions for the first and last mile issues.",2590-1982,Not found
Integration of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) into existing transportation services: A focus group study,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100481,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilize new technology that promises to enhance transportation equity, accessibility, and safety; however, their acceptance by consumers, as well as their future performance, is reliant upon the planners understanding the public’s perceptions of the current transportation services. Most of the existing studies that evaluate the public's opinions and perceptions of AV technology were conducted by using stated preference surveys in metropolitan areas with multiple public transit options; little emphasis was given to a qualitative approach that included all of the potential users. This study explores the concerns and preferences of future riders about the integration of a shared self-driving shuttle into an existing ridesharing service in a city with no existing public transit system, multiple population segments, and potential users. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we conducted three focus groups that were comprised of the general public; university faculty, staff, and students; and people with disabilities in Arlington, Texas (n = 24). A content analysis method was implemented to analyze the data and identify the main themes and subthemes related to each discussion.The results revealed that all three groups identified service accessibility, flexibility, and reliability as the factors that most strongly shape the demand for existing transportation services. Additionally, people with disabilities cited the capacity of the existing paratransit service and the lack of access to distant health care facilities as barriers that frequently prevent them from using the service.Participants also expressed their concerns about the proposed shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) service, and while accessibility and safety were the primary concerns, they also worried about the capacity of the service, the trip cost, and provisions for people with disabilities. Participants with disabilities indicated that they would adopt the SAV as long as service planners provide a supportive environment such as access to sidewalks, ramps, and curb cuts in the pick-up and drop-off locations. This study provides insights into transportation strategies that can integrate SAVs into existing on-demand ridesharing services to improve people's mobility needs. To predict the short-term and long-term adoption of an SAV deployment, it is essential to identify the potential users' concerns, preferences, and expectations of self-driving technology. The research findings are expected to support transportation planners and policymakers in their quest to recognize and utilize the most effective ways to promote the efficiency of SAV services.",2590-1982,Not found
What are the changes in LCA passengers' mobility practices? Insights from a European survey,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100477,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Low-cost airlines (LCAs) have been widely explored, but surprisingly, scholars have paid little attention to passengers’ mobility practices and the changes that have occurred since LCAs’ entry into the market. These practices were investigated through a large, in-depth survey amongst departing LCA passengers from Charleroi Airport, Belgium (N = 1471), conducted over six months to minimise seasonality issues. This study captures the profiles of LCA’s passengers and travel practices before and after the entry of LCAs, with a focus on travel frequency, length of stays, travel motives, travel party and accommodation. This study finds that these elements of mobility practices are all closely interrelated and change through time. A new relation to time and space emerges and travel frequencies and length of stays appear to be less differentiated according travel motives. Thereby, very frequent and very short trips are not specific to business trips anymore and they spread to tourism and visiting friends and relative (VFR) motives. However, VFR related trips also show very long stays which balance the general decrease in length of stays. This specific travel motive has risen significantly over the years, inducing other changes such as an increased number of trips made alone and the choice of free accommodation like VFR or own housing contrary to business and tourism motives which remain in more mainstream accommodation choices and travel party. Additionally, it is not those who used to travel a lot by plane in the past who travel a lot with LCAs today. Thus, LCAs’ passengers are either newly mobile or coming from other transport modes implying new or changed mobility practices.",2590-1982,Not found

The research is based on Federal District statistical data and workshops conducted with 243 children who attended a government-run elementary school located in the Plano Piloto of Brasília. Results show 15.8% of children below twelve years old of the 229,073 who attend schools in the Federal District travel to a region far from their local neighbourhoods. 35% of those studying in other regions (22,485) go to the Plano Piloto. Children’s transportation and mobility predominantly among poor elementary school children is highly complex and different from the simple pendulum movement reported in origin–destination surveys. We conclude that the utopia planned for Brasília was not achieved because of the urban structure that banished the poorest people to the periphery, and because of the poor quality of schools in these neighbourhoods.

This study investigated the correlations between personal factors, calculated accessibility (actual distances and travel time), perceived accessibility (residents’ perceived possibility of accessing specific destinations), and sense of accessibility. We conducted an online survey involving residents in the Sendai metropolitan area, Japan, from January 15 to February 9, 2021. The sample size was 1474. We considered previous studies and accessibility-related problems in Japan to determine what destinations and personal attributes the survey would enquire. The estimation results of ordinary regression models demonstrated that personal factors, including self-rated health, living in a central city, household composition, and transportation usage were associated with several measures of sense of accessibility. Good calculated accessibility to stations and food retailers was positively associated with the sense of accessibility without cars. Non-commuting and commuting longer than 30 min were positively associated with the sense of accessibility to what the respondents wanted. Perceived accessibility to important daily life destinations was positively associated with sense of accessibility. The neighborhood social cohesion was partly associated with the current sense of accessibility; however, this association was not observed under the assumption of not having access to a car. The results provide notable findings that connect existing accessibility measures and sense of accessibility in an Asian context.",2590-1982,Not found

The proposed recommender system provides the best solution with respect to three criteria: cost, time, and sustainability, considering the variation in travel time and cost parameters. The decision support tool provides recommendations on the best alternative for transporting products based on factors, such as source and destination locations, time of the day, package weight, and volume. Besides considering existing new technologies like electric-assisted cargo bikes, we also analyze the impact of emerging methods of deliveries, such as robots and air taxis. Finally, this paper also considers the best delivery alternative during the presence of a pandemic, such as COVID-19.

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on transportation employment: A comparative analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100470,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a variety of social, economic, and environmental changes. This paper examines the employment-related impacts of the pandemic on workers in the transportation industry compared to other industries, and within different transportation sectors. We estimated random effects logistic regression models to test the following three hypotheses using the monthly Current Population Survey micro-data. One, the transportation industry experienced a greater incidence of unemployment than other industries. Two, there is heterogeneity in employment impacts within the transportation sector. Three, specific sectors within the transportation industry experienced more employment impacts than other essential industries, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Phase 1a vaccination guidelines. Model results highlight that workers in the transportation sector were 20.6% more likely to be unemployed because of the pandemic than workers in non-transportation industries. Model results also indicate large intra-sector heterogeneities in employment impacts within the transportation sector. Taxi and limousine drivers were 28 times more likely to be unemployed compared to essential workers. Scenic and sightseeing transportation workers were 23.8 times more likely to be unemployed compared to essential workers. On the other end of the spectrum, however, postal workers and pipeline workers were 84% and 67% less likely to be unemployed compared to essential workers, respectively.

Impact of virtual accessibility on out-of-home activity and travel in Indian urban context: A structural equation analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100483,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The innovation in information and communication technology (ICT) by a long shot has changed people's way of life, making it more virtual than genuine. Now India is in a transition phase of adaption of virtual accessibility through an increasing online presence. Multiple initiatives by the Indian government to promote e-services and a cashless economy through mobile apps and websites have supported the shift from physical activity to online activity. According to the internet and mobile association of India (IAMAI) 2016, 69 % of internet users belong from age groups 19–35 in urban India, which establishes the need to study internet use on travel behaviour of the different socio-demographic groups. The focus is on establishing the relation between virtual accessibility, out-of-home activities, and individual mobility. The data collected for this study include the extent of ICT usage, socio-demographic variables and details of participation in activities. The analysis demonstrates the causal link; we were using the structural equation model (SEM) for analysis. Finding revealed a stronger relationship between virtual accessibility and leisure activities. High-income group households are more likely associated with great use of online activities. The younger age population uses a high degree of virtual application. The finding further revealed a negative relationship between ICT and travel. This research also highlights the mediation effect of time use for different activities between virtual accessibility and travel.

Transport represents a core challenge for the attractiveness of universities but also for their ecological footprint. This paper addresses the mobility practices of students and staff at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, through a series of 13 annual surveys. The majority of the university community use public transport, which is explained by investments in infrastructures, the development of their carrying capacity (frequency and size of vehicles) and also the staggering of the start time of classes that has flattened peak hours. The efficiency of public transport and a parking policy have more than halved the modal share of the car. Cycling has experienced a notable growth unlike motorized two-wheelers and walking. The paper then addresses how mobility practices diverge within the university community. Modal choices can be explained when the effects of gender, age, income, territorial context (distance and mobility offer) but also values (as reflected by several differences between faculties) are looked at together. Overall, the paper brings knowledge to the issue of mobility on university campuses and the levers that could turn them into sustainable communities.",2590-1982,Not found

In low- and middle-income countries these are mainly provided by informal sector entrepreneurs. In Pakistan, motorcycle three-wheelers (designed as six-seater, route-based vehicles) provide most rural transport services. Research was undertaken in three districts of Punjab Province, with traffic counts and surveys of transport users. Motorcycles are increasing rapidly, and men’s use of transport services is declining. The traffic counts showed motorcycles for personal and family use carry almost half of the people travelling. Women are increasingly passengers on motorcycles driven by male relatives, but these are seldom available for women’s multipurpose trips during the daytime. On village-to-town roads, motorcycle three-wheelers are the only low-cost (two cents USD per passenger-km) public transport throughout the day. Point-to-point taxis are more costly. Most (55%) of women’s public transport journeys are in three-wheelers. Women and men rate motorcycle three-wheelers highly, particularly their fares and frequency. Women have a greater willingness to pay more for less crowded, safer vehicles than men. It is concluded that the informal sector motorcycle three-wheeler services are optimising village-to-town transport connections, providing the only low-cost travel option for many rural women. Policies should avoid disrupting their vital services. With motorcycle growth undermining transport services, gender-aware strategies should be developed to facilitate frequent, uncrowded three-wheeler operations.",2590-1982,Not found

This study investigates the differences among the various traveler groups (e.g., students, faculty, staff, and visitors) regarding travel mode, travel distance and time, trip production, and distribution. Such exercise could assist campus planners in promoting sustainable transport. Method Towards this, travel patterns of around 2,000 travelers who study, work, live, and visit an urban university campus, namely Sharjah University City in the United Arab Emirates, were assessed. All participants answered a well-designed survey to collect information regarding their socio-demographic characteristics, travel patterns, and trip preferences as they travel daily to the university campus. Results & Findings Analysis of the results helped to confirm some known travel-related patterns on the campus. However, it also helped identify several interesting findings that could be valuable for university officials and planners in their pursuit of making a sustainable campus. For example, most respondents drive alone, as expected in a country with relatively high per capita income. Furthermore, modal-choice differences existed between male and female students; females are generally less receptive to non-motorized transportation, although they tend to use the bus significantly more than male students. On the other hand, male respondents use more active transport modes compared to female respondents. The main obstacles towards sustainable transportation at the campus were the harsh weather conditions and the inconvenient bus services; hence providing more convenient and air-conditioned bus stops may attract many more bus riders. Sadly, some existing bus users indicated that they ride the bus because of economic need rather than a sustainable mode of transport.",2590-1982,Not found
Impacts of shared autonomous vehicles: Tradeoff between parking demand reduction and congestion increase,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100482,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) can have significant impacts on the transport system and land use by replacing private vehicles. Sharing vehicles without drivers is expected to reduce parking demand, and as a side effect, increase congestion owing to the empty fleets made by SAVs picking up travelers and relocating. Although the impact may not be uniform over a region of interest owing to the heterogeneity of travel demand distribution and network configuration, few studies have debated such impact at a local scale, such as in transportation analysis zones (TAZs). To understand the impact in relation to geographical situations, this study aims to estimate the impacts of SAVs at the local scale by simulating their operation on a developed simulator. Using the mainland of Okinawa, Japan as a case study, it was found that parking demand was reduced the most in residence-dominant zones in terms of quantity and office-dominant zones in terms of proportion. As a side effect of replacing private vehicles with SAVs, empty fleets increase congestion, particularly at the periphery of the city. Overall, the results show the heterogeneous impacts of the SAVs at the TAZ level on both land use and traffic, thus suggesting the importance of developing appropriate strategies for urban and transport planning when considering the characteristics of the zones.",2590-1982,Not found

This paper focuses on barriers recognised in wellbeing-related travel by addressing two research questions: 1) Who agree that their wellbeing would increase if they could make more trips? and 2) What are the transport-related barriers identified in making trips important to wellbeing? The analyses are based on a survey conducted in Tampere, Finland in autumn 2020. 484 responses were collected from adults aged 18 and older. The results indicate that having a car and having access to use a car play an important role in wellbeing-related travel. Having a driving licence did not have a similar effect suggesting that driving licence ownership may be more voluntary compared to car ownership or access to car. Many barriers, such as cost of travel, travel time and location of destinations, were identified by those who agree that their wellbeing would increase if they were able to make more trips compared to those who disagreed with the statement. This implies that those who think that their wellbeing could increase with more travel encounter many barriers in travel. It is noted that the survey was planned before the COVID-19 pandemic. During data collection the COVID-19 situation was stable and public transport frequencies were normal. Notwithstanding, given the COVID-19 pandemic, the results may overemphasize importance of car in making trips on wellbeing.

Starting from three contrasting young social milieus from different social classes – cosmopolitans, middle-class and precariat – differences in material mode options and psychological evaluations of transport modes were investigated, which can be understood as (individual and collective) preconditions for participation in certain hegemonic or alternative transport regimes. For this purpose, quantitative data from Germany from the early 2010s of 852 young people aged 17 to 24 were used. As a result, this study contrasts the often-proclaimed linear regime shift towards multimodality, which would treat Millennials as a supposed collective driving force. The data reveal milieu-specific deviations from the predominant transition narrative as follows: First, young cosmopolitans seem to be the only group to share the historically momentous radical emotional distance from private automobility, which is reflected in ‘green’ multimodal behaviours. In contrast, the young middle-class shows signs of (conservatively) reproducing car-oriented behaviours. Finally, the young precariat faces socio-economic restrictions and tends to be outside the dualistic categorisation of automobility/multimodality. In conclusion, we see the concept of social milieus as an important thought-provoking impetus for a necessary change of perspective in international transport and mobility research to make the problem of social division in transportation more visible. If the direction towards multimodality aligns with the normative compass for a socio-ecological transformation, (transport) policies must provide even stronger support to milieu-specific framework conditions.",2590-1982,Not found
Will pedestrians cross the road before an automated vehicle? The effect of drivers’ attentiveness and presence on pedestrians’ road crossing behavior,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100466,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The impact of automated vehicles (AV) on pedestrians’ crossing behavior has been the topic of some recent studies, but findings are still scarce and inconclusive. The aim of this study is to determine whether the drivers’ presence and apparent attentiveness in a vehicle influences pedestrians’ crossing behavior, perceived behavioral control, and perceived risk, in a controlled environment, using a Head-mounted Display in an immersive Virtual Reality study. Twenty participants took part in a road-crossing experiment. The VR environment consisted of a single lane one-way road with car traffic approaching from the right-hand side of the participant which travelled at 30 kmph. Participants were asked to cross the road if they felt safe to do so. The effect of three driver conditions on pedestrians’ crossing behavior were studied: Attentive driver, distracted driver, and no driver present. Two vehicles were employed with a fixed time gap (3.5 s and 5.5 s) between them to study the effects of time gaps on pedestrians’ crossing behavior. The manipulated vehicle yielded to the pedestrians in half of the trials, stopping completely before reaching the pedestrian’s position. The crossing decision, time to initiate the crossing, crossing duration, and safety margin were measured. The main findings show that the vehicle’s motion cues (i.e. the gap between the vehicles, and the yielding behavior of the vehicle) were the most important factors affecting pedestrians’ crossing behavior. Therefore, future research should focus more on investigating how AVs should behave while interacting with pedestrians. Distracted driver condition leads to shorter crossing initiation time but the effect was small. No driver condition leads to smaller safety margin. Findings also showed that perceived behavioral control was higher and perceived risk was significantly lower when the driver appeared attentive. Given that drivers will be allowed to do other tasks while AVs are operating in the future, whether explicit communication will be needed in this situation should be further investigated.",2590-1982,Not found

This sector is mature and heterogeneous, which suggests the need for a more nuanced perspective on socio-technical regimes to understand variation in conditions for adoption of novel technologies that may support sustainability transitions. We consider this important in order to develop more efficient policy to decarbonize the shipping sector. We develop a framework that explicitly differentiates task and institutional environment of user regimes, enabling us to identify regime segmentation and its influence on three key transition conditions: technology maturity and fit, system integration and infrastructure, and acceptability and legitimacy. We apply our framework to analyse development and uptake of battery-electric energy storage solutions within three segments (coastal ferry, coastal fishing, and offshore supply) of Norwegian coastal shipping. Our analysis suggests that the transition process unfolds along different pathways in different user segments, pointing to a need for segment-specific policy instruments.",2590-1982,Not found

An online survey collected quantitative data on self-reported characteristics, speeding behaviors, and roadway behaviors after key events (collisions, speeding tickets) and given passenger presence. Analysis of qualitative data from participants explaining their roadway behaviors and beliefs identified several speeding-related themes. Themes shared to the same extent by all speeder types include not typically citing speeding a cause of a collision and good drivers not needing to change speeding behaviors (i.e., perceived mastery). However, the permanence and extent of speed reductions after key events and with passengers did vary by speeder type, with minor speeders making more extensive and permanent changes. Qualitative and quantitative data both underscore the perception that speeding is not a high priority threat to roadway safety. Findings suggest continued research using conservative and nuanced definitions of speeding is warranted to understand how similar perceptions result in a spectrum of speeding behaviors.",2590-1982,Not found

"Micromobility, Macro Goals: Aligning scooter parking policy with broader city objectives",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100508,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Dockless electric scooters challenge cities seeking to regulate them amidst broader goals such as universal access. Cities are particularly concerned with improper scooter parking, which can impede access by other travelers. Despite an important role that scooter parking plays in both regulations and public discourse, no comprehensive view of current scooter parking regulations exists, nor is it clear how regulations align with broader city objectives. This research asks: how have U.S. cities regulated scooter parking to date and what issues do parking regulations aim to address? Data from 37 U.S. cities show that while areas of widespread agreement exist—nearly all (95%) cities allow scooters to park in the furniture zone—a wide range in scooter parking requirements exists. About three quarters of cities allow scooters to park at bike racks (78%) and against buildings (70%), while fewer than two-thirds allow scooters to park either on landscaping (62%) or against signs (60%). Even among cities with similar regulations, however, considerable nuance exists. Interviews with staff from six U.S. cities and existing research highlight motivations for scooter parking regulations. The regulations employed—and the high degree of variability across cities—yield implications for scooter parking policies, as well as scooters’ role in advancing broader city objectives. Scooter parking regulations play an important role in access, but cities should approach regulations as just one piece within a broader agenda of reclaiming streets for people and promoting mobility, sustainability, and access for all.",2590-1982,Not found
App-based automatic collection of travel behaviour: A field study comparison with self-reported behaviour,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100501,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Smart phone apps hold great promise for travel behaviour research, but theirperformance relative to traditional methods is still not well understood. The aim of thisstudy is to evaluate the magnitude and direction of differences between travel behaviour from a completely automatic travel mode detection mobile app and a traditional travel behaviour survey. We present data from n = 230 participants who used the app (sense.dat) for four weeks. Participantsalso completed a one-daytravel diary and one-week retrospective account of cycling and walkingin the same period.Correspondence between app and survey varied across levels of aggregation and modalities. Overall, the app recorded substantially more km, minutes and non-zero trip days than the one-day survey, but when split up by mode this was not true for public transport. On the individual level there was atendency for the app to register modes not self-reported by the respondents for allmodes except public transport, possibly indicating that the app captures trips that theuser may have forgot or intentionally left out.For bike, car and foot, the Spearman correlations between app and survey registered (one-day)distances and durations were moderate (r > 0.5) or strong (r > 0.8) when based onobservations that were non-zero in both data sources, and moderate or weak whenbased on all observations.

Blue collar laborers’ travel pattern recognition: Machine learning classifier approach,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100506,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This paper proposes a pattern recognition model to develop clusters of homogenous activities for blue-collar workers in the State of Qatar. The activity-based data from the travel diary of 1051 blue-collar workers collected by the Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MoTC) in Qatar was used for analysis. A pattern recognition model is applied to a revealed preference (RP) survey obtained from the Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MoTC) in Qatar for the travel diary for blue-collar workers. Raw data preprocessing and outliers detection and filtering algorithms were applied at the first stage of the analysis, and consequently, an activity-based travel matrix was developed for each household. The research methodology undertaken in this paper comprises a combination of different machine learning techniques, predominantly by applying clustering and classification methods. A bagged Clustering algorithm was employed to identify the number of clusters, then the C-Means algorithm and the Pamk algorithm were implemented to validate the results. Meanwhile, the interdependencies between the resulted clusters and the socio-demographic attributes for the households were examined using crosstabulation analysis. The study results show significant diversity amongst the clusters in terms of trip purpose, modal split, destination choice, and occupation. Furthermore, whilst the Bagged Clusters and Pamk Clusters techniques on the three attributes yielded similar results, the Cmeans Clusters differed significantly in a number of the clusters. Applying such pattern recognition models on big and complex activity datasets could assist transport planners to understand the travel needs of segments of the population well and formulating better-informed strategies.",2590-1982,Not found
COVID-19 repatriation programs — Classification and optimization models,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100499,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent measures to control the spread of the virus by border closure and suspension of commercial flights, decision-makers in several countries had to deal with one or more forms of repatriation problems, international and domestic. In addressing an international repatriation problem, a country must schedule flights to return its citizens. Typically, the flight schedules of commercial airlines are announced, and passengers buy their seats accordingly. However, in repatriation, the opposite happens: citizens express their wishes to return to their countries, and flights need to be scheduled. Due to several constraints, decision-makers should repatriate the most vulnerable citizens first. In this work, we offer an overview of repatriation problems from an optimization perspective by visiting real-life cases. We compare the Indian and Jordanian repatriation programs to find similarities and differences between the two. We also develop several mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) to model different repatriation phases and solve respective illustrative examples to demonstrate the use of the MILPs. Last, we solve two stages of a problem that resembles Jordan’s actual repatriation program. Decision-makers and researchers may use and extend this summary and the optimization models for any future pandemic that might lead to border closures and new repatriation problems.",2590-1982,Not found
Multitasking onboard of conventional transport modes and shared autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100505,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"To mitigate the negative impact of travel time, travelers are predisposed to multitask onboard when traveling. The preferences of people determine how the travel time is utilized. Travelers try to minimize the unused part of travel time or convert it into a productive time by doing onboard activities and choosing the proper transport mode. Current study focuses on the travelers’ behavior onboard when traveling to their main destinations. The research studies the urban areas where the travel time is relatively short. Generally, most studies examine multitasking onboard of one or more conventional transport modes (CTMs) without defining the area type of the trips. Moreover, there is a demand on those papers that concern multitasking onboard of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Thus, current research focuses on one case of AVs while studying onboard multitasking, i.e., the shared autonomous vehicle (SAV). A survey is designed and distributed in Budapest, Hungary, and a sample size of 276 travelers is collected. Respondents choose the onboard activities and the tools that are carried and used onboard during their travel. The onboard activities are examined with SAV. During the analysis, the following methods are used: multiple response analysis, central tendency, Chi-square, Cramer's V, Cochran's Q test, and A Kruskal-Wallis. As a result of analyzing the differences between the activities onboard of SAVs and CTMs, the factors that affect onboard activities are found. Factors influencing the usage of the travelers’ carried tools and those that negatively affect the travel time and the acceptability of SAVs are identified, too. In conclusion, travelers’ onboard behavior is studied, and it is found that SAVs are preferred over CTMs to maximize the onboard activities and consequentially, increase the utilities.",2590-1982,Not found

The automotive maintenance and repair (M&R) sector will experience the effects of such transitions in the long term. This paper assesses the research in the road transport to derive the factors that may influence the M&R demand based on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) uptake. Starting from current scientific research and grounded on interviews with experts, the paper reviews major drivers influencing M&R demand and provides indications on possible future effects. While for BEVs, previous work has been conducted to estimate the M&R cost variations, the research addressing the impacts of AVs deployment on the M&R sector is at its incipient stage, hence the views of experts were paramount to shed light on this topic. We identified a scientific consensus that BEVs have less M&R requirements compared with Conventional Vehicles (CVs). For AVs, our analysis and expert views identify some important factors influencing M&R requirements: hardware components, software that enables autonomy, the rise in vehicle kilometres travelled leading to higher wear and tear of replaceable parts, the need for adequate cleaning services, especially for fleets and shared vehicles. Further work should look at the impact of regulations and the non-insurable risks linked to M&R requirements.",2590-1982,Not found

"Canadian transit agencies response to COVID-19: Understanding strategies, information accessibility and the use of social media",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100465,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Over the past few months, transit agencies across Canada have been rushed to implement a range of strategies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with no standardized guidelines to direct their efforts. This study explores the initial response of transit agencies serving the 25 most populous Canadian cities by understanding the distinct types of response measures implemented between March 1st and June 1st, 2020. It also explores to what extent information related to these measures was accessible and usable, and how transit agencies used social media to communicate their efforts to the public. To achieve these goals, a detailed review of Canadian transit agencies websites and social media accounts was performed. The findings suggest that larger transit agencies across Canada implemented the most measures to respond to COVID-19, but not necessarily provided the most accessible information regarding the measures. Overall, while all transit agencies reduced the offered service’s frequency and capacity and enhanced vehicle cleaning, the implementation of other physical and communication measures varied considerably between agencies. Information related to the number of COVID-19 cases within the workforce was least accessible across agencies. Transit agencies’ Twitter platforms were used more by larger agencies. While most of transit agencies tend to employ tweets that include some type of graphics, very few agencies employed videos and animations to communicate important information to the public. This paper provides transit planners and policymakers with comprehensive information regarding the initial response of Canadian transit agencies to maintain operations in such critical times.",2590-1982,Not found

Excessive or misleading signals can increase response times and decrease their response rates. We used reports from the Aviation Safety Reporting System and structured interviews to understand the complexity of the controller’s tasks in the context of potentially high-consequence situations and events, and to develop design strategies to enhance the effectiveness of signals in the ATC environment. Methods We reviewed ASRS reports over a 6-year interval from 2015 to 2020, searching for reports that mentioned alarm, alert, or warning and were submitted by air traffic controllers. We found 370 relevant reports that we analyzed for hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections. Structured interviews with former controllers further explored the role of signals in air traffic control. Results The most common signals in reports were MSAW (139), ASDE-X and ASSC (27), CA (195), and AMASS (4). ASDE-X, ASSC, or AMASS were mentioned in 30 reports by ground or local controllers. TRACON controllers reported events involving MSAW 70 times and CA 51 times; these were also implicated by local controllers. CA was most mentioned, cited a total of 195 times in the reports. Conclusions This information may help us to develop strategies that can enhance signaling modality (e.g., new auditory, visual, and tactile signals). Trust in automation may be improved by using strategies such as indicating the automation’s level of confidence in situations like impending loss of separation.",2590-1982,Not found
What encourages people to carpool?

Literature has called for a better understanding of psychological factors encouraging people to carpool however current research does not provide an in-depth psychological understanding of carpooling behaviour. This paper provides a review of psychological factors motivating drivers and passengers to carpool and identifies psychological theories appropriate for carpooling research. The Theory of Planned Behaviour and Norm-Activation Model were used as a priori theoretical frameworks to undertake a systematic literature review to identify important factors and relevant theories. Eighteen psychological factors were identified and classified as either common for drivers and passengers or specific to each group. In addition to the a priori frameworks, Consumer Perceived Value, Social Capital, and Technology Acceptance Model are considered the most appropriate for carpooling research. A conceptual framework and six research propositions were developed. Further, eight additional directions for future research were suggested including employing a variety of data collection methods to ensure rigour; collecting more data from non-Western countries for contextual veracity; exploring and testing psychological factors more deeply; and investigating the impact of COVID-19 on carpooling decisions. This paper contributes to theory through the development of the conceptual framework, identifying research propositions and providing additional research directions.

Developing a holistic decision support framework: From production logistics to sustainable freight transport in an urban environment,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100496,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"In recent years, policy makers as well as urban logistics and transport research have investigated how to reduce environmental impact from transportation in urban areas. Therefore, many new frameworks that can help a specific actor in its decision making process at a certain decision making level (i.e., business or policy level) have been implemented and published. However, the first screening of existing literature did not reveal frameworks that can be used across different decision making levels. This limits the possibility for actors using the same infrastructure but not necessarily co-operate to discuss how the actions and needs of each actor of different decision making levels mutually influence each other. This paper first presents an outcome of a literature review and analysis of existing research project results before. It combines these to a multi-layer framework that can enhance collaborative decision-making and seamless aggregation of performance measures such as environmental impact from multiple transportation activities in and around urban areas. For this multi-layer framework, factors are identified, and possible relationships across the various layers are indicated. The field of application is the area near urban manufacturing sites and specifically addressing all actors that share on regulate infrastructure relevant to last mile inbound logistics. The source of data is project databases as well as for the literature review research databases. The methodology applied is a combination of a literature review based on database entries and a snowball approach. The article also presents how the framework can be prototypically implemented in participatory simulations using a simplified example. Potential usage for establishing holistic urban mobility structures is also discussed.",2590-1982,Not found
Post COVID-19 teleworking and car use intentions. Evidence from large scale GPS-tracking and survey data in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100498,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This study examines the changes in teleworking during the lockdown in April 2020 and the intention to change commuting behaviour after COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Survey data of 1,515 Dutch employees and large-scale smartphone-based GPS-data of the same participants before and during COVID-19 is used. The probability of increasing teleworking during COVID-19 is estimated using an ordinal logistic regression model, considering sociodemographic characteristics, the initial travel behaviour and the initial work situation as determining factors. Two binary logistic regression models are developed to analyse whether employees expect to continue teleworking after the COVID-19 pandemic and whether they will decrease car use for commuting. Both models consider teleworking and car use intentions in the context of behavioural changes during COVID-19. The main factors that influenced teleworking during the lockdown are job characteristics. Office workers and teaching staff were more likely to increase the amount of time spent working from home and showed a higher chance of changes in daily commuting routines. After COVID-19, office workers expect to increase teleworking. The results suggest that employees with a relatively large change in teleworking during the early lockdown expect to work from home more frequently after COVID-19. This effect is strengthened further by positive experiences with teleworking (i.e. more pleasure and higher productivity) and supporting policy measures by the employer, such as sufficient ICT facilities. The main conclusion related to intended changes in mode choice is that car use for commuting is expected to decrease after COVID-19, mostly because of an increase in teleworking.",2590-1982,Not found
Understanding different car users as starting point for future mobility concepts – A co-creation approach,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100485,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The car is still the most used mean of transport in many countries around the world. To reach sustainability, though, reducing motorized transport is a necessity. It is therefore important to understand and address the perspective of car users when developing alternative mobility concepts. Debates around new mobility concepts are often led from a quite technical perspective. When dealing with transformation processes in mobility, however, we are not only confronted with technical challenges, but also with questions regarding the people who are concerned. Therefore, this article aims to contribute to the current discussion by examining mobility logics and requirements that underlie users’ travel behavior. The empirical study examines everyday life mobility using a qualitative, participatory approach. This transdisciplinary approach brings together scientific and non-scientific bodies of knowledge and is situated at the interface of technology development and sociological mobility research. The results indicate that visions of future concepts are strongly shaped by experiences and expectations related to users’ lives.

Truck travel time performance measures and their association with on- and off-network characteristics,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100500,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Trucks transport a significant amount of freight and are susceptible to traffic congestion related delays. Practitioners are interested in identifying suitable truck travel time performance measures and examining their association with on-network (road) and surrounding off-network (land use and demographic) characteristics for planning, designing, and building better transportation facilities. The focus of this research is on the investigation of truck travel time performance measures and their association with on-/off-network characteristics using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. Truck travel time data for the year 2019 and on-network and off-network characteristics captured using geospatial methods were considered for 501 links in Mecklenburg County, Buncombe County, and Wake County in North Carolina, USA for this research. The average travel time (ATT), planning time index (PTI), buffer time index (BTI), and travel time index (TTI) were selected based on the correlations within the truck travel time performance measures. Road functional class, number of through lanes, area type, annual average daily traffic (AADT), and speed limit are significantly but lowly associated with the truck travel time performance measures. The agriculture, light commercial, and residential land uses in the near vicinity have a moderate to strong association with the truck travel time performance measures. The associations varied with the truck travel time performance measure, day of the week, time of the day, and buffer width to capture off-network characteristics. The methodology and findings assist in identifying potential corridors/areas for the implementation of truck exclusive lanes, truck signal priority at intersections, decentralized delivery locations, or other unconventional strategies.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring neighbourhood-level mobility inequity in Chicago using dynamic transportation mode choice profiles,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100489,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This paper develops a method to dynamically model urban passenger mode trade-offs at fine-grained spatial and temporal scales using data from OpenTripPlanner (OTP) and the City of Chicago’s Transportation Network Providers (TNP) dataset. This approach can be used to calculate dynamic modal cost-distance trade-offs for specific times, routes, and geographic areas of interest, providing a framework for creating aggregate mode choice profiles for individual cities and neighbourhoods that can be used to assess structural differences in transportation investment and mobility, as well as to test various assumptions about travel behaviour, observe temporal changes in modal trade-offs, and model the system-wide implications of changes to the transportation system to modal trade-offs. Using this dynamic mode choice framework, this paper explores the features underlying observed structural heterogeneity in the ratio of cost to distance (i.e., speed or potential mobility) for observed flows across the city for each mode. It finds that Census tracts with larger proportions of Black and Hispanic population tend to have significantly larger cost-distance ratios (i.e., slower speeds/lower potential mobility) for non-auto modes, while Census tracts with higher proportions of “creative class” employment and features of walkable built environments have significantly lower cost-distance ratios (i.e., faster speeds/higher potential mobility).",2590-1982,Not found

The differences between the two models are discussed in general and in light of the ongoing trend toward more sustainable and transparent business models, thus focusing on the customer perspective. A quantitative empirical study was conducted to assess the perception of the two airline business models. Additionally, an analysis of changing flyer behavior owing to the COVID-19 crisis was conducted, and the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the airline industry was evaluated. Using a sample of self-reported frequent flyers (n = 99), the present study used a correlative approach to evaluate the relationship between the individual variables. Among the core findings of the study were that CSR plays an important role in the mindset of passengers, especially with respect to philanthropic and legal responsibility, and that during the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about ecological responsibility gained momentum. Apparently, COVID-19 did not cause a demand shift within business models, and no differences in passengers’ perceptions regarding CSR were detected among models. However, significant differences between low-cost and full-service airlines were found regarding their respective perceived cost structures. Passengers are aware of this difference, which implies that they might see fare differences up to 30% as reasonable.",2590-1982,Not found
Structural equation modeling of public transport use with COVID-19 precautions: An extension of the norm activation model,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100474,12,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This study aims to identify the travelers’ attitudes and preferences towards the use of public transport during COVID-19 through the Norm-Activation Model (NAM). A questionnaire survey was designed to assess the traveler’s awareness, sense of responsibility, and moral obligations to comply with safety norms or guidelines while using public transport in Lahore, Pakistan. The Structural Equation Modeling method was applied to analyze the collected 1516 complete responses. The survey results and measurement equations confirmed the association between observed and corresponding latent variables. The results of SEM revealed that the travelers’ Awareness of Consequences (AC) and Ascription of Responsibility (AR) are positively correlated with Personal Norms (PN), whereas attitudes towards public transport are negatively related to the PN. The perceived behavioral control (PBC) and PN have negative structural correlations with public transport use. However, the attitudes towards public transport are strong predictors of travelers’ behavior towards public transport. The current motorcycle users and high-income people have low preferences, whereas current users of public transport modes and middle-income people have high preferences to choose public transport during a pandemic. The travelers’ perceived difficulty of complying with safety guidelines while traveling, such as wearing a facemask, use of sanitizers, and maintaining a social distance, have a significant impact on their public transport use. The travelers’ better awareness, responsibility, and trust in using public transport may have a strong influence on their preferences towards public transport during a pandemic situation.",2590-1982,Not found

Sixteen questions are asked indicating different socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the respondents towards their choice between motorbike and car ride-sourcing: two most popular ride-sourcing services in Bangladesh. A Bivariate-ordered Probit Model has been used to model jointly their choices towards ride-sourcing services. The outcomes indicate that people with certain types of socio-demographic background prefer to use motorcycles over cars for ride-sourcing and vice-versa. The result also shows that gender, household density, income, educational qualification, and smart-phone usage have a propensity to increase ride-sourcing choice towards both motorbikes and cars.

Exploratory factor analysis was then used to validate the measurement and a general linear model was carried out to examine the impacts of customer participation and service failure on customer recovery satisfaction. The results showed that when the failure was due to the COVID-19, the highest customer satisfaction occurred when customers jointly participated in service recovery. This study also revealed that increasing customer participation during the service failure due to pilots on strike resulted in decreased customer recovery satisfaction.

UK anxiety is high with lockdowns preventing a normal way of life for over a year. A lack of ability to travel freely causes numerous declines in quality of life including social isolation and poor physical and mental health. People need crowding information to choose safer travel options and subdue coronavirus. To provide effective guidance, it is essential to empirically formulate messaging to create clarity and trust which can be acted upon in confidence. Behaviour Change Techniques incorporating the Behaviour Change Wheel and COM-B model have been utilised in vast areas of public health intervention development and messaging. There is consensus that public transport information needs to be clearer and more accessible but BCTs have not been utilised in the development of public transport advice. This paper outlines the development of crowding messaging for public transport on a platform available to UK travellers. Barriers and facilitators were explored; related behaviours, intervention functions and behaviour change techniques were mapped. Specific message phrasing was developed utilising the mapped functions and advice from the literature. With the COVID-19 outbreak, having accessible and effective messaging for safely using public transport is a continuation of the work recently conducted examining the best ways to present public health information.

A Non-parametric Bayesian Network for multivariate probabilistic modelling of Weigh-in-Motion System Data,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100552,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems help to collect data such as vehicular loads, individual axle loads, vehicle type, and number of axles. This is relevant in engineering because traffic load performs an essential function in the design of new bridges and in the reliability assessment of existing ones, in traffic analysis and other areas of engineering. Therefore, when WIM data is not available, computing synthetic WIM observations that adequately approximate the statistical dependence between variables is important. In this paper, WIM measurements from the Netherlands and Brazil were analysed, and a set of non-parametric Bayesian Networks (NPBNs) is presented. This paper significantly improves on previous results by allowing observations of inter-axial distance to be generated, by allowing several sources of data to be used in the modelling and by making software available to researchers and practitioners interested for generating synthetic observations based on the distribution of vehicle type. In particular, statistical models to describe the weight and length of different vehicle types are derived. Three NPBNs were quantified using data from: (i) six WIM locations of the motorway network of the Netherlands, (ii) one WIM location in one city route of Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and (iii) one WIM location of one highway in Araranguá city located in the south of Brazil. Additionally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the six Dutch WIM motorways locations was developed. To illustrate a possible use of the model when WIM data is not available. The GUI was used to compute synthetic WIM observations using data collected through traffic counters gathered in Toluca city in central Mexico, as input. This paper shows that the methodology here presented is widely applicable and depends only on the assessment of vehicle type configuration.",2590-1982,Not found
"Portraying perceptions of bike-sharing schemes (BSS) in Santiago, Chile: What both regular users and pedestrians tell us",10.1016/j.trip.2021.100534,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper focuses on portraying experiences and interactions of pedestrians and users of bicycle-sharing schemes (BSS) in the city of Santiago (Chile), where cycling is becoming an increasingly relevant transport mode. The methodology employed an adaptation of content analysis (CA) to assess the testimonies of two focus groups, one composed by regular users of BSS and the other by pedestrians. The findings show that BSS seem to operate in a domain distinct from Santiagós current transport regime, including cycling. Individuals perceive that BSS were mostly used by affluent people and these schemes were of little help in poor areas. However, rather than attributing these problems to long-standing inequalities affecting the city, interviewees attributed them to their personal preferences, characteristics and capabilities (not being lucky enough to live in rich zones or being able to cycle more often). Finally, conflicts between bike-sharing users and pedestrians were rarely mentioned explicitly. .",2590-1982,Not found
"Motorized travel mode choices of smallholder farmers in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100569,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The poor quality of rural road infrastructure may limit the transport services available to rural dwellers. The objective of this study is to understand the travel choices made by rural smallholder farmers in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria in the face of poor rural road infrastructure. The study uses an existing sampling frame of smallholder farmers obtained from the World Bank-supported Fadama III Project in Akwa Ibom State, and employs multistage sampling to generate data. According to the data, motorcycles are the most owned means of transportation in the study area, and also the most used – even by persons who do not own any means of transportation. Further, we employ the multinomial logit model to examine the factors that influence their choices of means of transportation, and we use motorcycle as the reference category. The result shows that the preference of respondents for the different means of transportation is influenced mainly by the attributes of the means of transportation. In addition, among the socio-economic variables included in the model, only the coefficient of income under saloon cars is significant. Given that motorcycles and tricycles are now dominating the rural transport landscape as an economical way to meet the transport needs of people, rural transport policy in Nigeria should be revised to reflect this reality. The operation of motorcycles and tricycles should be properly mainstreamed in rural transport policy to improve rural transport services.",2590-1982,Not found
Impact of mobility on COVID-19 spread – A time series analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100567,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"In this paper, we investigate the impact of mobility on the spread of COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran. We have performed a time series analysis between the indicators of public transit use and inter-city trips on the number of infected people. Our results showed a significant relationship between the number of infected people and mobility variables with both short-term and long-term lags. The long-term effect of mobility showed to have a consistent lag correlation with the weekly number of new COVID-19 positive cases. In our statistical analysis, we also investigated key non-transportation variables. For instance, the mandatory use of masks in public transit resulted in observing a 10% decrease in the number of infected people. In addition, the results confirmed that super-spreading events had significant increases in the number of positive cases. We have also assessed the impact of major events and holidays throughout the study period and analyzed the impacts of mobility patterns in those situations. Our analysis shows that holidays without inter-city travel bans have been associated with a 27% increase in the number of weekly positive cases. As such, while holidays decrease transit usage, it can overall negatively affect spread control if proper control measures are not put in place. The result and discussions in this paper can help authorities understand the effects of different strategies and protocols with a pandemic control and choose the most beneficial ones.",2590-1982,Not found
"Park-and-ride facility location optimization: A case study for Nashville, Tennessee",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100578,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Strategic placement of park-and-ride (P&R) facilities is important to ensure the facilities are effectively utilized by commuters, avoiding oversubscription or underutilization after placement. This study develops a framework that integrates a demand model and an optimization model to study the optimal placement of P&R facilities to maximize the total number of commuters who switch from single occupancy vehicles to public transit. The framework first develops a P&R demand model through a discrete choice model, specifically the multinomial logit model, to characterize the mode choice behavior of individuals in a multimodal network. Next, it leverages the estimated proportion of commuters that are expected to switch to P&Rs from alternatives in a mixed integer linear programming optimization model to prescribe the optimal locations of P&R facilities. This study also accounts for practical considerations and introduces an approach to estimate the potentially unknown demand for P&R facilities. The framework is applied through a case study for the City of Nashville, a major metropolitan area in the State of Tennessee, US. Model calibration is performed using the literature and available data at Nashville. The results of the case study are then presented and sensitivity analysis is performed to provide further insights. The results of the case study suggest that the optimal placement of P&R facilities has the potential to improve the network performance, and reduce emission and vehicle kilometer traveled.",2590-1982,Not found
"Amending the heston stochastic volatility model to forecast local motor vehicle crash rates: A case study of Washington, D.C.",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100576,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Modelling crash rates in an urban area requires a swathe of data regarding historical and prevailing traffic volumes and crash events and characteristics. Provided that the traffic volume of urban networks is largely defined by typical work and school commute patterns, crash rates can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, this process becomes more complicated for an area that is frequently subject to peaks and troughs in traffic volume and crash events owing to exogenous events – for example, extreme weather – rather than typical commute patterns. One such area that is particularly exposed to exogenous events is Washington, D.C., which has seen a large rise in crash events between 2009 and 2020. In this study, we adopt a forecasting model that embeds heterogeneity and temporal instability in its estimates in order to improve upon forecasting models currently used in transportation and road safety research. Specifically, we introduce a stochastic volatility model that aims to capture the nuances associated with crash rates in Washington, D.C. We determine that this model can outperform conventional forecasting models, but it does not perform well in light of the unique travel patterns exhibited throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, its adaptability to the idiosyncrasies of Washington, D.C. crash rates demonstrates its ability to accurately simulate localised crash rates processes, which can be further adapted in public policy contexts to form road safety targets.",2590-1982,Not found
Jet-setting during COVID-19: Environmental implications of the pandemic induced private aviation boom,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100575,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the nature of air travel throughout the world. One notable change in air travel is the significant increase in the use of private aviation relative to commercial air travel. Although some of the initial environmental impacts of COVID-19 transportation disruptions have been previously examined, little attention has been given to changes in private aviation usage. In general, there is a lack of academic literature that addresses private aviation operations and its impact on emissions. The purpose of this study is to fill that gap by analyzing the environmental implications of the COVID-19 induced shift toward private aviation in the U.S. We find that the number of private aviation flights in the U.S. increased by 20% after the beginning of the pandemic, which resulted in an increase of CO2-equivalent emissions by 23%. Further, analyses of long-run scenarios suggest that overall private air travel emissions will likely exceed 770 megatons of CO2-equivalent in the next three years.",2590-1982,Not found
Unpacking transportation barriers and facilitators to accessing health care: Interviews with care coordinators,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100565,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Care coordinators—which include social workers, nurses, and other professionals who address health-related social needs—have unique perspectives on transportation barriers to health care. They understand both the transportation challenges that individuals may face, and also the facilitators (i.e., solutions) available to help overcome these challenges. We conducted in-depth interviews with care coordinators in North Carolina to expound upon the multiple transportation barriers to accessing health care identified in previous studies, as well as the specific facilitators being employed to alleviate them. Analyzing these interviews using a flexible coding approach, we found that no single facilitator can address all of the various transportation barriers. Instead a multi-pronged approach is required. The findings also provide insights on how care coordinators can broaden their support offered to individuals experiencing transportation barriers to accessing health care.",2590-1982,Not found
Benchmarking the recovery of air travel demands for US airports during the COVID-19 Pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100570,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The aviation industry has gone through numerous ups and downs in the past decades. Despite the devastating damage caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, the aviation industry worldwide still manages to bounce back from the abyss of Q2, 2020, though the speed of recovery is less than satisfactory for most regions. Being aware of the existing literature on air travel demands published since March 2020, this study aims to provide US Primary Hub airports with benchmarks that can help airports predict the recovery of air travel demand during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This study uses the passenger numbers going through airport security checkpoints as the input data and the k-shape clustering algorithm to group airports by their travel demand recovery patterns. The clustering analysis results are presented in a circular dendrogram so that any of the 118 subject airports can quickly locate their benchmarking airports. In this process, the geographic location and hub category of an airport are found to play important roles in determining how local outbound traffic recovers during the Pandemic. We also test if state political preference in the 2020 Presidential Election affects local airport traffic but cannot find any convincing results. The method used by this study can be fed with up-to-date data to produce more timely and reliable results to guide airports and other stakeholders through the recovery journey.",2590-1982,Not found
Development of a simulation-based experimental research framework for the characterization of cannabis-related driving impairment,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100561,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Recreational use of cannabis has been recently legalized in Canada, however, its impact on driving performance and safety is not well-defined. One experimental tool that can be implemented to better examine the link between cannabis use and driving impairment is driving simulation. Customized driving scenarios can be created to target and evaluate hypothesized effects of cannabis on driving behaviors. This paper presents a framework for the evidence-based design of driving scenarios that aim to characterize cannabis-related driving impairment. The framework begins by considering the effects of cannabis on sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities, as well as how impairments in these abilities could negatively affect driving performance. Next, we examine how these negative effects on driving could be measured in a controlled, repeatable, and safe manner using simulators, to map the specific effects of cannabis on particular aspects of driving performance. Last, we describe how customized driving simulator scenario elements could be designed to challenge the targeted driving abilities that are affected by cannabis. In addition to detailing this experimental framework, a prototype scenario developed for DriverLab at KITE - Toronto Rehabilitation Institute is presented, but the expectation is that the proposed approaches could be broadly implemented across a range of simulators.",2590-1982,Not found

In particular, the personality trait desire for control may influence the acceptance of AVs, which has received scant research attention to date. Therefore, we independently carried out two questionnaire studies: Study 1 in Germany and Study 2 in the U.S. In both studies, we applied the self-driving car acceptance scale (SCAS) and the desirability of control scale (DoCS). In Study 1, we queried 114 participants (60 female) and in Study 2 we sampled data from 601 participants (322 female). In both studies, our findings consistently indicate that the overall DoCS factor was not associated with the overall SCAS factor. We only uncovered a weak positive correlation in Study 1, but only for a reduced overall acceptance factor with 10 items obtained by factor analyses instead of the 24 items of the SCAS. Furthermore, our results revealed that women assign significantly lower ratings to the overall acceptance factor of AVs as well as to the desirability for control factor than men, both in Germany and in the U.S., respectively. Despite the influence of gender on acceptance of AVs and DoCS, we conclude that there might be either no or only a weak association between desire for control and acceptance of AVs, which needs to be further investigated in future studies.",2590-1982,Not found

Empirical data consist of policy documents and qualitative interviews with bicycle logistics entrepreneurs and local policy actors from four Swedish municipalities which are all known for their ambitious strategies for sustainable transport. The paper leads to insights into a variety of challenges facing the introduction of bicycle logistics in urban environments but points also to possibilities and key issues for the further development of these types of concepts. Among these are the importance of targeted initiatives and support for new concepts for sustainable urban freight, but also conscious strategies for infrastructure development and a more well-informed use of public procurement processes. In addition, the study confirms the importance of norms, attitudes and knowledge among policy makers, planners and potential customers about bicycle logistics and its potential for urban areas.",2590-1982,Not found
County-level crash prediction models for Pennsylvania accounting for income characteristics,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100562,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The majority of current safety prediction models utilize roadway and traffic data as independent variables to describe safety performance at a microscopic level. Recent work moves toward predicting these measures within some region as a function of roadway and traffic data, as well as non-traditional variables, such as socioeconomic measures. This paper aims to provide a holistic view of the intersection of socioeconomics and safety in Pennsylvania by investigating possible relationships between wealth and various aspects of safety performance, including crash frequency, severity, and cost. The analyses presented in this paper serve as case studies with intentions to promote the development of more robust, wealth-inclusive safety analyses in the future. The study reveals relationships between socioeconomic-related measures and crash frequency, severity, and cost estimations. These relationships indicate counties with increased levels of socioeconomic distress (quantified by multiple socioeconomic-related variables) are estimated to experience more crashes – particularlyrelated to alcohol usage – and higher total crash costs, and crashes that occur in counties with increased levels of socioeconomic distress are estimated to be more likely to result in an increased injury severity level compared to crashes that occur elsewhere. These resultssupport previous work andexpand on that work by considering multiple socioeconomic-related variables and their impacts on three unique safety-related measures. The existence of a relationship between crash frequency, severity, and cost and wealth-related variables opens the door to further exploration of including wealth in traditional safety analyses. This paper discusses these relationships and offers recommendations for future work.",2590-1982,Not found

Data collection was based on a survey, applied in the two largest cities of Brazil (São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and Portugal (Lisbon and Porto). The dataset was processed considering only two categories of respondents (i.e., potential users and regular users) and then four machine learning models (K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) were applied to predict shopping by bike or kick-scooter. In terms of all performance measures, the Support Vector Machine model was the optimum. The results indicate that people are willing to transport lightweight goods by bike or kick-scooter, as long as the infrastructure is safe and comfortable.

Service contracting as a policy response for public transport recovery during the Covid-19 Pandemic: A preliminary evaluation,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100559,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"We examine and assess the service contracting (SC) program implemented for the first time in Metro Manila, Philippines as a response to the impact of the pandemic on road-based public transport sector. We develop an evaluation framework, consisting of three indicators: social amelioration, increase in transport supply and performance improvement. These indicators are the purported objectives of SC. Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, our evaluation suggests that although SC has brought positive impact in terms of the first two indicators, there is no robust evidence so far that may suggest that SC has improved the performance of public transport service delivery. We also find that while the primary objective of providing social amelioration to affected operators is appropriate during the time of the pandemic, this has also brought challenges in financially sustaining the program and in effecting improvements to public transport services. Our work aims to contribute as an empirical case study on the upsides and downsides of service contracting implemented as a business model for public transport provision during the pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found
Use of GPS-data to improve transport solutions in a cost and environmental perspective,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100557,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"In this paper we have utilised GPS data as a base to track truck movements and analyse transport activities.

The information gained from GPS-data helps firms such as a fruit and vegetables wholesaler to gain better insights into their transport solution and operations from a cost and environmental perspective. This also means that the current analysis remains useful for the transporting company in making strategic decisions as to when and where they should engage in other transport assignments to improve the load factors on their trucks. This paper presents that the picture the decision-makers had prior to GPS data being used was different from the real situation, and the insights gained lead to new knowledge and actions.

Cogenerative and photovoltaic scenarios have been considered varying the power size and the presence of a storage system. A computational model, based on maritime traffic and meteorological data over a one-year period, returns the percentages of the energy covered by the plant, the grid and the storage system. Environmental analysis shows that the grid-connected cold ironing scenario reduces the CO2 emissions by 34.5% compared to on-board diesel generators emissions.

Firstly, a head-up display was used to support the regular turn signal. Secondly, the meaning of regular turn signals has been revisited and enhanced semantics that distinguish between planning and starting a manoeuvre were proposed and assessed. A driving simulator study with N = 52 participants was carried out to investigate the effect of using an Augmented Reality Head-Up Display (AR-HUD) and the enhanced semantics on cooperation. Similarly, the effect on clarity and the general experience of the situation were explored. The results suggest that both approaches are promoting permissive behavior.

The most common solution to resolve issues related to any solid waste is its reuse in construction. This paper delves into the possibility of using red mud as a geomaterial in synergy with fly ash and gypsum. In this regard upon finding the geotechnical properties of virgin red mud, it is strengthened with fly ash by replacing 10, 20, and 30% of red mud by its dry weight and to these combinations gypsum was added by 0.5% and 1% and prepared various combinations. The impact of these material additions on the characteristics of red mud were investigated using the Unconfined compressive strength and California bearing ratio values and their environmental compatibility was further studied by conducting the leaching characteristics using Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procudure (TCLP) method. The findings of the tests indicated that fly ash and gypsum significantly enhanced the strength qualities of red mud as compared to unstabilized red mud.

Who took gig jobs during the COVID-19 recession? Evidence from Uber Eats in Japan,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100543,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The main purpose of this study is to examine gig workers in transportation sectors, especially focusing on workers in food delivery services, who had increased during the COVID-19 recession. By using a unique survey of 188 Uber Eats delivery persons in Japan conducted from October 2020 to January 2021, we analyze the features and labor supply behavior of the delivery persons who took the jobs during the COVID-19 recession. We found that more job losers, lower income earners and more manual workers, who are considered to be more negatively impacted by the pandemic, entered the food delivery service market during the recession. We also found that at least one-third of delivery persons worked at an hourly wage below the minimum wage, and those workers were highly concentrated in the workers who joined the market after the pandemic became severe. Based on the theory of compensating wage differentials, our analysis using hypothetical questions also found that such workers are more willing to accept jobs at lower hourly wages than those who started working at Uber Eats before COVID-19 was recognized, even under poor working conditions, such as downpours or fatigue. Our findings suggest that the gig economy, such as food delivery services, acts as an outlet for low-income and unemployed persons during recessions, indicating that such work may serve as a buffer to smooth income against business cycles. However, ample labor suppliers who are eager to take jobs with less money may exert additional downward pressure on wages during recessions.",2590-1982,Not found
Low audibility of trains may contribute to increased collisions with wildlife,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100516,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Train collisions with wildlife occur worldwide and might be more likely when animals fail to detect trains early enough to perform effective escape behaviour. Detection could be especially limited where tracks curve around hills, reducing visibility and audibility of approaching trains, but no literature has examined this potential in the context of terrestrial transportation collisions with wildlife. At 10 locations in a mountain park where the railway curved around elevated topography, we measured train audibility (as a ratio of train to background sound during approach) and developed a physical model to simulate train audibilities along 45.6 km of the same track. We compared both measured and simulated values to locations of wildlife–train collisions over a 35 year period. More wildlife collisions occurred at locations where measured train audibilities (averaged between train directions at each location) were lower and for the lowest quartile of simulated audibilities. Hill height appeared to reduce train audibility for approaches around curves, but track curvature did not predict audibility overall. Background noise from adjacent road traffic reduced train audibility, as did high train speeds and down-grade travel. Our results suggest that co-occurrence of lower audibility with other risk factors will make it difficult to predict and mitigate collision risk from audibility alone.",2590-1982,Not found

Many residents changed their travel behavior during and after the pandemic, especially for a certain percentage of public transport users who chose to drive their owned vehicles. Thus, urban roadway congestion has been getting worse, and the spatiotemporal congestion patterns has changed significantly. Understanding spatiotemporal heterogeneity of urban roadway congestion during and post the pandemic is essential for mobility management. In this study, an analytical framework was proposed to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of urban roadway congestion in Shanghai, China. First, the matrix of average speed in each traffic analysis zones (TAZs) was calculated to extract spatiotemporal heterogeneity variation features. Second, the heterogenous component of each TAZ was extracted from the overall traffic characteristics using robust principal component analysis (RPCA). Third, clustering analysis was employed to explain the spatiotemporal distribution of heterogeneous traffic characteristics. Finally, fluctuation features of these characteristics were analyzed by iterated cumulative sums of squares (ICSS). The case study results suggested that the urban road traffic state evolution was complicated and varied significantly in different zones and periods during the long-term pandemic. Compared with suburban areas, traffic conditions in city central areas are more susceptible to the pandemic and other events. In some areas, the heterogeneous component shows opposite characteristics on working days and holidays with others. The key time nodes of state change for different areas have commonness and individuality. The proposed analytical framework and empirical results contribute to the policy decision-making of urban road transportation system during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found
Restrictive and stimulative impacts of COVID-19 policies on activity trends: A case study of Kyoto,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100551,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper employs regression with ARIMA errors (RegARIMA) to quantify the impacts of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions, daily new cases, seasonal and calendar effects, and other factors on activity trends across the timeline of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The discussion focuses on two controversial policy sets imposed by the Japanese government that aim to contain the pandemic and to stimulate the recovery of the economy. The containing effect was achieved by stay-at-home requests and declaring a “State of Emergency” in the combat against the first waves of infectious cases. After observing reduced cases, Go-to-travel and Go-to-eat campaigns were launched in July 2020 to encourage recreational travel and to revive the economy. To better understand the impact of the policies we utilize “Google trends” which measure how much these policies are looked up online. We suggest this reflects how much they are part of the public discussion. A case study is conducted in Kyoto, a city famous for tourism. The proposed RegARIMA model is compared with linear regression and time series models. The outperformances in measuring the magnitude of intervention impacts and forecasting the future trends are confirmed by using a total of twelve activity and mobility indices as the dependent variable. Nine indices are released by Google and Apple and three are obtained from local Wi-Fi packet sensors. The effect of the State of Emergency declaration is found to erode at the second implementation, and the second stage of the Go-to-travel campaign successfully stimulated travel demand in the autumn sighting season of 2020.",2590-1982,Not found
Repositioning of driverless cars: Is return to home rather than downtown parking economically viable?,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100547,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"As of today, a considerable amount of urban land is devoted to parking, especially in downtown areas. Fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) – also referred to as self-driving car or driverless car – can self-park in less-expensive areas or even have no need to park at all and so can free city centers from parking lots and thereby relieve downtown land for more valuable purposes such as housing, production, recreation. This paper analyzes whether the technological capability of FAVs to reposition could also be economically viable under a wide range of differentiated constellations, paying particular attention to the heterogeneity of (downtown) parking pricing schemes (hourly parking vs. daily parking vs. employer-paid parking). We develop an economic speed choice model and calculate the utility maximizing (cost minimizing) driving speed of an empty electric FAV returning home. It is shown that compared to human driven cars, individual welfare losses when deviating from the privately optimal speed are rather small, implying that congestion effects would hardly affect economic viability of ‘return home’, as opposed to feasibility. We estimate feasible ‘return home’ options of an empty FAV depending on stylized parameters such as the average duration of stay of the traveler and distance between origin (home) and destination (e.g. work). To identify economic viability, we then juxtapose the net benefit of vehicle repositioning with the cost of downtown parking. Our analysis suggests that vehicle repositioning in the form of ‘return home’ may be economically viable for a wide range of constellations, in particular when account is taken of the benefits of intra-household car-sharing made possible by vehicle relocation. Our findings highlight the potential of FAVs to revolutionize the world’s transportation system and urban structure and stress the need to carefully fine-tune transportation policies to tackle the potential adverse societal effects of induced vehicle miles traveled owing to driverless vehicle repositioning.",2590-1982,Not found
Modeling multimodal access to primary care in an urban environment,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100550,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Access to primary health care facilities is a key component of public health, and measuring that access is vital to understanding how to target interventions. Transportation is one dimension of access and measuring distance via multiple modes allows better understanding of how varied populations access health care, particularly those who do not have access to a personal vehicle. This work builds on the 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method to include travel by car, bus, bicycle, and walking. Travel time data are sourced from OpenStreetMap and transit data incorporates stop and schedule information from the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). Open source data analysis tools are used to aid reproducibility in other geographic contexts. Modal weights are assigned to measure the population accessing each facility by each mode. Access values for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, USA are presented, with clear differences shown among modes accessing primary healthcare. Car access is high and consistent across the county, while biking and walking access are more impacted by distance to destination. Transit access is unequal across the county with some tracts showing no access at all. The highly varied access results by mode emphasize the importance of measuring access and travel by non-car modes, particularly when targeting communities with high rates of no car ownership. Improvement of multimodal access measurement will allow for targeted interventions that account for the availability of modes in each community.",2590-1982,Not found
City selection for fresh produce e-commerce's market entry strategy: Based on the perspective of urban logistics competitiveness,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100537,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Urban logistics is critical for fresh produce e-commerce (FPE), and the impressive advancement of urban logistics takes a leading role in increasing online grocery player’s competitiveness.

Travel behaviour and greenhouse gas emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study in a university setting,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100531,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The year 2020 was characterized by a marked shift in daily travel patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we know that overall travel decreased, less is known about modal shift among those who continued to travel during the pandemic or about the impact of these travel-behaviour changes on transport-related greenhouse gas emissions. Focusing on a university setting and drawing from a travel survey conducted in Fall 2020 in Montreal, Canada (n = 3358), this study examines modal shifts and quantifies greenhouse gas emissions at three time periods in the year 2020: pre-pandemic, early pandemic, and later pandemic. The pandemic resulted in a sharp reduction in travel to campus. Among those who continued to travel to campus (n = 1580), car-to-final destination mode share almost tripled at the start of the pandemic. The largest modal shift seen was the transition from walking, cycling, and transit, to driving at the beginning of the pandemic. Reductions in overall travel resulted in lower overall transport-related greenhouse gas emissions. However, if modal changes persist once students, staff, and academics return to campus, the transport carbon footprint is projected to increase above pre-pandemic levels. These results highlight the importance of putting in place policies that support a return to sustainable modes as universities and businesses reopen for in-person activities.",2590-1982,Not found
Risk perceptions of COVID-19 transmission in different travel modes,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100548,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"COVID-19 pandemic has caused adverse impacts on different aspects of life around the globe, including travelers’ mode choice behavior. To make their travel safe, transportation planners and policymakers need to understand people’s perceptions of the risk of COVID-19 transmission in different travel modes. This study aimed to estimate mode-wise perceived risk of viral transmission and identify the factors that influenced the perceived risk in Bangladesh. The study used a five-point Likert scale to measure the perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission in each travel mode. Using ordinal logistic regression models, the study explored the factors that influenced the perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission in different travel modes. The study found that people perceived a very high risk of viral transmission in public transport (bus), moderate risk in shared modes (rickshaw, auto-rickshaw, ridesharing), and very low risk in private modes (private car, motorcycle/scooter, walking, cycling). Such high-risk perception of viral transmission in public transport and shared modes might lead to a modal shift to private modes, which would worsen urban transport problems and undermine sustainable transportation goals. The study also found that socio-economic factors (gender, age, income) significantly influenced perceived risks in all travel modes. Contrarily, psychological factors (worry, care, and trust) were significant only for public and shared modes, but not for private modes. Lastly, travel behavior-related factors influenced perceived risk in shared and private modes.",2590-1982,Not found
Transport policy in the grip of a moral dilemma: a post-COVID reopening of the Russian borders,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100549,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The future of international passenger transport is largely determined by how the post-COVID border opening will proceed. The restoration of full-fledged work of transport enterprises and other sectors of the economy in the conditions of a new normality, as well as the life and health of people depend on this. On the example of Russia, it was found that post-COVID border opening is characterized by contradictory trends: opening borders is more difficult and longer than closing them; ensuring epidemiological security is imposed on the principles of reciprocity, proximity and poorly diagnosed political preferences. According to epidemiological indicators, the re-closing of borders may be hindered by the limited state budget for providing economic assistance to affected transport enterprises, the unwillingness of the authorities to ‘annoy’ the population with unpopular decisions. At the same time the widespread information coverage in the mass media of news related to the disease in other countries can contribute to border re-closing. In such conditions, transport policy balances between a choice in favor of epidemiological well-being and a decline in the economy, or in favor of economic recovery with a deterioration in the epidemiological situation. The presented results and identified trends can be used in the implementation of transport policy and ensuring epidemiological safety.",2590-1982,Not found

As a result, forecasting tools for analyzing policy scenarios are critical. However, existing freight transportation modeling tools have major gaps, especially in agent representation, prediction of fleet and distribution center control, and strategic alignment of agent decisions. We address these gaps by developing a new architecture for freight transportation modeling called CRISTAL: Collaborative, Informed, Strategic Trade Agents with Logistics. CRISTAL is an agent-based model that includes both firms and establishments (establishments are members of firms). Agents collaborate to form supply chain partnerships in trade and logistics. An Effect of Information captures information sharing in the supply chain, providing a mechanism to operationalize the push–pull boundary, which occurs at the customer-order decoupling point. Agents form strategies then align subsequent decisions with these strategies. Our CRISTAL implementation is multi-resolution, with urban freight linked to national and global supply chains. It is integrated with passenger activity, including household e-commerce use and passenger traffic. The framework has been applied to study e-commerce and truck traffic.

Despite potential death, many people resumed life as if there was no pandemic. The obscure nature of diseases and overly optimistic beliefs about personal health fostered a unique COVID-19 cavalier phenomenon. These people professed, “It’s just like the flu.” Many engaged in passive (e.g., ignoring mask policies) and active (e.g., COVID parties) behaviors that risked exposure, believing it will generate safe immunity. The COVID-19 cavalier believe they are invulnerable to major adverse complications and communal exposure results in immunity. Identifying and understanding caviler individuals will help control the spread of diseases and reopen society for tourism. The design and validation of the 9-item COVID-19 cavalier scale (CCS) provided a tool for researchers to study these individuals.

Current debates on future skills for maritime operations tend to focus on technology as a necessary requirement for workers to adapt to changes. This technology-centred approach can be controversial as technology cannot govern how humans work and how they choose their careers after graduating. This paper employs a career-focused perspective that addresses Industry 4.0 and digitalisation from individuals’ career development viewpoint, and discusses the potential implications of digitalisation and automation on individuals’ careers in the maritime industry. The paper contributes to the discussion of how Industry 4.0 and digitalisation have the potential to affect individuals’ skills and training, as well as their future career trajectories. The paper also scrutinises career structures for seafarers as well as possible socio-economic implications on future maritime careers, skills and training in the context of Industry 4.0. These issues are examined through the use of interview data from two empirical projects between 2007 and 2018 as well as a literature review on careers in the global labour market and on Industry 4.0.

Access-oriented design? Disentangling the effect of land use and transport network on accessibility,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100536,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"In urban planning and design, a holistic perspective is needed to examine multiple potential scenarios in future developing plans. Access (or accessibility) is a concept that measures the performance of a city in terms of how easily residents can reach their desired activities. The land use pattern and the transport network configuration are the two critical elements of spatial access measures. This study investigates whether access-oriented design can improve accessibility outcomes, and disentangles access benefits from network design and land use patterns. A generic superblock with two types of street network design is defined, and populated with two different land use allocation strategies. Local access is measured from transit stops. Furthermore, to test the hypothesis at a larger scale, the Liverpool LGA in Sydney is selected, and different combinations of land use pattern and network topology are tested. Results indicate that the land use pattern plays a vital role in the local access; however, the network configuration significantly impacts the access at the regional scale. The application of access-oriented designs in future urban growth is discussed.",2590-1982,Not found
Drivers’ behavior when driving vehicles with or without advanced driver assistance systems: A driver simulator-based study,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100545,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Automotive companies have been developing vehicles with advanced features that aid in various driving tasks. These features are aimed at enhancing safety by either warning the drivers of a potential hazard or picking up certain driving maneuvers like maintaining the lane or a constant headway. They are part of vehicles with driver assistance technology and are vital for the successful deployment of connected and automated vehicles in the future. However, drivers’ behavioral response when driving vehicles with such advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) compared to vehicles without ADAS may vary and is meagerly explored. This research evaluates drivers’ behavioral response to scenarios when driving vehicles with ADAS like lane departure warning (LDW), blind spot warning (BSW), and over speed warning (OSW) compared to vehicles without ADAS. Rural, urban and freeway driving scenarios were developed in a driver simulator and tested on 43 participants aged sixteen years to sixty-five years. The results show that ADAS influence driving behavior by making drivers less aggressive and harmonizing the driving environment. The influence of ADAS on the driver behavior was different in rural, urban, and freeway driving scenarios. The drivers’ behavioral response to scenarios varied with the lighting and weather condition as well as with the age, gender, and ethnicity of the participant. While ADAS help by reducing lane departures or speeding and enhance safety, an indirect influence on braking, turning, and car-following were also observed. The findings help assess driver behavior when driving vehicles with advanced features and build better systems.",2590-1982,Not found
The value of travel speed,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100530,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Travel speed is an intrinsic feature of transport, and enlarging the speed is considered as beneficial. The benefit of a speed increase is generally assessed as the value of the saved travel time. However, this approach conflicts with the observation that time spent on travelling is rather constant and might not be affected by speed changes. The paper aims to define the benefits of a speed increase and addresses two research questions. First, how will a speed increase in person transport work out, which factors are affected? Second, is the value of time a good proxy for the value of speed? Based on studies on time spending and research on the association between speed and land use, we argue that human wealth could be the main affected factor by speed changes, rather than time or access. Then the value of time is not a good proxy for the value of speed: the benefits of a wealth increase are negatively correlated with prosperity following the law of diminishing marginal utility, while the calculated benefits of saved travel time prove to be positively correlated. The inadequacy of the value of time is explained by some shortcomings with respect to the willingness to pay that is generally used for assessing the value of time: people do not predict correctly the personal benefits that will be gained from a decision, and they neglect the social impacts.",2590-1982,Not found
Pedestrian movement simulation for an airport considering social distancing strategy,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100527,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This study develops a pedestrian microsimulation model for an international airport that implements a social force model to simulate business-as-usual as well as pandemic pedestrian movement scenarios. The study follows an extensive calibration procedure to formulate pedestrian behavior within the microsimulation environment to reflect COVID-19 restrictions. The calibration process includes three components, which are visual observations, sensitivity analysis, and parameter combinations. The calibration process identifies the combination of the parameters that yields a pedestrian behavior for maximizing the distances among pedestrians in the airport. The study tests three scenarios: (1) a base case scenario with no social distancing parameters in effect, (2) a social distancing scenario that implements calibrated social force model parameters, and (3) a social distancing scenario through a combined implementation of the calibrated parameters and an operational improvement strategy. The simulation results for calibration reveal that the identified combination of the parameters yields 3.8% of instances of pedestrian movements that demonstrate a proximity of less than 2 m between pedestrians. The social distancing scenario demonstrates a significant reduction of such instances by 93–94% in comparison to a scenario with no social distancing strategy implemented. Moreover, the results show that social distancing is likely to increase pedestrian’s activity and queue time in the airport. According to the simulation results, it appears that the airport authorities may require queue management processes, infrastructure development, and additional resource deployment to alleviate the negative impacts of social distancing policies on pedestrian movements and operations within the airport.",2590-1982,Not found
Impact of Covid-19 on willingness to share trips,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100544,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This study relied on primary data from transportation users to investigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on shared mobility types. The study used ordinal logistic regression models to explore the relationship between Covid-19 spread-mitigative protocols and the willingness to share trips with family, friends, and strangers. Travellers who were moderately affected by social distancing had [0.356 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.189 – 0.669; p = 0.0001)] times the rate willing to share public vehicles and [0.492 (95% CI = 0.268 - 0.900; p = 0.05)] times the rate willing to share private cars than commuters who mostly affected. Commuters with a minor extent of means of transportation change at (α < 0.0001) significance level had 0.330 times the rate willing to share personal cars with family and friends. At the same time, 0.434 times the rate (α < 0.01) willing to share public vehicles with strangers compared to commuters who had a major extent of means of transportation change. The prevalence rates of change were higher during Covid-19 than precovid, showing that the pandemic set an impetus for a modal shift from public to private vehicular use, with a probable effect on willingness to share trips postcovid, ceteris paribus. Consequently, the study concludes that the transportation regulators could continue to sensitise travellers, regulate passenger spacings, monitor and enforce gears to make shared mobility more appealing to people during and postcovid periods.",2590-1982,Not found
Transport impacts in Germany and State of Qatar: An assessment during the first wave of COVID-19,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100540,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Response measures to contain COVID-19 spread varied from country to country, some imposed a complete lockdown while some imposed partial restrictions. This paper compares the transport impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for two countries having dissimilar characteristics, Germany and State of Qatar, based on the rates of infection and response measures. Secondary data, obtained from Google mobility reports, and primary data, collected from local agencies, were used for comparison purposes. The secondary data comparison from February 2020 to July 2020 indicated an overall decline in mobility for all commercial activities and an increase was noted for parks and residential locations for Saxony, Germany. For State of Qatar, the mobility was decreased to all places except residential locations. Further, the comparison for traffic volumes and the number of crashes during the first wave of the pandemic indicated that the reduction in traffic volumes, major, and minor crashes was coupled with restrictive measures rather than COVID-19 incidences for both countries. Further, the traffic volumes showed a statistically significant inverse linear relationship with the stringency index for both countries during weekdays as well as weekends. These results suggest that the policy measures are key in governing movement restrictions and containing the spread of pandemic rather than the number of COVID-19 incidences. Further, the authorities should monitor the traffic trends during the pandemic and enforce the traffic rules and regulations as soon as the movement restrictions are lifted.",2590-1982,Not found
Accessing hemodialysis clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100533,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Transportation is a key element of access to healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic posed unique and unforeseen challenges to patients receiving hemodialysis who rely on three times weekly transportation to receive their life-saving treatments, but there is little data on the problems they faced. This study explores the attitudes, fears, and concerns of hemodialysis patients during the pandemic with a focus on their travel to/from dialysis treatments. A mixed methods travel survey was distributed to hemodialysis patients from three urban centers in Montréal, Canada, during the pandemic (n = 43). The survey included closed questions that were analysed through descriptive statistics as well as open-ended questions that were assessed through thematic analysis. Descriptive statistics show that hemodialysis patients are more fearful of contracting COVID-19 in transit than they are at the treatment center. Patients taking paratransit, public transportation, and taxis are more fearful of COVID-19 while traveling than those who drive, who are driven, or who walk to the clinic. In the open-ended questions, patients reported struggling with confusing COVID-19 protocols in public transport, including conflicting information on whether paratransit taxis allowed one or multiple passengers. Paratransit was the most used travel mode to access treatment (n = 30), with problems identified in the open-ended questions, such as long and unreliable pickup windows, and extended travel times. To limit COVID-19 exposure and stress for paratransit users, agencies should consider sitting one patient per paratransit taxi, clearly communicating COVID-19 protocols online and in the vehicles, and tracking vehicles for more efficient pickups.",2590-1982,Not found

The research argues that the new Makassar-Parepare railway development requires risk-based analysis (Law No 24 of 2007 on Disaster Management) and was thereby conducted to analyze elements exposed to it from the risk perspective. The elements at risk were identified using 1 to 5-km buffers, location quotient (LQ), and gravity index. The research revealed that the factors contributing to the at-risk elements were population, land use, productive sectors, and interregional interactions. Based on the buffer analysis, the population was concentrated within 1 km from the railway development site. Consequently, the settlements in this zone are subject to modification due to land acquisition in Segments A, D, and E (Parepare-Barru-Makassar). In addition, productive land use like ponds (in Marros) was also the most vulnerable to any disturbance. Based on the gravity index, the highest interaction occurred between Makassar, Marros, and Pangkep (particularly optimum 14.46 km south of Marros toward Makassar and 16.97 km south of Pangkep toward Makassar). A closer look at the LQ revealed that the interaction originated in the service and mining sectors, which are predominant in these regions. The research highlighted that population, land use, productive sectors, and interregional interaction are vital in evaluating the elements at risk in the new railway development. Furthermore, these elements are interlinked with the transport demand analysis to create resilient and sustainable transportation planning.",2590-1982,Not found

Pilot fatigue can affect their performance and has become a threat to flight safety. Objective This study examines whether different flight time limitations (FTL) and rosters of EASA-based and Australian pilots were associated with different levels of stress, sleep difficulties, fatigue levels, symptoms of depression or anxiety and wellbeing. Method 192 EASA-based and 180 Australian pilots completed a cross-sectional online survey, which asked for their schedules, stress, sleep problems, fatigue, wellbeing, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. These variables were compared for the groups of EASA-based and Australian pilots. Findings Although EASA based and Australian pilots were scheduled for only 57–62% of maximum duty and flight hours, 71.8% EASA-based vs. 77% Australian pilots reported severe or high fatigue. Significant depression symptoms were reported by 17.2% Australian and 18% EASA-based pilots, 7% pilots reported significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Australian pilots reported more demanding rosters, significantly more sleep problems and significantly lower wellbeing. Conclusions Present regulations and FTL likely could not prevent high fatigue levels among EASA based and Australian pilots. Both groups were equally fatigued, although Australian pilots reported more demanding rosters. Pilots of both groups reported the same levels of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms, while Australian pilots’ sleep and wellbeing were significantly more impaired. These results suggest that fatigue should not be regarded as an isolated problem for flight-safety.

Electrifying California fleets: Investigating light-duty vehicle purchase decisions,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100532,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper uses results from interviews conducted with 23 fleet managers across California in 2019 to investigate fleet adoption of light duty Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs). The interviews examined how fleet managers make vehicle purchase decisions and explored the motivations and barriers for the adoption of PEVs. The results are framed in the context of Self-Determination Theory which categorizes the level to which actions are taken based on internal and external motivators. Results show that conventional vehicle purchases are mostly motivated by internalized extrinsic motivators while PEV purchase decisions are mostly motivated by external extrinsic motivators, such as requirements to meet sustainability goals. While most fleets had adopted at least one PEV, there are still barriers to widespread electrification, including a lack of time and resources available to evaluate PEVs, issues with employee buy-in, a lack of total cost of ownership considerations, and infrastructure challenges. The results provide a greater understanding of fleet PEV purchasing, how PEVs align with existing purchase considerations, and how stakeholders could facilitate increased electric vehicle adoption in fleets.",2590-1982,Not found

This study assessed public health framing in local media coverage of traffic crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists in Hawai‘i. We systematically searched the websites of all major local news sources (newspapers and local television stations) to identify articles about Hawai‘i traffic crashes involving pedestrians/bicyclists that were published in 2019. Using content analysis, we extracted information on title and article attributes, crash details, language patterns, and public health framing elements. After screening 738 news articles for inclusion, 162 articles comprised the final sample. These articles reported on 164 crash events, representing 57 unique crash events. Most articles described the crashes factually as isolated events. Language patterns in article titles were non-agentive (77%) and focused on the pedestrian or bicyclist (77%) without mentioning the driver or vehicle (69%). When articles ascribed agents, vehicles (53%) were mentioned more often than drivers (13%). One-quarter of articles contained a counterfactual that subtly assigned responsibility for the crash to the person walking or bicycling. About 15% of articles described a traffic safety solution. These findings serve as a benchmark for local media coverage and can be used to inform state-level actions to improve local media reporting. Media coverage that considers the contextual and systematic factors contributing to the crash could better support local government policy change to protect pedestrians and bicyclists.",2590-1982,Not found
Structural modeling of COVID-19 spread in relation to human mobility,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100528,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Human mobility is considered as one of the prominent non-pharmaceutical interventions to control the spread of the pandemic (positive effect from mobility to infection). Conversely, the spread of the pandemic triggered massive changes to people’s daily schedules by limiting their movement (negative effect from infection to mobility). The purpose of this study is to investigate this bi-directional relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 spread across U.S. counties during the early phase of the pandemic when infection rates were stabilizing and activity-travel behavior reflected a fairly steady return to normal following the drastic changes observed during the pandemic’s initial shock. In particular, we applied Structural Regression (SR) model to investigate a bi-directional relationship between COVID-19 infection rate and the degree of human mobility in a county in association with socio-demographic and location characteristics of that county, and state-wide COVID-19 policies. Combining U.S. county-level cross-sectional data from multiple sources, our model results suggested that during the study period, human mobility and infection rate in a county both influenced each other, but in an opposite direction. Metropolitan counties experienced higher infection and lower mobility than non-metropolitan counties in the early stage of the pandemic. Counties with highly infected neighboring counties and more external trips had a higher infection rate. During the study period, community mitigation strategies, such as stay at home order, emergency declaration, and non-essential business closure significantly reduced mobility whereas public mask mandate significantly reduced infection rates. The findings of this study will provide important insights to policy makers in understanding the two-way relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 spread and to derive mobility-driven policy actions accordingly.",2590-1982,Not found

An online survey consisting of two waves was conducted between April and June 2020 among randomly chosen transport system users. The survey consisted of both a stated choice experiment, revealed preference, andpsychometric indicators. Hybrid choice models were developed and included two latent variables (1) satisfaction with public transport and (2) the response to COVID-19. The results indicate that there is a strong habit of private vehicle use in the Dominican population. The main deterrents for public transport use are limited capacity and reduced safety (including regarding social distancing). The findings particularly highlight the success of the metro as a public transport mode in the city of Santo Domingo. Both cost and time are significant factors in mode choice, before and during the pandemic, but more so for OMSA bus use than for metro use. One of the conclusions from this study is that ignorin covid-related latent effects on public transport service during the pandemic may yield biased (lower) estimations of Value of Travel Time Savings. Finally, the results also show that mode captivity for public transport users plays an important role during the pandemic. These users have no access to alternative transportation and are obliged to continue using public transport. This implies that governments would be wise to urge transport operators not to reduce capacity and frequency during the pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found
Towards autonomous public transportation: Attitudes and intentions of the local population,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100504,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Public autonomous vehicles (AVs) have a high potential to solve traffic related problems and environmental challenges. However, without the passengers’ acceptance, the potential to achieve these benefits will not be fulfilled. Therefore, this paper is focused on the factors that influencethe acceptance of such vehicles and investigates how much the acceptance varies if different levels of supervision are provided. An online survey was conducted and factors like trust and experience were found to impact on the stated intention to use a self-driving bus. Additionally, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)factors, such as, effort expectancy, performance expectancy and social influence were found to impact user intentions. Interestingly, socio-demographic factors appeared to be determinants of the acceptance of public AVs only if an employee was no longer present in the bus. The study highlighted the importance of paying sufficient attention to qualitative psychological factors, next to classic instrumental attributes like travel time and costs, before and during the implementation of public AVs. As experience was found to be a relatively robust factor in explaining public AV acceptance, we expect that preferences towards autonomous public transportation evolve along with the transition from hypothetical scenarios to demonstration pilots, to their deployment in regular operations. We therefore recommend the extension of this research to revealed preference studies, thereby using the results of field studies and living labs.Policy makers and researchers should allow users to access public AVs in test phases, so that users can generate positive experiences. This is expected to reduce future efforts of encouraging the use of this new technology, before its implementation.",2590-1982,Not found
COVID-19 and suburban public transport in the conditions of the Czech Republic,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100523,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This article focuses on possible approaches to safe regional public transport during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purposes of the research are examination the conditions for ensuring safe transport and the impact on the planning of transport services. The result is an assessment of the operation of regional public transport, consisting of the possibility of maintaining safe distances in public transport. Authors work on suburban transport cases in selected regions of the Czech Republic (Prague and Moravian-Silesian Region). Census devices in public transport, periodical transport surveys, Google mobility reports and data on fare sales from regional transport were used as data sources. Emphasis is placed on a safe distance between commuters, this condition leads to lower occupancy of the vehicle while maintaining the capacity of the vehicles. The value of this new occupancy is determined for selected vehicles and the coefficient that represents the maximum occupancy level to ensure safe transport is established. The capacity of the connections is examined in the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the period before COVID-19, the daily variation of passengers is expected to change significantly, leading to different occupancy rates during the day.",2590-1982,Not found

The pandemic is a disaster that the industry has been forced to adapt to. This study illustrates, through a mixed-methods research design, what factors cruiseferry operators considered in their responses to the pandemic, whether the implemented countermeasures increased their customers’ sense of security, and what countermeasures customers would agree to follow before boarding a ship. The study thereby provides insights into which countermeasures are likely to decrease customers’ perceived health risks and which they are ready to accept or not on cruises during pandemics.",2590-1982,Not found

To study these shifts, we enhance an existing smartphone-based travel/activity diary to capture online activities, with a focus on activities that can replace passenger trips. Furthermore, we expand the options to report shopping details, to better understand the influence of e-commerce on in-person shopping. In this paper, we detail the data collection tool development strategy and user-experience findings.

Autonomous vehicle policies with equity implications: Patterns and gaps,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100521,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may improve or harm social equity for disadvantaged groups. Government agencies, planning organizations, businesses, and nonprofits have drafted or published an array of AV-related policies that have equity implications. Through a review of academic and grey literature, this study pioneers a comprehensive analysis of these policies in terms of patterns, frequencies and gaps. Our analysis shows that these policies can be grouped into three categories: access and inclusion, multimodal transportation, and community wellbeing. Regarding specific policies, considerations for a shared-use model and impacts to the economy dominate the policy landscape. Helping marginalized communities, urban parking, and automating transit are also prevalent policies. However, considerations for people with low incomes and people of color are not well represented, nor are personal security issues within shared vehicles, or models for deploying AVs in rural communities. Policymakers are beginning to plan for the potential equity impacts of AVs, but more opportunities remain for developing policies that will ensure the most equitable outcomes. This study elucidates the different types of policies with equity implications and provides planners and policymakers a base from which to draft their own policy.",2590-1982,Not found
Integrating COVID-19 health risks into crowding costs for transit schedule planning,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100522,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The public transport sector worldwide experienced the worst impact in recent history, in terms of ridership loss, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic negatively affected passengers' perceptions of public transport and is likely to make a lasting impact on ridership, trip patterns, and modal share. Without any supportive changes to transit operations, ridership is likely to decline. This study explores the setting of frequencies in transit lines and proposes a two-part methodology that addresses the changing perceptions of users, especially in a health-related context. The first part develops a mathematical model that expresses the pre-COVID-19 cost of passenger crowding as an integral part of user costs to determine the optimal headway that considers the trade-offs between user and operator costs. A continuum approximation for the demand of the bus line has been used in the derivation. The second part extends the developed model to include both the costs of the health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and crowding. The developed models will help transit planners and operators to plan and adapt operations to changing health risks during the pandemic and post-pandemic. Several numerical examples are provided to describe the uses and applications of the analytical models using information obtained from the literature.",2590-1982,Not found
Half-hearted policies on mobility restrictions during COVID-19 in Indonesia: A portrait of large informal economy country,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100517,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This study measures the effectiveness of government’s transportation policy on mobility restriction during the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available big datasets. Using a causal difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis and regression discontinuity design (RDD), we examine the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the aggregate population mobility of cities and regencies across Indonesia. Our results show that during the period of the first so-called “Large-scale Social Restrictions” or “Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar” (PSBB I) from April to May 2020, NPIs reduced mobility by 5.4% relative to pre-pandemic baseline and accounted for a small portion of mobility decline in cities or regencies that instituted mobility restrictions. The impact of the second PSBB policy (PSBB II) from September to November 2020 was smaller, with a mobility reduction of only 1.8%–2.9%, depending on the window of observation and sample. Lastly, the “Imposition of Restriction on Social Activity” or Pemberlakuan Pembatasan Kegiatan Masyarakat (PPKM) policy beginning in January 2021 has had a more negligible impact, with mobility reduction of approximately 0.6–2.1%. These findings indicate that the effectiveness of mobility restrictions tend to decrease over time. The decline in effectiveness may be the result of the increased cost of social distancing over long periods of time and the declining stringency of the mobility restrictions being imposed, which may be particularly pronounced for emerging countries with a large informal sector, such as Indonesia.",2590-1982,Not found
Mirror or camera?

These systems offer advantages that can improve rearward vision and safety, such as image enhancement. However, these systems must also be accepted and valuated by users. We examined acceptance of CMS, the willingness to change from rear-view mirrors to CMS, and the willingness to pay for this replacement, using an online questionnaire. We also explored the relationship between these variables using an adaption of the technology acceptance model. In total, 364 subjects completed the questionnaire. Items were aggregated using confirmatory factor analysis and factors were analyzed using (non-) parametric tests as well as path model analysis. Despite a positive attitude and high intention to use standard CMS, a combination of mirror and blind spot detection system was preferred. Subjects were willing to pay around 300 € for standard CMS, which is comparable to the preferred price of driver assistance systems. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, and satisfaction were strong predictors of intention-to-use, but only satisfaction had a direct effect on willingness-to-change, and none of these variables predicted willingness-to-pay. Finally, customization was identified as a promising way to increase acceptance of and preference for CMS.",2590-1982,Not found

The event attracted people to the path of totality and generated additional traffic that might have negatively impacted the regular traffic operation and management. This paper studied the 2017 solar eclipse to determine its impact on traffic operation and management from states located within the path of totality using data obtained from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The paper grouped the states into three groups based on the time when the eclipse occurred. The paper compared traffic patterns before, during, and after the eclipse. The results indicated that traffic volume decreased two days before the eclipse except for Wyoming. Also, traffic increased in post-eclipse and returned to normal after two to three days. Three hours before the eclipse, traffic significantly declined by 13%, and two hours post-eclipse, traffic increased by 13% from the regular traffic.

Telecommuting has several benefits that are separate from COVID-19. Two prevalent changes have been in regard to telecommuting and online food buying habits, both of which impact social wellbeing as a dimension of social sustainability. We discuss two exploratory surveys on the perception of telecommuting and food e-commerce. We found that while telecommuting has the potential to increase social wellbeing and the social sustainability of both urban and rural Canadian communities through a variety of mechanisms, food e-commerce does not offer similar returns. Instead, the prevalence of food e-commerce merely adds convenience to the lives of those who already have adequate food access while maintaining the status quo, or even worsening access for disadvantaged Canadians.",2590-1982,Not found
Too much pressure?

Which direction and path this transformation will take remains highly uncertain, as do the related environmental effects. In the present study we examine the introduction of CAVs in cities in terms of the indirect or underlying processes (drivers) and the direct expressions of interest that are related to specific actions, events or processes (pressures). The drivers and pressures are identified in interviews with stakeholders from across the quadruple helix (academia, industry, government and civil society). We then use an analytical framework that combines the drivers and pressures of the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, States, Impacts, Responses) model and force field analysis. This framework is used to map survey data on the strength of the driving and restraining forces and pressures behind the introduction of CAVs in cities, and to identify which stakeholders are involved in this socio-technical transition. Results showed that there was a strong belief across stakeholder groups that CAVs should be connected with mobility planning strategies. This need for planning has been discussed at length in other contexts, and now our results show that respondents find this need is also present in the Swedish context. An unexpected finding was that those who are sceptical to CAVs may form unique groups with a broad range of stakeholder types, for example elderly people, cyclists, people who are concerned because of conspiracies related to new technology, and those who are concerned about environmental effects.",2590-1982,Not found
Will we travel less after the pandemic?,10.1016/j.trip.2021.100509,13,2022-03-01,2022,3,"During the pandemic, passenger transport has decreased dramatically due to restrictions and recommendations to avoid social contacts. Hopes and expectations have been raised that experiences, habits and improved digital services developed or discovered during the pandemic can lead to a permanent decrease of travel volumes even in the long run, thereby reducing emissions, noise and congestion. This paper discusses this question, based on descriptive analyses of historical development of travel distances and travel times in Sweden, including a description of how transportation changed in Sweden during the pandemic. Obviously, it is too early to give a conclusive answer regarding long run effects, but judging from historical experiences of previous improvements in transportation and communication, it seems unlikely that increased digital experience, improved digital services or changed habits will lead to permanently reduced travel volumes. It appears more likely that improved digital services and increased digital maturity will continue to transform work, shopping and leisure, but that this will not translate into decreased physical travel to any large extent.",2590-1982,Not found
"Policy measures and their impact on transport performance, modal split and greenhouse gas emissions in German long-distance passenger transport",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100615,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"In our study, we used a system dynamics model to analyze how frequently discussed transport policy measures affect the total transport performance of long-distance passenger transport in Germany and the transport performance of relevant modes (modal split shares). We then combined the results with established data on mode-specific greenhouse gas emissions to ultimately determine the climate protection effects of the measures. Our analysis shows that an actual modal shift from road to rail will only occur if the price competitiveness and supply conditions of long-distance rail passenger transport are significantly improved. Scenarios for increasing the price of passenger car traffic via a passenger car toll on trunk roads or an additional CO2-based tax on fuels increase the market share of rail, but limit overall transport performance growth compared to our reference scenario with no measures. A doubling of long-distance passenger rail transport cannot be achieved with any of the measures or bundles of measures examined, neither in terms of transport performance nor modal split share. According to our calculations, only the “car repression” scenario makes a noticeable contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. German government's ambitious climate targets for 2030 can only be reached if the climate footprint of vehicles – especially passenger cars – is significantly improved. It is also noteworthy that, according to our analysis, a politically frequently demanded ban on domestic flights would ultimately even lead to an increase in CO2 emissions, since, among other things, general travel costs would fall.",2590-1982,Not found
"Cyclists’ exposure to air and noise pollution, comparative approach in seven cities",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100619,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Cyclists’ exposure to air and noise pollution is a growing field of study. A situation of transport injustice has been largely documented, showing that cyclists are more exposed than other road users to pollutions they do not produce themselves. Modeling cyclists’ exposures became an important issue to understand how to reduce them and how to include that issue in planning. However, many gaps are currently characterizing the field of cyclists’ exposure modeling studies: methodological discrepancy, few comparison analyses, cities in the Global South and noise exposure are both under-studied. This study fits in these gaps by proposing a comparative analysis of seven cities (Paris, Lyon, Copenhagen, Delhi, Mumbai, Montreal and Toronto) considering both noise and exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and applying a uniform methodology allowing for comparison and generalization of the results. The built models are critically analyzed, and used to map cyclists’ exposure. These maps of relative potential exposure provide interesting perspectives for planning at both the regional and local levels. We found a weak correlation between cyclists’ exposure to environmental noise and NO2. Noise depends more on characteristics of the micro-scale environment in which exposure occurs than NO2. Thus, planning to reduce cyclists’ exposure to noise can have significant effects. For NO2, the micro-scale environment only has a significant impact in Mumbai and Delhi. However, our results suggest that it might be difficult to systematically combine several dimensions of the quality of a bicycle network such as straightness, connectivity, safety, and reduced air and noise exposure.",2590-1982,Not found
Airline market exit after a shock event: Insights from the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100621,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, passenger demand for air transportation declined drastically. In the Unites States (U.S.), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided financial assistance. In return, commercial passenger airlines were given minimum service obligations, which allowed airlines to remove markets (flights between origin and destination airport pairs) from their networks as long as they continued operating in all cities that they serviced pre-pandemic. A binary logit methodology is used to model airline-market level decisions to continue operating in a market or to exit it. Two time periods are modeled: during normal operating conditions (before the pandemic) and after a major shock event (after the beginning of the pandemic). Results show that after the pandemic, 8.4 times more airline markets are exited as compared to before. Interestingly, the probability of exit is found to vary widely across markets, airports, and airlines. Some market characteristics have a high probability of exit both before and after the pandemic, including low passenger revenue per available seat mile, low flight frequencies, and flights to/from multi-airport cities. In contrast, other market characteristics impact airlines’ market exit decisions in only one time period rather than both. For example, during normal operating conditions, airport size does not impact market exit. However, after the pandemic, the probability of exit is 1.8 to 2.2 times higher for the larger hub airports as compared to the smallest airports (non-hubs), a result that is explained within the context of the CARES Act minimum service obligations.",2590-1982,Not found
Perception of people from educational institution regarding autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100620,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Since the general public will play a central role in the evolution of AVs, research has been performed to assess their perception and acceptance of AVs. Nevertheless, the most potential users of AVs, i.e., young, students, and more educated people, have not received any particular focus in those studies. This research gap has motivated us to assess their perceptions. Extensive data analyses of the survey at the University of Central Florida with a sample of 315 reveal that on average 57% of the respondents were familiar with AVs, and about 44% of the respondents felt positive perceptions toward AVs. Around 51% of the respondents had some concerns regarding the perceived negative aspects of AVs, however, a significant percentage of people (around 34%) maintained a neutral position regarding the negative aspects of AVs. In addition, structural equation modeling was performed considering five latent variables and 32 observed variables to investigate the inter-relationship among those variables. Model results suggest that as more people have positive primary perceptions about different aspects of AVs, their attitudes toward AVs would be more positive, and the concerns regarding AVs would be reduced. Demographic characteristics do not significantly influence the willingness to possess AVs, and people want to own AVs despite their different demographic backgrounds. These study findings could help policymakers to apprehend different prospects of people’s perceptions regarding AVs and have implications for the stakeholders of autonomous vehicles.",2590-1982,Not found

This study evaluates the influence of sociodemographic and psychosocial variables (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control) associated to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) about cyclists’ intentions to ride on the pedestrian lane (RPL) and to ride against the traffic flow (RATF), to identify significant predictors. An online survey was applied among 200 urban cyclists (52 females and 148 males), in a mexican city with emerging cycling culture, in October 2020. A descriptive statistical analysis was conducted, and intention prediction models were built through hierarchical regression analyses. The three TPB variables were found to be the most significant predictors of the cyclists’ intentions towards RPL and RATF, above the sociodemographic variables considered. Perceived behavioral control was the strongest predictor. Findings, provide an empirical precedent in predictorś study on RPL and RATF in the context of emerging urban cycling environment. On the other hand, could guide road education policies focused on the found predictorś hierarchy. A variety of strategies could range from broad promotion of cycling mobility regulations and enforcement to awareness campaigns about the real adverse effects on safety and road coexistence, derived from RPL and RATF.",2590-1982,Not found

To prevent aggressive driving, we strive to first understand aggressive driving and find patterns in this type of driving behavior. In an effort to uncover to identify patterns in aggressive driving, we examine sensor data and video data of trips taken by drivers with ADHD and identify our distinct aggressive driving patterns. Using the sensor data, we extend our findings to all aggressive trips in our dataset and generate a model to detect aggressive driving patterns. By finding the similarity between trips and then using these distances to produce a KNN model, we are able to model our data and classify it into 4 driving patterns.

This study revisits the political economy theorems of Adam Smith, Joseph Stiglitz, and Ronald Coase, to better guide government investment decisions on cycling infrastructure and to illustrate the trade-offs between the investment in cycling and automotive infrastructure. When improving infrastructure, there is no perfect policy, so a clear statement should be made to give the public a better understanding. This paper highlights that every road user should consider the difficulties of all other users on the road. Policy makers should consider cyclists’ difficulties and try to find an investment solution that maximizes both cyclists’ and car drivers’ benefits. Putting cycle paths on the side of roads constrains the value of both bicycles and cars; separate cycling paths should be considered.

Here, we demonstrate an intuitive, simulation-based approach for inferring spatial vulnerabilities to area-spanning disruptions. In particular, we show how partial dependence plots derived from gradient boosting machines trained on the results of a routing simulation can be used to depict the average effect a disruption’s location has on impacts while controlling for other input variables and spatial dependencies embedded in the network.

Evaluating citizen science data: A citizen observatory to measure cyclists’ waiting times,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100624,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Citizen science allows mobility researchers and mobility planners to collect data at a larger scale and at lower costs compared to traditional data collection methods. Citizen observatories (COs) are especially interesting because public authorities are often involved in the setup and the participation barrier for citizens is reduced by relying on smartphones. Citizen science and COs both foster public participation in scientific research. An evaluation framework can increase the quality of and the trust in citizen science data. Although considered important by existing evaluation frameworks for citizen science, detailed instructions on how to evaluate data accuracy are lacking. This is especially the case in domains where citizen science has not been widely used, such as mobility. This paper therefore presents a framework to evaluate the data quality of a CO for mobility. The framework includes representativeness, accuracy, reliability, and validity. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to a CO in Ghent, Belgium, in which cyclists used their smartphones to collect their perceived and objective waiting times at signalised intersections. Although the representativeness of the data could be improved, the data was found to be accurate. Data showed that participants on average spent 4% of their trip time waiting at signalised intersections. Furthermore, no clear overestimation or underestimation of the waiting time was found.

A face-to-face household survey was conducted to collect individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics, their travel patterns for different trip purposes, and perceptions of the built environment. We developed four Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) models to understand the influence of latent perceptions on bicycling for commuting and non-commuting (i.e., grocery shopping, going for tea, and recreational) trips. The analysis indicates that women are more likely to choose a bike for commuting trips but are less likely to use bikes for recreational trips. The results also show that the choice of commuting by bicycle is positively associated with commuting distance and negatively associated with residential land use. Walkability perception has a significant positive association with the choice of bikes for commuting and non-commuting trips. Road safety perception for active travel is positively associated with bike choice for recreational trips, and crime perception of the neighborhood is negatively associated with bike choice for grocery trips.

A driver’s liability for a crash was derived from the “Hazardous Action” field in each crash report. The likelihood of assigning liability to an elderly driver was examined in light of pre-crash actions defined in each report’s “Actions Prior to Crash” field. Logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios used to explain the likelihood. Furthermore, Random Forest machine learning technique was used to predict driver liability based on pre-crash actions. Distraction, number of travel lanes, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs were significant predictors of the likelihood that an elderly driver was at-fault in a crash. A “going straight” pre-crash action by an elderly driver was the best indicator of liability, regardless of the pre-crash action by a young driver. For interaction scenarios, an elderly driver going straight at a stop-sign-controlled intersection was associated with a lower likelihood of being liable for a crash. Turning actions increased the likelihood of the elderly driver being liable for a crash. The results can be used to appraise countermeasures that improve the safety of elderly drivers at stop-controlled intersections.",2590-1982,Not found

This study adopts an ethnographic qualitative research methodology and triangulates data from the fieldwork, interviews with cyclists and non-cyclists. The study explores how Cycling is handled in urban and transport planning and treated within the broader context of urban mobility. The current study's findings have several implications for cycling promotion interventions, and they are grouped under three themes – awareness, availability, and activation. The study also makes theoretical contributions to studies on Cycling, sustainable and non-motorised transportation in urban cities and especially in developing countries.",2590-1982,Not found
"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the behavior change of cyclists in Lisbon, using multinomial logit regression analysis",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100609,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak hit most countries and cities globally, dramatically impacting how people live during lockdown periods. Compulsorily, socioeconomic activities and mobility patterns changed while long-lasting structural changes might remain. Focusing on this very particular liminal event, this paper aims to present and analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus lockdown on the behavior change of cyclists and previously non-cyclists in Lisbon, Portugal, knowing that no concomitant interventions occurred in the cycling environment during the period analyzed (e.g., pop-up interventions). From a 1-min questionnaire in 5 locations in Lisbon’s existing cycling lanes, we aimed to collect (n = 493) revealed preferences on cycling frequency before and after the lockdown, which we used to calibrate a weighted multinomial logit model to analyze respondents’ probability of increasing, maintaining, or decreasing their cycling frequency. Results suggest that people tended to cycle more often after the lockdown than before. For every five cyclists, two cycled more frequently while two others maintained their cycling frequency. Most cycling trips were recreational or to exercise, and these increased after the lockdown, while trips for work and school decreased, as expected. Moreover, the lower the individuals’ cycling frequency levels before the lockdown, the more they cycled after it. Our study diagnoses the impact of the lockdown on cycling habits, indicating an overall propensity to cycling more by the Lisbon citizens. Hence, authorities need to act and make quick infrastructural changes (e.g., pop-up cycling lanes) and encourage the population to use more bikes (e.g., financial incentives for bike purchases).",2590-1982,Not found
Regulating connected and automated vehicles: How do drivers experience being automatically regulated by digital traffic rules?,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100611,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Digital traffic rules using geofencing can be communicated to Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) offering possibilities for both national and local authorities to regulate traffic in an efficient and environmentally sound manner. This real-traffic study provides novel results of attitudes towards being automatically regulated in low emission zones (LEZs) in Norway and Sweden. Drivers with updated software were surveyed about their experience with the functionality, and the acceptance of being regulated by such a system, and further compared to a scenario of geofenced speed zones (SZs). Findings show the difference in attitudes between the two use cases – drivers are much more positive to LEZs than SZs. And further that those that had noticed the function were more positive than those that had not noticed the function. The study demonstrates the importance of experience with the technology in vehicles and how LEZ can be more compatible with existing values, while SZ can create feelings of infringement of freedom. The study is novel in that it focuses on attitudes to regulation. Voluntary use cases demonstrated in this study, show a promising example of adaptive policymaking and nudging that could help authorities mitigate uncertainties on the way towards a more efficient, safer and environmentally friendly transport system.",2590-1982,Not found
A review of the socio-demographic characteristics affecting the demand for different car-sharing operational schemes,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100616,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"In this paper, socio-demographic factors influencing the demand for different car-sharing forms are examined. An in-depth review of such factors is provided based on the type of shared car service, geographic area, and specific travel demand aspect being considered. Conclusions highlight the differences between car sharing operational schemes. The number of males, young individuals, and people with above-average income among free-floating members is higher than in other car-sharing services. Also, although round-trip car-sharing users appear to be less educated than other car-sharing services users, car-sharing members may follow a more efficient and sustainable lifestyle than the one-way shared car system members. Besides, some suggestions are recommended for future studies. A research gap has been identified regarding the direction of causation between vehicle ownership levels and car-sharing demand. Most studies have worked on the impact of vehicle ownership on car-sharing or simply noted a correlation between the two. However, clarifying any reverse effect would help in better assessing the sustainability of car-sharing services. This overview can guide policymakers, planners, and other stakeholders to enhance the car-sharing program's effectiveness and opt for the best kind of service according to their goals.",2590-1982,Not found
Feasibility study for the estimation of a motorcycle helmet Centre of Gravity accelerations with 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) system,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100603,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBIs) is the most frequent cause of serious and fatal road crashes. European Community has adopted an automatic emergency call system (eCall) and made it mandatory for new cars since 2018. eCall was adapted also to motorcycles, which are worldwide linked to significant mortality and trauma rates in crashes. In this context, the development of a helmet fitted with sensors, capable to estimate biomechanical crash consequences and to transmit the information over the eCall system, has the potential to reduce motorcycle crashes severity. The aim of this study is to adapt the 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) method to the estimation of the linear and rotational accelerations of a helmet Centre of Gravity (CoG) during an impact and check the fitness of the method for the scope. The research was performed with virtual testing tools, reproducing three impacts of the helmet on a deformable structure at 8 m/s. The results indicate that the 6DOF estimates the peak values of the linear acceleration components with good approximation, while the peak values of the rotational acceleration components and the time histories of all the components present large errors. The 6DOF cannot be extended beyond the application to rigid bodies and another prediction method has to be identified for the accelerations of the helmet centre of gravity.",2590-1982,Not found
Examining tourists’ intention to use electric vehicle-sharing services,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100610,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Tourists’ mobility is closely linked with the concept of sustainable tourism, since it affects issues that are related with the local economies and the environment. The seasonality of the transport demand in touristic areas results in traffic congestion phenomena and extensive air pollution. At the same time, the touristic areas have to serve the special mobility needs of tourists, in order to be competitive and increase their market. For reducing the negative impacts of demand seasonality and serving the tourists efficiently, innovative mobility concepts and services can contribute. In this framework, a questionnaire study was conducted in the island of Rhodes, Greece aiming to investigate the willingness of tourists to use shared electric vehicles for intra-destination trips. The responses were analyzed descriptively and through statistical modelling techniques. The results of the analysis show that electric car-sharing can expect a greater demand comparing to electric moto-sharing and electric bike-sharing. Also, the results indicate that electric car-sharing will mainly attract a market share from the traditional car rental schemes. Finally, it seems that the intention of tourists to use shared electric vehicles is highly affected by their mobility-related habits and experiences in their hometown.",2590-1982,Not found
Development of lower flammability limits testing apparatus for gasoline vapor – Air mixture using an internal vaporizer at ambient conditions,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100613,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Fire accidents at public fuel stations in Indonesia have urged the need to characterize the causes of these fires. In the gas station area, the formation of gasoline vapor is the main concern of this research. Therefore, this study aims to analyze lower flammability limits (LFLs) of gasoline vapor-air mixtures of the selected gasoline samples. The LFL of gasoline vapor was characterized using a 1.2 L vertical tube integrated with an internal evaporator and a high voltage electric lighter with the energy of 10 J. The tube is made of glass with a diameter of 80 mm and a height of 300 mm with an open top end. This apparatus can run two test methods of upward and downward propagation. The experiment was conducted at the ambient condition with an evaporation temperature of the sample being 150 °C for the internal evaporator. Four gasoline samples were used with varying octane numbers (RON) obtained from arbitrary public gas stations. For validation, Iso-octane (IO) reference fluid with a purity level of 99.5% was tested for the assessment of LFL. The results with the upward propagation method showed that the LFL volume-based concentration were 1.62%, 1.61%, 1.64%, 1.60% and 1.05%, and downward propagation method were 2.48%, 2.39%, 2.30%, 2.11% and 1.57% for RON_88, RON_90, RON_92, RON_95 and IO_100 samples respectively. This study shows that a downward propagation flame has a higher gas temperature with lower velocity compared to an upward flame, which suggests that lower elevation fuel vapor sources at gas stations have a higher fire potential. This research topic is in an effort to provide input on the fire hazards at gas stations that are specific for tropical conditions with traffic practices such as in Indonesia and other countries that face similar hazards and threats. This study can provide input for further transportation safety policies and research.",2590-1982,Not found
Investigating spatial accessibility to urban facility outcome of transit-oriented development in Dhaka,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100607,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Transit-oriented development (TOD) is credited with improving urban residents’ quality of life (QoL) and social sustainability by ensuring adequate and convenient spatial access to urban facilities. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence to suggest that TOD is likely to ensure spatial accessibility to urban facilities in developing countries. Using Dhaka as a case study, this study aims at answering this question by: a) assessing a neighborhood’s potential for TOD using cluster analysis of built environment (BE) factors (job-household ratio, cul-de-sac density, connected node ratio, land use diversity, distance to transit stop, and public transit accessibility); b) authenticating the selection of TOD types based on travel behavior and property value; c) quantifying an integrated spatial accessibility index of urban facilities for two time periods and finding their association with TOD; and d) identifying the relationship among BE indicators and spatial accessibility to urban facilities for the year 2019 using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), and Spatial Error Model (SEM). The results demonstrated that TOD neighborhoods possess better spatial accessibility to urban facilities compared to non-TODs. Spatial accessibility to urban facilities has also increased significantly in TOD areas over time. Regression models indicate a statistically significant relationship between accessibility and BE variables indicators. The SEM model was the most effective in describing the variation in geographic accessibility to urban facilities when compared to the other two regression models-OLS and SLM. These findings would recommend policymakers and planners to continue to advocate for TOD for ensuring better accessibility to urban facilities.",2590-1982,Not found
Active transportation pilot program evaluation: A longitudinal assessment of bicycle facility density changes on use in Minneapolis,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100604,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Cities around the world are adding bicycle facilities to enhance physically active travel to improve sustainable transport and public health outcomes. One of the most promising policy interventions is the use of targeted pilot programs that aim to build connected networks of bicycle facilities to increase bicycle use. In the United States, the federal Nonmotorized Transportation Pilot Program (NTPP) provided approximately $25 million to four communities (Columbia, MO, Marin County, CA, Minneapolis, MN, and Sheboygan County, WI) to test the impact of building a full network of bicycle facilities. This study examines the impact of the NTPP in Minneapolis to determine whether the addition of bicycle facilities and increased density of bicycle facilities are related to increased bicycle ridership over time. Secondarily, the study examines the impact of differing facility types (protected facilities like trails vs. non-protected facilities like on-street bike lanes) on bicycle use. The study finds that both the presence of and density of bicycle facilities emerged as significant independent predictors of bicycle counts and growth in counts over time. Compared to locations with no facility, sites with protected facilities had 113 more cyclists during the evening peak 2-hour count period (95% CI 16.19, 209.99; p = 0.02) and a greater rate of increase in cyclist counts over time. Over the study period, counts increased by 69% at locations with protected bikeways, by 26% at locations with on-street bike lanes, and by 10% at locations with no on-site facility.",2590-1982,Not found
Effects on accidents of police checks of drivers of heavy goods vehicles in Norway,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100606,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"During the period from 2007 to 2019, the number of drivers of heavy goods vehicles checked by the traffic police in Norway varied substantially. It declined during the first years of the period, then increased. This paper studies where there is an association between these variations and annual changes in the number of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles. A negative relationship is found: the more drivers checked, the fewer accidents. The relationship can be described by means of a dose–response function. The function indicates that when the number of drivers checked by the police is reduced by 50%, one may expect the number of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles to increase by 7.5%. A 50% increase in the number of drivers checked will be associated with a 3.5% reduction in the number of accidents, and a 150% increase in the number of drivers checked will be associated with an 8.6% reduction in the number of accidents.",2590-1982,Not found
An alternative regulatory approach for long-distance passenger rail services: An explorative analysis with a focus on Germany,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100593,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Regulatory efforts to introduce effective intramodal competition to the rail sector, in particular to the long-distance intercity market segment, have so far been only marginally successful in Germany. This stands in stark contrast to some other EU member states such as Italy, Sweden, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Spain and, most recently, France. In 2019, the year before the outbreak of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic and 25 years after Germany’s fundamental 1994 ‘Bahnstrukturreform’ (structural reform of the railway system), which eliminated the legal network monopoly of former Deutsche Bundesbahn for passenger transport services, the combined market share of all competitors for long-distance passenger services was still marginal at 4 per cent (Bundesnetzagentur, 2021a, 26). By contrast, its competitors’ market shares stood at 28 per cent for short-distance (regional) services – where a competition for the market regime had been established – and at 54 per cent in the rail cargo segment – which is governed by an open access regime. In this paper, based on a comparative institution analysis, we explore an alternative regulatory regime to substantially increase effective intramodal competition in Germany’s intercity rail passenger market: open access to the incumbent’s seat inventory. Our main finding is that, compared to the existing yet ineffective open (track) access regime, our proposed alternative considerably reduces entry barriers for newcomers and simplifies regulatory oversight given the specific features of Germany’s railway market.",2590-1982,Not found
COVID-19 lockdown as an opportunity to rethink urban freight distribution: Lessons from the Barcelona metropolitan area,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100605,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The COVID-19 health crisis has had a strong impact on societies around the world, affecting both the health of populations and countries’ economies. While lockdowns imposed to stop the spread of infection reduced urban mobility and had a positive impact on air quality, lowering the emission of polluting particles and greenhouse gases, they had the opposite effect on urban freight distribution (UFD). With the population remaining at home, ecommerce-driven shipments surged, and total freight traffic increased. In order to have a better understanding of this phenomenon, the aim of this study was to identify the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on the daily operation of the region’s main logistics agents. Lessons learned from this cyclical scenario could be used to define more sustainable public policies regarding UFD in the post-COVID era. To meet the above objectives, semi-structured interviews were conducted with public administrations and private operators, before being transcribed and encoded for later analysis. The results of our study show that common problems in UFD, such as traffic congestion or problems finding parking in the loading and unloading (L/U) zones, temporarily disappeared during the lockdown phase. Delivery times were consequently reduced, despite an increase in operations due to ecommerce. In addition, the public administrations took advantage of this situation to adapt the urban space and force a transition towards new delivery systems, such as cargo-bikes, to guarantee sustainable last-mile operations in specific zones.",2590-1982,Not found
Aggressive-dynamics metrics for drive-cycle characterization,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100592,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"In the pursuit of policies and regulations on real-world driving emissions, it becomes necessary to quantifiably define what constitutes “real-world driving.” Measurements of ambient temperature, pressure, and humidity can be used to quantify the weather. Routes can be quantified by their fixed characteristics such as length, road grades, and speed limits. Variable traffic conditions can be quantified by the number of traffic encounters, the number of traffic stops, the fraction of traffic limited driving, et cetera. A real-world drive cycle arises from the interactions between the driver, weather, route, and traffic. People sometimes colloquially described drive cycles in terms of aggressiveness. This subjective characteristic of aggressiveness is here quantified using dynamics metrics, and it is discussed how such metrics could be used by researchers and regulators. A new dynamics metric, the average judicative element, is presented in this investigation. This new metric is compared to previously developed metrics, and its advantages and disadvantages are considered. It is argued how the average judicative element is a superior aggressive-dynamics metric for characterizing drive cycles in scientific studies and governmental regulations.",2590-1982,Not found
Presence of tourists and perceived safety from COVID-19 among local bus users: Evidence from a Mediterranean city,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100599,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, public transport has been signalled as a potential contagion hot-spot, leading to a generalised decrease in its use. However, public transport use is still being used and little is known about how the perception of loyal users is configured in contexts of influenza-like viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The configuration of the perception of safety acquires a critical importance in urban contexts where the public transport system is used both by tourists and local users. The presence of strangers or higher crowding levels could impact the perception of safety among residents and their consequent travel behaviour. In the present study, we explored how the presence of tourists influences the configuration of the perception safety related to the transmission of COVID-19 on public transport of daily users. We used data from an ad-hoc survey conducted at the main bus stations and stops of the Tarragona Urban Area (Catalonia, Spain) between August and September 2020. This area includes the Costa Daurada coastal destination. The 2020 summer holiday season was characterised for the relaxation of mobility restrictions and the start of the second wave of COVID-19. Results show how the presence of tourists in buses negatively influenced the perception of safety of local users. However, this influence can be mostly explained to their prior perception of risk of contagion. These findings will be useful for policymakers and public transport managers in both the latter stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and future virus-related epidemics to maintain public transport ridership.",2590-1982,Not found
Can a racial justice frame help overcome opposition to automated traffic enforcement?,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100594,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Traffic safety cameras are used infrequently in the United States due to perceived public opposition. While efforts to increase public acceptance have traditionally focused on safety benefits, this paper explores an alternative approach. Recently, automated enforcement has attracted new supporters who see traffic cameras as a way to reduce racial profiling and minimize violent encounters between police and the public. Can we increase public support for cameras by framing them as a tool for reducing interpersonal racial bias? Is there a risk of backlash among some groups (e.g., white, conservative, and those who approve of racial profiling)? We answer these questions using a survey experiment with a representative sample of the U.S. public. We find that an interpersonal racial justice frame increases stated support for cameras (OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.11–3.18) and that this result persists when controlling for personal characteristics, political ideology, and views on policing. This racial justice frame did not result in backlash, although it was ineffective for some groups. Finally, we draw on rich written responses from 415 respondents to characterize views on cameras and policing. Ultimately, we find that a racial justice frame may be a useful addition to the advocate’s toolkit.",2590-1982,Not found

This study aims to evaluate the potential opportunities of public-private partnerships for MOD planning while presenting an overview of the challenges and lessons learned during the implementation of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Sandbox Program projects. Following a comprehensive review of MOD's background, we identify the goals and scopes of the 11 FTA Sandbox Program projects. The programs are classified into four categories: service to people with disabilities, first/last mile solutions, mobile application targeting one non-transit mode, and mobile application to integrate public and private transportation services on one app. Emphasizing particular FTA Sandbox Program projects, we determine the challenges and technical lessons learned during the implementation of the programs.

Unravelling the rationalities of childhood cycling promotion,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100598,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Decrease of children’s independent mobility (CIM) has worried academics, policymakers, educators and other professionals for decades. Research and policy often emphasise that promoting children’s physically active and independent transport modes as cycling is important to achieve better public health, solve environmental challenges and increase related economic benefits. Yet, cycling promotion is not a neutral process and all promotion efforts are derived from latent notions of ‘cyclists’ and ‘cycling’. This paper discusses different rationalities of childhood cycling promotion and the representations of ‘children’ as independent ‘cyclists’ they entail. We argue that in order to efficiently promote cycling across contexts, we should better understand children’s cycling experiences and meanings they ascribe to it and how their mobilities emergence in the flux of social, institutional and political relations. By applying action research to a local cycling promotion project in Finland we explore how instrumental, functional and alternative rationalities emerged and resulted in differing representations of children as cyclists. While all rationalities played a role in different stages of the project, the results highlight that alternative rationalities as children’s autonomy, positive emotions and friendships were considered the most important drivers of new cycling practices among project participants. In conclusion we propose children’s autonomous mobility as the most appropriate term to depict their cycling and other self-imposed (but relational) mobility practices.",2590-1982,Not found
Is the 15-minute city within reach? Evaluating walking and cycling accessibility to grocery stores in Vancouver,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100602,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Leaders around the world have embraced the idea of a “15-minute city”. This urban planning concept proposes a city where residents can meet their essential needs within a short walking or cycling trip from their home. Local access to grocery stores is a necessary component for cities to achieve the 15-minute city. This study aims to evaluate local accessibility to grocery stores by walking and cycling in the City of Vancouver. We used a cumulative opportunity measure to count the number of grocery stores available within a 15-minute walk and cycle from people’s homes. To evaluate accessibility from the perspective of younger and older travellers, we considered different travel speeds. Our results show there is good accessibility to grocery stores when cycling, with less than 1% of the city’s population not having a grocery store within a 15-minute cycle. When assuming a walking speed of an older pedestrian, around one-fifth of the population did not have access to a grocery store in their local area. The neighbourhoods that did not have a store within a 15-minute walk had higher proportions of children, older adults, and visible minorities, and lower rates of employment and post-secondary education attainment. In seeking to improve accessibility via walking and cycling, cities should prioritize grocery store locations and investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure to underserved neighbourhoods and populations.",2590-1982,Not found
Communicating perceptions of pedestrian comfort and safety: Structural topic modeling of open response survey comments,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100600,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Purely quantitative or qualitative studies of perceived comfort and safety have different strengths and limitations related to scope, reliability, and generalizability. To pursue new insights about perceptions of pedestrian comfort and safety, this study uses the novel approach of Structural Topic Modeling to organize open-response comments into prominent topics, or themes, and explore the factors affecting the prevalence and content of topics. The study data come from a survey in which participants rated short video clips of pedestrians interacting with motor vehicles or bicycles at unsignalized crosswalks, and then provided optional open-response comments about each video. Modeling results identified six topics in the text data: (1) driver behaviour and pedestrian risk, (2) pedestrian risk assessment and mitigation, (3) pedestrians not waiting before crossing, (4) cyclists leaving the bicycle lane, (5) cyclists’ yielding necessity, and (6) and cyclists’ speed modifications. The prevalence of the topics was significantly affected by attributes of the interaction (vehicle type—bicycle or car—and its proximity), and attributes of the perceiver (travel habits and self-reported risk aversion). Topic prevalence was unrelated to participants’ comfort and safety ratings for the same interactions, indicating that topic modeling provides a fundamentally different source of information than quantitative severity ratings. The findings help to illuminate why pedestrian-cyclist interactions may attract disproportionate attention from the travelling public, despite their relatively lower risk than interactions with motor vehicle drivers.",2590-1982,Not found
Analysis of initial speed pedelec usage for commuting purposes in Flanders,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100589,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Speed pedelecs, pedal-powered two-wheelers with motor assistance up to 45km/h, are relatively new vehicles for active travel on European roads, with Flanders at the forefront of adoption. Policies by European and national entities have allowed speed pedelecs to be used, yet the policies have been based on assumptions and modelling about speeds reached, rather than measured data. This paper presents analysis of naturalistic speed pedelec behaviour by 98 individuals at 10 companies in Flanders, who logged commuting and leisure rides with smartphone GPS during three-week test periods as part of the 365SNEL project using fifteen speed pedelecs, ranging in motor power from 250W to 800W. The cruising speed, the speed at which the largest distance is covered, and the 95th percentile (P95) speed (as a realistic maximum speed) are proposed as Key Performance Indicators to better evaluate speed pedelec behaviour. Cruising speeds for men were consistently higher than women (mean values: men 38.2km /h, women 33.5km /h). For all participants, the mean commuting P95 speed of 40.1km/h is 5km/h below the expected 45km/h, which points to potential over-regulation of speed pedelecs according to their expected maximum speed. Contrasting logged commuting cycling trips with leisure trips indicates that speed pedelecs can be characterised by their speed metrics, regardless of their travel purpose. Policymakers can therefore facilitate active travel with its commensurate physical and mental health benefits by investing in and designating routes for higher-speed (active) travel, and conversely reserve other routes for slower travel modes.",2590-1982,Not found
Leveraging the spatial-temporal resolution of crowdsourced cycling data to improve the estimation of hourly bicycle volume,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100596,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Traditional methods for measuring bicycle volume have proven to be challenging and costly, especially when planning for non-motorized facilities at network level. One potential enhancement to traditional bicycle volume measurement methods is to use crowdsourced cycling data in conjunction with other data. This study explored the potential of incorporating crowdsourced data in bicycle volume estimation methods to improve the spatial-temporal coverage and resolution. To account for the potential biases associated with crowdsourced data, the study used additional predictors to enhance estimations. Different probabilistic and Machine Learning models were tested, including the Negative Binomial (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Both RF and ANN model were found to have a better prediction capability compared to other models. For the RF model, the addition of crowdsourced bicycle counts from Strava, which had an average observed penetration rate of 7 percent across study sites, improved the model significantly by increasing its ability to explain variations in hourly bicycle volume from 65 percent (R2 = 0.65) to 71 percent (R2 = 0.71). A simulation study to assess the change in model performance based on different simulated penetration rates found that a penetration rate of about 40 percent would improve prediction capability to 96 percent. To demonstrate a practical way for integrating crowdsourced data in practice, a web-based tool that can be used to estimate bicycle counts was developed. The results of this study can assist planners and engineers to make informed decisions by providing them with a quick method for estimating bicycle volume over a network when they have counts from crowdsourced data sources.",2590-1982,Not found

Drive modes allow drivers to alter their vehicles’ operating characteristics including propulsion energy sources, responsiveness of the steering wheel/accelerator pedal, etc. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) can use energy from a combination of a battery and a fuel source to propel themselves, so drive modes that can shift vehicle propulsion power sources can directly impact energy usage and emissions in these vehicles. This study examines the use of drive modes in PHEVs. We use empirical, on-road vehicle data to explore whether drivers are using drive modes as intended by vehicle manufacturers and to develop a regression model and engine start analysis to quantify the impact of mode usage on PHEV energy efficiency and emissions. We find that incorrect use of drive modes leads to a 15–30% increase in energy usage and higher engine start emissions.",2590-1982,Not found

The analyses were based on 432 school students aged 13–18 years in Yogyakarta. The model results revealed two main determinants influencing the perceived disadvantages of cycling among adolescents. The first is related to the environment and constraints, and the second to cycling attitudes. However, the results revealed that rather than perceived disadvantages, habitual behaviors determine the cycling frequency for adolescents’ school commute. With regards to respondents’ characteristics and their households, boys and adolescents living in households with less car ownerships tend to cycle to school more often. Furthermore, attitude-related perceived disadvantages of cycling were affected by socio-demographic factors, such as age, gender, and number of cars and family members. However, only gender and car ownership substantially influenced the environment and constraints-related perceived disadvantages of cycling. Based on the findings of this study, policy recommendations were proposed to increase bicycle use for school trips among adolescents.",2590-1982,Not found
Analysis of the potential of a new concept for urban last-mile delivery: Ducktrain,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100579,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"As cities continue to grow and the online retailing business continues to boom, last-mile logistics is becoming more and more of a challenge. This paper introduces Ducktrains, a new electric, automated, and compact light vehicle logistic solution for dense urban areas. Moreover, we present first insights on the potential of such a concept from a transport planning and social science perspective. Using a comparative transport analysis focusing on the factors speed, payload, and range, we validated the vehicles’ suitability for urban delivery. To explore social acceptance, we used an empirical mixed-method approach, conducting both a qualitative interview study (N = 70) and an online survey (N = 1007). Results of both analyses reveal the general suitability of the introduced concept for urban deliveries. The Ducktrains showed to be competitive for standard delivery tours, and acceptance was generally high, with the main associated advantages being environmental friendliness and quality of life improvements. However, some concerns, including negative impacts on the overall traffic situation and safety, remain from the public’s perspective.",2590-1982,Not found
Macroscopic flow characterization at T-junctions,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100591,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"At T-junctions, a minor road meets a main road and merging vehicles from the minor road create traffic bottlenecks as significant interactions between vehicles occur. These interactions reduce road capacity resulting in congestion. The Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model is widely employed to characterize traffic flow. However, this model only considers small changes in flow which can be inadequate for T-junctions. Thus, a new model is proposed which is based on driver response during transitions at these junctions. The proposed and LWR models are evaluated using the first order upwind scheme (FOUS). The Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) condition is employed to ensure model stability. Results are presented which show that the proposed model better characterizes traffic flow at T-junctions.",2590-1982,Not found
"Financing low-carbon transport transition in the Philippines: Mapping financing sources, gaps and directionality of innovation",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100590,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Successfully achieving a low-carbon transition in the transport sector requires an understanding of the lending logics of the financial institutions in order to identify the financing directionality and gaps. However, in the transportation literature, there is a lack of attention on the relationship between financing sources and the direction of innovation. The present study seeks to address this by mapping the flow of finance from financial institutions to transport projects. Our dataset consists of 9 transport projects included in the Philippines’ Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). We consider different types of projects (rail development, bus rapid transit implementation, jeepney modernization) and various financial actors (multi-lateral banks, private and government banks). Through an analysis of loan portfolio composition and interview data, we uncover the underlying logics of each financial institution in lending to transport projects. Our findings suggest that the lending logics of many financial institutions is primarily driven by portfolio and borrower credit-worthiness considerations, and less by motivations concerning sustainability transition. As a result, with respect to the average, some transport projects are over-financed (e.g. rail development), while others – which have a high potential to accelerate decarbonization – are under-financed (e.g. jeepney modernization). All these have profound implications for the directionality of low-carbon transition. Deeper engagement of transition research with finance is a nascent field, and the current research contributes to the literature not only by presenting a comprehensive mapping of several financing sources and projects, but also of proposing three credit enhancement mechanisms to mobilize capital for under-financed projects.",2590-1982,Not found

Our paper fills this gap by conducting a worldwide analysis of monthly passenger air services at the airport level, and discussing factors that shape this temporality. Our study found that 36% of airports worldwide (accounting for less than 12% of seats) experience a significant degree of seasonality, and that larger airports are less affected. On the one hand, diverse travel purposes related to larger cities, hubbing, physical geography, remoteness and appropriate weather throughout the year induce stable seat capacity. On the other hand, climate profiles and institutional factors are key factors of peaks.

Tunnel effects on road efficiency and travel time explored by a three lane traffic model,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100573,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"To ascertain tunnel effects upon road efficiency and travel time of ring road traffic, a mathematical model accounting of three lanes is investigated. The model uses traffic pressure and sound speed in algebraic form, and a single traffic speed to describe the vehicular motions on the three lane instantaneously to simplify mathematical modeling of traffic flow. The ring road with a total length 100km has a tunnel with a length of 8km and a speed limit of 80km/h. The free flow speeds on lane I, II and III are assumed to be 110, 100, and 90km/h. Using the model, a code is elaborated for numerical simulations on the three lane ring road. For validating the model the tunnel length is reset as 1.5km, so that the conformity between the predicted time averaged speed and the recorded speed near the Kobotoke tunnel in Japan can be seen clearly. It is found that the threshold of traffic shock formation near the tunnel can be determined by observing spatiotemporal pattern of traffic flow. When and where traffic shock appears relies on the free flow speed on lane III. Road efficiency and travel time for the ring road traffic are predicted and discussed. The numerical findings in this paper deepen the understanding of tunnel effects.",2590-1982,Not found
Testing cycling infrastructure layout in virtual environments: An examination from a bicycle rider's perspective in simulation and online,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100586,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Marked on-road infrastructure for bicycle riders is a fast and cost-efficient way to expand cycling infrastructure and thus promote cycling as a means of transport. Infrastructure layout has been shown to influence cyclists’ as well as car drivers’ behavior towards cyclists in traffic observations, with on-street markings for cyclists in some circumstances reducing overtaking distances by car drivers. Simulator and online studies promise to provide a fast and easy way of rapid prototyping infrastructure layouts. But, despite of good face validity, how trustworthy are the results of both these research tools? In a case-study to inform planning authorities, two studies, one in a cycling simulator and an online survey, evaluated the effects of different on-street markings from bicycle riders’ perspectives. Results showed that in mixed traffic stronger visual separation between parking cars and flowing traffic and a bicycle pictogram on the road induced greater lateral distance of bicycle riders from parking cars. This infrastructure layout was also rated as safe, comfortable, and comprehensible from bicycle riders’ perspectives. From a methods’ evaluation perspective, effects from the cycling simulator may be interpreted as behaviorally valid relatively between conditions only. Both methods offer a cost-effective approach to initially test infrastructure solutions by weeding out the less favorable ones in the early stages of the design.",2590-1982,Not found
Potential impacts of institutional dynamics on the development of automated vehicles: Towards sustainable mobility?,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100587,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Most experts agree that automated vehicles (AV) will be commercialized sooner or later and that this will lead to far-reaching changes in the mobility system. However, it is still open whether these developments will lead to more sustainable transport systems. AVs may render private car ownership more attractive and therefore intensify car-oriented mobility patterns, or may increase the attractiveness of public transport when mostly used as robo-taxis. Once development has started to move in a specific direction, self-reinforcing dynamics and path-dependencies may unfold. Therefore, it is important to analyze which factors may influence the direction of path-dependencies. We argue that understanding emerging path-dependencies requires an understanding of the interrelated technical, economic and societal dynamics. We draw on recent insights into societal dynamics in sociotechnical regimes, drawn from sustainability transition research, to identify potential development trajectories of automated driving due to changes in what is conceptualized as normative-cognitive institutions. We introduce an approach to map such institutional dynamics based on recent data from developments in the German mobility sector. Results demonstrate that the direction of future AV pathways may depend on such institutional developments. Both a reinforcing and a disruptive pathway are plausible. Governance strategies that aim to tap the potential of AVs in supporting sustainable urban mobility should consider institutional dynamics more explicitly.",2590-1982,Not found
Micromobility injury events: Motor vehicle crashes and other transportation systems factors,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100574,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Potential safety issues have been one area of concern in policy debates over micromobility transportation. Existing research has mostly explored micromobility safety from a medical perspective. To inform transportation policy strategies to try and improve safety performance, this paper explores the circumstances in which injured micromobility riders sustained their injuries, with a focus on factors related to the transportation system. Data comes from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a United States national sample of emergency room visits. Information on injury circumstances is mostly not coded by default in NEISS data, but detail was scraped from reading a short narrative comment line with each case. Crashes with motor vehicles were the most frequently mentioned transportation-related injury circumstance in the data. Pavement condition and hilly train were among other measurable transportation-related factors. Crashes are particularly problematic as logistic regression modeling shows that patients who crashed with motor vehicles were about 150 percent more likely to be hospitalized and 30 percent more likely to suffer a head injury. After controlling for demographics and injury circumstances, some variation in hospitalization risk was found between micromobility devices. In particular, patients who were injured riding motorized bicycles and motorized scooters had higher likelihoods of hospitalization versus riders of human-powered bicycles. Patients riding kick scooters and devices presumed to be Segways had lower likelihoods of hospitalization versus bicycles.",2590-1982,Not found
Residents’ acceptance towards car-free street experiments: Focus on perceived quality of life and neighborhood attachment,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100585,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"While the twentieth century was dominated by private car usage, shifts towards more sustainable urban mobility, to mitigate environmental damage and increase health benefits, are now taking place. In Scandinavia, several car-free street experiments take form, that span from permanent car-free inner-city plans (i.e. Oslo) to temporary interventions (i.e. pop-up plaza and parklets) to shift the use of urban settings and infrastructures from motorised traffic towards spaces for people and social interactions. Specifically, in Sweden, transitory car-free street experiments (i.e. summer streets) are developed with the purpose of creating novel mobility patterns and uses of public spaces that enhance social inclusion and quality of life. Despite Swedish municipalities’ monitoring of these interventions, very little is known about whichphysical parameters (i.e. environmental qualities) and psychosocial processes (i.e. emotional relation with places) affect people’s acceptance and placeusability during car-free initiatives. Following the guidelines proposed by the European Commission, this paper focuses on residents’ perception of car-free street experiments. The aim is to identify howacceptance andusabilityof car-free street experiments might vary depending on the perceived qualities of the physical urban settings and on interceding psychosocial processes such as, neighborhood attachment and perceived quality of life. An interdisciplinary methodology of investigation merging knowledge from the field ofenvironmental psychology, landscape architecture, urban transport and planning wasapplied on four case studies in Sweden.Results suggest that psychosocial processes of place attachment and quality of life are relevant in order to understand the level of acceptance towards car-free streets implementations.",2590-1982,Not found

RCTs are still unusual in transportation planning, and this is the first RCT transportation protocol we are aware of seeking publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The trial tests a mobility-as-a-service app aimed at shifting mode choice to campus among an intervention student population while also tracking in parallel the mode choices of the control group. The concept behind the intervention is to leverage information and marketing to shift students' intentions relative to their travel to campus, following Azjen’s Theory of Planned Behavior. The app, which is custom developed under the guidance of the research team, facilitates students' trips to campus by transit, biking, walking, and ride-hailing. An intended secondary outcome of the intervention is improved academic outcomes among students in the intervention group. The research team developed the protocol through a literature review of campus-based travel demand management measures, then by vetting a draft protocol with an expert panel, and then through a series of survey pilots.

This article aims to juxtapose the need for collaborative, adaptive and outcome-based governance models in the mobility sector before and after the pandemic started. First, we analyse the governance needs and trends related to mobility innovations that were identified during two workshops with public and private actors in the mobility sector and through an extensive research of new governance models already applied in many European countries.

A series of binary logit models are built to analyze what factors affect the OGS with the influence of COVID-19. The results show a significant shift from PGS to OGS due to the pandemic, which is also extended beyond COVID-19. People who are female, have more available vehicles, higher income, and health constraints, or worry the virus show more tendency to choose OGS as the primary mode during COVID-19, and stay with OGS after COVID-19.

Integrating public transportation and shared autonomous mobility for equitable transit coverage: A cost-efficiency analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100571,14,2022-06-01,2022,6,"As automated transportation technology advances, public transit agencies could consider how integrating autonomous vehicles and shuttles into existing transit systems affects equity. Capital and operating costs for automated mobility modes managed by public transit agencies are uncertain since few deployments have occurred to date. Automated vehicles and shuttles are agile for dynamic routing and can make use of the existing transportation infrastructure, but operating costs remain uncertain. This study aims to characterize the economic feasibility of improving transit coverage and transit equity of public transportation with shared automated mobility. Cost efficiency analysis compares direct operating costs of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and autonomous shuttles to a conventional transit bus. Using Allegheny County, Pennsylvania as a case study, the analysis considers potentially adding shuttle or SAV service to expand service for the existing public transit system. The results suggest it is feasible to improve transit equity with shared AVs and shuttles at lower costs than buses on average. Revenue kilometers traveled, fleet size, and operating hours are the most important parameters that determine cost-efficiency. Transit planners and policymakers can use this analysis to inform shared autonomous mobility operation guidelines to ensure emerging technology services remain a complement to existing transit.",2590-1982,Not found

Cycling in the era of Covid-19: The effects of the pandemic and pop-up cycle lanes on cycling practices,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100677,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This paper addresses the effects of the pandemic and of Covid pop-up cycle lanes on cycling. A questionnaire survey was carried out in Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland. The pandemic has strengthened the attractiveness of cycling both as a mode of transport and as a recreational activity, showing its resilience in a time of crisis. Covid cycle lanes implemented after the first lockdown have improved traffic conditions for cycling in terms of safety, directness and the overall experience. Beyond the recruitment of new cyclists, an effect of consolidating existing practices is observed through, for example, their extension to additional routes and motives. These pop-up cycle lanes have, however, been politically contested, and their reception varies in the population, depending mainly on mobility habits and political position. As both cities aim to increase their modal share of cycling, the challenge is to capitalize on the recent development of cycling, to provide suitable infrastructures, but also to find ways to deal with the controversies and to legitimate cycling as a fully-fledged means of transport.",2590-1982,Not found

On the road safety benefits of advanced driver assistance systems in different driving contexts,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100670,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have introduced several benefits in the vehicular industry, and their proliferation presents potential opportunities to decrease road accidents. The reasons are mainly attributed to the enhanced perception of the driving environment and reduced human errors. However, as environmental and infrastructural conditions influence the performance of ADAS, the estimation of accident reductions varies across geographical regions. This study presents an interdisciplinary methodology that integrates the literature on advanced driving technologies and road safety to quantify the expected impact of ADAS on accident reduction across combinations of road types, lighting, and weather conditions. The paper investigates the safety effectiveness of ADAS and the distribution of frequency and severity of road accidents across 18 driving contexts and eight accident types. Using road safety reports from the United Kingdom (UK), it is found that a high concentration of accidents (77%) occurs within a small subset of contextual conditions (4 out of 18) and that the most severe accidents happen in dark conditions on rural roads or motorways. The results of the safety effectiveness analysis show that a full deployment of the six most common ADAS would reduce the road accident frequency in the UK by 23.8%, representing an annual decrease of 18,925 accidents. The results also show that the most frequent accident contexts, urban-clear-daylight and rural-clear-daylight, can be reduced by 29%, avoiding 7,020 and 3,472 accidents, respectively. Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) is the most impactful technology, reducing three out of the four most frequent accident categories – intersection (by 28%), rear-end (by 27.7%), and pedestrian accidents (by 28.4%). This study helps prioritise resources in ADAS research and development focusing on the most relevant contexts to reduce the frequency and severity of road accidents.

Electrified road transport through plug-in hybrid powertrains: Compliance by simulation of CO<inf>2</inf> specific emission targets with real driving cycles,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100651,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Worldwide targets on specific CO2 emissions (g/km) seem to make the use of internal combustion engines (ICE) prohibitive when adopting conventional driving cycles concerning road transport. This research comes therefore from the necessity of an accurate analysis of the real driving habits in order to evaluate whether its implementation on an alternative powertrain, suitable to differentiate urban (local zero emissions) and extra-urban travels (highest performances of ICEs, even better than electric motors when contemplating the entire energy chain), can guarantee the compliance with specific CO2 emissions reduction legislation; this last has been introduced with the aim of containing or even erasing global emissions from the transport sector in next years. After an overview of all the main available technological alternatives, as regards powertrains, the Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) solution has been analysed. An experimental driving cycle is proposed by combining representative cycles obtained from a previous study, based on data provided by FCA, now Stellantis, where a clustering procedure has been applied to a sample of over two-thousand real journeys made in 2015 and 2016 in all Europe with conventional automobiles; appropriate ranges of distance, time, average speed in urban and extra urban conditions, idle times and stops have been identified thanks to a statistical analysis and the cycle has been created with all of these requirements to be as similar as possible to most of daily trips by road transport. PHEV market has been examined in order to identify the components and architectures that characterize the most registered automobiles; a realistic model has therefore been created and used for the experimental cycle simulation. Simulation results show that PHEV technology has the potential to consume 69% less fuel than a conventional vehicle counterpart with a consequent reduction of 71% in emitted tank-to-wheel (TTW) tons of CO2 and significant reductions in fuel expenditure, in one year, because of the different source of energy.",2590-1982,Not found

In particular, the paper aims to separate the effects of mobility and government restrictions on BSS ridership and analyse whether long-term positive effects are observable in this city. Results indicate that both mobility and government stringency measures significantly and positively affected BSS usage, particularly in residential areas and close to public parks. However, after the first wave of the pandemic passed and government measures were partially lifted, BSS ridership declined in line with the elimination of the restrictions. New users often churned after their first trial, and usage frequency dropped to lower levels than before the pandemic. This indicates that BSS was a valuable transportation mode during a pandemic, but a permanent increase in usage was not observed in Budapest despite a considerable price decrease in bicycle fares. The unsatisfactory experiences with this BSS, primarily due to heavy bike frames and solid rubber tires may be the cause of this. Our results prove the benefits of BSS in mitigating a pandemic but call the attention to the need to improve particular system characteristics that may undermine long-term ridership. These characteristics can be different for every BSS; hence, local market research is required. This limits the generalizability of the results.",2590-1982,Not found
Older Adults’ concerns regarding Hurricane-Induced evacuations during COVID-19: Questionnaire findings,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100676,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected our day-to-day life in the last few years. This problem becomes even more challenging when older adults are considered due to their less powerful immune system and vulnerability to infectious diseases, especially in Florida where 4.5 million people aged 65 and over reside. With its long coastline, large and rapidly growing of older adult population, and geographic diversity, Florida is also uniquely vulnerable to hurricanes, which significantly increases the associated risks of COVID-19 even further. This study investigates older adults’ evacuation-related concerns during COVID-19 using statistical analysis of a questionnaire conducted among 389 older adult Florida residents. The questionnaire includes questions concerning demographic information and older adults’ attitudes toward hurricane-induced evacuations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ordered Probit regression models were developed to investigate the impacts of demographic parameters on older adults’ tendencies toward evacuating as well as their preferences to stay at home or shelter during the pandemic. The model results reveal that male participants felt safer to evacuate compared to females. Also, any decrease in the level of income was associated with an increase in the need for help for evacuation by 18%. Findings indicated that the participants who found the evacuation safe normally also had a positive attitude toward staying in their vehicle, hotel, or even shelters if maintaining social distance was possible. Emergency management policies can utilize these findings to enhance hurricane preparations for dealing with the additional health risks posed by the pandemic for older adults, a situation that could be exacerbated by the upcoming hurricane season in Florida.",2590-1982,Not found
Understanding the role of transportation in combating human trafficking in California,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100673,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Human trafficking, a form of modern slavery, is the recruitment, transport, transfer of persons using force, fraud or coercion to exploit them for act of labor or sex. According to the International Labor Organization, human trafficking is the fastest growing organized crime with approximately $150 billion in annual profits and 40.3 million individuals trapped in slave-like conditions. While it is not compulsory to involve transportation for human trafficking, the transportation industry plays a critical role in combating human trafficking as traffickers often rely the transportation system to recruit, move or transfer victims of human trafficking for either sex or forced labor. Recognizing the importance of transportation, multiple anti-trafficking stakeholders in California have started initiatives to address the problem. This project investigates the role of transportation in combatting human trafficking in California by conducting a survey followed up with semi-structured in-depth interviews with key stakeholders.

Achieving the goal of MaaS, which is to promote sustainable forms of transportation and reduce single occupancy vehicle travel, depends on the needs of different user groups. A review of literature confirms that little remains known about gender-based perspectives towards MaaS. This study aims to identify the features that impact satisfaction across gender. After collecting over 29,000 online reviews, series of text mining and unsupervised machine learning technique were performed to extract features discussed by users in the reviews. Next, ordinal logit regression was used to examine associations between extracted features and level of satisfaction. Findings show that public transit is still the backbone of MaaS, as such, other modes of transportation such as micromobility and ridesharing still receive little attention from users. Although, integrated payment options and booking systems were meant to offer MaaS an advantage over classic journey planners, still fare related features were found to contribute to user dissatisfaction. App related features (such as map, technical issues, and updates), often neglected in transportation studies, showed significant association with satisfaction. One of the main contributions of this study is the expanded understanding of gendered attitudes towards MaaS. Few studies have explored gender perspectives towards new mobility concepts, and particularly MaaS.

In particular, we compare freeway use to use of other metered network infrastructure, like electricity grids and water systems.

This article investigates COVID-19-induced mobility-behavioral transformations by analyzing travel patterns of Berlin residents during a 20-month pandemic period and comparing them to the pre-pandemic situation. Based on quantitative analysis of almost 800,000 recorded trips, our longitudinal examination revealed individuals having reduced average monthly travel distances by ∼20%, trip frequencies by ∼11%, and having switched to individual modes. Public transportation has suffered a continual regression, with trip frequencies experiencing a relative long-term reduction of ∼50%, and a respective decrease of traveled distances by ∼43%. In contrast, the bicycle (rather than the car) was the central beneficiary, indicated by bicycle-related trip frequencies experiencing a relative long-term increase of ∼53%, and travel distances increasing by ∼117%. Comparing behavioral responses to three pandemic waves, our analysis revealed each wave to have created unique response patterns, which show a gradual softening of individuals’ mobility related self-restrictions. Our findings contribute to retracing and quantifying individuals’ changing mobility behaviors induced by the pandemic, and to detecting possible long-term effects that may constitute a “new normal” of an entirely altered urban mobility landscape.",2590-1982,Not found
Riding through the pandemic: Using Strava data to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on spatial patterns of bicycling,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100667,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"COVID-19 prompted a bike boom and cities around the world responded to increased demand for space to ride with street reallocations. Evaluating these interventions has been limited by a lack of spatially-temporally continuous ridership data. Our paper aims to address this gap using crowdsourced data on bicycle ridership. We evaluate changes in spatial patterns of bicycling during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (Apr – Oct 2020) in Vancouver, Canada using Strava data and a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation. We map statistically significant change in ridership and reference clusters of change to a high-resolution base map. Amongst streets where bicycling increased, we measured the proportion of increase occurring on pre-existing bicycle facilities or street reallocations compared to streets without. In all our analyses, we evaluate patterns across subsets of Strava data representing recreation, commuting, and ridership generated by women and older adults (55 + ). We found consistent and unique patterns by trip purpose and demographics: samples generated by women and older adults showed increases near green and blue spaces and on street reallocations that increased access to parks, and these patterns were also mirrored in the recreation sample. Commute ridership highlighted distinct patterns of increase around the hospital district. Across all subsets most increases occurred on bicycle facilities (pre-existing or provisional), with a strong preference for high-comfort facilities. We demonstrate that changes in spatial patterns of bicycle ridership can be monitored using Strava data, and that nuanced patterns can be identified using trip and demographic labels in the data.",2590-1982,Not found
The relationship between car shedding and subjective well-being,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100663,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The sufficiency strategy for sustainable development aims to reduce energy and resource consumption beyond technological modifications. One way to do this is to forgo ownership of certain consumer goods, such as cars. Although proponents of sufficiency claim that car shedding (i.e., giving away a vehicle so that the household no longer has its own car) might increase subjective well-being (SWB), there is little empirical evidence supporting this. This paper aims to help fill this gap by adding empirical evidence on the relationship between car shedding and SWB. Data from the Swiss Household Panel is used (2006–2017) with a fixed-effects model assessing the year-to-year changes in evaluative and affective well-being (life satisfaction, leisure satisfaction, joy, and anger) before and after car shedding. Separate analyses for non-affordability-driven and affordability-driven car shedders were conducted. Results show that non-affordability-driven car shedding has a positive effect on feelings of joy one to three years after the event. Affordability-driven car shedding, in contrast, is associated with a decrease in leisure satisfaction and feelings of joy up to three years later. Levels of positive affective wellbeing already decrease in anticipation of affordability-driven car shedding. A sufficiency measure like non-affordability-driven car shedding is not associated with reducing SWB, and this may have policy implications.",2590-1982,Not found
Effect of vehicle properties and driving environment on fuel consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of timber trucking based on data from fleet management system,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100671,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This study evaluated fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for 13 typical log trucks in operating conditions in Finland. The effects of season, transportation distance, mass, vehicle and road properties, and weather conditions on fuel consumption for driving were analyzed and modeled. The average fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the 76-t trucks when driving with a load was 0.013 l(t·km)−1 and 30.856 g(t·km)−1 respectively. The consumptions and emissions for the 68- and 76-tonners were found to be at the same level per tonne kilometer due to the overload of the former. The highest consumptions were measured in January (on average 57.5 l(100 km)−1), and the lowest in July (on average 48.7 l(100 km)−1). Machine learning was applied to predict fuel consumption with the above-mentioned factors for 73,686 road segments. Based on the developed models, driving speed was the most influential explanatory variable, in addition to road gradient, pavement, and sinuosity. Engine power and truck mass had minor importance. Wind effect was the only significant weather variable. The “big data” approach, as used in this study, enables the collection of a vast amount of data on very varying conditions in log transportation. However, higher resolution data than the fleet management system data used in this study will be needed to construct more accurate models.",2590-1982,Not found

We employed an exploratory mixed-methods approach, including a post-training questionnaire and extensive discussions with police officers, journalists, and legal scholars, to understand officers’ likelihood to implement our advice and the barriers they anticipated in doing so. Officers raised concerns about the difficulty of implementing some of the suggestions (e.g., report crash statistics or describe safe systems), pointing to time constraints for the relevant staff. Others disagreed with some of the guidance, principally because they wanted to stick to “just the facts” and avoid legal trouble. Based on this rich data, we carefully refined our guidance in the form of a two-page handout and press release template.",2590-1982,Not found
Workstyle change effects on physical activity and health consciousness in Japan: Results from COVID-19 lifestyle activity survey,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100657,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The importance of daily trips as the daily general physical activity (PA) generator has been attracting more attention than ever. Workers had been obtaining certain amount of PA by commuting; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought a rapid spread of teleworking, which may lead to a loss of PA. To analyze the effect of workstyle change on the PA amounts, we assessed diary data from three time points in Japan: Before, During, and After the first lockdown in April 2020. Participants (n = 4,484) were divided according to workstyle change patterns. Their PA amounts were calculated by associating metabolic equivalent (MET) values with their diary data. Purposes of the trips were considered to distinguish the pure workstyle change effect and the lockdown effect. Workers’ health consciousness was also examined from a questionnaire survey. Results revealed that telework drastically reduces PA associated with daily trips for any transport mode. Teleworkers tend to make more non-commuting trips than commuters, but the PA amount associated with total daily trips is higher for commuters. Young workers who newly started teleworking during the pandemic significantly reduced PA. Women teleworkers tend to have less PA amount than men during the lockdown. Workers who had been teleworking since before the COVID-19 pandemic had the lowest consciousness about the health effects of daily trip reduction. Continuous and courteous support aimed at maintaining a certain amount of PA with daily trips and exercise habits might be a key measure to safeguard worker health, especially for the young teleworkers in a long-term.",2590-1982,Not found
Comparing COVID-19 in the antipodes: Insights from pandemic containment strategies on both sides of the Pacific,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100660,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"That the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in terms of its scale, spread and shocks can be evinced by the myriad of ever-changing responses cities all around the world have rolled out throughout the different waves of outbreaks. Although the threat is similar across the world, it took some time before its reach became global and the waves of outbreak are experienced by cities at different times. While this staggered spread imply that some cities might manage the virus better as they learn from the experiences of cities which had been amongst the earliest to face the virus, the reality is more complicated. In the early stages of the pandemic, the global consensus on the best way to contain the virus swiftly converged in the interlinked strategies of restricting the movement of people and minimizing their social contact. However, the effectiveness of these strategies differ greatly between cities. To that end, this study focuses on COVID-19 responses in two regions (Latin America and Southeast Asia) and examines the evolution of the first wave of COVID-19 outbreaks during 2020 in Singapore, Jakarta (Indonesia), Bogotá (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile). The study is based on a comparative approach and uses a variety of data sources, namely morphology, density, housing concentration, mobility, and governance in the four analyzed cities. The goal is to shed light on the response of city governments in these two different regions in terms of mobility restrictions in order to reduce the cases of new infections. The results show the relevance of urban policies and their territorial approaches, particularly in terms of mobility and public transport networks in the four cities.",2590-1982,Not found

As Dhaka has been marked as a hotspot for the virus contagion, this paper has focused on the changes in mode choice behavior of Dhaka people due to the COVID-19 pandemic while they are on the road. A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted to capture the information on mode preferences and perspectives on travel characteristics for commute and discretionary trips before and during COVID-19. Multinomial Logit (MNL) model based on a utility function has been used to investigate the significance of the socio-demographic attributes and travel characteristics of the trips on the mode choice behavior and to calculate the maximum utility of the mode choice. This study highlighted some noticeable changes in perspective towards mode choice. People prefer walking, private cars, and rickshaw more during the pandemic as they feel these modes are more reliable, available, and cost-effective in this crucial time. Usage of public transportation dropped drastically for discretionary purposes. Additionally, usage of the on-demand vehicle increased during the pandemic as a large portion of commuters shifted to on-demand vehicles from public transportation. Furthermore, this paper suggested some viable policy-making implications to cope with the current pandemic and relatable future national and global crises. Finally, the paper concludes by suggesting some future research insights.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring the potential demand for Jakarta–Bandung high-speed rail,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100658,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This paper investigates two fundamental questions related to the new development of high-speed rail (HSR) infrastructure in Indonesia: (1) What are the variables that affect intercity traveler preference between private cars via toll roads, intercity trains, and HSR? and (2) what are the determinants of psychological intentions for intercity travelers regarding HSR? On the basis of a survey of 412 Bandung–Jakarta travelers, the mixed logit model and a modification of the theory of planned behavior were deployed to analyze the extent to which the mode choice of travelers was affected by various factors, including trip characteristics, sociodemographic, and travelers’ perceptions on HSR. The analyses reveal that existing car users tend to keep using their cars via toll roads. The demand for HSR comes from existing intercity train users with high-income levels, whereas train users with lower income levels prefer to continue using intercity trains. With regard to other sociodemographic effects, females and travelers younger than 50 years old would be more likely to switch to HSR. Travelers with business trips are also more likely to use HSR. Furthermore, the study found that the use intention of HSR is more influenced by subjective norms, perceived moral obligation, and perceived behavioral controls rather than attitude variables such as comfort and reliability. Several policy recommendations are outlined from the findings to achieve the sustainability of HSR in the future.",2590-1982,Not found
The impact of adding the Northern sea route to the Belt and Road Initiative for Europe: A chain cost approach,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100659,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"In this paper, the possibility of adding the North Sea Route (NSR) route to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is researched whereby the main aim is to determine if it is possible to set up a container service via the NSR route that could attract cargo from the existing maritime routes via Suez and the land route. In order to make the analysis, a model which is able to calculate the total generalised chain cost for a supply chain is used and updated. This analysis shows that it is possible to set up such a competitive service compared to the land bridge and the Suez Canal Route (SCR) for cargo that has a high value of time. For these specific cargo types, it is possible to attract cargo for the NSR from the SCR at equal costs, but with an average time saving of 10%. Comparing the BRI or land bridge to the SCR, there is a cost increase of 20% and a time decrease of almost 65%. Considering the rather strict limitation in capacity, it should be noted that a single NSR service of eight 5,400 TEU vessels already offers around half the capacity of the land bridge. The uncertainty in arrival times, however, would remain an issue in the NSR service, but with ice diminishing, this risk will decrease as well.",2590-1982,Not found
"Modeling the competing demands of carriers, building managers, and urban planners to identify balanced solutions for allocating building and parking resources",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100656,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"While the number of deliveries has been increasing rapidly, infrastructure such as parking and building configurations has changed less quickly, given limited space and funds. This may lead to an imbalance between supply and demand, preventing the current resources from meeting the future needs of urban freight activities. The aim of this study was to discover the future delivery rates that would overflow the current delivery systems and find the optimal numbers of resources. To achieve this objective, we introduced a multi-objective, simulation-based optimization model to define the complex freight delivery cost relationships among delivery workers, building managers, and city planners, based on the real-world observations of the final 50 ft of urban freight activities at an office building in downtown Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. Our discrete-event simulation model with increasing delivery arrival rates showed an inverse relationship in costs between delivery workers and building managers, while the cost of city planners decreased up to ten deliveries/h and then increased until 18 deliveries/h, at which point costs increased for all three parties and overflew the current building and parking resources. The optimal numbers of resources that would minimize the costs for all three parties were then explored by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-2) and a multi-objective, evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Our study sheds new light on a data-driven approach for determining the best combination of resources that would help the three entities work as a team to better prepare for the future demand for urban goods deliveries.",2590-1982,Not found

The readership interested in policies and mitigation strategies is expected to involve a wide range of actors, each involving a particular application context; hence, the literature is also characterized by key attributes such as: transportation mode; actor (users, operators, government, industry); jurisdiction (national, provincial, city, neighborhood); and area of application (planning, regulation, operations, research, incentives). An in-depth analysis of the surveyed literature is then reported, focusing first on condensing the literature into 151 distinct policies and strategies, which are subsequently categorized into 25 broad categories that are discussed at length. The compendium and discussion of strategies and policies reported not only provide comprehensive guidelines to inform various courses of action for decision-makers, planners, and social communicators, but also emphasize on future work and the potential of some of these strategies to be the precursors of meaningful, more sustainable behavioral changes in future mobility patterns.",2590-1982,Not found

We performed interviews with the households before and after the BEV trial period. We can thus compare the change in measured driving patterns and the users’ experienced adaptation in relation to their measured driving adaptation. We find large heterogeneity in measured adaptation, with some users driving the BEV more than the replaced car and some less. Most users state a preference for using the BEV, but this is not always detectable in the GPS data.

The main data used in this project is street data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and cycling infrastructure data from the Atelier parisien d’urbanisme (Apur). The proposed method can be applied with commonly available data, has clear outcomes, is reproducible, and can be applied to different case study areas. We produced a map of bicycle suitability across all of Paris, and validated it for the 30 longest segments in the city with lower bike suitability. Our validation showed that combining OSM and Apur data led to a reliable dataset, with which we modelled bikeability using the underlying network overlain on a 250 m resolution grid and destinations representing leisure activities, education, shopping, city functions and public transport.

Crash-level factors include socio-demographics of VRUs and freight vehicle drivers, driving behaviors, temporal and weather effects, and environmental factors. The results indicate that freight-related VRU crashes, compared to nonfreight-related VRU crashes, are more likely to occur at private properties and parking areas and have a higher probability of causing severe injuries or deaths. The results also show that the involvement of larger vehicles and the occurrence at midblock segments are positively associated with more severe injury outcomes.

The feature of our dataset is that it contains information on daily mobility for those traveling by vehicle along with their travel purposes. We provide several new findings. First, the impact of the pandemic on daily mobility was limited in Tajikistan, in contrast with the evidence from other countries. The pandemic discouraged motorized travel for family-related purposes in all income groups while keeping other vehicle travel intact for reasons such as work and shopping under the country’s lenient travel restrictions. Second, the effects of concerns about the pandemic were not uniform across all vehicle travel when different purposes are taken into account. People who were very concerned about the pandemic were more likely to refrain from motorized travel for family-related purposes. Third, refraining from travel for family purposes exacerbated food insecurity, implying that the safety net provided by family members and relatives was hampered by the limited ability to travel during the pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found
Equity and exclusion issues in cashless fare payment systems for public transportation,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100628,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Many transit agencies in the United States plan to automate their fare collection and limit–or even eliminate–the use of cash fares, with the goals of expediting boarding, collecting data, and lowering costs. Yet about 10% of US adults lack a bank account or credit card, and many rely on restrictive cellphone data plans or do not have access to the internet or a smartphone. These riders will find it difficult to access transit in the future. This paper examines transit users’ experiences with fare technologies using a survey of riders in three cities. Our analysis reveals which riders are most at risk of being excluded, and how mitigation strategies could work to overcome barriers to cash-less transit. We find that a significant number of riders (∼30%) currently use cash on-board buses. If on-board cash fares were to be removed, a significant share of these riders appear able to switch to other options, though many imagine they will continue to use cash in some way (e.g. at retail or ticket vending machines); a small number claim they would no longer be able to ride transit if on-board cash fares were removed. Older and lower-income riders are more at risk of exclusion as they often lack access to smartphones or the internet. A significant number rely on less dependable internet sources, such as public Wi-Fi, potentially inhibiting some from using smartphone and internet-based payment systems. Findings suggest approaches to reduce the number of riders excluded from transit during fare technology adoption.",2590-1982,Not found

Methods Fixed a grid of days from February 27, 2020, the cumulative numbers of infections in each considered province have been compared to sequences of thresholds. As a consequence, a time-evolving classification of the state of danger in terms of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, in view of the smallest threshold overtaken by this comparison, has been obtained for each considered province. The provinces with a significant amount of cases have then been collected into matrices containing only the ones featuring a significant amount of cases. Results The time evolution of the classification has then been qualitatively compared to the highway network, to identify similarities and thus linking the rapid spreading of COVID-19 and the highway connections.

External human–machine interfaces: Gimmick or necessity?,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100643,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The last few years have seen a wealth of research on external human–machine interfaces (eHMIs). It has been argued that eHMIs are vital because they fill the social interaction void that arises with the introduction of automated vehicles (AVs). However, there is still much discussion about whether eHMIs are needed. The present article surveys arguments for and against eHMIs. We list three arguments against eHMIs: (1) Implicit communication dominates pedestrian-AV interaction, and there is no social interaction void to be filled, (2) There is a large variety of eHMI concepts and a lack of standardization and consensus, and (3) eHMIs may elicit various negative effects such as distraction, confusion, and overreliance. Next, we present five reasons why eHMIs may be useful or required: (1) eHMIs can make planned actions of the AV visible, thereby increasing the efficiency of pedestrian-AV interaction, (2) Participants value an eHMI compared to no eHMI, (3) eHMIs do not have to be limited to showing instructions or the AV’s planned actions; showing the AV mode or the AV’s cooperative or detection capabilities are other uses of eHMIs, (4) Recent research shows that driver eye contact is important in traffic, and a social interaction void thus exists, and (5) A large portion of pedestrian-vehicle accidents in current traffic is caused by unclear implicit communication, suggesting that pedestrians may benefit from explicit eHMIs.

The campus of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) was used as a case study site, and pivoted stated choice experiments were developed as part of a real-life experiment where several autonomous buses were operated at the DTU campus. In the experiment, choice tasks were directed to users that specifically used the shuttle service. Our findings indicate that while AV shuttles did indeed attract some existing public transport users, almost no effect on the overall mode shares was observed. This even holds for scenarios where speed and frequency of the buses were improved considerably compared to those of the experimental setup. The paper thereby underlines that while new autonomous driving technologies have the potential to improve first and last mile services for public transport, they will have a limited effect on the overall choice of mode for the entire trip chain in their current form.",2590-1982,Not found

Evaluating the substitutability of short-haul air transport by high-speed rail using a simulation-based approach,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100632,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Air transportation is reported to have the highest CO2 emission per passenger kilometer compared to other modes of travel. Although prior studies have analyzed the impact of high-speed rail (HSR) on the aviation sector, this study is one of the first to develop a simulation model to evaluate the current HSR system, and determine the extent to which the existing rail network can handle additional passengers, if short-haul airline customers were to avail of HSR service. This study also proposes recommendations for future HSR schedules and rail capacities, as well. A Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify (DMADV) approach is developed for (a) conceptualizing the problem, (b) collecting data from different sources, (c) developing the simulation model, and (d) evaluating the results and deriving managerial recommendations. For the purpose of illustrating the proposed approach, we discuss a case study considering the passenger travel between two major European cities, Munich and Paris. It can be observed that the current railway operations between Munich and Paris could only handle 25% additional customers. If 50%, 75% and 100% of current air customers were to switch to HSR, then it is recommended to operate one (evening), two (one afternoon and one evening), and three (two afternoon and one evening) additional trains, respectively. Furthermore, this study shows that a complete customer transition from air to rail could save 56.8% in CO2 emission.",2590-1982,Not found

However, persons with blindness, deafblindness, and deafness, who usually receive information and guidance from the driver, could miss information when travelling in an autonomous car. In this case study, 15 people with hearing and vision impairments explore and compare trips with and without vibrotactile guidance (using Ready-Ride or Ready-Move) in a simulated autonomous vehicle in real traffic (using a Wizard-of-Oz method). The study investigated if vibrotactile aid could enable persons with blindness, deafblindness, and deafness to use autonomous vehicles. Different phases of a trip (before, during, and after) were analysed. The study shows that people with functional impairments such as blindness, deafblindness, and deafness can perform trips independently if given information adapted to their needs through auditory, tactile, or visual information channels. It would be difficult for the target groups to travel without any additional communication aid, such as a vibrotactile guidance aid for all phases of the trip, especially for those with blindness. In all rides with the simulated autonomous car (Wizard-of-Oz set up) without vibrotactile guidance, the driver or assistant (in at least one phase of the trip) had to intervene for the research participants with blindness to complete the trip and continue the study. The study also highlights the usability of the vibrotactile guidance aid and identifies areas in need of improvement.",2590-1982,Not found
The effects of ridesourcing services on vehicle ownership in large Indian cities,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100631,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The role of ridesourcing services on vehicle ownership is an important research area, especially in the context of the environmental implications and long term sustainability of these services. However, evidence from literature so far is mixed, with studies reporting both an increase and reduction in ownership, sometimes in the same country. This research adds to the current knowledge by econometrically estimating the impacts of ridesourcing services on vehicle ownership in a large emerging economy, India. Using a cross-sectional timeseries data on vehicle registrations in 18 large cities in India over 17 years, we find a statistically significant reduction in vehicle ownership (compared to baseline) since the introduction of these services. The growth in vehicle ownership has reduced by around 7.7% in the cities together since the introduction of ridesourcing services and this impact appears to grow over time; but the overall ownership is still increasing.",2590-1982,Not found
An examination of the potential impact of 5G on air travel in the U.S.,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100627,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The rollout of 5G wireless service has been much anticipated by consumers across the U.S. since it will bring faster data download speeds and expanded service; however, the impact to aviation and air travel are as a major issue and the potential impact to aviation has not been estimated or assessed. This paper fills that gap and provides the first analysis of the potential number of flights impacted by 5G at ten of the busiest airports in the U.S. Using detailed historical weather and flight data in 2019 at 10 large hub airports, we find that nearly 15,700 flight arrivals could be directly impacted annually, at the ten airports considered. The geographical and seasonal impact varies significantly with more flights affected by the potential for 5G interference at airports in Seattle and Dallas Fort-Worth and relatively few flights affected at airports in Phoenix and Las Vegas. A case study examining ten years of data at Chicago O’Hare International, a hub for two major airlines, suggests that over 2,400 flights every year could be impacted by 5G interference. Fortunately, there has been increasing cooperation between the cell phone industry and aviation stakeholders to ensure a safe rollout of 5G C-band; this paper provides a significant contribution by documenting the issues and context for aviation operations.",2590-1982,Not found
Disentangling social capital – Understanding the effect of bonding and bridging on urban activity participation,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100629,15,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Social capital is a critical glue for economic and social development in urban areas. Yet, to effectively guide research and practice, there is a need for careful measurement of social capital and how it links to important aspects of urban system functions. This study is aimed at examining the multi-dimensional nature of social capital and the relationship between these dimensions and travel behavior. Prior research has shown connections between stand-alone social capital concepts, such as resources gathered via social networks, with specific aspects of travel behavior. In this work, we expand the definition of social capital to cover separate dimensions, modeled via multiple indicators. Specifically, we make use of over 1400 observations from the Pew Internet Networks and Community Survey dataset to build a Structural Equation Model dividing social capital into two latent dimensions: bonding and bridging to examine the relationship of both these dimensions with discretionary urban activity participation diversity and frequency. Moreover, broader measures of neighborhood and community engagement are included in the model to explain how such engagement can help with the accumulation of social capital. Our results indicate a positive but differential relationship between both social capital dimensions and activity participation. Further, the results also suggest an absence of correlation between bonding and bridging capital, strengthening the hypothesis that social capital is multi-dimensional. In terms of explaining the social capital accrual, we find that while community engagement is positively correlated to bridging capital, no evidence was found for a relationship between community engagement and bonding capital. Further, neighborhood engagement was not found to be associated with any of the social capital dimensions. This suggests that individuals predominantly rely on close-knit and stronger relationships for social/emotional support, while instead, community engagement significantly helps in the accumulation of bridging capital. The result from the study can be used by policy makers to improve transportation planning, management, and community well-being.",2590-1982,Not found

This study builds on previous work by exploring COVID’s impact on older cyclists (65+) residing in a small, auto-centric urban area. A survey (n = 198) demonstrated that, on average, cycling frequency decreased and average distance/trip increased. This suggests a less pronounced impact among older adults residing in a small urban area. However, interviews (n = 24) showed that cycling during the pandemic was associated with feelings of accomplishment, enjoyment, improved self-esteem, and increased freedom by allowing them to get out despite social distancing requirements. Further, among respondents reporting increased cycling (n = 76), most (79 %) plan to maintain cycling habits post-pandemic, citing reasons such as personal health, enjoyment, and the social aspect of cycling. These findings could support efforts promoting cycling among older adults, pointing to aspects for designing voluntary travel behavior change (VTBC) programs.",2590-1982,Not found
Beyond fear and abandonment: Public transport resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100711,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic challenged urban public transport systems to maintain accessibility and service for daily users while adapting to local health and safety regulations. Developing sustainable and resilient urban policies under such crisis conditions requires understanding the different feelings, experiences and expectations of passengers and how these relate to socio-economic inequalities. Drawing on a mixed-method study in Berlin (Germany), Brussels (Belgium), Stockholm (Sweden) and Tallinn (Estonia), we show how the pandemic outbreak has changed both who uses public transport and how users experience their journeys. Challenging the narratives that portray public transport as a place of fear, we find that remaining passengers assess the risk of contagion lower than those who avoided it completely. We argue that promoting resilient public transport requires policies that address the needs of passengers relying on public transport services. Therefore, we question the current policies under the sustainable mobility paradigm for not taking sufficient account of the feelings, experiences and emotions and particularly of transport-dependent users.",2590-1982,Not found
Dynamic simulation on eye exposure of in-vehicle daylighting in urban environments of China,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100727,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Light has a profound non-visual impact on the human body. It affects people’s mood, alertness, endocrine and circadian rhythm. Most non-visual effects studies focus on built environment. Yet, the non-visual effects of in-vehicle lighting have rarely drawn scholarly attention. Theoretically, by changing the transmittance and reflectance of the windshield, or adjusting the luminaires in vehicles, the physiological and mental state of the driver and the passengers can be intervened. The paper carries out series of dynamic daylight simulations in multiple categories of urban environments in China, summarizes the eye exposure characteristics of in-vehicle daylighting, and proposes new suggestions regarding the lighting design in vehicles. The main results can be summarized as follows: (1) The M/P Ratio of the in-vehicle daylighting has an average of 1.12 for clear sky, while 1.07 for overcast sky. (2) The back seat passengers receives significant lower eye exposure compares with the driver and front seat passenger when looking ahead. However, if the back seat passengers look outside the side windshield, the eye exposure they receive is mostly higher than that the driver and front seat passenger receive. (3) The floor area ratio (FAR) of the urban environment has an impact on the eye exposure of in-vehicle daylighting. The higher the FAR, the lower the non-visual effects. (4) The in-vehicle daylighting eye exposure differs significantly throughout China.

Addressing forced labor in supply chains in California,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100735,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Transportation plays a key role in combating human trafficking and California is monumental in understanding this role. This paper presents one element of research undertaken for United States Department of Transportation for understanding the role of transportation in combating human trafficking in California through a survey of multi-disciplinary anti-trafficking practitioners followed by a semi-structured interview. This paper focuses on forced labor and supply chain management. It presents general knowledge on forced labor issues in California and globally, the intersection with transportation, efforts to combat forced labor in the supply chains, and experts’ suggestions on how to address forced labor. The study also supplements expert input with labor violation and transportation accessibility analysis. Experts state that in order the combat forced labor the underlying reason for forced labor, which is economic incentives, should be understood first for a shift to demand reduction. Experts urge for pricing studies, mapping and technology to understand the vulnerabilities, hot spots, legal operating price and detect anomalies in the supply chain. Second, experts suggest awareness and responsibility of all levels for achieving transparency in supply chains. Reexamination of California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and enforcement of other policies was also commonly suggested. Monitors, public private partnership and technology was recommended for ensuring sustainability of the efforts and capacity management.

Challenges of passenger and freight transportation in mega-city regions: A systematic literature review,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100730,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The mega-city region was projected as the future outcome of the urbanization process, which is commonly composed of single or multiple main cities and peripheral cities through highly developed transportation networks. Because passenger and freight systems commonly share a physical transport network, the effects of urban morphology changes act on both systems at the same time. Although passenger and freight transport in mega-city regions have been addressed in a growing number of journal publications, an overview of research focusing on both topics together is still lacking. Meanwhile, the potential crossed topics between both systems in mega-city regions were limited in the discussion. This situation may hinder local authorities in the formulation of an appropriate transportation agenda for the promotion of collaboration among the transport system between different cities in mega-city regions, even further aggravate the problem of land-use conflict between city and transport, the unreasonably distributed transport infrastructure, and the excessive allocation of transportation resources, etc. Therefore, it's essential to understand the state-of-the-art in the field of passenger and freight transport in the mega-city regions, and to further analyze the potential crossed topics between the two topics. To this end, this paper adopts a systematic literature review method, covering 468 papers and research works published from 2016 to 2021. The cross-relevance analysis shows that, thus far, only seven crossed topics have covered passenger and freight transport simultaneously, while five potential topics can be further studied.

Examining the ride-hailing adoption behaviors among older adults in an Indonesian city: The case of Yogyakarta,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100729,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"A substantial amount of research has been conducted to understand the ride-hailing (RH) adoption behaviors, but only limited efforts have been invested in exploring how older adults ride and request an RH service, especially in developing countries. In overcoming this constraint, this study applied a nested logit model to examine the RH adoption behaviors in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, categorizing them into five groups: self-request riders, riders requested by others, current non-riders, RH app-less non-riders, and RH app-installed non-riders. The influence factors of RH adoption among older adults are also investigated. By involving 289 older adults aged 50 years and above, the study found that women and older adults aged between 50 and 54 years were likely to be self-request riders. Meanwhile, low-income RH riders tend to ask others to request RH. Additionally, older adults living in households that own more cars and motorbikes were less likely to be self-request riders. Concerning technology response, the study found that smartphone ownership affects RH riders to self-request, while RH app-installed non-riders come from older adults who have used smartphones for a long time. Riders with good health conditions continue to use RH services to support their mobility needs. Limited abilities related to technology, senses, and physique experienced by older adults also significantly impact the adoption behaviors of RH services. The findings provide a starting point for increasing the availability of RH services to substantially older adults, especially those who have barriers to using technology.",2590-1982,Not found
Data-driven risk analysis of unmanned aircraft system operations considering spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100732,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"One of the challenges of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations is to operate an unmanned aircraft with minimal risk to people on the ground. The purpose of this study is to define and measure such risks as population risk, by incorporating spatiotemporal changes in population density. Unlike previous studies, we use high-resolution de facto population data instead of residential population data to reflect the spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of mitigation measures based on population risk in the context of airspace management. We set a restricted airspace by using population risk and an acceptable level of safety. Scenario analysis of the study area in Seoul, South Korea provides a richer set of findings regarding spatiotemporal differences in restricted airspace. During the daytime, there are many restricted airspaces around commercial areas, but few around residential areas. Additionally, we observe the difference between restricting airspace based on population risk derived from the residential population and from the de facto population. These findings confirm the importance of accurately considering population density when assessing and mitigating the population risk associated with UAS operations. Sensitivity analysis also reveals the need to precisely estimate population density when estimating population risk with combinations of multiple parameter values. The proposed approach captures spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution when assessing the population risk associated with UAS.",2590-1982,Not found

To bridge this gap, this paper tries to quantify the proportion of the population, both in Europe and the USA that could benefit from drone-delivery services. Results indicate that under the conditions considered drone delivery services could be financially viable in the Europe and in the USA, where they could serve between 16 and 43% and between 32 and 60% of the population respectively.

Results from this study in the form of marginal effects show that urban morphology and demographics have a substantial influence on travel behaviour. However, lifestyles, attitudes and ideologies have significant influence as well. Travel distance is foremost influenced by attitude to travel distance and occupation. Travel mode is foremost influenced by distance to public transport facility and gender. Urban morphology, a designer lifestyle and ideological concerns regarding ecology matter as well. Thus, sustainable travel behaviours can be promoted by spatial planning.

Built environment bikeability as a predictor of cycling frequency: Lessons from Barcelona,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100725,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Background Many cities are putting cycling at the centre of their sustainable transportation policies after the COVID pandemic. Cycling is seen as a desirable mode of transport in dense and compact areas and needs to be promoted accordingly. However, to date, only a handful of different bikeability indexes exist attempting to map biking conditions and the built environment’s potential to promote biking as a modal choice on a city scale. Methods In this article, we use objective GIS data to map bikeability potential in the city of Barcelona. To do so we extracted the main bikeability components from an adhoc cycling survey and then create an index using ten spatial indicators. This bikeability index is mapped at a 100 × 100 m scale in the city of Barcelona. We then use actual travel behavior data extracted from a local representative travel survey to test the reliability of the index in predicting daily bike use. Results Results confirm the validity of the bikeability index as a predictor of the frequency of cycling. People living in areas with higher levels of built environment features associated with bikeability such as dedicated infrastructure, low accident rates and small slopes are more likely to use the bike more often. Conclusions Results validate our approach providing new methods to be used in further biking studies and a useful tool for policy and decision making.

The core point we want to make is that attitude changes are not included in aggregate models, which leads to an underestimation of the impacts (often: benefits) of unconventional transport policy options.",2590-1982,Not found
Ridesourcing mode choice: A latent class choice model for UberX in Chile,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100722,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"As shared mobility expands, ridesourcing has become its most popular manifestation. However, users’ mode choice has not yet been sufficiently explored. Thus, this study aims to model ridesourcing mode choice across different latent classes to ascertain who chose ridesourcing and why. We conducted a mode choice study by collecting revealed preference surveys from UberX users in Viña del Mar, Chile, in 2017. We then determined the existence of two latent classes and modeled the mode choice using a latent class choice model. Ultimately, we characterized individuals belonging to each latent class and calculated the subjective value of time (SVT). Most UberX users were highly educated and aged 20–35 years. Further, UberX gained users principally from public transport (80%). Likewise, the two latent classes differed by socioeconomic characteristics and SVTs. A latent class grouped the highest-educated and highest-earning users, who also offered the highest SVT. In summary, two latent classes, differentiated by educational level and income, formed the ridesourcing market. Besides, they offered distinct ridesourcing choice behavior based on the widely dissimilar SVTs. There was also a strong substitution effect between ridesourcing and transit use. The results imply that policymakers and transportation planners could have increased the competitiveness of the public transit system by improving rapidity and safety, having room to increase the fares to defray the improvements. Further, they could have used information related to the latent classes to customize relevant policies and marketing strategies (routes, frequency, fares, etc.) for every latent class.",2590-1982,Not found
Perception of safety culture in the Nepalese aviation industry: A factor analysis approach,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100723,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper uses industry-wide survey data to assess employees’ perception of safety culture in the Nepalese aviation industry. A factor analysis with Principal Component Analysis extraction and varimax rotation is employed to extract factors from the data set of thirty-three variables. The initial factor solution identifies “Positive safety practices”, “Management and decision making”, “Safety management systems”, and “Implementation of policies and procedures” as the factors influencing the perception of safety in an organization. Likewise, respondents considered “Implementation of safety policies and procedures” as the most important factor among others to ensure safety in the aviation industry. An interesting finding from this study is that the Senior-level management believes that the management practices employed in their organization are proactive enough to allocate resources, to ensure operational safety, address high-risk scenarios, and promote blame-free reporting of safety-related incidents which is challenged by the respondents working in Mid-level management. Another significant revelation is that the more experienced employees perceive that the “Safety management systems” employed in their organization are not effective and there is a significant room for improvement in the safety reporting and safety management practices in their organization. Based on the findings, it is concluded that the service providers could do better in improving individual’s safety practices, facilitating safety reporting, and managing safety.",2590-1982,Not found

The target area of this study is Gunma prefecture, a regional area in Japan. The planning horizon is set to 2040, where the effects of population decrease are reflected in the scenario settings. Policy scenario analysis that assumes complete substitution of human-driven vehicles with AVs suggests increases between 22.1% and 43.6% in total distances traveled, with a corresponding increase in increased CO2 emissions between 23.6% and 46.0%. While this suggests a worsening network level of service, around 2 to 3 min gains in median activity-based accessibility were also observed, suggesting overall positive effects from AV adoption in the study region.",2590-1982,Not found
An analytical model for a tandem of two traffic-light intersections under semi-actuated and fixed control,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100715,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"With increasing congestion in urban areas, it is important to characterise existing traffic control policies in terms of their performance and their optimal settings. In this paper, we propose a queueing model for traffic-light networks under fixed and semi-actuated control. In our model, we explicitly consider slow-departing vehicles in the beginning of a green period and the offsets between intersections. Our approach proves to be both accurate and fast compared to traffic microsimulation, allowing us to optimise the traffic-light settings and offsets. By analysing our model for two intersections in tandem, we show the important differences between semi-actuated and fixed controls. We observe that semi-actuated control is better for the average delay in comparison to fixed control when the main road has the same or a higher load than the crossing roads. If the loads are similar, the results of both types of control are close, and it may be advisable to use fixed control to avoid additional costs. The optimal traffic-light settings are shown to heavily depend on the type of control. For example, the effect of offsets in case of semi-actuated control is minor when the loads are relatively low, while the performance of fixed control may significantly vary depending on the offset between the intersections for any load.",2590-1982,Not found
Adapting the behavioral regulation in active commuting to and from school questionnaire in Sweden: BR-ACS(SWE),10.1016/j.trip.2022.100721,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Although growing attention has been paid to motivation in explaining active travel to school among young people at the international level, no measures of motivation for active commuting to school (ACS) were found in Sweden. Guided by self-determination theory, this research aimed to adapt the Behavioral Regulation in Active Commuting to and from School (BR-ACS) questionnaire to the Swedish context and test the resulting version’s psychometric properties. The purposive and cross-sectional sample included 273 students (58 % girls, aged 10–12 years) from four Swedish urban schools. Results from confirmatory factor analyses psychometrically supported the six-factor correlated model (intrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, external regulation, and amotivation) and the hierarchical three-factor model (autonomous, controlled motivation, and amotivation), which were invariant across gender. Latent correlations underpinned a symplex-like pattern. Discriminant and convergent validity and reliability were gathered. Criterion validity evidence was met with positive associations from intrinsic motivation, integrated and identified regulation to ACS, and a negative relationship between amotivation and ACS. The Swedish version of the BR-ACS questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure of children’s motivation toward ACS.",2590-1982,Not found
Improving children's on-road cycling with immersive video-based training: A pilot study,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100699,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Cyclists are frequent casualties in road traffic collisions, and cyclist inattention is often implicated. Children are more distractible than adults and so are arguably more vulnerable road users, including when cycling. Research shows that misallocation of attention or distraction is a common factor in crashes involving cyclists, and child cyclists are more likely to be seriously injured, possibly because their hazard perception is inferior to that of adults. Video-based training paradigms designed to improve children’s hazard perception and situation awareness have yielded mixed findings, but none have examined positive transfer of such training interventions to on-road cycling performance. The aim of this study was to use an immersive video-based training protocol to improve attention allocation, situation awareness and on-road cycling performance in children who had completed UK cycle training aimed at 9–11-year-olds. Thirty-three children aged 10–12 years were randomly allocated to either an Intervention group or a Control group. All participants reported their cycling behaviour and cycling self-efficacy, and completed online situation awareness tests at baseline, post-test, and retention stages. Between baseline and post-test, the intervention group (n = 17) completed a lab-based training protocol in which they viewed real-world cyclist point-of-view footage on an immersive screen while pedalling on a stationary cycle. As they navigated five virtual routes their task was to demonstrate awareness of potential hazards and other information pertinent to their safety, with decreasing levels of support from the researcher as they progressed. The control group did not receive the training intervention. All participants’ cycling performance was individually assessed on urban roads on two testing occasions, by qualified cycle instructors. The intervention group outperformed the control group in terms of their on-road performance, in terms of Making good and frequent observations (Observation; F[1,31]) = 16.53, η p 2 = 0.35, p = 0.0003,); Communicating intentions clearly to others (Communication; F[1,31]) = 13.70, η p 2 = 0.31, p = 0.001); Choosing and maintaining the most suitable riding positions (Position; F[1,31]) = 7.41, η p 2 = 0.19, p = 0.01); and Understanding priorities on the road, particularly at junctions (Priorities; F[1,31]) = 6.88, η p 2 = 0.18, p = 0.01), although this was not accompanied by significant changes in their cycling self-efficacy and situation awareness, all p’s > 0.05. The present findings suggest that an immersive video-based protocol such as the one herein may improve children’s safety when cycling on roads and may therefore be an effective complement to current cycle training protocols. Given ongoing governmental investment in cycling infrastructure in the UK, with a concomitant increase in micromobility modes of active travel, national policy will need to consider the additional perceptual-cognitive demands that will face young cyclists; immersive training is a potentially efficient and cost-effective way to mitigate these demands. However, further research attention should be devoted to the development of effective situation awareness tests – preferably ones that correlate with, if not predict, children’s independent on-road cycling performance.",2590-1982,Not found
City-oriented and inclusive bicycle-vehicle crash frequency modeling through the integration of bicycle-sharing system and other surrogates,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100714,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This research explores a city-oriented and inclusive bicycle-vehicle crash frequency model through the integration of bicycle-sharing system and other surrogates pertaining to the built environment like road network, land use developments, and socio-demographic characteristics. Bicycle-vehicle crash data from 2016 to 2019, along with the road network, land use, and socio-demographic characteristics within a 1-mile radius of 62 randomly selected Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) stations (referred to as stations), was used to estimate and validate bicycle-vehicle crash frequency models (negative binomial regression models with log-link distribution) and assess the role of explanatory variables. The selected stations are geographically and fairly distributed in low-risk, moderate-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk areas while covering 99.8% of the total number of recorded bicycle-vehicle crashes. From such an inclusive approach, it was observed that bicyclists are more likely to be involved in crashes in commercial, mixed-use, and densely populated areas. In addition, they are more often involved in crashes in areas with more six-lane roads. Also, many bicycle-vehicle crashes have occurred at intersections. The nonexistence of bicycle crossings could explain this finding. The findings are substantial, and characteristics related to the built environment like road network (including vehicle and bicycle infrastructure), land use developments, and socio-demographics are good surrogates for traffic volume and bicycle count.",2590-1982,Not found
Living in a Silver Zone: Residents’ perceptions of area-wide traffic calming measures in Singapore,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100710,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Traffic calming has been introduced in many cities in a bid to create more age-friendly and sustainable communities. This study uses Q methodology to understand the perspectives and experiences of residents after almost a decade since the first implementation of traffic calming measures in neighbourhoods in Singapore. In particular, we focused on the Silver Zone programme, which involves the introduction of senior-friendly road safety features in areas with a high proportion of senior residents and where there have been past road traffic injury involving seniors. With 26 participants, we identified three perspectives and termed them the Road Safety Enthusiast, Inconvenienced Users, and Implementation Critics. While their perspectives of the traffic calming measures were different, we found that all three groups broadly supported the objectives of Silver Zones. The participants were able to identify that the benefits of traffic calming go beyond protecting vulnerable populations to enhancing the liveability and overall traffic safety of their neighbourhood and community. However, the benefits and inconveniences of these measures were felt differently across these groups, which are areas for planners and policymakers to address to increase the support for traffic calming in neighbourhoods. The efficacy of Q methodology for mobility and planning related research is also supported and further discussed in the article.",2590-1982,Not found
The relation between transit service availability and productivity with customers satisfaction,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100716,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Limited access to public service and a lack of measurable quality of service attributes composes a challenge for providing acceptable service quality. This research addresses the question: does the transit service performance (spatial and temporal coverage) influences customer satisfaction? Available data from the relevant sources were collected, and field surveys were conducted to collect data unavailable. Different tools and approaches include descriptive and inferential statistics and GIS-based spatial analysis, including Moran's I, the data envelopment analysis for the super efficiency analysis. The service coverage is relatively poor, with less than 60% of the transit-supportive area (TSA) served by transit. The spatial service assessment based on four attributes (the number and length of transit lines, line density, and % TSA served) showed a small value of Moran's I. Only transit density and the percent of the transit-supportive area served were statistically significant, showing a cluster in the city center. The primary road network correlates with the transit network density and % of TSA served. The results showed that poor service productivity varies by the season and the day of the week, and the system is more efficient in winter. The customers rated the service spatial and temporal coverage above the scale's mid-point, but less than the fare rating and their satisfaction differs by the service season. Customer satisfaction can be predicted based on fare, comfort, and safety for the inter-urban service and service fare, travel time, and convenience of intra-urban service.",2590-1982,Not found
Parcel self-collection for urban last-mile deliveries: A review and research agenda with a dual operations-consumer perspective,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100719,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Self-collection concepts, such as collection and delivery points and parcel lockers, have been commonly deployed. These concepts rely on consumers’ efforts to carry out Last-Mile Delivery (LMD) tasks and consequently relieve both operators’ financial and sustainability pressures. Since the success of these self-collection operations involves both the operators’ planning perspectives and consumers’ participation, it is essential to jointly consider both aspects. However, existing research has largely overlooked the required synergies between the underlying consumer research and operations management studies. This paper aims to provide a review of related literature and subsequently propose a dual-perspective framework that bridges the gap. Specifically, systematic reviews on LMD self-collection consumer research and operations management studies are first conducted. The review highlights the research-to-practice gap that exists in consumer research as well as the need for improved modelling of consumer behaviours in operational models. This study then argues that an integrated approach that encompasses both viewpoints is needed. It is an approach that proactively optimises consumer demands through operational decisions supported by the connection between consumer behaviours and operational characteristics. For successful implementations of the proposed approach, specific research topics and directions are explicitly discussed.",2590-1982,Not found
Ridership dynamics and characteristics of potential riders of a transit system: The SunRail of Central Florida,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100720,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Accessibility, livability, and public health in urban areas can be improved by promoting sustainable and eco-friendly modes of transport such as rail transit. The success and feasibility of a rail transit system, however, rely on maintaining sufficient ridership depending on several factors. This study focuses on two of these factors in examining the SunRail transit system: 1) the ridership dynamics in terms of passenger flows between transit stations, and 2) the socio-demographic characteristics of the population living around and travelling between these stations. The SunRail system is the flagship commuter rail line of Greater Orlando, Florida, encouraging denser and more walkable development and promoting a less car-dependent multimodal transportation system. For this purpose, we utilized an instantaneous-balance Bayesian model estimating the origin–destination passenger flows and conducted a comprehensive assessment of the characteristics of residents living within each SunRail station area. The analyses help provide a more detailed understanding of the travel dynamics of SunRail riders as well as who lives and works in all 12 SunRail station areas. Consequently, the findings and insights obtained from the analyses aim to serve urban and transport planners in devising strategies to influence ridership based on the passenger flows and unique characteristics of the station areas.",2590-1982,Not found
Understanding the road rage behavior and implications: A textual approach using legal cases in Korea,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100712,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This study aims at exploring the road rage behavior using extreme legal cases of Korea. This study uses a topic modeling algorithm with a text embedding technique to classify the road rage by characteristics (i.e., type, behavior, damage, punishment, and context). We collected 39 representative cases of the road rage from precedent data in Korea. We used nominalizing keywords and a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm of topic modeling among text mining techniques to analyze each case’s criminal facts and punishment. After preprocessing by indexing with a coherence score, we set the appropriate number of topics. Through the study, it was confirmed that the model has the highest explanatory power with five topics. We further analyze the five topics for occurrence and subsequent road rage, method of realizing road rage, psychological state of the offenders during road rage, method of collecting evidence of road rage, and type and extent of the damage. By categorizing the keywords, we derive the road rage cases by type. Through this study, precedents dealing with criminal cases of road rage were analyzed to derive the types and causes of retaliatory driving. This result is expected to be used as basic data for the enactment of road rage policies and laws in the future.",2590-1982,Not found
Locating underground utilities in the United States: A comparative analysis of services provided by private locators,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100707,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The ability to locate underground utilities is imperative for the protection of these facilities and for the coordination of these facilities with transportation projects. The proliferation of underground facilities in the United States has led to an increase in dig-in strikes resulting in loss of services, project delivery delays, injuries, and even deaths. In fact, the Federal Highway Administration found utility-related issues to be one of the top causes of delays for transportation projects. These delays are often attributed to unknown or inaccurate utility location information. This scenario has led to a vast industry of utility location service providers. Additionally, national and state damage prevention laws led to the creation of one-call systems for the purpose of providing a communication conduit between designers or constructors and utility owners and operators. The importance of accurate utility locates and the risk and liability of providing utility location services also led to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) standardizing the practice of Subsurface Utility Engineering (SUE) into a professional service. Even with this standard, there remains misinformation and misunderstandings regarding SUE and non-SUE services provided by private utility location firms. The differences between the services provided by SUE investigations and non-SUE private locating services that do not meet SUE standards has largely been anecdotal. This study serves as an advancement in understanding the distinction of SUE services versus non-SUE services and provides evidence of industry misunderstanding of differences in these service types.",2590-1982,Not found
Mode choice of city tourists: Discrete choice modeling based on survey data from a major German city,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100704,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"With growing city tourism, there is an increasing need for urban travel demand models to consider traffic generated by visitors. Existing research has concentrated on socio-demographic and journey-related factors to determine what influences the mode choice of tourists. In contrast, revealed preference data, such as travel time, is almost never considered. In this article, we present the results of discrete choice modeling of city tourists’ mode choice based on revealed preference data from a survey we conducted in Kassel, Germany. We used multinomial logit models and determined the model parameters using maximum likelihood estimations. Surprisingly, travel time played a smaller role in mode choice than assumed from previously established understanding about everyday mobility. In the final model, travel time was only significant for the alternative of walking. Also, most other sociodemographic and journey-related variables showed no significant influence. The final model reproduced the mode choice, but the goodness of fit was lower than expected from other research. We conclude that modeling the travel behavior of tourists is more complex than everyday mobility. An alternative approach that we suggest would be to model trip chains rather than single trips.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring the sustained and divided attention of novice versus experienced drivers,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100702,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Purpose of the research Driving is a complex task that requires appropriate engagement in, and regulation of, sustained attention and divided attention. This study explored the sustained- and divided-attention function of novice young adult drivers and experienced adult drivers. Methods Fifteen novice young adult drivers (mean age = 20.07) and 18 experienced adult drivers (mean age = 41.33) participated in the study. The participants’ sustained and divided attention were assessed using a computerised fixed Sustained Attention-to-Response Task (SART) and a modified version with low cognitive-load and high cognitive-load conditions. Their attention was also assessed using the Color Trails Test (CTT) and Digit Span Test (DST). The participants’ cognitive resources that were available during the assessments were monitored using the Rating Scale Mental Effort (RSME). Results The main results of this study showed that the experienced drivers had significantly higher performance in terms of accuracy in both sustained attention (p = 0.011) and divided attention (p = 0.008 and 0.006 in low and high cognitive-load conditions, respectively) components of the SART. No significant differences in the CTT and DST were found between the two groups. The results of the RSME also indicated that both groups had comparable cognitive resources available throughout the assessments. Conclusions This study suggests that experienced adult drivers have a higher developed ability to engage in and maintain sustained and divided attention appropriately. These results provide insight related to attention function, which might affect novice young adult drivers compared with experienced drivers.",2590-1982,Not found
Does procedural justice predict intentions to speed? Evidence from a sample of young drivers,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100709,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Due to factors such as greater levels of sensation seeking and negative peer influences, travelling at speeds greater than the posted limit is common among young drivers. This has been shown to increase risk of death and serious injury in road crashes, and therefore, there is a need to identify theoretical perspectives that can be used to effectively inform intervention development. This study aimed to further develop an understanding of the influence of procedurally just interactions between young drivers and police on intentions to engage in speeding behaviours. A 30-minute online survey was completed by 2,124 young Queensland and Victorian (Australia) drivers. A regression analysis identified that young drivers who perceived higher levels of procedural justice in their interactions with police officers reported lower intentions to engage in speeding. This was after factors known to be associated with increased speeding intentions, such as sensation seeking, had been accounted for. These findings suggest that procedural justice is a candidate for consideration in the development of non-deterrence based speeding interventions for young drivers.",2590-1982,Not found
Is the automated vehicle “aware” of the pedestrian? Examining driving behavior adaptation as a cue to inform the passenger of a potential hazard,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100701,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"In urban areas, drivers often have difficulty detecting pedestrians who want to cross the street but are obstructed by parked vehicles. Highly automated vehicles (HAVs, SAE Level 4) will have to solve this issue automatically and at least as safely as human drivers. We conducted two studies to investigate whether passengers’ trust in automation can be supported by adapting HAV driving behavior to demonstrate that the vehicle is “aware” of a potential hazard. We examined the passengers’ perception of risk, their trust in the automated driving system, and their preferences for HAV behavioral adaptations as a response to potential hazard in a driving situation in two experimental studies, 1) a driving simulator study and 2) a human&vehicle-in-the-loop study. We varied the lateral offset from the road center and deceleration (driving simulator only) when passing a parked vehicle. In the driving simulator study, we varied the HAV’s speed and the presence of a pedestrian in the parking bay and an oncoming vehicle. In the human&vehicle-in-the-loop study, the HAV passing the obscured pedestrian at 50 km/h. Results support the idea that it is beneficial for human passengers to be informed about the HAVs “awareness” of a potentially hazardous situation. However, introducing a lateral offset had no positive effect on passengers’ perceptions. Deceleration enhanced passengers’ trust but was only examined in the driving simulator study. Future research should compare the effects of behavioral adaptations to other in-vehicle human–machine interface approaches providing information about the “awareness” about potential hazards visually.",2590-1982,Not found
A naturalistic study assessing the impact of daytime running lights and vehicle passing events on cyclist's physiological stress,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100703,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Bicyclists are vulnerable road users who are at a greater risk for injury and fatality during crashes. Additionally, the “near-miss” incidents they experience during regular trips can increase the perceived risk and deter them from riding again. This paper aims to use naturalistic bicycling data collected in Johnson County, Iowa to: 1) study the effect of factors such as road surface type, parked vehicles, pavement markings and car passing events on cyclists’ physiological stress and 2) understand the effect of daytime running lights (DRL) as an on-bicycle safety system in providing comfort to cyclists and highlight of their presence on the road to other vehicles. A total of 37 participants were recruited to complete trips over two weekends, one weekend with DRL and the other without DRL. Recruitment was specifically targeted toward cyclists who expressed discomfort riding in traffic. Data were collected using a front forward facing camera, GPS, and a vehicle lateral passing distance sensor mounted on the bicycle and a Empatica E4 wrist band (providing physiological data such as electrodermal activity; EDA) worn by the cyclist. Data from those sources were cleaned, processed, merged, and aggregated into time windows depicting car passing and no car passing events. Mixed effects models were used to study the cyclists’ skin conductance response (phasic EDA) and baseline skin conductance level (tonic EDA). Car passing, parked vehicles, and roads with dashed centerline markings were observed to increase the cyclists stress. The use of DRL had negligible impact on cyclist stress on roads.",2590-1982,Not found
"Digital civic engagement, open data, and the informal sector: a think piece",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100700,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Digitalization and advances in information and communications technologies (ICT) are having a major impact on urban transport and the way people move around cities. However, this hardly relates to informal transport in the global South. Despite its importance and the fact that billions of people depend on it, insufficient efforts have been made by policymakers to improve informal transport services. In this think piece, we propose that this circumstance can be addressed on two counts through digital civic engagement and open data. In the digital age, civic engagement is no longer only associated with voluntary work at community level, but it is also very effective remotely. Digital civic engagement leverages social media to create awareness for in-situ concerns and provides a platform for local volunteers to connect with international experts to create people-centered solutions (e.g., mobile apps). Open data stimulates and facilitates digital civic engagement, which, in turn, can lead to the creation of more open data. Cities and local authorities should encourage and foster this virtuous cycle, and make transport data sets openly available. This can spur innovation and promote sustainable mobility behavior – with volunteers being powerful agents driving these efforts. Indeed, the case of the Trufi Association demonstrates that open data (e.g., in the form of volunteered geographic information) and the development of mobile apps in several developing cities have helped make informal transport more visible and transparent. The insights from the informal transport field can serve as an impetus for other sectors of the informal economy – such as retail, commerce, agriculture, manufacturing, and services – to promote digital civic engagement and open data to bring about positive change.",2590-1982,Not found

In travel surveys, people do not report their exact departure or arrival times, and they often round the times to nearest multiples of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min.

However, no studies have confirmed this assumption that actual times are evenly distributed. The present study aims to confirm the assumption by utilising times reported by a third party. The data come from the Japanese Prime Minister’s minute-by-minute activity schedule published daily in newspapers. The data covers 90 days between 27 June and 24 September 2021.

Fleet management and control system for developing countries implemented with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) services,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100694,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Fleet Management Control Systems (FMCS) monitor vehicles in real-time and help assessing schedule compliance. Transit services in developing countries must improve in aspects such as information about routes, schedules and users; and compliance with traffic regulations, to achieve an increase in their demand. Although a FMCS can deal with these issues, currently implemented systems have some limitations related to communications technology, associated costs, interoperability and standardization. This paper includes the following: 1) The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) architecture designed for the FMCS; 2) The development of a FMCS prototype for developing countries, considering the proposed architecture, using the Long Range communication technology and Intelligent Transportation Systems services; 3) A validation and testing of the FMCS prototype, using transit vehicles in a city. The developed prototype was successfully tested. The ideal operating parameters of the FMCS in terms of communications technology were identified in one of the four routes used in the tests. The results in such route were validated with additional tests, using the same parameters, and reaching similar operating values. A data set with the information of the performed tests was generated. With the results obtained in the FMCS, a better control of the transit service can be achieved, helping to improve upon the problems identified for developing countries (especially in medium-sized cities) related to route and schedule compliance, speeding, safety, standardization and helpful information for users. Additionally, service operation costs are reduced by using cutting-edge communications technology and promoting interoperability with other mobility services created for these cities.",2590-1982,Not found

Recently, the nascent concept of “resilience hubs” has emerged to help communities overcome these challenges and improve well-being during disasters and everyday conditions. This paper provides an early conceptual understanding of resilience hubs, in particular their associated transportation needs, through a comprehensive literature review. The review identified characteristics and needs for planning hubs by focusing on their current definitions and related concepts (e.g., evacuation shelters, mobility hubs). In all, the review identified that resilience hubs could be a successful tool for communities in addressing the important needs of residents, evacuees, and survivors. However, we found that the placement of hubs is not methodical or optimized, and hubs have yet to be evaluated using metrics or key performance indicators. Critically, most literature and examples of resilience hubs fail to consider: 1) how people and relief supplies will travel to/from hubs, or 2) potential transportation services that could be offered by hubs. We recommend that programs that identify, design, and create resilience hubs should emphasize mechanisms for providing reliable and equitable transportation for people and relief supplies.",2590-1982,Not found

In this paper, we aim at investigating users’ perception on autonomous vehicles, mobility on demand schemes as well as on the future transportation landscape using data collected through a questionnaire survey in the Metropolitan Area of Athens, Greece conducted after the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. First, a statistical analysis of the responses is performed and, then, a clustering approach is followed to identify user profiles based on daily mobility patterns and attitudes towards autonomous vehicles.

Walkability and importance assessment of pedestrian facilities on central business district in capital city of Indonesia,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100695,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The City of Jakarta has changed the paradigm of transportation development policy in order to prioritize pedestrians. This research aims to examine the walkability of Sudirman-Thamrin central business district. The research used the modified Global Walkability Index (GWI) method. This method was used because the parameters have been adjusted to the characteristics of pedestrians in big cities in Asia. The findings of this research show that revitalization of sidewalk using the road diet concept can increase walkability up to 38.98%. It also has an impact on increasing the number of public transportation users by 15.41%.The Sudirman–Thamrin area, as a pilot project location for sidewalk revitalization, can be used as an example to be applied in other locations. The findings of this research for international readers can be used as lessons on how an area that was previously a car oriented city has turned into an area that prioritizes pedestrians which also has implications for increasing the value of walkability and public transportation users. Furthermore, the walkability parameters were grouped into four aspects to find out the correlation between walkability and the four aspects. In previous GWI research, the analysis of this correlation was not conducted. According to the IPA results, four parameters were considered important and high performance.

"Why do lower-income areas experience worse road safety outcomes? Examining the role of the built environment in Orange County, Florida",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100696,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Lower-income areas experience an increased incidence of traffic crashes, injuries, and deaths than more affluent ones. Researchers tend to blame these outcomes on differences in car ownership, with lower-income households expected to use vulnerable active modes at higher rates, as well as being more likely to drive older vehicles with fewer safety features. While these explanations seem plausible enough, they likely fail to provide a complete picture of the problem. This study examines the role of the built environment in road safety outcomes for lower- and higher-income block groups in Orange County, Florida. It finds that the hazard posed by urban arterials is three times greater for lower-income environments than for more affluent communities. Sidewalk buffers, ordinarily regarded as a pedestrian amenity, were associated with crash increases in affluent areas but not lower-income ones. Areas with concentrations of black residents were found to be increased risk, even after accounting for differences in income.

Real-time social distance measurement and face mask detection in public transportation systems during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic Era: Theoretical approach and case study in Italy,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100693,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Due to its remarkable learning ability and benefits in several areas of real-life, deep learning-based applications have recovered to be a research topic of great importance in the last few years. This article presents a method devoted to guaranteeing safety conditions in public transportation systems (PTS) during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic era. The paper describes a viable real-time model based on deep learning for monitoring social distance between users and detecting face masks in stop areas and inside vehicles of public transportation systems. Detections are made using the deep learning approach and YOLOv3 algorithm. The safety rule violations are represented by red bounding boxes and red circles in a bird’s eye view as output of the video surveillance analysis. The datasets used to train the neural network are the “Caltech Pedestrian Dataset” and the “COVID-19 Medical Face Mask Detection Dataset”. Metrics, such Loss Accuracy, and Precision, obtained in the testing process of the neural network were used to evaluate the performance of the model in detecting users and face masks. The proposed method was recently tested in the Public Transportation System of the Municipality of Piazza Armerina (Italy). The results show a significant reliability of the method in detecting real-time interactions between users of the PTS in terms of over-time variations in their mutual distancing, as well as in recognising cases of violation of the imposed social distancing and FFP2 face mask use.",2590-1982,Not found
Mental barriers in planning for cycling along the urban–rural gradient,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100689,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"As studying planning practices and planners’ motivations along the urban–rural gradient has not been common practice, we scrutinize the regional differences in the understanding of cycling planning of Austrian municipal administrators using three questions from a previous on-purpose survey. These questions serve as simple proxies for decisions that need to be made from the perspective of a climate change mitigation-driven transformation of transport planning. The administrators were asked (1) to rank the priorities for transport modes in the case of conflict of space allocation, (2) to name the quantity of bicycle parking provision in projects, and (3) to mark pictures of bicycle parking stands they consider fulfilling the needs of cyclists. The chosen priorities indicate that traditional understanding and mental barriers persist among administrators in an urban–rural gradient. In urban as well as rural areas administrators in charge of cycling planning, still prioritize cars (in terms of infrastructure and space) over bicycles. And up to one quarter of responses – from urban as well as rural municipalities – state that they don’t know if the amount of bicycle parking spaces provided meets legal requirements or exceeds them. These mental barriers need to be overcome for an improved and accelerated introduction of necessary cycling policies.",2590-1982,Not found
Profitable market mechanism for platform-based aggregator taxi services,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100687,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"For platform based aggregator taxi services, selling the rides through appropriate channels is critical. Typically, aggregators use a listed price strategy in the regular and opaque channels for the passengers. The listed price channels’ rigidity restricts the passengers to only accept or reject rides without further involvement. We propose an additional ‘Name Your Own Price’ (NYOP) channel with opaqueness in terms of features and extra waiting time that captures the passengers’ and drivers’ preference. The passengers with low ride valuation who were previously priced out of the market can be accommodated by NYOP since it offers rides at a reduced price. In our model for the drivers, we specifically analyze an incentive-practice where the drivers are offered a lump-sum amount for completing a threshold number of trips on a day-to-day basis. When such incentives are offered by the aggregator to the drivers, we find that a rational driver in NYOP should aggressively bid for a ride if the driver is away from the threshold for incentives, and vice versa. We show that with higher levels of opacity, the aggregator can achieve higher levels of passenger segmentation that in turn increases the overall aggregator’s revenue. Also, NYOP offers additional rides for drivers, which will generate extra revenue, and it also helps them reach the incentive threshold set by the aggregator. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increase in the number of rides due to NYOP can be capitalized by the aggregator for generating additional revenue.",2590-1982,Not found
The impact of access prices on train traffic: An econometric study for France,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100679,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"To guarantee fair and nondiscriminatory access to rail networks, European Commission raised the importance of regulation by promoting short run marginal cost. Thus, to recover the full cost of infrastructure, Infrastructure Managers may use mark ups over the marginal cost, using Ramsey pricing for example. However, a Ramsey pricing implementation for rail infrastructure is strongly limited by the lack of information about the demand elasticity of train paths. The aim of this article is to try to fill this gapby conducting an empirical research on the price sensitivity of the railway paths using a French dataset from 2003 to 2016. Preliminary results suggest that track access charges influence negatively the train path demand for high-speed trains and freight trains butdo not seem to influence the train path demand for regional trains under PSO. Nevertheless, if track access charges are related to the track category (UIC category) or to the kind of line (high speed or conventional) results may differ. Regarding regional and freight trains, the track category seems to determine the statistical significance of track access charges elasticity while the kind of line seems to explain the impacts on the demand of rail paths for high-speed trains.",2590-1982,Not found
Towards sustainable mobility – Transformative scenarios for 2034,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100690,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Increasing the share of walking and cycling is one of the building blocks of sustainable mobility transformation. Fundamental changes are needed in society and urban structure to support the integration of walking and cycling into everyday routines. We conducted an online Delphi study with 30 walking and cycling experts during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland in the spring of 2020. The aim was to explore transport experts’ views on the future and derive scenarios of walking and cycling with the broader context of the urban mobility system. The scenarios were created using a combination of cluster analysis and qualitative content analysis. In addition, a methodological elaboration of the Disaggregative Delphi analysis was introduced, systematising the analysis of qualitative data. The analysis resulted in five scenarios depicting walking and cycling in 2034: 1. Business as Usual Plus, 2. The Demise of Bus-Transport, 3. The Era of Soft Modes, 4.

As the primary sector in Thailand, the tourism industry has been significantly affected by the pandemic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the differences in domestic travel behavior in Thailand's pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic periods. A total of 460 valid questionnaires were collected using an online survey. The valid datasets were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis modified with the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Essential behavior factors were considered, such as attitude toward travel (ATT), travel norms (TN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). According to the research gap, we included the hygiene concern (HC) and destination knowledge (DK) factors to examine Thai tourists' intention to travel in the post-pandemic. The result showed that Thai tourists tended to travel more domestically post-COVID-19.

Factors that affect travel behaviour in developing cities: A methodological review,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100683,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Introduction Travel behaviour research involves the study of both the economic and behavioural (or sociological) aspects of travel. Numerous factors influence the demand for travel in complex ways, resulting in intricate causal relationships which require the use of a wide range of data analysis methodologies and interpretations. This study provides an overview of travel behaviour research conducted in developing countries in order to gain insight into the factors that influence travel demand and the methodologies used to investigate them. Methods Four multi-subject electronic databases were searched, and the inclusion criteria adopted was in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Twenty studies met our inclusion criteria. Results The main methods of analysis used in the studies reviewed are rooted in multivariate regression models and structural equation modeling with the most predominant methods being SEM and the MNL. The studies reviewed show that age, gender, income, work status, education level, family size, cost, and availability of travel modes are the most important factors influencing travel demand in developing cities. Conclusion The findings serve as a resource for scholars interested in this subject, as they provide insights that may be used to perform better travel demand studies.

The future of telecommuting post COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100685,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"COVID-19 caused unprecedented changes in the daily lives of many people worldwide, with many working from home for the first time. This shift in working arrangement has the potential to have a lasting impact in future. This paper investigates longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on work-arrangements, specifically, individuals’ preferences towards work-from-home post COVID-19. This study utilizes data from a stated preference component of a travel survey conducted in the Central Okanagan region of British Columbia. A random parameter ordered logit model is developed to accommodate the ordinal nature of the preference variable and capture unobserved heterogeneity. One of the key features of the study is to confirm the effects of residential choice in-terms of location characteristics and dwelling attributes on work-from-home preferences after the pandemic. For example, individuals’ dwelling attributes such as larger sized dwelling, larger sized apartments are likely to have positive effect on frequent work-from-home. The model confirms significant heterogeneity, in relation to location characteristics such as commute distance and distance to urban center. For instance, initially, females were less likely to work-from-home. However, they showed significant heterogeneity with large standard deviation, specifically their preference was found to vary by residential location. For instance, females residing farther from urban centers prefer a higher frequency of work-from-home. Elasticity analysis suggests that part-time female workers, mid-age individuals, full-time workers with children, and full-time workers with longer commutes have a significantly higher probability to work-from-home every day after the pandemic. The findings of the study provide important insights which will assist in developing effective work-from-home strategies post-the-pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found
A Delphi-FMEA model to assess county-level speeding crash risk in North Dakota,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100688,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Speeding is a common contributing factor to traffic crashes. It contributes to a third of fatal crashes in the United States and is a critical risky behavior for drivers. Due to the limited budgets received by states to improve traffic safety, they must identify high-risk regions that can be prioritized to receive safety-related funding. Speeding crash risk can vary among regions. Therefore, identifying regions with the highest speeding crash risk enables road managers to balance and arrange corresponding budget allocations. Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) was used to assess speeding crash risk. A localized risk assessment of speeding crashes was demonstrated for North Dakota counties. Incorporating local experts' opinions via Delphi method into FMEA, we determined thresholds to calculate risk priority number (RPN). Additionally, a preference approach was employed to rank the duplicate RPN values. A comparison study was carried out to confirm the effectiveness of incorporating detectability risk and localized degrees of risk parameters in evaluating the speeding crash risks. The findings equip decision makers and road managers with an effective tool to prioritize high-risk counties in receiving safety budgets or for conducting more detailed safety studies. Because of its generality, the new framework can be adapted for a wide range of applications in evaluating risks of various crash types.",2590-1982,Not found

Transportation programs under financial uncertainty: Identification of needs for future research,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100684,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"To meet their short-term and long-term transportation goals, nationwide transportation agencies prepare infrastructure programs. Such programs, which consist of projects to be undertaken during the planning horizon, are developed in a highly complex and dynamic environment. Successful implementation of these programs is dependent on multiple uncertainties, with financial uncertainty being key among them. The literature has extensively discussed financial uncertainty at both the project and the program levels. However, financial uncertainty is generally addressed under the assumption of a single central funding source. These studies assume that there is no restriction on the use of money and on what projects are eligible for funds from a given funding category (source). However, multiple funding categories and project eligibility restrictions are prevalent across most transportation agencies. This study aims to address this gap by understanding the role of financial uncertainty when coupled with multiple funding categories and other project eligibility restrictions. The study is motivated by the practical needs of decision-makers at the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). To better understand the needs of practitioners, the authors carried out an exploratory case study to identify the complexities involved in the transportation programming process. Additionally, this scenario analysis illustrates the potential implications of the current practices and procedures. The study's findings reveal a clear need to expand the current literature to account for multiple funding categories during transportation programming.

Towards a co-creation framework based on citizens' dreams of future mobility,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100686,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The design space of Future Mobility Services is a wicked problem. Wicked problems are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty and many competing perspectives and interests that must be aligned in order to solve. Therefore, the design of future mobility services tends to require collaborations between private partners, the public sector, and citizens to come to fruition, often with competing goals and value systems. Recent years have shown a growing interest in using Living Lab methodology to address these types of wicked problems, and even though progress has been made, there still remains challenges concerning how to engage citizens in co-creation and alignment of stakeholders. This paper investigates how future workshops can be used to generate a framework rooted in the context of citizens, and how this framework can be used as a point of departure fo co-creation in multi-stakeholder settings in order to address wicked problems. The future workshops were organized in Sweden, in two communities which are seldomly emphasized in mobility service research; the first a peri-urban area on the outskirts of a large city and the second an urban area within a city with a heterogeneous set of citizens in terms of cultural background and income status. The framework was derived from an analysis highlighting Resilience, Opportunity and Community, as important themes to bring into the discussions when co-creating future mobility services. The framework, in turn, can then help in creating a bridge between citizens and align other stakeholders, when grounding work in a situated context.",2590-1982,Not found
Difference in risk perception of onboard security threats by aircrew and aviation security experts,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100666,16,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Airlines are increasingly relying on non-security personnel such as cabin crews and pilots to perform a security function when dealing with potential onboard security threats. The training aircrews receive on security threat assessment is considered by many to be inadequate. The way aircrews respond to potential onboard threats can have life and death consequences for passengers and other aircrew. How these potential threats are handled can also cause significant financial loss to the airlines through loss of productivity, passenger claims or even legal liability. For this reason, it is imperative we understand how aircrews perceive security risk in order to make appropriate risk assessments. This study examines if aircrew perceive security risks the same as aviation security experts. Five scenarios representing actual potential onboard security threats were given to a group of 67 pilots, cabin crew and aviation security experts. The participants were asked a series of questions about the scenarios that measured how they perceived the potential threat as well as other questions to determine how prepared they were to deal with each scenario.

The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology to apply BIM to the archaeological field (Heritage BIM - HBIM), with a focus on stone paved roads. It addresses the case study of a stretch of stone paved road located in the Archaeological Site of Pompeii in Italy. For the development of the digital model, several BIM-based tools have been used, starting from a laser scanner-based survey, which led to a point cloud that was subsequently coordinated with certain referenced points to achieve a correct geo-referenced point cloud. The corridor design process was performed by developing a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the paved surface and customizing the cross-section.

This study sought to conduct a detailed cost analysis with a view to determining whether productivity is at an optimum for specific road maintenance equipment in Uganda, with emphasis on mechanized agricultural plantation access road maintenance works. Two descriptive research methods were used: observations and case study approach. Control parameters affecting machine production were identified as machine repair costs, maintenance costs, machine depreciation costs, worker’s salaries, machine insurance costs, and machine fuel costs. Machine downtime was mainly affected by delays in procuring spares. The total hourly machine production costs were calculated to be 699,602 Ugx (185.84USD).

The factors influencing trust were investigated as was whether the withdrawal experience had changed the trust in other authorities not involved in the withdrawal process. Also, the aetiology of the visual field loss and gender were investigated. A survey study was conducted in which 402 Swedish respondents with visual field loss and a withdrawal experience participated. Variance, regression, and content analyses were conducted. The following conceptual factors were used in understanding trust: Benevolence, Openness, Integrity, Ability, and Value Congruence. The results revealed that processes and outcomes affected the overall trust in all three authorities, although the highest trust was in the health-care system (but still low). Diagnosis, but not gender, was important for the experienced trust. Differences in levels of trust in each authority were related to the aetiology of the diagnosis.

Napper cycling typology: Identifying and understanding different bicycle trip purposes,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100740,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"What is a bicycle trip? Our own experiences, observation and reading tells a story – that there is no single or all encompassing “cycling” activity. Although trip purposes are used as examples to illustrate findings or explain ideas, they are often limited to a binary of “transport or recreation”. This oversimplification makes it easy to dismiss and mischaracterise cycling, particularly in countries with low or emerging cycling volumes. This research addressed this gap in knowledge with the development of a typology of bicycle trips. Based on six types of trips, the typology represents how they relate to, and mix with, one another. The typology represents a departure from a tendency of classifying people, to classifying the things they may do. The six journey types are: recreation, commute, tasks and errands, passenger, work, and sport. The implications of trip purposes are discussed, with opportunities arising such as a better understanding of what might be needed to encourage a modal shift from recreational to commuter riding, or a better understanding of user needs in different trips. The practical implications of trip purposes, for example riding with shopping and making short multi-stop journeys carrying goods and children raise implications for the bicycle transport system.

The spatial dynamics of these are key to generating and interpreting outputs of transportation models that are most relevant for a community and the diverse mobility needs of its members. Here we present a typology transfer framework, grounded in socio-spatial dynamics shaping people’s mobility, to take transportation-themed regional mobility model outcomes, in this case from two agent-based models (ABMs), and extrapolate them to other cities, with less time and resource intensity than new ABM development. The typology transfer process first identifies micro-urban social types (MUSTs) using socio-spatial factors, then defines city types based on spatial patterns of MUSTs to assess across which cities transfer results are likely to best hold. Lastly, a typology transfer multiplier matrix extrapolates a given variable, in our case the Mobility Energy Productivity (MEP) metric, to another city. The full process demonstration uses ABM results from Chicago (POLARIS model) and San Francisco (BEAM model), applying them to New York City. We discuss how MEP or other outputs can be appropriately estimated and used for integrated, human-centered mobility analysis. Key findings include that this MUST framework of user-defined dependent and independent variables allows tailoring ABM results and interpretations to specific community needs and data availability. Findings clarify that positive outcomes can be targeted towards user groups, based on sociospatial characteristics, using a typology approach, such as inclusive access to mobility choices, transportation affordability, and greater efficiency in resource use.",2590-1982,Not found

This paper offers an analysis of the academic literature to show how narratives have been used in transport research between 1990 and 2021 and to discuss how narratives are useful for interpretation of real-world policy contexts. We perform a systematic literature review using 106 publications that met the identification and eligibility criteria from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. We analyse frequency and cluster the publications according to their focus and function. For the focus, we categorised by research areas, themes, and sub-themes. For the function, we grouped the narratives into three categories: Elicit narratives (extracting narratives from collected data); explicit narratives (narratives used to create scenarios); and proposed narratives (recommended narratives). Our results indicate that narratives were not previously used extensively in transport research, but their use is increasing in recent years. We demonstrate that narrative methods are most often used to analyse safety and the social impact of transport. Our analysis suggests that narratives are crucial to understanding and implementing transport policies, a helpful methodological tool to capture values and people's experiences, and therefore a useful way to address sustainable change. We posit that if narratives were more widely adopted and circulated in the transport community, we might see more robust insights into mechanisms required to achieve sustainable policy choices.",2590-1982,Not found

Data was obtained from a stated preference survey that was distributed online to 74 truck fleet managers/owners in the United States (U.S.). A multicriteria decision-making approach was used that combines the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method (DEMATEL) with grey system theory. Additionally, a subgroup analysis was conducted to explore potential differences for ET adopters and non-ET adopters. Among other findings, the results indicate that the business model and partnerships, product availability, and charging time constitute the top cause factors. Addressing these barriers would also lead to or help address the most prominent barriers regarding operational reliability, grid resiliency, and customer acceptance and expectations. The subgroup analysis showed that ET adopters and non-adopters may not be viewed as one homogenous group, since differences were found in the ranking and interrelationships of barriers to ET adoption between these two groups. This study improves the theoretical rational for the barriers and can assist policymakers or other major stakeholders to frame and prioritize strategies for accelerating ET adoption.",2590-1982,Not found
Associations between vision impairment and driving performance and the effectiveness of vision-related interventions: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100753,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Introduction This systematic review aims to (1) investigate the associations between vision impairment and driving performance, and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of vision-related interventions to improve driving performance. Method Medline (Ovid), EMBASE and Global Health electronic databases were searched from their inception to March 2022 for observational and interventional English-language studies. The population of focus were licensed drivers of all ages of four-wheeled motorised vehicles. The primary outcome was measures of driving performance from naturalistic driving and/or on-road closed circuits. All screening, data extraction and critical appraisals were completed independently by two authors. Results 27 studies (n = 6358 participants) from the 4281 identified in the search were included in this review. All but one study, an RCT, were observational. Only 2 cross-sectional studies were rated as high risk of bias. The majority of papers (80 %) were limited to older drivers. There were 33 different performance measures reported. Poor driving performance was associated with glaucoma, AMD and monocularity, and measures of vision function including contrast sensitivity, visual acuity and visual fields. From the vision-related interventions identified only cataract surgery and toric refractive correction for astigmatism were shown to improve driving performance on selected measures. Conclusion Despite differences in outcome measures, there is consistent evidence for associations between vision impairments and poor driving performance. This review highlights the importance vision has on an individual’s ability to safely drive and complete common manoeuvres. Early detection and management of eye conditions may help decrease the likelihood of crashing and road traffic injuries.",2590-1982,Not found
Comparative evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and vaccine discovery on the global transportation industry,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100741,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This research investigated the daily abnormal stock returns of 727 listed companies from 63 countries. We tested the impact of two major COVID-19 related events—(1) the declaration by the World Health Organisation of the global pandemic and (2) the vaccine discovery announcement by Pfizer/BioNTech—on transportation stock price reactions. We found that the pandemic declaration event negatively affected transportation stocks, whereas the vaccine announcement had a positive effect. Passenger markets were more affected than freight markets. Airlines stocks were most struck during the pandemic, whereas railroad companies were unaffected. However, airlines were the best performers following the vaccine discovery event. During the pandemic incident, European transportation firms were hit to a large extent; however, they also rebounded well during the vaccine event.Transportation firms in emerging markets were hit more than those in developed markets; however, both recovered to the same degree during the vaccine event. Transportation firms from countries with higher exposure to China were affected less than those with lower exposure during both events. Our implications are relevant to how investors make investment decisions surrounding market uncertainty. Moreover, corporate managers can refer to the findings when they formulate their firm’s financial policies and operations to respond to stock market reactions in the wake of the pandemic. Our results can also help policymakers evaluate and deploy effective policies to boost investor confidence and keep transportation firms viable during a crisis. Overall, the findings can be used for future policy formulation in the transportation industry.",2590-1982,Not found
A method to separate primary and secondary train delays in past and future timetables using macroscopic simulation,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100747,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Punctuality is a key factor in railway operations and is affected by both primary and secondary delays to differing degrees. Being able to separate these two types of delays is very important when simulating operations, and when conducting punctuality improvement efforts. However, it is not easy to estimate the relative proportions of primary versus secondary delays using historical data. In this paper, we demonstrate a method that uses repeated runs of a macroscopic simulation tool to estimate what share of delays has been primary or secondary. Using the Swedish region of Skåne as a case study, we estimate that about 36% of delays in 2019 were primary, leaving 64% as secondary. We further show that in order for operations to reach the targeted level of punctuality, 95% instead of the observed 87%, primary delays would have had to be cut by half. Using a draft timetable for 2025, we also simulate what the punctuality would be given different assumptions of primary delays. Assuming the same level of primary delays in 2025 as in 2019, we estimate that the punctuality would drop by a further 5 percentage points due to increased density of operations. In order to reach the punctuality target of 95% in 2025, primary delays would instead need to be reduced by two-thirds. At the request of the infrastructure manager, we also show the predicted geographical distribution of secondary delays in this future timetable. Our results highlight the need for drastic delay reduction measures to reach set targets.",2590-1982,Not found
Spatio-temporal constraints of carer-workers in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area: An exploratory analysis using potential path areas,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100749,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Carer-workers are individuals providing regular unpaid care to an adult dependent while simultaneously employed in the paid labour market, and the group represents a significant portion of the Canadian adult population. Despite the prevalence of unpaid care in Canada, very limited research has explored the spatio-temporal tensions that carer-workers experience. The objective of this study is to explore the space–time constraints experienced by carer-workers. One way of measuring both space and time constraints on an individual is the foundational time geography concept of the Space-Time Prism, and its two-dimensional counterpart, the Potential Path Area (PPA). We collected three to seven day-long trip diaries of 25 carer-workers in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area in 2017–18, including all trips made over the diary period and whether the trip involved care work. We developed a customized Python tool and used Open Street Maps to derive PPAs for 12 of the sample carer-workers, which were aggregated to form daily PPAs. Descriptive analyses of the PPAs are presented, and comparisons of PPA size, and therefore, daily accessibility, across carer-workers’ sociodemographic and economic indicators, days of the week, and level of caregiving intensity are examined. Through its ability to represent, quantitatively and visually, the accessibility differences across various population groups, and to fill a gap in our understanding of carer-workers, the PPA represents an important methodological avenue for continuing research into carer-workers in Canada and around the world.",2590-1982,Not found
Iterated clustering optimization of the split-delivery vehicle routing problem considering passenger walking distance,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100751,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The user-oriented, demand-driven nature of customized shuttle bus (CSB) services forces operators to pay more attention to service quality. However, the bus route planning of CSB and other similar systems in established studies rarely took service quality into consideration while minimizing operating costs. This study proposed an open split-delivery weighted vehicle routing problem with iterated clustering (OSDWVRP-IC) to simultaneously optimize the route of bus and passenger walking distance. A max–min ant system (MMAS) algorithm is developed to solve the OSDWVRP-IC. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated using a range of classical benchmark instance sets.

Urban freight logistics and land use planning education: Trends and gaps through the lens of literature,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100731,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Supply chains, urban freight logistics and freight transport have been under pressure to improve productivity, quality, and sustainability performance. Conventional methods of practice are unable to respond to this industry’s ever-growing challenges and needs. New methods/technologies have emerged to respond to this issue, making urban freight logistics a more contemporary, interdisciplinary and technology integrated field. Nevertheless, the application of new methods/technologies, and developments in the field are not fully integrated into training/education programs. This study utilised a systematic literature review along with thematic and content analyses to interrogate and explore the developments within urban freight logistics practises and compared them with the current developments in the literature on freight logistics training/education programs—to identify the gaps and limitations within the body of knowledge. The findings reveal that the literature on urban freight logistics education is lacking in terms of providing a comprehensive education on the spatial systems of moving freight in urban areas and is falling behind the current developments within the industry. This study highlights that there is a substantial gap in the body of knowledge on urban freight logistics education, given that many of the current studies in the literature are focus on freight logistics as a topic with no/limited consideration to the rapidly changing urban context.",2590-1982,Not found

This demands a deeper analysis to support policy makers in creating interventions that not only protect people from the pandemic but also remedy its negative effects on the economy. Thus, this study investigated people’s mobility changes through the relationship between spatiotemporal population density and urban facilities. Results showed that places related to daily services, restaurants, commercial areas, and offices experienced decreased visits, with the highest decline belonging to commercial facilities. Visits to health care and production facilities were stable on weekdays but increased on holidays. Educational institutions’ visits decreased on weekdays but increased on holidays. People’s visits to residential housing and open spaces increased, with the rise in residential housing visits being more substantial. The results also confirmed that policy interventions (e.g., declaration of emergency and upgrade of restriction level) have a great impact on people’s mobility in the short term. The findings would seem to indicate that visit patterns at service and restaurant places decreased least during the pandemic. The analysis outcomes suggest that policy makers should pay more attention to risk perception enhancement as a long-term measure. Furthermore, the study clarified the population density of each facility type in a time series. Improving model performance would be promising for tracking and predicting the spread of future pandemics.",2590-1982,Not found
Linking travel behavior and tourism literature: Investigating the impacts of travel satisfaction on destination satisfaction and revisit intention,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100745,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This study aims to link two closely related domains in literature – travel behavior and tourism. Travel behavior studies partly aim to improve travel satisfaction by exploring its relationships with overall and domain-specific life satisfaction. Tourism studies, on the other hand, focus on improving the attraction and sustainability of tourism destinations and often investigate the factors affecting destination satisfaction and revisit intention. The present study uncovers the interconnections between travel behavior and tourism by investigating the impacts of travel satisfaction on destination satisfaction and revisit intention. An online survey of 696 visitors to national parks in the US conducted in the Summer of 2022 was analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach. Analysis results show that travel satisfaction has a direct impact on destination satisfaction and both direct and indirect (through destination satisfaction) impacts on revisit intention. Also, interestingly, results reveal that travel satisfaction has a stronger impact on revisit intention than destination satisfaction. These results offer an important implication to the tourism destination managers that investing in destination attributes alone might not be sufficient to attain the desired level of tourism for the destination. Thus, an area to be focused on is improving the satisfaction and experiences of travelers on the way to their destination. This could be achieved by investing in transportation infrastructures, networks, facilities, and services connecting major tourism destinations and city centers.",2590-1982,Not found

"Decarbonising UK transport: Implications for electricity generation, land use and policy",10.1016/j.trip.2022.100736,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"To ensure the UK’s net zero targets are met, the transition from conventionally fueled transport to low emission alternatives is necessary. The impact from increased decarbonised electricity generation on ecosystem services (ES) and natural capital (NC) are not currently quantified, with decarbonisation required to minimise impacts from climate change. This study aims to project the future electric and hydrogen energy demand between 2020 and 2050 for car, bus, and train to better understand the land/sea area that would be required to support energy generation. In this work, predictions of the geospatial impact of renewable energy (onshore/offshore wind and solar), nuclear and fossil fuels on ES and NC were made, considering generation mix, number of generation installations and energy density. Results show that electric transport will require ∼136,599 GWh for all vehicle types analysed in 2050, much less than hydrogen transport at ∼425,532 GWh. We estimate that to power electric transport, at least 1515 km2 will be required for solar, 1672 km2 for wind and 5 km2 for nuclear. Hydrogen approximately doubles this requirement. Results provide an approximation of the future demands from the transport sector on land and sea area use, indicating that a combined electric and hydrogen network will be needed to accommodate a range of socio-economic requirements. While robust assessments of ES and NC impacts are critical in future policies and planning, significant reductions in energy demands through a modal shift to (low emission) public transport will be most effective in ensuring a sustainable transport future.",2590-1982,Not found
The impact of COVID-19 and related containment measures on Bangkok's public transport ridership,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100737,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic and related measures used to contain its spread affected public transport ridership in cities around the world. In Thailand, the government issued 41 Royal Decrees between April 2020 and December 2021 to mitigate the spread of the pandemic. In this study, we investigate how Bangkok's public transport services (bus, metro, and boat) have been affected during this period by analyzing the daily ridership data, confirmed COVID-19 cases, and aggregated travel trends by trip destinations using from Google mobility reports. The results show that public transport ridership decreased as daily COVID cases increased and the levels of restraining measures became higher. However, other factors, such as relative strictness compared to earlier measures and sequencing of the measures seems to have had an impact on the ridership. Moreover, the impact on ridership trends is unique for each of the three modes. Bus and metro ridership appear to be more sensitive to the changes in restrictions than the boats. Bus and metro ridership also shows similar changes in the travel trends concerning the place of visit. The findings reported here provide first insights into how Bangkok's public transport systems were affected and suggest the rationale of why different public transport modes were affected differently. These results can be useful for researchers and for decision-makers who plan and design policies and measures for public transport services.",2590-1982,Not found
The limits of soft safety regulation: Does successful work with safety culture require SMS implementation?,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100733,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The Swedish Transport Agency defined contributing to a high safety culture in transport companies as a key element in its regulatory strategy. This study examines how the safety culture strategy was received and enacted by regulators and companies within each transport sector, and factors influencing this. We discuss what a regulatory agency can accomplish through a safety culture strategy, and the extent to which it is bounded by the safety management maturity level in each sector. A key question is whether safety management requires a sequential, or evolutionary development, where companies must implement well-functioning safety management systems (SMS) before being organisationally mature enough to work successfully with safety culture. Our results seem to support this assertion, as we find that transport sectors with legal SMS requirements focus on safety culture, and work with safety culture elements (e.g. reporting/just culture, continuous improvement, involvement) to ensure that the SMS is a living system. Sectors without SMS requirements (i.e. road) do not focus on safety culture. Without SMS, it seems that safety culture work equals focusing on safety commitment among managers and employees. We identify additional factors influencing organisational maturity level and safety culture focus, limiting soft safety regulation, e.g. business structure, maintaining equal conditions for competition.",2590-1982,Not found
Predicting the impact on road safety of an intersection AEB at urban intersections. Using a novel virtual test field for the assessment of conflict prevention between cyclists/pedelecs and cars,10.1016/j.trip.2022.100728,17,2023-01-01,2023,1,"With the rise of Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) and the introduction of Highly Automated Driving (HAD), understanding and predicting road traffic accidents becomes increasingly important. Especially for the assessment of HAD/ADAS systems and of road safety, the precise prediction of the system’s impact on the occurrence of road traffic accidents is essential. Traffic simulations, as one option of virtual assessment, enable the assessment of safety systems in virtual test fields. By modelling the human driver, it is possible to simulate and predict future accident constellations and accident severities. In addition, the influence of vehicle factors, such as the presence of safety systems or their characteristics, on the occurrence of accidents can be investigated. This article elucidate virtual assessment by executing the whole procedure for an automatic emergency braking (AEB) system capable to detect cyclists at urban intersections. The authors implement a new driver behaviour model (DReaM) to predict road traffic accidents at urban intersections. Using the AEB as an example, the influence of different sensor opening angles on crash frequency is investigated by varying the sensors in three steps: 100°, 180°, and 210°. A total of 240,000 situations are simulated of which 6,674 are crashes. Within the two investigation scenarios, the crash frequency is reduced by up to 88.43%, or 93.92% by introducing the AEB system. The article shows that virtual assessment enables the prediction of new safety systems regarding road safety at early design stages. In addition, different system characteristics can be compared efficiently, e.g., the sensor opening angle.",2590-1982,Not found

In a randomized 3-group survey (N = 600), Group A (n = 200) received a standard administrative message; Group B (n = 200) received the standard message together with a rational-based anti-speeding message; Group C (n = 200) received the standard message together with an emotional-based anti-speeding message. Only Group B respondents reported lower intention to speed in general. Both rational- and emotional-based messages influenced respondents' reported intentions to reduce their speed in school zones and residential areas (30 km/h speed limits in both instances).

Behavioral pathway analysis of pedestrian injury severity in pedestrian-motor vehicle crashes,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100777,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Despite the health and environmental benefits of walking as an active and sustainable mode of transport, the increasing number of road crashes involving pedestrians has become a public health concern. This study investigates the direct and indirect effects of various contributing factors on pedestrian injury severity in pedestrian-motor vehicle crashes. Data on pedestrian-vehicle crashes from North Carolina between 2015 and 2019, including the pedestrian pre-crash actions and injury severity, were used. Path analysis was applied to uncover the inter-relationship between contributing factors, pedestrian pre-crash behaviors, and injury severity using random parameter ordered logit and mixed logit models. The results indicate that pedestrian intoxication, lighting condition, number of lanes, speed limit, and vehicle type contribute directly and indirectly (through pre-crash behaviors) to increasing injury severity. It was also observed that pedestrian position and traffic control directly decreased injury severity but indirectly increased injury severity through pre-crash behaviors. This study provides valuable information about the relationship between various crash factors and pedestrian injury severity. For researchers and agencies interested in pedestrian safety improvements, this study gives valuable insight by uncovering the roles of pedestrians’ pre-crash action on injury severity outcomes. For countermeasures, the study recommends better street lighting and re-evaluation of posted speed limits on roads with high pedestrian traffic. A regular educational campaign should inform pedestrians of the importance of yielding to motorists at locations without crosswalks.

The team custom-designed the app, MyAmble, to capture successful transportation behaviors, as well as latent demand, defined as travel not taken but desired, among underserved populations. Stakeholder focus groups with subject matter expert (n = 30) and end users (n = 19) were conducted prior to pilot testing the app, and post-pilot test focus groups (n = 18) and usability surveys (n = 76) were conducted to evaluate the app’s usability. Pre-pilot focus groups indicated that transportation planners desired more questions about safety and other transit modes. End users identified missing destinations, such as temporary housing locations. Post-pilot focus group members reported that using MyAmble required minimal training or technological assistance and that they had sustained confidence throughout usage. Further refinements include reducing length of daily use and resolving Broadband or data plan obstacles for end users.

This study presents empirical evidence for conceptualizing road rage by exploring the relation between aggressive driving behaviors and drivers’ anxiety while driving. Responses from drivers who were observed driving their cars indicated an association between state-trait anxiety and aggressive driving style. Hostile aggressive behaviours were related to higher levels of state-trait anxiety and problem-focused coping style was more common among drivers with instrumental aggression than those with hostile aggression. These findings contribute to our understanding of the interplay between drivers’ coping styles and road rage, highlighting problem-focused coping as a strategy that can reduce hostile aggressive driving.

Baggage dissociation for sustainable air travel: Design study of ground baggage distribution networks,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100797,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Dissociation of passenger travel from baggage delivery has been proposed as one of the radical innovations in future air travel. This concept is still relatively new and largely unexplored, so there are many issues that need to be resolved. For instance, a complete end-to-end baggage dissociation will require the ground distribution networks to deliver passenger luggage to and from the departing and arriving airports. This paper proposes to design such networks as the existing parcel delivery networks. In particular, baggage sorting centers (BSCs) can serve as local hubs for creasing a scalable, multi-level topology of the delivery network in order to manage baggage flows in a given geographical area around the selected airports. Assuming the population density as a proxy for estimating the baggage delivery service demands, the optimum locations of BSCs are determined by formulating and solving the standard p-median and the maximal covering location problems. The numerical results were obtained for Greater London, and also for the whole UK assuming all its major civilian airports. The Greater London area could be served by 36 BSCs to achieve a full service coverage. The 90% service coverage of the whole UK can be achieved by about the same number of BSCs, provided that the coverage distance is increased. In practice, the actual number of required BSCs crucially depends on the operational and capital costs, and the maximum processing capacity of each BSC.

The paper aims to develop a conceptual perspective of psychological and moral values, societal experiences, and service perception and discuss their implications for individuals’ behaviour in transport contexts. To achieve this, the paper draws on theories and concepts from psychology literature, specifically subjective norms and affective attributes. These are used to explore the contextual dimensions of travellers' behaviour and identify the key factors that influence their behaviour and decisions. Thus, two main contributions of the paper are 1) developing a conceptual model that can be used to analyse the decisions of transport users and predict their behaviour 2) reviewing the implications of these factors in the transport context. In particular, the importance of socio-ethical factors in individuals' behaviour toward using transport services and their possible implications in long-term transport planning is discussed.",2590-1982,Not found
Addressing the emergence of drones – A policy development framework for regional drone transportation systems,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100795,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The climate crisis demands an energy transition away from fossil fuels, and for the transport sector, this implies finding more electric or hydrogen-fuelled solutions. An emerging disruptive solution with high potential for improved sustainability is using drones as a mode of transport, i.e., Advanced Air Mobility for passenger and freight transport in urban and rural areas,fuelled by electricity or green hydrogen. As drones are being rapidly commercialized, there is a need for a policy framework for local and regional actors to address this in decision-making. This paper aims to develop a policy framework through a systematic literature review where findings have been validated by experts from industry and appropriate governance bodies. The results reveal three conceptual elements in the Advanced Air Mobility system where policy actions are needed: 1) primary technology, including vehicle-related aspects; 2) functionality, including infrastructure and operations; and 3) adoption, including the environment, market, and society. The overall lack of a multi-level governance model for Advanced Air Mobility and the scarcity of knowledge of the topic within vital fields such as energy systems and regional planning are also addressed. The findings are discussed in light of regulatory frameworks for drone transportation in Europe. The paper concludes with a policy development framework for regional Advanced Air Mobility deployment and provides policy implications.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring motivating factors and constraints of using and adoption of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs),10.1016/j.trip.2023.100794,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Self-driving vehicles are expected to reduce mobility barriers; however, it is still unclear how individuals will use them and how they will benefit the urban transportation system overall. This research aims to evaluate self-driving technology diffusion by applying and testing a conceptual model that was designed to unpack the possible determinants of the adoption of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The study framework was developed based on the principles of socio-psychological theories of human behavior and investigates the adoption of SAVs by two groups of people: users and non-users. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to analyze the effects of motivational and restriction-related factors on SAV use and adoption, and the results indicated that perceived usefulness and restriction-related factors can positively motivate individuals to use SAVs more frequently. Ultimately, however, their adoption will depend on the public’ attitudes towards technology and as their perceptions of the inherent risks. This study provides new insights into the identification of potential SAV users and non-users and shows how their behavioral intentions differ.",2590-1982,Not found
Mixed fleets of automated and human-driven vehicles in public transport systems: An evaluation of feeder line services,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100791,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This study focuses on the transitioning period of operating mixed fleets of both automated and human-driven vehicles for public transit services. The type of service investigated here is flexible, including elements of both fixed route and on-demand systems. The operation of the mixed fleet is optimized with analytical methods leading to models for optimal service headway and stop spacing for the two types of vehicles. Analytical models for optimal passenger capacity per vehicle and required fleet size for each type of vehicles are also derived. Four operational strategies are considered, referring to whether the two types of vehicles operate jointly or independently in terms of optimal service headway and stop spacing within the mixed fleet. Numerical analyses indicate that automated vehicles operate optimally with less frequent vehicle dispatches and more fixed stop locations compared to human-driven vehicles. They also require greater fleet size and similar passenger capacity per vehicle. The four operational strategies perform similarly in terms of total generalized costs for the input values considered here. However, sensitivity analyses showed that the operational characteristics of the two types of vehicles in a mixed fleet and the performance of the four operational strategies depend significantly on the percentage of total demand that each type of vehicle serves, as well as on the automated vehicles’ speed and in-vehicle travel time cost for users. The mixed fleets represent the transitioning period towards transit fleets of automated vehicles only and it is shown to be the costliest period for both users and operators.",2590-1982,Not found
"Modeling over speeding behavior of vehicles using a random parameter negative binomial approach: A case study of Mumbai, India",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100790,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Over speeding is one of the most common factors contributing to road accidents leading to traffic-related injuries and deaths. Understanding determinants of over speeding behavior is an important step toward enhancing road safety and developing robust intervention strategies. Moreover, there is a need to extend this knowledge with respect to developing countries, where there is a significant variation in the operating speeds of the vehicles owing to the heterogeneous traffic conditions. The present study captured the speeding behavior of the vehicles in Mumbai, India, during the years 2017 and 2018 using roadside observational surveys along with the spatial and temporal attributes of the selected locations. This study investigates the combined effect of temporal and spatial attributes on the over speeding frequency. A random parameter negative binomial model is developed utilizing the observational data to explain the over speeding behavior of the vehicles at the selected count locations. The developed model accounts for unobserved heterogeneity across the over speeding count locations based on temporal, road geometric, and built environment attributes. The study results confirm the presence of heterogeneity in the over speeding behavior of the vehicles at the count locations. In terms of policy implications, results suggest that temporary speed calming strategies could be adopted during the non-peak hours and on weekends. Similarly, deploying speed humps, rumble strips, or adopting law enforcement strategies can circumvent over speeding behavior on arterial roads. Lastly, developing well-connected roads with frequent presence of intersections and traffic signals can be another strategy applicable for such behavior.",2590-1982,Not found
Snow coverage estimation using camera data for automated driving applications,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100766,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"In the U.S., over 38,000 fatalities occur every year due to automotive accidents where 24% of these accidents are attributable to inclement weather. Automated driving systems have shown to decrease up to 21% of potential collisions, however, these systems do not operate in inclement weather. The camera’s reliance on clear lane line detections cease the functionality of the safety systems when occlusions occur due to precipitation. For these systems to become operational during conditions such as snow coverage, therefore leading to a greater impact on safety, new research and development is needed to focus on inclement weather scenarios. This study addresses this need by first collecting a new dataset consisting of raw camera images along arterial roads in Kalamazoo, MI and additionally collecting snow precipitation data from the National Center for Environmental Information. With this data, snow coverage estimation models were developed to automatically determine categories of snow coverage. The models were developed by investigating various machine learning algorithm types, image predictors, and the presence of snow precipitation data. The final model resulted in 95.63% accuracy for categorizing the instance as either none, standard, or heavy snow coverage. These categories are important for future development of purpose-build algorithms that identify drivable regions in various levels of snow coverage for future automated driving systems. The results demonstrate that snow estimation is a near-term achievable task and that the presence weather data improves accuracy. With the addition of snow-coverage estimation, automated driving systems can be developed to react to these different conditions respectively and further reduce the nearly 6,000 annual fatalities caused driving in adverse weather.",2590-1982,Not found
Does the AR-HUD system affect driving behaviour? An eye-tracking experiment study,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100767,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"In recent years, the continuous development of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) has greatly enriched the driving experience, while also occupying the driver’s cognitive resources to varying degrees, causing driving distraction. Therefore, studying the influence of the AR-HUD (Augmented Reality Head-up Display, AR-HUD) system on driving behaviour is of great significance for the in-vehicle information system to manage the complexity of information and enhance driving safety. This experiment applied five typical risky driving scenarios under two lighting conditions (daytime and night), as stimulus materials. The effects of eye movement behaviour and risk reaction time indicators during driving were comprehensively analysed. The experiment results showed that the AR-HUD system can significantly improve the subjects' attention to risky AOIs (Area of Interest, AOI) in night driving situations, as well as reduce the difficulty of processing information in risky driving scenarios, thus reducing cognitive load; In terms of reaction time, the AR-HUD system can significantly reduce the driver's perception time for risky driving scenarios, thus responding to risky situations more quickly. The experiment conclusions verified the role of AR-HUD technology in improving driving safety and driving behaviour, and provide a new direction for the future development of in-vehicle information systems.",2590-1982,Not found
The utility of cognitive testing to predict real world commercial driving risk,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100783,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Background Driving is a complex task which requires numerous cognitive and sensorimotor skills to be performed safely. On-road driver evaluation can identify unsafe drivers but can also be expensive, risky, and time-consuming. Poor performance on off-road measures of cognition and sensorimotor control has been shown to predict on-road performance in privately-licensed light vehicle drivers, but commercial drivers have not yet been studied despite such vehicles generally being larger and heavier, thus increasing risks from unsafe driving. Method Commercially-licensed truck, bus, and light vehicle drivers undertook the tablet-based Vitals cognitive screening tool, which measures reaction time, judgement, memory, and sensorimotor control, and also undertook an on-road driving evaluation using their vehicle. Accuracy and reliability of the Vitals tasks on predicting road test outcomes were investigated using a trichotomous classifier (pass, fail, borderline), and task performance was analyzed depending on vehicle type and road test outcome. Results Performance on the Vitals tasks predicted on-road performance across all vehicle types. Participants who failed their on-road evaluation also demonstrated lower success on the Judgement task, fewer correctly replicated shapes on the Memory task, and less time on-target in the Control task compared to those who passed. Conclusion Performance on cognitive and sensorimotor tasks is a good predictor of future driving performance and driver safety for commercially-licensed drivers. Regardless of vehicle type, stakeholders can use cognitive measures from the Vitals assessment to identify an increased driving risk. Use of the Vitals as a screening tool prior to on-road evaluation can benefit both drivers and evaluators.",2590-1982,Not found
Observed sidewalk autonomous delivery robot interactions with pedestrians and bicyclists,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100789,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The recent deployment of sidewalk autonomous delivery robots (SADRs) across university campuses has offered students, staff, and faculty a convenient option for food delivery to their residences or workplaces. However, these low-speed automated food delivery services, which were first commercially deployed on American campuses in early 2019 and continued to offer an important contactless delivery service during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, traverse campuses on pathways originally designed for pedestrians and bicyclists, creating a potential for conflicts among the different pathway users and potentially unsafe transportation conditions. This study examines one week of field-recorded video from ten locations across the Northern Arizona University campus to help understand the prevalence and severity of SADR-involved interactions with pedestrians and bicyclists. The severity of SADR-involved interactions was quantified by using the surrogate safety measure of post-encroachment time, which was then modeled as a function of conflict- and site-level characteristics to identify predictors of moderate or dangerous conflicts between SADRs and human pathway users. Findings from this study, which provides initial real-world insights into the impacts of SADRs sharing pathways with pedestrians and bicyclists, are intended to help inform facility management strategies capable of supporting the safe introduction of this emerging autonomous freight technology on shared-use facilities in current and potential future settings.",2590-1982,Not found

Identifying, evaluating, benchmarking and prioritising its key indicators is a way to ensure that policy-makers will develop those transport strategies and measures necessary to facilitate a more effective transition to liveable futures. After identifying from the literature and the European Commission (EC) directives the indicators that are underpinning the powerful scheme of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) that each municipality in Europe may implement to elevate the wellbeing of its population, we adopt a Cross Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) approach to assess, contextualise and rank them. Through conducting a qualitative study that involved a narrative literature review and more importantly in-depth discussions with 28 elite participants, each of them with expertise in sustainable development, we are able to designate the Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators (SUMIs) that are the most (and least) impactful. According to our analysis the most powerful indicator is traffic congestion, followed by affordability of public transport for the poorest, energy efficiency, access to mobility service and multimodal integration. This analysis allows us to then match them with the most applicable strategies that may ensure a holistic approach towards supporting in practical terms sustainable mobility in the city level. These are in ranking order: Transit Oriented Development (TOD); public and active transport enhancement; parking policies, vehicle circulation and ownership measures; telecommuting and car-pooling.",2590-1982,Not found
Keeping older people mobile: Autonomous transport services in rural areas,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100778,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Rural areas are characterized by limited access to public transportation. In the absence of alternatives, many older people continue to drive private cars. This imposes risks on society and older people, as traffic risks increase with declining mental and physical health. As opportunities to remain mobile have key relevance for quality of life, this paper investigates attitudes of older people to autonomous transport services (ATS), based on a sample of n = 2,349 respondents living in rural and urban areas in Freiburg, Germany. ATS are not currently available, though they are expected to follow the introduction of automated driving, thus representing a future to alternative to public transport and private car travel. Results show an openness to the use of autonomous transport services for a majority of >65 year olds, though interest declines with age. Neither willingness-to-pay nor waiting times to ATS arrival are likely barriers to adoption. The study concludes that an introduction of ATS that targets older people in rural areas is promising, and will generate social and economic benefits for individuals and society. The transition from private cars to ATS can be supported by mandatory license renewal (fitness) tests. These are welcomed by a large majority of respondents, but not currently required in Germany.",2590-1982,Not found

Although car ownership plays a vital role in social and economic mobility in the US, transportation scholars know little about how low-income households obtain cars. Better understanding the pathways to car ownership can help policymakers and non-government actors design interventions to assist low-income households in acquiring and maintaining cars. Our research contributes to basic social science by illuminating the financial and quality of life effects of obtaining cars through various means. We use an online opt-in survey of adults from lower-income households to examine how and why they acquire cars and the effects of these different pathways to car ownership on finances and quality of life. We identify-five pathways to car ownership. The most common pathway is to acquire a used car from a dealer (38% of our sample), followed by buying a used car informally (24%), purchasing a new car (17%), receiving a car as a gift (15%), and via a move-in with someone who has a car (5%). Respondents most often acquired a car for financial reasons and to increase accessibility. In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic, life events, and built environment factors played a smaller role. Respondents reported that acquiring a car had a positive effect on their lives. Almost 90% of respondents said that acquiring the car was worth it, despite nearly half of the survey respondents experiencing financial hardship related to car ownership, operation, and maintenance.",2590-1982,Not found
Fields of interest and demands for a digital proving ground twin,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100782,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The general understanding among scientists in the field of intelligent vehicles is that physical testing alone is not sufficient to achieve full driving automation in an economically acceptable period. Virtual testing methods are perceived as an effective option to decrease development times and costs for intelligent vehicles. We propose to utilize digital proving ground twins in order to verify the reliability of driving simulations by test replication under real environmental conditions. To investigate this proposal, we conducted a potential users survey to infer specifications for such a digital proving ground twin. The survey shows a consensus among engineers regarding the expected benefit of a digital proving ground twin. Next to the track geometries, environmental conditions, such as adverse weather, were stated as the most important aspect of a digital proving ground twin. Vehicle-in-the-loop, hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop test methods achieved the highest importance rank for applications of the twin. Engineers in the field of automated driving systems and engineers with a work focus on driving simulators expect the highest benefit of it. This article verifies the added value of test track digitalization and provides essential information on how and where to implement virtual simulation infrastructure for transportation system tests. The revealed knowledge can be used to accelerate the development of automated driving systems. Thus, it contributes to a faster reduction of road accidents and emissions. The results are highly relevant to strategists and managers that determine the development of automated driving systems by establishing policies or assigning investment budgets.",2590-1982,Not found
Travel behaviour changes and risk perception during COVID-19: A case study of Malaysia,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100784,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted travel behaviours due to the need for movement restrictions. The restrictions adversely affected various aspects of health and the economy. This study aimed to investigate factors affecting trip frequency during the recovery period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. An online national cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect data in conjunction with different movement restriction policies. The questionnaire includes socio-demographics, experience with COVID-19, risk perception of COVID-19, and trip frequency on several activities during the pandemic. Mann Whitney U was conducted to determine whether there were statistically significant differences between the socio-demographic factors for the respondents in the first and second surveys. Results show no significant difference in socio-demographic factors except for the level of education. The results indicate that the respondents from both surveys were comparable. Next, Spearman correlation analyses were conducted to find significant correlations between trip frequencies toward socio-demographics, experience with COVID-19 and risk perception. There was a correlation between the frequency of travel and risk perception for both surveys. Regression analyses were performed based on the findings to investigate trip frequency determinants during the pandemic. Perceived risk, gender, and occupation influenced the trip frequencies for both surveys. By understanding the influence of risk perception on the frequency of travel, the government can identify the appropriate policy during a pandemic or health emergency to avoid impeding normal travel behaviour.

This study aims to identify the perceptions, attitudes, preferences, and concerns of those who have and have not taken advantage of the AV technology by sharing the results of a self-driving technology demonstration in Arlington, Texas. A two-step approach was employed for this study: (a) quantitative analysis of a self-reported survey of SAV users and non-users who experienced SAVs on the road, and (b) a qualitative study of interviews conducted during the post-implementation phase of the project. The results from an ordinal logistic regression of a self-reported survey showed that the ease of using SAVs because of not having to worry about parking is positively associated with individuals' willingness to use them in the future. In contrast, concerns about possible confusion arising between human drivers and SAVs on the street decrease willingness to use SAVs. A qualitative analysis of interviews conducted on this subject indicated that waiting time, pick-up and drop-off locations, and the ability to make tight turns in intersections are the three major concerns. Potential riders anticipate that SAVs will be more cost-efficient, safer, and environmentally friendly than owner-operated vehicles. This study provides insights into the perceptions and attitudes of SAV users and non-users and identifies strategies for successfully integrating an SAV service with an existing on-demand ridesharing service, thereby enhancing future acceptance of the technology.",2590-1982,Not found
Study on facility location of air taxi skyports using a prescriptive analytics approach,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100761,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The current study identifies infrastructure locations for air taxi operations in New York City (NYC) using a prescriptive analytics approach. Based on the potential air taxi demand estimated by prior studies, 14 unique sites are identified by an unsupervised machine learning technique called clustering large applications (CLARA) in Step-1. However, developing all the suggested stations simultaneously might be challenging for any business, and therefore, an integer programming model is developed in Step-2 to propose opening these centers in multiple phases, considering parameters such as rental cost, daily number of trips, easy access to road facilities, and employee salary, while maximizing the demand satisfaction. Sensitivity analysis is then conducted to identify the impact of various market penetration strategies (such as aggressive, defensive and balanced), inflation in the rental cost and employee salary, and the emergence of latent demand on the phased opening of the facilities. The clustering algorithm results indicate seven air taxi facilities to be established in the Manhattan borough, four in Queens, two in Brooklyn, and one in New Jersey, spread across three phases. Larger vertiports are suggested for airports, such as John F Kennedy and LaGuardia international airports, since they serve approximately 55% of the overall demand.

Escaping the heat: Climate change and visitation to the Lake Tahoe basin,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100779,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The Lake Tahoe Basin of California and Nevada is a popular destination for visitors. As temperatures rise globally, visitation to this climatic refuge is likely to grow. Increased visitation contributes to increases in vehicle miles of travel (VMT), congestion, crashes, emissions, and deteriorating travel experiences at Lake Tahoe, while also contributing to friction between visitors and residents. Policymakers are exploring ways to mitigate these problems, but one key uncertainty to first address is exactly how many visitors are in the Tahoe Basin at a given time and how and where they travel while there. It is also unclear how visitation is influenced by heat in the nearby lower-elevation population centers during the summertime, which is when visitation is the highest. This study thus seeks to 1) quantify day and overnight visitors in the Tahoe Basin, 2) estimate VMT attributable to each group, and 3) model the influence of hot temperatures nearby on visitation and VMT within the Tahoe Basin. We use existing survey data, network GIS analysis, and publicly available weather data to model the relationship between particularly hot conditions and vehicle flow through two of the region’s primary entry points and estimate in-basin VMT attributable to travel through them. We evaluate several ways of defining “hot conditions” nearby and find that between 500 and 1,200 additional vehicles enter the basin at these two points alone, generating an additional in-basin daily VMT of about 12,000 to 33,000 when hot conditions exist.

The motivation of this work is to provide information that might help during the regulatory process of this service by allowing alignment of the offered service characteristics and avoiding mistakes that transportation authorities have incurred in the past with other public regulation processes. The methodology used to assess the QS from the user's perspective consisted of identifying the essential features that encompass the QS vector for the mototaxi. Later, a discrete choice experiment was designed, and a Stated Preferences (SP) survey was conducted to design a Logit model to estimate the weights of the critical factors in the QS vector. This methodology was applied in a study case in a Mexico Valley Metropolitan Zone municipality.

Consumer response to transformative transportation innovations: Advancing the reflexive participant approach to survey research,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100759,18,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Many stakeholders want to predict how consumers will respond to novel technologies and behaviors that enable transitions to low-carbon forms of mobility, energy, and related lifestyle practices. Consumer research is inherently difficult where people lack familiarity and experience. However, much research explicitly or implicitly assumes consumers are well-informed, deliberative decision-makers with defined and stable preferences—which may provide misleading conclusions. As an alternative, we propose the Reflexive Participant Approach (RPA) and offer guidelines for its usage. RPA recognizes that participants may be ignorant of the technology or practice of interest; their evaluations of it may be unformed, changeable, and even difficult to articulate. We provide guidelines for how RPA can shape five components of data collection: elicit participant background, provide deep context, prompt reflexive imagination and experience, elicit response, and follow-up with confirmation and diagnosis of the process and responses. We illustrate these guidelines using examples from published studies on alternative fuel vehicles, conducted at times and in locations when the vast majorities of households had no or little experience with them.

The treatments were sharrows (presence or absence) at a roundabout and widening an on-road bike lane (width 1.2 m or 1.8 m) on a curved mid-block section of the road. Outcomes collected included count (e.g. number of lane excursions) and continuous responses (lane position upon entry into the roundabout, in metres from the curb). A convenience sample of 21 Perth-based participants was recruited between 1 July and 30 September 2021. The results found that the presence of sharrows was not significantly associated with the distance from the left curb when entering a single lane roundabout. However, females rode 0.44 m further from the left curb when entering the roundabout than males, which was significant (95 % CI = 0.02–0.85; p = 0.04). Riders, aged 26–40 years, also rode 0.61 m further from the left curb when entering the roundabout than riders aged 18–25 years, which was also significant (95 % CI = 0.18–1.05; p = 0.01).

We find that some trips have demand that exceed their COVID-19 passenger limit, where the driver must decide between: (1) leaving a passenger without a ride or (2) allowing them on the bus and increasing COVID-19 risk. We consider five alternatives for alleviating overcapacity: allow crowding, additional buses, longer buses as substitutes, Transportation Network Company (TNC) rides, or Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) for passed-by passengers. We use transit ridership and COVID-19 data from the spring of 2020 by combining transportation data and an epidemiological model of COVID-19 stochastically in a Monte Carlo Analysis. Our results show that 4% of county cases were contracted on the bus or from a bus rider, and a disproportionate amount (52%) were from overcapacity trips. The risk of contracting COVID-19 on the bus was low but worth mitigating. A cost–benefit analysis reveals that dispatching AVs or longer buses yield the lowest societal costs of $45 and $46 million, respectively compared to allowing crowding ($59 million).",2590-1982,Not found
On the influence of infrastructure availability on companies decisions toward modal shift and relocation of falicities,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100818,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Purpose Reduced availability of transport infrastructure affects highly dependent global supply chains (SCs), leading to modal shifts in the short term. Since relocation decisions of facilities may result in the long term, this paper evaluates companies’ business decisions in reaction to availability reductions of inland waterway transport (IWT). Methodology A transport model evaluates the impact of reduced infrastructure availability through heuristic optimization based on the Traveling Purchaser Problem. The resulting increase in operational costs is used to assess the probability of relocating facilities based on a Facility Location Problem (FLP) which enables deriving the benefit from infrastructure conditions. Findings The study identifies critical thresholds for infrastructure availability that affect companies’ relocation decisions regarding the maintenance of public infrastructure. The case study exhibits actual critical infrastructure assets. Practical implications Insights into the decisive consequences of companies’ decisions are given, and awareness of the relevance of infrastructure investments on local areas’ attractiveness is raised. The results imply considering public infrastructure investments in maintenance for private business locations. Originality The paper highlights a new way to sustain local industries and connects short-term agility and long-term resilience with companies’ decisions and the exogenous factor infrastructure availability. The applied use case focuses on the barely studied waterway infrastructure that gains importance in light of sustainability and climate change.",2590-1982,Not found
Urban warehouses as good neighbors: Findings from a New York City case study,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100823,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The surge in online shopping has contributed in no small part to the return of warehouses in cities. Urban warehouses allow retail and delivery companies to serve consumer populations faster. They are also a necessary condition for the transition to an urban logistics system that is efficient and sustainable. However, integrating urban warehouses into dense, mixed-use urban areas presents considerable challenges, particularly in coexistence with surrounding communities. This study explores how urban warehouses can become good neighbors, through a case study of New York City. The city has a high e-commerce demand and high population density. In addition, zoning regulation and administration in particular have enabled the development of several warehouses in recent years. The study introduces seven types of practices that can promote the proper integration of warehouses in cities. Scaled from the system (i.e., the city) to the site (i.e., the warehouse), best practices include the following: zoning for innovation as well as nuisance monitoring and mitigation, environmental policy for movement and place, supply chain awareness for citizens/consumers, blocks and buffers for neighborhood design, community conversation, sustainable transportation transition for goods as well as people, and context-sensitive building design.",2590-1982,Not found
Enhancing station level Direct-Demand models with Multi-Scalar accessibility indicators,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100834,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Direct-demand models (DDM) are increasingly being used for a diversity of transit research and practice purposes. Yet few station-level DDM studies have explored the use of composite indicators of metropolitan accessibility in predicting demand. After all, provision of access to metropolitan destinations is one of the main goals of rapid-transit systems. Furthermore, to this author’s knowledge no study has explored potential interactions with local-level accessibility indicators that are typically included in station level transit DDMs. This study explores these possibilities and uses Los Angeles multimodal rapid-transit network as a representative case study of a system that operates in a dispersed agglomeration where multiple sub-centers are linked. Multi-level generalized linear models were implemented where key predictors, including stations' metropolitan- and a local-accessibility indicators are regressed onto average weekday boardings. Furthermore, more general accessibility constructs were developed via EFA and implemented in models; and parameters non-stationarity was assessed via geographically weighted regressions. Results indicate that nodal metropolitan accessibility is a significant predictor of patronage in LA’s rapid-transit network, and that its interaction with local-accessibility amplifies boardings and improves DDM models’ explanatory power. More general constructs of accessibility at metropolitan and local-scale were derived via EFA and these resulted in a more parsimonious model with equal predictive power. Land-use and transit planners would benefit from including an accessibility lens in their DDM modeling. Practical applications of these type of models include TOD scenario planning, comparative route alignment studies, system expansion studies, and for didactic purposes given the ability of accessibility measures to capture land-use/transportation interactions.",2590-1982,Not found
Spatiotemporal trip profiles in public transportation reveal city modular structure,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100840,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Understanding urban mobility patterns within public transportation (PT) systems is key for cities to improve services and promote sustainable mobility. Exploring daily PT riders’ traffic flows using anonymized big data is a first step to analyze when and to where people travel. Nevertheless, assessing the degree to which PT usage patterns correlate with the spatial distribution of points of interest (POI) and subsequently affect the city structure is less attempted. Classic approaches use questionnaires and survey data that are costly and often yielding limited statistical significance. The purpose of this research is to understand associations between travel patterns of urban commuters and the functional organization of a city. To this end, we propose a network-constrained temporal distance measure for modeling PT rider travel patterns from smart card data; and further introduce a fully autonomous approach to describe the span of services available at catchment areas around metro stations. The end result is a detailed analytical prescription of spatiotemporal commuting patterns in the city of Lisbon as well as an analytical contextual information that enables us to understand the functional modular structure of urban facilities. Using the city of Lisbon as the guiding case study, the gathered results confirm the hypothesis that PT rider’s daily flows along the PT network of metro stations reveal a city modular structure.",2590-1982,Not found
Predicting bus ridership based on the weather conditions using deep learning algorithms,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100833,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This study proposes a new approach to predict bus ridership based on the weather conditions while accounting for additional factors such as large events, holidays, and bus cancellations. For this purpose, a deep learning algorithm - multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks - is implemented using smart-card data from the bus network in the Twente Region in the Netherlands. The prediction was carried out under three scenarios: (1) without the weather conditions (base model), (2) with the weather conditions of the same time as the boarding time into buses, and (3) with the weather conditions of an hour ahead of boarding time into buses. The results showed that the application of the MLP is very promising in forecasting bus ridership considering the meteorological parameters. The average errors were improved by 4.9% on weekdays and 2.8% on weekends as a result of including the meteorological parameters in the models. The improvements were even more prominent on weekdays with moderate to extreme weather conditions (for instance, heavy precipitation, strong wind speed, and low temperature). However, the models showed higher errors during the morning peak hours on days with heavy rainfall and strong wind speed.",2590-1982,Not found
Public transport demand estimation by frequency adjustments,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100832,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This article addresses the problem of estimating the demand for public transport from two approaches. First, we propose a bilevel optimization problem that allows estimating the demand using historical data and the observed bus frequencies. This model has been applied to small theoretical networks and the transit network of Tandil (a medium-sized city in Buenos Aires, Argentina), showing good results. However, from a practical point of view, the computation time of the algorithm used to solve the bilevel problem is long, reducing its applicability by traffic authorities. To solve this, we propose to use an artificial neural network module that allows to quickly detect if the change in demand is significant enough (for example, beyond a predefined threshold). If it is substantial, the operator can decide to run the algorithm to estimate the demand and take action to adapt the system to the new reality, for example, adapting vehicle frequencies or incorporating more vehicles into the system so that the current demand can be served. The machine learning approach allows it to be used as a fast change detection tool, avoiding running the expensive algorithm for false positives.",2590-1982,Not found
Prevalence of drowsy driving and modeling its intention: An Indonesian case study,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100824,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Drowsy driving is a common occurrence and a major cause of traffic accidents. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of and the reasons why people engage in drowsy driving and to develop a model of the factors that influence drowsy driving in Indonesia. Two hundred and fifteen respondents voluntarily participated in this study by completing an online questionnaire. The questionnaire, which comprised 36 items, was developed based on the theory of planned behavior and the health belief model. Convenience sampling was utilized to select respondents, as they had to fulfill the requirements of being able to drive and having a driving license for at least one year. The results showed that 79% of respondents had had at least one experience of drowsy driving. In addition, 32% of the respondents had experienced a near-miss accident during drowsy driving. Their reported reasons for drowsy driving were eagerness to arrive at the destination quickly, lack of availability of proper rest areas, and lack of awareness of sleepiness. The demographic characteristics that differentiated drowsy driving behaviors included age, sex, and living area. The factors influencing drowsy driving were attitude, perceived behavioral control, and perceived barriers. The implications of these results are discussed.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring spatial associations between near-miss and police-reported crashes: The Heinrich's law in traffic safety,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100830,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This research explores the spatial association between police-reported crashes and near-miss crashes experienced by community members using the network cross K-function method and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The near-miss crashes were collected from a field survey conducted in Seoul, South Korea, and police-reported crashes in the study area were also collected for comparison. The results show that minor and severe police-reported crashes have statistically significant spatial associations, and near-miss and police-reported crashes also have significant associations. Thus, the Heinrich’s law, which postulates that police-reported minor and severe crashes and near-miss crashes may share underlying locational factors, has merit to apply in traffic safety. These findings indicate that road users’ near-miss crash experiences reflecting local knowledge can supplement police-reported traffic crashes to identifying crash hotspots in road networks and developing safety improvement measures and strategies.",2590-1982,Not found

This study investigated the factors and control beliefs affecting young motorcycle riders’ wrong way driving (WWD) based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework. The control factors underlying the driver’s WWD were elicited again. Young motorcycle riders (average age, 22 years; N = 234) completed a TPB questionnaire measuring direct and belief-based measurement items. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) showed good fits to the observed data and provided qualified support for the utility of TPB and motorcycle riders’ sex in explaining WWD behavior. The findings reveal that subjective norms, attitudes, and perceived behavioral control influence WWD intention among young motorcycle riders. Intention and perceived behavioral control influence WWD behavior. Belief about facilitating circumstances (e.g., riding on the road with a far U-turn opening and riding at night) affects the perceived behavior control. Engineering and enforcement countermeasures (e.g., counterflow lane and automated WWD detection camera) aim to reduce exposure to facilitating circumstances that can decrease the WWD intention and behavior of young motorcycle riders.",2590-1982,Not found

For Women of Colour, this marginalisation may be heightened and help to reinforce often already low cycling rates. This paper is the first to pair hooks’ concept of the ‘oppositional gaze’ with Hall’s theories of representation and reception to explore how dominant discourses around cycling, gender and race shape the experience of UK Women of Colour who cycle. Using go-along interviews with cycling influencers and advocates who are also Women of Colour, it provides space for counternarratives that can challenge dominant discourses about cycling. Borrowing the concept of ‘oppositional gaze,’ we examine the agency of those whose cycling experience is simultaneously shaped by both hypervisibility and invisibility on the road as in the broader cultural and policy contexts. We find that masculine sporty representations in cycling in the UK have material effects on the experience of cycling for women. Women of Colour must constantly negotiate these and other representations that do not fit them easily, sometimes claiming and sometimes challenging aspects of dominant discourses. Despite a small sample size and diverse locations, the insights offered by our research can help policymakers in similar cultural contexts start to build on existing diverse cycling experiences to create more inclusive cycling futures.",2590-1982,Not found
Balancing the efficiency and robustness of traffic operations in signal-free networks,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100821,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Integration of artificial intelligence and wireless communication technologies in Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) enables coordinating the movement of the platoons of CAVs at signal-free intersections. The efficiency of the platoon coordination process can be improved by reducing the spacing between successive platoons to increase capacity; however, such improvement in efficiency can have adverse impacts on the robustness of the coordination process. In this research, we balance the trade-off between the efficiency and robustness of traffic operations in signal-free networks at a macroscopic scale. To this end, we use a rule-based approach to express the process of coordinating CAV platoons at intersections as a set of governing equations that provide an analytical basis to develop a stochastic model for traffic operations. We derive the platoon synchronization success probability for a general distribution of the error in synchronizing the movement of platoons in crossing directions and formulate the expected capacity as a function of the synchronization success probability. We then balance the trade-off between efficiency and robustness at a macroscopic scale by adjusting the average spacing set between successive platoons. In urban networks, adjusting the spacing between successive platoons also changes the vehicular density and consequently the traffic speed. We account for the interrelationship between the traffic speed and inter-platoon spacing in balancing the trade-off between the efficiency and robustness of traffic operations using the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) and extend the stochastic traffic model to the network level. We evaluate the analytical results of the research using a simulation model. The numerical results of the research show that optimizing the system by adjusting the platoon spacing can improve robustness by 13% at the cost of a 4% reduction from the maximum capacity at the network level.",2590-1982,Not found

Nudging travellers to societally favourable routes: The impact of visual communication and emotional responses on decision making,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100829,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"As urbanisation increases, in many places, the transport system is suffering from problems that may affect large parts of the urban population, such as traffic congestion or increased air pollution. In both cases, a better distribution of traffic flows could contribute to establishing a more sustainable transport system, and to improve the situation from a societal point of view. In this paper, we use cartographic symbolisation for communicating favourability of route options for achieving a societal benefit. Since map symbols can evoke different emotional responses in the viewer, we investigate to which extent map symbols evoke positive and negative emotions and whether these influence route choice decision making. We created different cartographic visualisations and designed a user study that investigates the effectiveness and suitability of these different visualisation variants for influencing route choice based on two scenarios: traffic and air quality. Fourteen route maps were prepared using different map symbols to symbolise societally favourable and non-favourable route options. The results of this study show that map symbols can be used effectively for influencing route choice towards choosing the favourable route for the two tested scenarios. While visualisations that modify only lines were more effective in the traffic scenario, area symbol modifications were more effective for the air quality scenario. The symbolisation evoked a wide range of emotions in participants. While non-favourable routes mainly evoke negative emotions (particularly fear), favourable routes mainly evoked positive emotions (particularly contentment) or no emotions. The results further demonstrate that for some of the visualisation variants, emotions felt in response to the map visualisations contributed significantly to changing the route choice decisions in favour of the societally favourable route option. The findings of this research demonstrate the relationship between route choice behaviour and emotional responses elicited by map symbols.",2590-1982,Not found
"Exploring drivers’ interest in different levels of autonomous vehicles: Insights from Java Island, Indonesia",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100820,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The number of people who have adopted autonomous vehicle (AV) technology in developing countries, such as Indonesia, remains considerably lower than in developed countries due to insufficient AV infrastructure and a lack of awareness of AV technology. Since the public’s understanding and perception of AV technology is the main obstacle to AV acceptance, it is important to examine the critical factors that can be correlated with a person’s perception of different AV levels. Despite this, the relationship between an individual’s awareness of AV technology in current vehicles and their perspective toward different levels of AV technology has not been studied in great detail. This study aims to identify the ideal AV level at which autonomous vehicle technology can be deployed in Indonesia by using descriptive statistics to analyze the public’s perspectives toward AV technology across the nation. A survey of 629 respondents, a majority of whom were concentrated on Java Island and used their vehicle on a daily basis, revealed that most respondents preferred the use of level 2 AV technology. These results also revealed the relationship between the respondent’s willingness to use each AV level and several critical demographic factors, such as gender, education, employment, familiarity and previous experience with AV technology, offering insight into the preferences of a wide range of people. The study concludes that AV stakeholders, especially the government, should prepare a realistic strategy to support AV adoption at a higher level of automation. Furthermore, improving the general populace’s awareness and knowledge of AVs is important to increase AV acceptance in Indonesia.",2590-1982,Not found
How do drivers allocate visual attention to vulnerable road users when turning at urban intersections?,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100822,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Introduction Drivers turning at urban intersections pose a high risk to Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as cyclists and pedestrians. In vehicle collisions with VRUs, driver attention misallocation is considered a leading contributor. While previous naturalistic studies have examined driver gaze behaviors at intersections, findings are limited to general gaze directions obtained through video analysis, meaning specific areas to which drivers attend cannot be determined. Method We present a secondary analysis of an on-road instrumented vehicle dataset collected in 2019 which offers eye-tracking and video data from 26 experienced drivers (13 cyclists and 13 non-cyclists). Three coders jointly examined eye-tracking footage from four right-signalized turns (n = 96) to quantify drivers’ glance distributions to various areas of interest, including those most relevant to VRU safety when drivers turn. Individual temporal glance patterns and general attention allocation trends are presented and described. Results (1) Relevant pedestrians were the top objects of glance irrespective of signal status, and (2) at red light turns, driver attention was heavily skewed toward leftward traffic. Conclusions This analysis provides a detailed report of driver glance distributions toward scene-specific areas (as opposed to general directions) at urban intersections and discusses how these patterns may influence VRU safety.

To date, there is very little research on the impact of charging such vehicles on power grids. The following study leverages conventional long-haul truck GPS data to develop an archetypal routing network (ARN) model that can help identify candidate charging infrastructure locations in Ontario, Canada. Results suggest that based on historical LHEV travel patterns, most candidate charging station locations fall along critical road links in Ontario like Highway 401 and Highway 400. Subsequently, the additional electricity demand of these stations is estimated and compared with Ontario’s current electricity demand. Though the charging stations’ aggregate daily demand is smaller than Ontario’s overall demand, some of these stations’ hourly electricity demand during peak hours are great enough to put significant pressure on local infrastructures.",2590-1982,Not found

In New York City, local media have documented that cars outside of law-enforcement offices routinely park on sidewalks and in crosswalks. This study systematically and longitudinally pursues this topic by tracking the geographic extent of this obstructive parking via in-person observation of the streets surrounding all 77 New York Police Department (NYPD) station houses, across all five boroughs. Combined with review of historical street imagery, this approach reveals widespread and longstanding parking on sidewalks, and to a lesser extent, in crosswalks. Of 77 NYPD station houses, 70 (91%) exhibited parking of at least one of these kinds, with sidewalk parking often extending along the entire block (and not simply in front of station houses), on adjacent blocks, and on both sides of the street. This renders many sidewalks impassable – forcing pedestrians into traffic – and in many cases directly abuts residences and businesses, curtailing access to such destinations. Longitudinally, such obstructive parking was present across 82% of 703 street-imagery data points, indicating this has largely become the default (and not occasional) use of adjacent sidewalks. In-person observation also demonstrated other ways this parking has had negative effects surrounding NYPD station houses, including double parking, obstruction of bus and bike lanes, and blocking of fire hydrants. These findings broaden the study of pedestrian accessibility and safety beyond the quality and design of sidewalks and intersections, to include chronic automotive obstruction, and indicate that parking behavior surrounding public-sector offices, if left unchecked, significantly degrades walkability.",2590-1982,Not found

This paper presents a quantification of the impact of this conflict for various possible alternative transport chains. A methodology is presented to evaluate the internal costs, emissions, and external costs of transport and applied to evaluate these parameters for chains having a common origin in Ukraine and destination in a representative major North African port.

We also evaluate the geographic correspondence between truck driving jobs and available alternatives within the same state given research evidence about geographic rigidities in job seekers. We develop two strategies for identifying alternative occupations. One approach suggests that there may not be sufficient job alternatives for a displacement of 35% or more of the truck-driving workforce. The second alternative suggests insufficient job alternatives when displacement levels exceed 50%. Despite these varied pictures, our results present some important trends among job alternatives. Most alternatives were in Job Zones 1 and 2 which require little additional training and/or education for displaced drivers. Unfortunately, the identified alternatives paid lower wages than truck-driving jobs, indicating a potential loss of income. The projected demand for alternative jobs also varied by occupation. Some alternatives are projected to have employment growth, while others are projected to have job losses. Lastly, there were geographic trends in states projected to experience greater losses of driving jobs, and that do not have sufficient alternative jobs for workers. Our findings indicate that this is particularly true for states located in Middle America. Proactive labor policies that are tailored to the regional labor market and available job alternatives will be needed to help truck drivers transition into new occupations. These policies should be particularly mindful of the specific characteristics of the truck-driving workforce.",2590-1982,Not found

The purpose of the study is to understand the pandemic's effects on older adults’ travel purpose and frequency, challenges faced during essential trips, and to identify potential policies to enhance their mobility during future crises. Descriptive analysis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to summarize the changes in employment status, trip purposes, transportation mode usage, and attitude regarding transportation systems before and during the outbreak and after the travel restrictions were lifted. A Natural Language Processing model, Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture, was adopted to open-ended questions due to its advantage in extracting information from short text. The findings show differences between older and younger adults in telework and increased essential-purpose trips (e.g., medical visits) for older adults. The pandemic increased older adults’ concern about health, safety, comfort, prices when choosing travel mode, leading to reduced transit use and walking, increased driving, and limited bike use. To reduce travel burdens and maintain older adults' employment, targeted programs improving digital skills (telework, telehealth, telemedicine) are recommended. Additionally, safe, affordable, and accessible transportation alternatives are necessary to ensure mobility and essential trips for older adults, along with facilitation of walkable communities.",2590-1982,Not found

The study precisely captures the attitude of a rider towards the need for comfort and convenience, safety and security, services and facilities, and riding attraction and quality class of latent variables. 26 of initially considered 41 latent variables clubbed into four latent constructs through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and SEM approach were incorporated in the ICLV analysis. The results explain the riders’ attitude driven choice for comfort and convenience and service and facilities over the safety and security and riding quality aspects of the mode. The shift demand governed by these latent variables helps to develop a methodological framework, which sets up a base for transport system design oriented policies’ implications as future scope of the research.",2590-1982,Not found
A study on road accident prediction and contributing factors using explainable machine learning models: analysis and performance,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100814,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Road accidents are increasing worldwide and are causing millions of deaths each year. They impose significant financial and economic expenses on society. Existing research has mostly studied road accident prediction as a classification problem, which aims to predict whether a traffic accident may happen in the future or not without exploring the underneath relationships between the complicated factors contributing to road accidents. A number of research have been done to date to explore the importance of road accident contributing factors in relation to road accidents and their severity, however, only a few of those research have explored a subset of ensemble ML models and the New Zealand (NZ) road accident dataset. Therefore, in this paper, we have evaluated a set of machine learning (ML) models to predict road accident severity based on the most recent NZ road accident dataset. We have also analysed the predicted results and applied an explainable ML (XML) technique to evaluate the importance of road accident contributing factors. To predict road accidents with different injury severity, this work has considered different ensembles of ML models, like Random Forest (RF), Decision Jungle (DJ), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (L-GBM), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). New Zealand road accident data from 2016 through 2020 obtained from the New Zealand Ministry of Transport is used to perform this study. The comparison results show that RF is the best classifier with 81.45% accuracy, 81.68% precision, 81.42% recall, and 81.04% of F1-Score. Next, we have employed the Shapley value analysis as an XML technique to interpret the RF model performance at global and local levels. While the global level explanation provides the rank of the features’ contribution to severity classification, the local one is for exploring the use of features in the model. Furthermore, the Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) dependence plot is used to investigate the relationship and interaction of the features towards the target variable prediction. Based on the findings, it can be said that the road category and number of vehicles involved in an accident significantly impact injury severity. The identified high-ranked features through SHAP analysis are used to retrain the ML models and measure their performance. The result shows 6%, 5%, and 8%, increase, respectively, in the performances of DJ, AdaBoost, and CatBoost models.",2590-1982,Not found
How does transportation facilitate regional economic development? A heuristic mapping of the literature,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100817,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Despite a growing body of literature, the relationship between transport investment and regional economic development remains elusive. Individual studies highlight certain aspects but neglect others, and yet do not add up to a holistic framework. This paper engages with this gap by developing a holistic conceptual framework based on the synthesis of the literature. A list of variables and relationships were extracted and classified into a broad framework representing common elements of a regional economic system. Then, a causal loop diagram (CLD) was produced as a conceptual model by employing a system dynamics method that captures the interaction of the elements. The conceptual model reveals that the underlying mechanisms of regional economic development represent a complex and dynamic process engaging multiple factors, causalities, and temporal dynamics. Transport investment improves the attractiveness of regions and generates economic activities, reinforcing further investments, thereby fostering regional GDP and urban growth. The conditions of interregional transport infrastructure determine where cities can emerge and grow, and urban transport infrastructure conditions guide how big (population) and wide (area) a city can become. Three additional soft policies (urban transport, urban policies, and institutions and innovation) influence the attractiveness of regions and their economic activities. The time and scales of the policy inputs may produce different outcomes, i.e., city(ies) size and regional GDP, leading to income inequality across regions. We conclude that the generated conceptual model offers a distinct contribution by originally mapping the links between different studies and provides an overarching framework for further explorations.",2590-1982,Not found
Optimal mechanism design of public policies for promoting electromobility: A dynamic programming formulation,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100807,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Electromobility is considered a promising future of road transportation, driving the current industrial and market shift to the era of Electric Vehicles (EVs). As electromobility’s ecosystem depends on electricity generated by the energy sector, decision-makers face the tedious task of enacting policies that alter the transport and energy sectors simultaneously to promote EVs. This paper proposes an Optimal Mechanism Design framework for planning the shift to electromobility from the urban level. The framework fuses concepts of Mechanism Design, optimization methods and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), incorporating all important elements for a comprehensive and sound policy-making procedure, such as market dynamics and the associated financial, social and technological dimensions for the transport and energy sectors. The policies considered incorporate EV promotion incentives, taxation, charging infrastructure, electricity taxation and infrastructure such as power plants and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to support the growing energy needs. Market mechanisms comprise direct links between policy actions and sustainability outcomes. The framework identifies and optimizes these mechanisms to maximize the CBA sustainability indicators. The framework is applied to Nicosia, Cyprus’s capital, where accelerated EV adoption appears to maximize the transport sector's socioenvironmental sustainability and the energy sector's financial sustainability. On the other hand, delayed EV adoption maximizes the energy sector's socioenvironmental sustainability and the transport sector's financial sustainability. Taxation policies are used to limit EV penetration, whilst funding incentives are used to accelerate EV adoption. The results provide decision-makers with a new tool for optimally planning EV adoption using a policy mixture that optimizes financial and socioenvironmental performance.",2590-1982,Not found
Private car ownership in Indonesia: Affecting factors and policy strategies,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100796,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Without transportation demand management, urban development and population growth could lead to an increase in the use of private vehicles. Ultimately, increased internal and inter-city traffic causes numerous transportation and social issues. This study sought to develop strategies to limit car ownership in Bandung, Jakarta, and Surabaya, three of the largest cities in Indonesia, by examining the factors that influence car ownership. We conducted external and internal analyses as the basis for a SWOT analysis for developing policy strategies. The external and internal analyses were conducted to understand the external and internal factors that influence transportation conditions in each city. The external analysis was conducted using two models, (1) binomial logistic regression (BLR) and (2) multiple linear regression (MLR) based on user surveys, while the internal analysis was derived from secondary data such as the cities’ development plans. Based on the binomial logistic regression analysis of 585 responses, we found various factors affecting the tendency of owning a car, such as socioeconomic background, garage capacity, as well as perception and attitude toward cars and neighborhood conditions. The multiple linear regression analysis supported the results of the binomial logistic regression analysis by revealing the relationship between variables that influence the number of cars owned. Based on these influencing factors and secondary data, we then conducted a SWOT analysis to develop a number of policy strategies to reduce car ownership. These strategies were specifically designed for the three respective cities. Cities with similar characteristics, such as the major cities of Southeast Asia, could also implement the same strategy.",2590-1982,Not found
Influence of cognitive processes on driver decision-making in dilemma zone,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100805,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"In the past, research, which addressed driver behaviour in dilemma zone while approaching signalised intersections, did not focus on cognitive processes underlying stop/go decisions and collision risk after yellow-onset. Therefore, a study in a dynamic driving simulator with 20 participants was conducted to examine cognitive processes as basis of decision-making at signalised intersections. The study followed a 2×2 design with repeated measures. First, cognitive processes were triggered by perceptual cues, like the onset of yellow and a car in a leading position. Second, a cognitive distracting secondary task, the drivers had to solve interfered with cognitive processes. The results show, that a car in a leading position increases the probability not to stop after yellow-onset. Furthermore, the cognitive distracting secondary task leads to longer perception-response times (PRT) after yellow-onset, but only if there was no car in a leading position. Additionally, pupillary responses of the drivers during cognitive loading driving conditions are supporting this pattern of results. Finally, the concept of coupled motion is suggested to explain the underlying stop/go pattern of drivers after yellow-onset.",2590-1982,Not found
"Data, AI and governance in MaaS – Leading to sustainable mobility?",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100806,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is regarded as key innovation for sustainable mobility, with data and AI playing a central role. This paper explores the nexus of data-AI-governance in MaaS to understand in how far sustainability is addressed. While the role of data and AI is covered by technical literature, and governance by social science literature, these discussions remain largely separate in MaaS. This paper aims to redress this issue through an interdisciplinary narrative literature review that brings together these literature sets. The research question is: How does the data-AI-governance nexus in MaaS give rise to hybrid forms of governance between humans and algorithms and what are the implications for sustainable mobility? Results show that: (1) The data collection and processing that is crucial to MaaS, might reproduce socio-political inequalities. (2) AI-driven customisation and nudging of end-user demand ignores rebound effects, that can only be avoided if sustainability objectives are central. (3) Inadequate integration of mobility service supply might exacerbate mobility challenges. (4) When mobility system optimisation through AI becomes more widespread, MaaS platforms might become a form of algorithmic governance. (5) Whether sustainability can be reached, depends on how and by whom (sustainability) objectives of algorithms will be decided. The paper concludes that hybrid governance for sustainability requires close collaboration between policymakers and industry players and acknowledging AI algorithms as important non-human actors. The paper contributes to conceptual debates on sustainability and data/AI, governance and data/AI in MaaS and beyond, and to policymaking on aligning platform systems with sustainability.",2590-1982,Not found
Behaviors of pedestrians on streets with roadside strips,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100799,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Pedestrian behaviors in natural settings have been investigated mainly on roads with sidewalks or the corridors outside or inside buildings. The present study examined pedestrian behaviors on roads with roadside strips, which are popular in Japanese local areas. The purpose of the study was to investigate pedestrian behaviors and the factors affecting them. Observations were made at two single-lane streets in Tokyo with 0.9 m and 0.5 m roadside strips. A total of 2,476 pedestrians were observed for 2 days (1 weekday, 1 weekend day) in each location. Walking with traffic was more popular (61%) than walking against traffic. People seemed to walk either side of the street depending on their turn direction at the forward intersection. Illegal behavior of walking into the roadway was also observed in 46% of pedestrians. This behavior was more likely to appear on the streets with narrower roadside strips and when people walked in a group. As expected, males, young and mature adults, and single pedestrians walked faster than females, children and senior adults, and pedestrians in a group. When a female and a male walked abreast, males tended to reduce their walking speed considerably and walk on the roadway side (62%), taking care of females. Similar positional consideration for a vulnerable partner was also found in parent–child pairs. It was concluded that people are likely to violate traffic law if the violation serves a purpose, and they tend to behave altruistically towards others, even if there is no relevant rule.",2590-1982,Not found
The overlooked transport project planning process — What happens before selecting the Locally Preferred Alternative?,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100809,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This study investigates the transport investment decision process of judging the robustness and viability of the selected option compared with the rejected alternatives. This paper adopted the Ridership to Cost Ratio (RCR), that is analogous to the Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) and contrasts the unit cost at which the proposed transit alternative can serve one additional transit patron, as the primary measure of assessing the relative advantage of alternatives. We found that on average the ‘do-minimum’ option generates a Ridership to Cost Ratio (RCR) nine times higher than the Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA), and the average RCR produced by the second-best alternative is 86% higher than that of the LPA, indicating substantial opportunity costs of rejecting more economical course of action which could have likely managed prospective demand at much lower costs and delivered more services for more people at the same budgetary outlay. Second, we observed that the primary factor differentiating build alternatives is route alignment. However, ridership estimates for alternatives with different routes show narrow differences, raising concerns about whether the existing user benefit assessment framework can fully exploit potential values credited to each alternative option. Third, the number of alternatives considered in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement has gradually declined across the past three decades, informing that the identified transport problems are prone to be approached from confined terms of reference. Last, most projects only compared the preferred light rail mode against the traditional bus mode in the Transportation Systems Management (TSM) base option, attesting to concerns about selection bias and discrimination in early-stage appraisal and decision-making.",2590-1982,Not found
The role and potential of trusted change agents and freight demand management in mitigating “Panic Buying” shortages,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100792,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The goal of this research is to help develop effective freight demand management (FDM) programs to reduce the amounts of “panic buying” purchases. Such programs are indispensable because, as explained in the paper, in “panic buying” environments, supply chains are frequently unable to rapidly increase the amounts of critical supplies delivered to points of sales. Thus, reducing the demand is the only option to mitigate shortages. To reach this goal, this research assesses the potential of a novel FDM initiative that relies on Trusted Change Agents (TCAs) to convince individuals to limit their purchases of critical supplies, and outlines a comprehensive FDM program with initiatives spanning the entire disaster management cycle. The research: analyzes survey data to gain insight into the reasons people participate in “panic buying;” establishes that the term “panic buying” is a misnomer—as the instances of true “panic” are extremely rare—and suggests the term “Disaster Related Buying Behaviors” (DRBBs)” to better describe the phenomena; creates a data-driven taxonomy of objectives and motivating reasons for DRBBs; estimates a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to assess the strengths of the interconnections between reasons, themes, and objectives pursued by individuals who enact DRBBs; assesses the impacts of TCA appeals; identifies the initiatives needed, together with the timing and sequencing, to be conducted at the various stages of the disaster management cycle; identifies the stakeholders that ought to be involved in the executions of these initiatives; and puts these elements together to outline a comprehensive FDM program.",2590-1982,Not found
Post-pandemic travel patterns of remote tech workers,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100804,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Almost half of all jobs in the San Francisco Bay Area are “remote-eligible” – more than any other metropolitan area in the United States, due to the high concentration of employees in the technology sector who were early to embrace teleworking at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Any significant share of these tech workers staying remote may have profound long-term impacts on aggregate travel patterns in the region. This research seeks to predict the magnitude of these impacts and derive insights about the newly learned behaviors of tech workers, as indicative of remote-eligible workers in general. A survey of over 660 tech workers ran from November 2021 to March 2022, asking about participants’ employers and remote work policies, commute details and mode preferences, non-work trips, and interest in relocation. Respondents expected employer-driven hybrid arrangements of 2–3 days per week in the office after the pandemic, which in turn dictated the number of predicted future commuting trips and suppressed interest in relocation. Though almost half of respondents expressed interest in moving, they only planned to move a median of 20.93 miles – staying within the region but shifting away from their offices and towards less dense and more automobile-oriented suburban neighborhoods. Additionally, those moving more than ten miles from their office are likely to switch to less sustainable travel modes. On the other hand, robust observed retention of online shopping habits for groceries and food delivery may mitigate the added vehicle trips caused by rebound effects.",2590-1982,Not found
Travel route planning method to avoid epidemic hot-spots in the post-epidemic era,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100802,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The Chinese government adhered to the “dynamic clearance” epidemic prevention strategy from August 2021 to December 7, 2022, during the post-epidemic era (this study started in March 2022 and ended in September 2022). People are gradually resuming their daily routines, and demand for travel is rising again. Nonetheless, the epidemic occasionally breaks out on a smaller scale, causing social concern. As a social reaction, the essential issue is how to avoid COVID-19 hot-spots effectively by offering secure travel options for local residents who tend to travel privately. Two travel route planning models are proposed to avoid COVID-19 hot-spots based on the invalid road sections which are affected by epidemic. Specifically, the static model aims at generating the shortest travel distance after detours, with the constraint of avoiding COVID-19 hot-spots; the dynamic model takes real-time data into account, which includes epidemic risk levels, road grades, and real-time traffic information on road selection. Shenzhen, China, is illustrated as an example of the research area in this paper. To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the suggested approaches, data regarding the road network, the prevalence of epidemics, and traffic congestion are collected. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) the proposed two route planning models can effectively bypass areas with high levels of epidemic risk. 2) The static route planning model increases the travel distance by 12.24% and 13.03%, while the dynamic route planning model increases the travel distance by 24.33% and 27.69% compared with the conventional shortest route, given the same origin and destination and the same impact radii of the COVID-19 hot-spots (300 and 500 m respectively). When taking detour routes to avoid COVID-19 hot-spots, the average increase in trip distance does not surpass 50%, which is acceptable psychologically for travelers. 3) The static travel route planning model is suitable for the severe epidemic situation for it can strictly avoid the epidemic hot-spots; The dynamic travel route planning model is applicable to the situation where the epidemic situation is relatively mild. Ultimately, the route planning models can be utilized to develop a framework to provide travelers with detour options, which would make a practical difference to ensure travelers’ safety during traveling and contribute to preventing the spread of the epidemic.",2590-1982,Not found
Application of hybrid support vector Machine models in analysis of work zone crash injury severity,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100801,19,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Crash severity models are often used to analyze the adverse effects of highway work zones on traffic safety. In this study we evaluated application of hybrid support vector machine (SVM) and hyperparameter optimization models for improved accuracy of crash severity prediction. Two hybrid models were evaluated: a genetic algorithm-optimized SVM (GA-SVM) and greedy-search optimized SVM (GS-SVM) models. The dataset used in model development and testing contained 12,198 work-zone crash observations in New Jersey over three years, from 2016 to 2018. The results indicate that the GA-SVM model outperformed both GS-SVM and the SVM with default parameters in predicting the severity of work zone crashes. While GA-SVM provided the best accuracy, it had the highest computation time. Among more than dozen factors considered in the models, the findings suggest that crash type and posted speed limit were the most significant for estimation or prediction of work-zone crash severity. The modeling approach and methods demonstrated in this study can improve the accuracy of crash prediction models. Also, a two-stage sensitivity analysis was conducted to see the impact of associated factors based on the probability of crash severity in work zones. The key findings revealed that early morning, nighttime, rainy environmental condition, rear-end crashes, a roadway with no median, and a higher posted speed limit increased the likelihood of injury and fatality in the work zone areas. This improvement will in turn lead to better informed decisions about planning and implementing work zone safety enhancements aimed at reducing severity of crashes.",2590-1982,Not found

Next, routes are ranked according to the risk value and classified by a 5-level scale, to show the (parts of) routes with the highest risk of evasion. Results show the capability of this framework on about 20,000 real-world data records gathered by a mid-sized Italian bus company through fare inspection logs and passenger surveys.

Understanding children's cycling route selection through spatial trajectory data mining,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100855,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"A sustainable alternative transportation mode to address growing transportation and environmental stress is cycling, which is eco-friendly and healthy for humans. Improving the quality of the bicycling experience is crucial for increasing bicycle use. Good bicycling experience is more critical for child bicyclists because they are less experienced and need more space for error. Therefore, a scientific assessment of child bicyclist perception of selected route safety, comfort, and environment is of great interest. Finding an effective way to learn child bicyclist behavior and help them reduce cycling risk is necessary. In response to this need, we utilize a data mining model to develop a methodology for measuring children's bicycling route safety conditions by evaluating multiple road safety-related features. The proposed method uses a set of route features representing the situation of street environments extracted from state data and first-hand children’s bicycle trajectory data collected using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) from volunteer children bicyclists. A random forest (RF), a well-known classifier, is adopted to predict child bicyclists' behavior. We extract the different route segments between children’s selected routes and the shortest path to learn the child bicyclists' behavior and use the selected best features to interpret their changing cycling behavior. The result shows that children bicyclists' behavior could be analyzed by giving trajectory and nearby road safety situation data. Our model achieves a promising accuracy with an average rate of 92% over multiple scenarios, demonstrating the proposed method's feasibility and the effectiveness of selected features. In addition, we compare our feature effectiveness with the state's generated road safety score data to evaluate the feature robustness. Our features outperform the safety score feature with an average of 10% improvement in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, our method proposes a model framework that can be applied to different study regions and adult bicycling behavior learning.",2590-1982,Not found
Characterization of the state of the traffic signs focused on cyclists in Bogotá,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100837,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Introduction Traffic signs can be functional if they are visible and legible, especially when they alert about grave hazards to vulnerable road users such as cyclists. However, what is the current state of traffic signs directed at cyclists? This knowledge is essential for road infrastructure, especially in a city like Bogotá, which presents growing mobility challenges for cyclists. This paper aims to characterize the state of the signs directed at cyclists in Bogotá and evaluate the conformity level according to current guidelines. Methods A reliable method was developed to evaluate existing signs. The method assesses the physical and functional characteristics of signs to verify if they are adequate from the human factors perspective and if they facilitate perception, are obeyed, and conform regarding dimensions, location, and function. With the method, an observational study was applied to characterize and evaluate signs in urban public spaces. Results Eighty traffic signs were characterized in ten high-risk sectors for cyclists in Bogotá. Fifty-five percent of the signs are not in good condition, and often damaged; 18% are not coherent with the environment. Thirty-eight percent do not comply with the appropriate board size. The “Get off the bike” sign has the highest violation rate. Conclusion Traffic signs aimed at cyclists present problems focused on compatibility with guidelines and compliance by cyclists. The observation indicates no effective maintenance plans. The coherence problems indicate insufficient infrastructure design planning.

An AV-MV negotiation method based on synchronous prompt information on a multi-vehicle bottleneck road,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100845,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Bottleneck roads with narrowed width often only allow one vehicle to pass at once. In this situation, human drivers need to negotiate their right-of-way via, e.g., hand gestures and eye contact. However, when a human-driven vehicle (MV) confronts a driver-less automated vehicle (AV), explicit communication between drivers is no longer possible. External human–machine interfaces (eHMIs) on AVs may facilitate communication in unobscured situations, but MV-drivers can fail to perceive the eHMI information on the AV with other vehicles in front of the AV, blocking the MV’s view. Even if the visibility is not impaired, AV broadcast communications do not target on specific receivers, it is not unlikely that other vehicles may wrongly perceive this information. Instead, an internal human–machine interface (iHMI) can uni-cast the AV intention to MVs since the information on iHMIs is direct to MV-drivers and visible in visibility-blocked situations. However, iHMIs require vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology, and the conveyed information might not be highly trusted as the information is transmitted to MVs rather than being seen directly from AVs. Therefore, this paper proposes a synchronous iHMI+eHMI method for a more unambiguous communication in this multi-vehicle bottleneck road situation. The designed iHMI+eHMI is compared with the baseline i.e., without HMI, iHMI, and eHMI in a video-based driving simulation by subjective evaluations from structured questionnaires. The results (N=24) indicate that HMIs (iHMI, eHMI, and iHMI+eHMI) are more helpful than vehicles without any HMI for the AV-MV communication, and iHMI+eHMI achieves the best performance when the views of MV-drivers are obscured.",2590-1982,Not found
Forwarding containers to dry ports in congested logistic networks,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100846,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This work investigates the impact of container arrival flow rate on the port surrounding network and proposes a mixed integer programming model to optimize their forwarding towards dry port destinations.

The aim is to give a decision support for operational planning with limited capacity of both the terminal yard and the logistic network, with respect to the quantity of containers transferred per time unit. The model considers time dependent costs and traveling times to reduce congestion. As a further novel issue of the model, arc costs and traveling times change during specific time slots. More precisely, new linear functions are derived as tangents to the nonlinear convex components of a classical traveling time function proposed in the literature. The aim is to produce a light model which can be effectively used for macro planning of forwarding operations. The model is proved to be fast in real case instances also if compared to classical literature approaches. The model is used to study the container dispatching process in a terminal which is going to be the main Italian container terminal equipped to manage mega-ship traffic.

Also, acts as an assignment of demand to the network following the stochastic user equilibrium approach by using the Frank–Wolfe algorithm. Whereas, the upper level of the model maximizes the production of newly generated demand incorporating inequity constraints. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the multi-objective fitness function yielded from the bi-level optimization model by application of the model on a real transportation network of the city of Genoa, Italy.",2590-1982,Not found
Uncovering the spatio-temporal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on shared e-scooter usage: A spatial panel model,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100843,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This study examines the spatio-temporal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on shared e-scooter usage by leveraging two years (2019 and 2020) of daily shared micromobility data from Austin, Texas. We employed a series of random effects spatial-autoregressive model with a spatially autocorrelated error (SAC) to examine the differences and similarities in determinants of e-scooter usage during regular and pandemic periods and to identify factors contributing to the changesin e-scooter use during the Pandemic. Model results provided strong evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the e-scooter trip data and found a spatial negative spillover effect in the 2020 model. The key findings are: i) while the daily e-scooter trips reduced, the average trip distance and the average trip duration increased during the Pandemic; ii) the central part of Austin city experienced a major decrease in e-scooter usage during the Pandemic compared to other parts of Austin; iii) areas with low median income and higher number of available e-scooter devices experienced a smaller decrease in daily total e-scooter trips, trip distance, and trip duration during the Pandemic while the opposite result was found in areas with higher public transportation services. The results of this study provide policymakers with a timely understanding of the changes in shared e-scooter usage during the Pandemic, which can help redesign and revive the shared micromobility market in the post-pandemic era.",2590-1982,Not found
Comparison of travel attitude study methods using online tools: The case of understanding public acceptance of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100847,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"With the growing penetration of mobile phones, mobile apps and media platforms offer new ways to conduct travel-related research. The aim of this study is to compare two pairs of quantitative and qualitative research methods that leverage these tools: (1) an online survey versus a mobile chatbot interaction, and (2) an online focus group discussion over a live video conference versus a moderated discussion over a mobile messaging application. As a case study, we investigate the public acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) for public transit in Singapore. 320 participants answered the same five research questions posed across the four methods, which were carried out over the first half of 2021. Across all methods, it was consistently found that there was cautious excitement about shared AVs in Singapore. Nevertheless, there were concerns about the safety of AV technology and uncertainty of how AVs will be implemented in practice. Compared to more conventional tools, the advantages of using mobile messaging apps to conduct travel-related studies are their low cost, scalability, and ease of analyzing resultant data. However, it was more challenging to recruit participants, mainly due to unfamiliarity, uncertainty of time requirements and a need to install the prerequisite mobile app. In chat groups, there was an observed lack of group interaction between participants. Overall, we found that while chatbots and chat groups hosted on mobile messaging apps were potential alternatives to surveys and focus groups to widen participation, there are still some inherent limitations to be overcome.",2590-1982,Not found
Demonstration of virtual reality simulation as a tool for understanding and evaluating pedestrian safety and perception at midblock crossings,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100844,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Recent advancements of virtual reality (VR) technology (such as the HTC Vive or Oculus Quest) have opened the door for lower cost and lower risk methods to study pedestrians’ behavior and perception of safety, offering a higher degree of data resolution and level of realism compared to previous pedestrian simulators. This research aims to address the lack of research conducted to compare pedestrian midblock crossing behavior within VR simulators against naturalistic, real-world behavior, as well as provide a low-risk framework for conducting these analyses. In addition to comparing pedestrian crossing speeds and gap acceptance in the replica virtual environment, post-experiment questionnaires also asked participants about their perception of realism in the virtual environment. Chi-squared analysis showed no statistically significant differences in the gap acceptance distribution nor median accepted gap size (real-world = 8.05sec, VR = 8.20sec, p = 0.358), indicating similar gap size acceptance between environments. Logistic regression analysis showed similarity with respect to the rate at which participants’ decision to cross or not changes, indicating consistent and naturalistic decision-making processes between the environments. Furthermore, experiment results showed no significant difference in the means (real-world = 3.32mph, VR = 3.52mph, p = 0.138) and medians of crossing speeds (real-world = 3.28mph, VR = 3.43mph, p = 0.358) in either environment and no difference in crossing speed variance. Additionally, survey results showed that subjects felt their sense of movement and risk inside the simulator were realistic and reported high levels of immersion. Through the use of a low-risk and time-efficient study framework, this paper demonstrates the efficacy of VR simulation for use in replicating naturalistic pedestrian crossing behavior in immersive virtual environments modeled after real-world locations.",2590-1982,Not found
Assessing the effects of road geometry and fidelity on driver behaviour in driving simulator experiments,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100835,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The paper presents a set of programs created specifically to investigate the driver’s behaviour along a road circuit when the driving simulation scenario changes in the quantity and quality of the displayed Level of Details (LOD) (fidelity), as well as when the road curvature ratio (geometry) varies. In the experiments, carried out on a sample of 29 drivers who drove on the same circuit twice, data on vehicle features (speed, trajectory, and gas pedal usage), physiological factors of the drivers (SC, skin conductance), and information from an eye-tracking equipment (gaze) were collected. The programs used in this study are designed to study the complex and position-based information present in the data that cannot be analysed by classical statistical methods. The results are twofold. On one side, they show the applicability and usefulness of the proposed functions, which are capable of extracting information and referring it to a specific point in the circuit. On the other side, they give effective insights on driving behaviour. When driving is more demanding (i.e., along curvilinear stretches), variations between different scenarios are nearly non-existent, and the effect of geometry changes greatly depending on the signal being investigated (speed, trajectory, gas pedal, gaze, skin conductance). The effects of vehicle speed are essentially the same for all drivers and are closely tied to the geometry of the road. Trajectory and gas-pedal usage signals exhibit diverse effects on drivers, indicating that their choice of trajectory and frequency of gas-pedal usage is undoubtedly influenced by their driving style as well as by geometry. Skin conductance appears to be significantly altered where driving is more challenging, but it varies greatly from driver to driver. The results of gaze analysis also demonstrate that the driver’s behaviour strongly depends on geometry and much less on LOD and loop sequence.",2590-1982,Not found
The expression of anger while driving – The role of personality and self-consciousness in a sample of Chinese drivers,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100838,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Driving anger among Chinese drivers is common leading to aggressive and risky driving behaviours and potentially increasing involvement in road collisions. This study adopted an online survey to explore the relationship between personality, self-consciousness and driving anger expression. 559 participants completed a questionnaire consisting of the Driving Anger Scale (14-item DAS), the short version of the Driving Anger Expression Inventory (15 item DAX), the Brief HEXACO Inventory (BHI), and the Self-Consciousness Scale (SCS). A Confirmatory Factor Analysis yielded a reliable and valid three-factor structure of the Chinese 15 item DAX, labelled as “Adaptive Expression”, “Verbal Expression” and “Physical and Vehicle Expression”. Physical and Vehicle expression of anger was reported more by males and by experienced drivers compared to females and novice drivers. Traffic offenders showed more inclination towards exhibiting verbal anger expression than non-traffic offenders. In terms of dispositional traits, Humility-Honesty had a negative effect on both verbal expression and physical and vehicle expression. However, private self-consciousness was related to an increase in verbal expression and physical and vehicle expression. Importantly, Humility-Honesty and private self-consciousness moderated the relationship between trait driving anger and non-adaptive anger expressions in opposite ways. The findings could provide some support for the development of strategies to mitigate driving anger in China.",2590-1982,Not found

Information derived from proposed treatments enables planners to make comparisons between the expected savings from crash reductions and associated treatment costs. This review aims to provide direction to agencies and practitioners interested in estimating safety effectiveness. Specifically, this study discusses the main methods for developing CMFs, including an overview of each method, data considerations, and their strengths and weaknesses. It also discusses the techniques of estimating combined CMFs resulting from multiple safety treatments. The review showed that observational Before–After (BA) studies with the Empirical Bayes (EB) and Full Bayes (FB) approaches provide enhanced consistency and precision for the estimated safety effectiveness. Alternatively, the cross-sectional method can be adopted in cases where observational BA studies are not practical due to data restrictions. Five additional techniques for estimating combined CMFs were also reviewed. The study notes that while there has been substantial research in the broad area, few studies have reported comparative methods of combined CMF estimation.

GIS-based spatiotemporal analysis for road traffic crashes; in support of sustainable transportation Planning,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100836,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Road traffic crashes pose a significant challenge worldwide, necessitating increased efforts to reduce them and promote sustainable transport systems. This study aimed to investigate spatiotemporal road traffic crashes and their causes in the State of Qatar by identifying hot spots of crashs and exploring whether they were primiarly attributed to behavioural practices and/or the geometrical design of roads and intersections. The study employed various methods, including Time-Space Cube analysis, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Emerging Hot Spot analysis, and Spatial Autocorrelation analysis, with historical traffic crash data from 2015 and 2019. The findings indicated that crashes were mainly concentrated in the central-eastern region of Qatar and are related to driver behaviour. The analysis also revealed that crashes during the weekdays in 2019 were more strongly clustered than in 2015, suggesting a probable systematic cause of crashes. The results provide valuable information for policymakers to target high-incidence locations, prioritize interventions and develop more effective measures and policies to reduce crashs and promote a sustainable transportation system in Qatar. Overall, this study highlights the importance of continued research and policy development in this area and could potentially be applicable and transferable to similar regions.",2590-1982,Not found
Compliance to eco-riding recommendations on an E-scooter: Effects on energy consumption and user acceptance,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100831,20,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Eco-riding assistance systems on electrified powered two-wheelers aim at decreasing energy consumption. However, the efficiency of such systems depends on the riders’ behavior. Therefore, the present paper evaluates an eco-riding assistance system giving recommendations for regenerative braking, coasting, and sailing regarding compliance, transfer effects, energy consumption, and acceptance. N = 31 participants had to complete a test course including highway, rural roads, and urban riding in a purpose-built E-scooter simulator. A between-subjects study design with three groups was chosen to determine possible effects: (1) Control condition without any assistance; (2) Basic condition with recommendations triggered by vehicle- or map-based data; (3) Comprehensive condition with recommendations based on vehicle-, map-, and Vehicle-to-everything (V2X)-based data. Due to the multitude of sensors, the comprehensive condition received more recommendations than the basic condition. The riders of the basic and comprehensive condition received no recommendations on the last section of the test course to assess possible transfer effects. Riders with assistance ride slower and sail more often than the control group. This is valid also for sections without riding recommendations. Overall, the riders with assistance have a lower energy consumption on sections with coasting recommendations (Basic condition: 18.2 % less energy consumption; Comprehensive condition: 12.8 %) and on sections without any eco-riding assistance (Basic condition: 9.5 %; Comprehensive condition: 8.2 %). The frequency of recommendations has no effect on the efficiency as the basic condition and the comprehensive condition show comparable riding behavior and do not differ regarding energy consumption. Finally, all the participants rate all three recommendation types as positive. Altogether, the results endorse the benefit of eco-riding assistance for electrified powered two-wheelers concerning energy efficiency and provide indications for the design of such systems.",2590-1982,Not found

Therefore, this study explores the role of such factors as personality traits (introversion/extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism), driver's risky behavior, driver's attitude, sensitivity to reward/punishment, and demographic characteristics of drivers involved in road traffic crashes. 425 Iranian motorists completed a comprehensive questionnaire package which included the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Sensitivity to Punishment and Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ), Manchester Driving Behavior Questionnaire (MDBQ), and items on safety attitude, and drivers’ demographic characteristics. Structural equation model results indicated that introversion, sensitivity to punishment, (safe) attitudes towards safety, (safe) driving behavior, age, and driving experience correlate with lower crash frequency (lower reported crash history). In contrast, extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, and sensitivity to reward were factors related to higher reported crash history. This study further informs our understanding of the factors that contribute to higher crash risk among Iranian drivers, and may therefore assist the development of interventions to reduce road crashes.",2590-1982,Not found
Expanding the VBN theory on succeeding the transportation demand management policies,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100903,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"The growth of the car fleet has caused many problems, such as environmental problems, uncontrolled energy consumption, and traffic congestion. To resolve the issues caused by transport-related activities, transportation planners should implement policies that reduce car use and move forward to sustainable transportation. The prerequisite of the efficiency of the policies that reduce car use is the acceptance of them by the entire community members. Previously a few studies have tested individuals’ environmental attitudes using the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory. This research aims to analyze and examine car use reduction policy using a comprehensive VBN and Norm-Activation-model (NAM) theories to consider more variables and provide a model with more analytical capability. To address this issue, 500 questionnaires were filled by travelers’ in Tehran, Iran, in the restricted traffic area to describe their behavior. The result shows that the biospheric value significantly affects car use reduction policy, associated with considerable environmental concerns. Besides, it was found that a high ascription of responsibility (A.R.) appeared as the strongest predictor of the policy. The findings have represented initial support for the VBN theory and revealed that the theory could explain the car use reduction policy’s Intention, according to Tehran’s respondents’ environmental behavior. This study’s findings can assist policymakers in adopting appropriate policies to reduce car use based on environmental advantages and could target biospheric values and ascription of responsibilities.",2590-1982,Not found
Freight trip distribution using spatiotemporal aggregate data: A modified collective flow diffusion model-based approach,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100904,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"The estimation of freight trip distribution is an important issue in freight transport studies, and collecting data on the spatiotemporal aggregated number of freight vehicles without trip information is relatively easy and inexpensive. In this paper, we propose a new model for freight distribution estimation, referred to as “TripCFDM.” Unlike the traditional collective flow diffusion model (CFDM), which solely relies on aggregate data, TripCFDM relies on aggregate data along with a small amount of trip data. CFDM estimates the probability of latent zonal freight trips based on aggregate data corresponding to the number of vehicles in each zone and time step. The use of the aggregate and small amounts of trip data ensures a realistic data acquisition environment. Our model is applied to freight trips in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area using the National Survey of Roads and Streets Traffic Conditions (Road Traffic Census). The results reveal that TripCFDM yields a significant improvement in the estimated probability compared with CFDM, particularly for intrazonal freight trips. However, the estimation results of interzonal trips obtained by CFDM and TripCFDM tend to be similar, suggesting that CFDM alone may be adequate to estimate the probability of interzonal trips with a sufficient degree of accuracy; nevertheless, TripCFDM is a better method for freight trip distribution estimation, including for intrazonal trips. The results of CFDM are not significantly affected by the time steps in the input data, whereas TripCFDM can yield higher accuracies with longer time steps. Regarding the number of zones and zone size, sufficient zone aggregation may be effective in improving the estimation accuracy because a detailed zonal division leads to a small probability of origin–destination trips with extensive computations. Based on this modified CFDM approach, origin and destination matrices for freight transport can be generated without large-scale surveys.",2590-1982,Not found
Learning not blaming: Investigating ten fatal road traffic collisions using STAMP-CAST,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100912,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"There have been strong calls in the research literature for the adoption of system-based approaches to further reduce road casualties. However, person-based approaches remain at the forefront of both national and local-level decision-making around road safety in the UK. Focusing on person-based approaches inhibits learning across the system. Practical examples are needed to support adoption of system-based approaches and ensure safety learning is maximised within the industry. This study builds on previous work (Staton et al., 2022) mapping the control structure for the municipal area of Cambridgeshire, UK. It utilizes a system-based accident investigation method: Causal Analysis based on System Theory (CAST) (Leveson, 2019). The method is based on Rasmussen’s Risk Management Framework and is used to identify weaknesses in the control structure across the entire sociotechnical system. This supports understanding why the collision occurred and prevention of similar future events, rather than apportioning blame. In the study, CAST is used to investigate a random sample of ten fatal collisions that occurred in Cambridgeshire between 2018 and 2020. The investigations were conducted retrospectively using police forensic collision investigation files that had already concluded crown or coroner’s court proceedings. Across all ten collisions investigated, 21 different types of actor were identified across all levels of the system, each of whom played some role in at least one of the collisions. As a result, 49 specific recommendations are made concerning these actor’s roles in preventing future road deaths and serious injuries. In addition, 11 system-wide recommendations are made relating to communication and coordination; the safety information system; safety culture; design of the safety management system; changes and dynamics over time; and economic factors in the system environment. This study demonstrates that the CAST method is a viable tool for learning in the road safety industry and provides a taxonomy of system hazards, alongside the system control structure from Staton et al. (2022), to support any future analysis using this method. The use of CAST identifies the importance of controls within the road transport system and that currently, despite having one of the best road safety records in the world, the existing controls in place in the UK are insufficient to prevent serious injury and death occurring daily and are in danger of being eroded further through a political agenda of deregulation. This study reinforces that road safety requires system-based approaches and the strength of the CAST method in identifying system-wide recommendations which can be used in support of a Safe System approach to provide recommendations across the Safe System pillars.",2590-1982,Not found
The impact of COVID-19 on Canadian restaurant operations and the likelihood of pivoting off-dining options post-COVID-19,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100917,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"The COVID-19 pandemic uncovered the weaknesses in the global food system, disrupting food production, processing, distribution, and consumer behaviors. The study seeks to examine the state of recovery in the restaurant operations, changes in supplier relationships, and the likelihood of pivoting off-premise dining options post-COVID-19. Based on primary data from 181 restaurants in Canada, the findings revealed that takeout was the most widely used off-premise dining option by the restaurants in the study before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant change during the pandemic occurred in the use of curbside pickup and delivery through third-party aggregators. The use of the drive-thru option remained at the pre-pandemic. The pandemic significantly impacted restaurants' sales and traffic levels and permanently closed some restaurant units. As of September 2021, two-thirds of the restaurants reported having recovered more than 50% of full capacity. The nature of supplier relationships during COVID-19 and pre-pandemic firm characteristics (number of restaurant units, business form, and restaurant category) influenced the likelihood of pivoting one or more off-premise dining options post-pandemic. By controlling the effect of pre-pandemic firm characteristics, the study provides empirical evidence on the state of recovery in restaurant operations and the likelihood of pivoting off-premise dining options post-COVID-19.",2590-1982,Not found

This is at least partially attributed to investments in cycle infrastructure. Yet few other countries have followed the Netherlands lead and invested similarly, and arguments are made that the Dutch life experience and culture are also important in encouraging walking and cycling. To examine the influence mobility culture on active travel behaviour, this study assesses similarities and differences in walking and cycling between a sample of professional immigrants living in the Netherlands’ Randstad region and a socio-demographically comparable sample born and raised in the Netherlands. The study found both similarities and differences in walking and cycling between professional immigrants and ethnic Dutch, with the immigrants actually walking and cycling more than the ethnic Dutch. In order to identify factors that influenced preferences to and levels of walking and cycling, a multiple linear regression analysis of dichotomous and ordinal variables based on their polychoric correlations was applied. Findings show that socio-demographic characteristics, car and bicycle access and trip purpose have a significant effect on the active travel behaviour of the two population groups. In addition, findings demonstrate that car access and use is associated with reduced active travel mode use.

Impact of a lower demand during the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency of dwell time delays,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100911,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This study investigates the relationship between changes in the frequency of dwell time delays and passenger flow characteristics and the frequency of railway service during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so we make use of automatic passenger count data from commuter trains in Southern Sweden. Our findings show that the frequency of dwell time delays decreased under COVID-19 conditions compared to the two years prior, but dwell time delays did not cease to exist altogether. The improvement in dwell time performance is found to occur for delays of 30 s and larger, whereas the occurrence of delays up to 15 s increased. No decline in the service frequency under COVID-19 conditions was found. Overall an improvement in dwell time punctuality can be observed under COVID-19 conditions. The analysis, somewhat, points towards a reduction in peak passenger loads to be one of the factors associated with this improvement. This is, however, not the sole reason as dwell time punctuality is found to improve for all volumes of boarding passengers. The lower passenger demand thus improved dwell time punctuality under COVID-19 conditions, but it does not tell the whole story. When trying to improve dwell time punctuality it is thus not sufficient to only reduce the number of passengers boarding, but other measures are necessary as well.",2590-1982,Not found
Fast Corridors: innovative customs processes and technology to increase supply chain competitiveness. The case of IKEA Italy,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100909,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Customs play a crucial role in facilitating and speeding up the international flow of goods, especially in logistic nodes such as seaports or dry ports. Burdensome customs procedures can significantly affect the competitiveness of supply chains by increasing times and costs. This paper describes the features and benefits of the so called “Fast Corridor”, an innovative customs process and technological procedure introduced in Italy in 2015. Compared to standard import processes, the Fast Corridor streamlines the flow of import containers from ports to their inland destinations, thanks to a transparent, more economical, secure and IT-integrated procedure, making supply chains more competitive. The Fast Corridor is based on the concept of the virtual long quay, according to which the hinterland becomes an extension of the port areas. Once unloaded from ships, goods are virtually considered to be in the inland node of final destination. Route assurance from port to the destination is provided by geofencing technology, a location-based service that uses truck-mounted GPS to trigger pre-programmed actions. IKEA was the first to adopt this new procedure. Company benefits amounted to −30% in terms of customs costs per TEU, and up to −35% in terms of port-inland node transit time and dwell time for all containers, including those not using the Fast Corridor. Based on the successful implementation by IKEA, other Italian Fast Corridors were activated.

While there have been studies focusing on the operations and management of such services, there is a lack of understanding about the quality of the delivery service and their pricing schemes. In this empirical study, we examine the delivery fee and wait time variations for ordering food using four food delivery applications in the U.S.: DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates, and Uber Eats. We collected delivery data featuring a variety of attributes of cost, timing, restaurant type, and location. The analyses cover all pricing items comprising total cost across the apps and various study areas. Furthermore, we estimated mixed-effect ordered-logistic regression (ologit) models to identify the variables and assess their association with food delivery fees and wait times. Results revealed that delivery fee variation across time of day or day of the week is negligible; however, delivery distance significantly influences delivery fees, and this effect varies considerably across apps. The observed effect of requester location reveals potential zone-based delivery pricing schemes by apps. Delivery wait time is shorter when demand and supply are high. Platforms with more established networks of users and couriers feature shorter wait times. The results of this study provide insight into user experiences with food delivery services and the choices available, which can help inform the development of pricing schemes for food delivery; the development of better optimization and operations management strategies by incorporating knowledge of key variables.",2590-1982,Not found
A spatial agent-based model of e-commerce last-mile logistics towards a delivery-oriented development,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100895,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"The spread of e-commerce has driven a major growth in the parcel delivery market, bringing a negative impact on sustainability, especially due to last-mile deliveries in urban areas. It is crucial to appropriately tackle this issue to foster consolidation of deliveries, possibly by using collection and delivery points (CDPs), where customers might receive their parcels. This paper proposes a new spatial agent-based modelling approach to explore different scenarios of last-mile logistics referred to e-commerce deliveries, comparing fragmented door-to-door deliveries with consolidation-based strategies. The case study is the central urban area of Catania, a medium sized city in Southern Italy. The Agent-Based Model (ABM) reproduces feasible operations considering real-world spatial constraints and demand data, including the possible matching of customers’ systematic trips and parcel delivery via CDPs with small detours from the scheduled trip. Key performance indicators consider both customer and logistics operator perspectives. Main results of the simulation show that the scenario without CDPs is the costliest and least efficient, implying a high number of failed deliveries. Using cargo bikes instead of vans to perform the delivery implies high costs, but much higher benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption. The highest logistics efficiency is achieved in the scenario with a doubled demand, implying a better use of the CDPs. The results suggest that it is advisable to incentive the use of CDPs instead of increasing their number. The ABM can provide useful information to decision-makers on how to manage growing on-demand urban deliveries and plan last-mile logistics using a delivery-oriented development approach.",2590-1982,Not found

To this end, two Machine Learning clustering algorithms, the K-Means and OPTICS algorithms, are applied on driving data from a large naturalistic experiment using almost 18 K trips recorded from 130 drivers. The results revealed 3 profiles, the less risky drivers, the modest drivers and the more aggressive drivers. Clustering was based on 3 important driving behavior characteristics, namely the number of speeding, headway and harsh events per 100 km. The less risky drivers profile was revealed by both algorithms, whereas drivers of higher aggressiveness are distinguished by K-Means based on the driving feature that dominates the rest. The OPTICS algorithm showed that many drivers, especially the aggressive ones, present unique behavior that cannot be grouped together with other drivers. The interpretability of driver profiles resulting from the application of these unsupervised learning techniques is worsened as the number of clusters increases. The association between driver profiles and individual characteristics leads to the conclusion that aggressiveness is mainly driven by personality traits and less by specific characteristics such as gender, age or past accident history. The results of this study can be potentially used to develop profile-specific applications that provide feedback to drivers and reduce their crash risk.",2590-1982,Not found
"Aggressive Driving, Rule-Breaking, and Driver Stress in Spanish-speaking countries",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100907,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Driver Aggression is a phenomenon many have studied in all five continents. It has been the focus of curiosity for all sorts of disciplines, and science has been unable to curb it, much less park it. Driver Stress, Road Aggression and Road Rule-Breaking are crucial elements in traffic psychology. Those who do not respect the rules are a major factor in increased risk and the occurrence of major traffic accidents. Little work has been done on how these phenomena behave in Spanish-speaking countries, much less the development of useful instruments to evaluate them. This study aims to generate two unique scales that can be used in Spanish speaking countries regardless of culture or geography, as well as determining the influence Driver Stress has on Driver Aggression and Rule-Breaking. This study comprises a sample of 1827 drivers from Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Spain. Through this paper, a small yet significant relationship was found between Driver Stress, Driver Aggression, and Driver Rule-Breaking. This suggests that personality factors are at play in these relationships in Spanish-speaking countries, and that these variables are an important factor on how drivers behave. This study also delivers two useful tools for evaluating Driver Aggression (LatinCAT) and Driver Rule-Breaking (LatinDANT) that have excellent construct validity for further research in Spanish-speaking countries.",2590-1982,Not found
Designing for street livability in the era of driverless cars,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100868,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Transport innovation, disruption and automation provide the potential to dramatically change travel and our urban landscapes over the coming years. This transformation could increase safety and efficiency, alongside accessibility for the population. Yet this promise is not without limitations. This paper focuses on the attributes of disruptive transportation that could either help or hinder street beautification, livability, sustainability, and equity. It provides an overview of the literature and practice, while discussing the benefits and challenges of new and disruptive mobility, focusing primarily on autonomous vehicles (AVs). This leads to a policy framework to guide planners, landscape architects, engineers, and policymakers toward achieving livable cities and neighborhoods in parallel with these innovations. The roadmap illustrates potential challenges in maintaining human-centered transport. Planners and engineers will need goals for 1) vehicle technology; 2) prioritizing human travel and experiences; and 3) proactively designing and programing streets for beautification, livability, and humanity.",2590-1982,Not found
Night icing prediction using vehicle-mounted pavement temperature sensor and atmospheric data,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100910,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Faced with high accident rates on ice-covered roads at night, notifying road managers of the most dangerous locations would allow them the opportunity to treat the icy roads by applying de-icing chemicals. In addition, drivers can be better prepared for the impending danger. In this regard, this study developed a web-based night icing potential information system and a deep learning-based night icing forecasting model. Input data included pavement temperature, collected by patrol cars operating between 23:00 and 07:00 on a daily basis in the winter season, and atmospheric data provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. For evaluating the forecasting model, baseline data were generated based on the physical principle that ice is formed when pavement temperature is negative and lower than the dew point temperature. The forecasting model was assessed using pavement temperature and atmospheric data obtained on a 40 km stretch of a rural highway, passing through a mountainous region in South Korea. As a result, the model showed favorable performances, with 94% and 90% accuracies for bridge and roadway segments, respectively. Considering the increasing emphasis on preventive maintenance, the developed forecasting model can be applied to a preventive anti-icing measure, in turn, increasing traffic safety on winter roads.",2590-1982,Not found
Assessing the effects of geometric layout and signing on drivers’ behavior through work zones,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100901,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Work zones are commonly deployed within or near the traveled way during roadway maintenance, repair, and construction works. Work zones could translate into hazardous spots requiring higher driver attention and possibly leading to increased crash rates and crash severity. This research addresses the effects of various design elements on drivers' behavior through work zones. Chekka diversion, currently implemented along the main Coastal Highway M-51 in Lebanon, is analyzed as it currently presents numerous non-standard design elements. A proposed standard diversion design is compared to the current non-standard diversion layout. A driving simulator has been used to model the current and the proposed diversions. Four driving scenarios involving the combination of the two diversion designs under different visibility conditions are used to evaluate drivers' behavior and responses through the diversion zones. The simulator study results showed that the proposed work zone geometry significantly improved the drivers' behavior compared to the exiting diversion. The visibility conditions have proven to have a more profound effect on driver behavior through the current non-standard diversion design. The pavement markings used along the proposed diversion reduce the vehicles' lateral fluctuations by 50% compared to the current design. The recorded driving patterns prove useful for work zone design to minimize the Lebanese drivers' risky behavior and enhance road safety.",2590-1982,Not found

Automobile technology and tradeoffs: How does automobile footprint affect its fuel economy?,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100897,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"It is generally understood that automakers face a tradeoff between fuel economy and other automobile attributes, e.g., size and horsepower. Since the current fuel economy standards are set based on a vehicle’s footprint, we analyze the tradeoffs involved paying special attention to the relationship between fuel economy and footprint. In line with previous studies in the literature, we estimate the technology frontier using automobile specifications data for all car models sold in the U.S. market from 2005 to 2014. We show that while a tradeoff exists between miles per gallon (mpg) and other automobile attributes, automobile footprint has a positive impact on mpg controlling for other vehicle attributes. Taken together, our results imply that the current footprint-based CAFE standard treats larger cars more favorably, creating incentives for carmakers to substitute across models.",2590-1982,Not found
"Exploring non-mandatory travel behavior in Jakarta City: Travel time, trip frequency, and socio-demographic influences",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100896,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This study investigates non-mandatory trips in three regions of Jakarta city, namely Central, North, and West. Specifically, the focus is on examining mode choice, distance traveled, and trip frequency. The dataset used for analysis consists of 1,187 complete survey responses obtained from an on-site survey of residents conducted between December 2019 and March 2020. The results reveal distinct travel patterns across the surveyed areas. For instance, Central Jakarta exhibits a high reliance on ride-hailing services, while shorter-distance trips are more common in West Jakarta. These variations can potentially be attributed to socio-demographic factors. To gain deeper insights into travel behavior, a multinomial transport mode choice model is employed to explore the relationship between travel modes, trip characteristics, and personal/household variables. Interestingly, despite the growth of motorcycles in Jakarta, our findings suggest that older individuals are more inclined to choose walking over motorcycle travel. Additionally, trip frequency plays a role in mode choice, as frequent trips are associated with motorcycle-based travel. As anticipated, motorcycle modal share is influenced by vehicle ownership; however, our results indicate a negative impact of ownership on the likelihood of switching from motorcycle mode to alternative modes. To facilitate a shift from motorcycle use to active and public transportation, our findings emphasize the need for an effective transportation strategy that includes reducing motor vehicle ownership, creating walkable environments, and developing age-friendly public transport options.",2590-1982,Not found
The Safe Systems Pyramid: A new framework for traffic safety,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100905,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Introduction Civil engineers play an outsize role in shaping the built environment, which plays an outsize role in health, especially in transportation safety. While there is growing interest in integrating public health and transportation engineering and planning to improve safety outcomes, existing efforts fall short. Method We review prior efforts to integrate public health into transportation safety, and frameworks from injury prevention and control and risk management. Result Based on the Hierarchy of Controls and the Health Impact Pyramid, we present a framework for prioritizing policies and interventions, known as the Safe Systems Pyramid, that contains five ascending levels – Socioeconomic Factors, Built Environment, Latent Safety Measures, Active Measures, and Education. The levels of the framework prioritize increased population health impact and decreased individual effort. Conclusions Frameworks like “The 3 E’s” emphasize collaboration rather than a change in thinking and action among transportation safety professionals, and do not prioritize specific actions. We argue that Vision Zero and other “Safe Systems” prioritize implementation of policies, programs, and infrastructure to increase population health impact by considering the individual effort necessary to obtain a protective effect. Practical applications This framework is designed to shift the thinking of engineers, planners, and policy makers that shape the transportation system. We conclude this work by applying the Safe Systems Pyramid to a hypothetical Vision Zero program, highlighting how the framework can be used to prioritize efforts using a Safe Systems approach.",2590-1982,Not found
Examining the determinants of electric bike riders’ attitudes towards traffic safety and risky driving behaviours amongst high-school students in Vietnam,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100889,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This study explored the influencing factors of attitudes towards traffic safety and risky driving behaviours amongst a sample of 594 e-bike riders who are high-school students in Vietnam. By using structural equation modelling, this research confirmed the significant association between traffic safety attitudes and the behaviours as well as the significant influence of traffic risk perception and safety knowledge on the traffic safety attitudes. In addition, e-bike riders’ behaviours were also significantly affected by descriptive norm. Furthermore, considering the specific characteristics of e-bike riders who are high-school students, this study found that either higher level of perceived family’s commitment to traffic safety or lower level of perceived privilege of e-bike riders who are high-school students significantly associated to both safer traffic safety attitudes and less risky driving behaviours.",2590-1982,Not found
Remoteness and other risk factors in circumpolar road accident severity,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100898,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Access to healthcare services is more challenging in remote northern regions due to higher travel costs associated with longer distances and harsh environments. Emergency response to road accidents in remote regions can take significantly longer than in more easily accessible locations, and potentially lead to more severe health outcomes. Accordingly, it is important to have insights on the factors that influence road accident severity in remote regions. This paper uses police accident data from Canada’s Northwest Territories between 1989 and 2019 to assess the influence of various factors on accident severity, including environmental, infrastructure-specific, geographical and accident-specific characteristics. Using multinomial logistic regression, we find that remoteness, off-road vehicle involvement and alcohol involvement increase the odds of a road accident being in a higher severity category. Overall, we find that risk factors that are more prevalent in Canada’s northern, remote regions may increase the severity of accidents in comparison to less remote regions.",2590-1982,Not found
Challenges of replacing train drivers in driverless and unattended railway mainline systems—A Swedish case study on delay logs descriptions,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100875,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Currently, the challenges of driverless or unattended train operation have not been described in detail and are often grouped into one category. This paper contributes to filling a knowledge gap regarding the roles of the train driver about the potential use of automatic train operation (ATO) on high grade of automation (GoA) levels. The results contribute to a better understanding of the challenges with driverless or unattended train operation to support strategies on how to utilize ATO on a wider range of trains than is presently the case. We use the Swedish railway network as a case study and delay logs written by train dispatchers for 2019. Our research quantifies how often unplanned events occur in which the train driver is needed, and the role of the train driver in solving these problems. In addition to this we elaborate on existing GoA levels definitions and propose a revised model that highlights more aspects of the train drivers’ roles. We have identified six categories in which an action by the driver is required: Detect, Report, Inspect, Adjust, Manage passengers, and Respond to train orders. The study illustrates some of the challenges with driverless or unattended train operation, and points to the need to develop strategies not only for the driving aspects of ATO but also for the more general technical operational management of rolling stock in high GoA levels.",2590-1982,Not found
Provisional drivers intend to speed less: The positive outcome for young drivers of a safe-driving app randomised trial,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100877,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Speeding is a major contributor to young drivers' crashes and one of their most commonly observed risky behaviours. Practice-oriented research suggests that technology, such as smartphone safe-driving apps (apps), can help reduce risky behaviour like speeding. Some apps' effects (e.g. on speeding) have been investigated in simulator and field studies. Those studies on apps' effects seem challenging to replicate in the real world, do not control for general influences, or focus on short-term effects. Furthermore, the impact of a freely-released app on random users has not been investigated to date. This paper investigates the behavioural effects of one off-the-shelf app, Flo, in a training study with 210 young drivers aged 18 to 25, 84 intervention and 126 control participants. The app's impact on their speeding was assessed in a three-month randomised trial. ANCOVAs were performed to assess separately for changes in the Intervention participants' speeding intention and self-reported speeding behaviour relative to the Control group. The results suggest the intervention significantly affected the speeding intention of participants with provisional driving licences. These findings encourage discussion on the effectiveness of apps in safe-driving training and influencing behaviour, which can potentially be more effective for provisional drivers. We provide suggestion on improving smartphone apps' functionality to increase their potential for positive behavioural change.",2590-1982,Not found
Less can be more: Pruning street networks for sustainable city-making,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100878,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Current trends in urban planning aim at the reduction of space for private vehicles to promote alternative mobility, more diverse activities on streets and reduced pollution for healthier cities. Simultaneously, “tactical urbanism”, embedded within participatory processes, helps to articulate and enrich these policies. In this connection, our study evaluates a number of “what-if scenarios” of “city pruning” by means of realistic, agent-based computer simulations. They regard traffic restrictions for Barcelona with the purpose to identify the impact on travel performance and the environment. Positive counterintuitive effects related to Braess and Daganzo paradoxes are found in new alternatives to the street repurposing plans developed by the City of Barcelona. These result in a reduction of emissions (−8% of main pollutants) and traffic congestion (−14% of travel time) solely by closing some streets to motor vehicles. These findings indicate a formerly unnoticed potential to further improve the quality of urban life. Hence, the use of interactive urban models can be a powerful tool to explore and co-create policies within participatory approaches in spatial planning. Positive counterintuitive effects of street repurposing and network dismantling provide opportunities for participatory and sustainable city-making beyond the ongoing public debate.",2590-1982,Not found
"The Road, Home: Challenges of and Responses to Homelessness in State Transportation Environments",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100890,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"In recent decades, homelessness has become an increasingly major challenge in the U.S., reaching about half million unhoused people. Many of them seek shelter in settings such as freeways, underpasses, and rest areas. State departments of transportation (DOTs) are responsible for the health and safety of these settings and their occupants, housed and unhoused. This study synthesizes existing literature and findings from interviews with staff from 13 state DOTs and eight service providers and organizations responding to homelessness. Homelessness represents a recognized and common challenge for DOTs, which face jurisdictional, financial, and legal hurdles in addressing it. DOT staff employ both “push” and “pull” strategies, the most common of which is encampment removals (“sweeps”). However, the effectiveness of such removals is limited, as encampments often reappear in nearby sites. Other strategies include “defensive design” and, more proactively, establishing or partnering with low-barrier shelters, providing shelters and sanitation on DOT land, and coordinating rehousing and outreach efforts. Our findings suggest that DOTs should acquire better data on homelessness on their lands, create a homelessness coordinating office, establish formal partnerships with nonprofits/service providers, and evaluate the necessity of encampment removals, through the development and utilization of prioritization criteria.",2590-1982,Not found
Does built environment matter in a medium-sized African city? Empirical evidence from the interaction between land use and travel behavior,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100881,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"A bulk of the empirical studies on land use and travel behavior seem to focus on Western, European, and Asian cities. The experience of cities in Africa has been grossly understudied and left unaccounted for in global literature. A substantial number of these studies concluded that variables in the built environment are important determinants of travel behavior. It is the view of this paper that some African cities, like the Benin metropolitan region, may deviate from the hypothesis of land use-travel behavior interaction in several other studies, which seems to imply that built environment components are among the key factors impacting travel behavior. This paper is aimed at examining how the built environment and socioeconomic and demographic attributes affect travel behavior in a medium-sized African city, using the Benin metropolitan region as an example. Using remotely sensed datasets and metropolitan-wide survey data of 1,735 valid responses, a nested logit choice model was estimated. The result revealed that built environment indicators have a weak association with travel behavior and that individual characteristics like socioeconomics and demographics prove to be strong variables that influence people’s travel behavior in the study area. The study provides support for the association between built environment indicators, individual indicators, and travel behavior. It suggested that, unlike the cities of most advanced nations, the Benin metropolitan region somewhat deviated in the manifestation of travel behavior. It was recommended that more studies be conducted in African cities. Such research could disclose additional important details regarding African behavior and how it influences their decision-making.",2590-1982,Not found

But to understand recent changes in demand for cars, researchers must account for behaviors specific to different generations, while simultaneously controlling for the influence of lifecycle and historical effects. To overcome the analytical challenges of cross-sectional data in Age-Period-Cohort (APC) analysis, we apply three different approaches largely used by biostatisticians to isolate how cohort effects influence the likelihood that a U.S. adult lives in a zero-vehicle household. Our analyses draw on data from the U.S. Census Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) from 1970 to 2019. To test for cohort effects, we use constraint-based binary logistic regression, a nonlinear parametric approach to log-linear models, and median polish analysis. We find that people born from 1935 to 1944 experienced the strongest negative cohort effect of all groups, and thus were least likely to live in zero-vehicle households (after accounting for age and period effects). Compared to this cohort, persons born before 1924 and after 1955 saw higher likelihoods of living in zero-vehicle households, all else equal. The peak cohort effect of people born in the 1930s to 1940s may please those interested in reducing automobile use. But because automobiles offer access benefits, more recent cohorts may experience transportation challenges. Negative effects may be especially salient for Millennials, a group faring worse economically than previous generations. Further, recent changes in the transportation landscape – including the growth of services like carshare and ride-hail and behavioral changes emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic – complicate efforts to forecast demand for automobiles.",2590-1982,Not found

Using structural equation modeling, we analyze Google mobility data taken from February to December 2020 and find that changes in the contents of the announcements can influence the pandemic crisis, via their effects on public transport mobility. Interestingly, we find that different announcements affect public transport mobility differently. The impact of these announcements is maintained even after taking the effect of the contemporary government regulations into account. We therefore argue that, in order to fight the spread of the virus, it is important for policymakers to inform the general public about COVID-19-preventive behavior in an appropriate manner. We further suggest that governments take advantage of the large daily flow of people through public transport infrastructure, to disseminate vital information during crises.",2590-1982,Not found

Impact of health and transportation on accessing healthcare in older adults living in rural regions,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100882,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Introduction Living in rural areas pose challenges to accessing healthcare, often requiring individuals to travel to major cities. This study examined the impact of health and transportation among older adults using no healthcare services, family doctor services, and medical specialist services, and compared to those living in rural and small population centers. Methods Between 2020 and 2021, a survey was disseminated to 244 older adults (Mean age = 72.2 years ± 5.3 years, 50.2% male) living in rural (n = 139) and small communities (n = 105) of Saskatchewan, Canada. Results In total, 135 participants did not use healthcare services (i.e., family doctor or medical specialist); 55 used family doctor services, and 54 used medical specialist services; 10.6% reported cancelling medical appointments due to the lack or cost of transportation. Living in a rural community was a significant predictor of using family doctors. Additionally, living in a rural environment, not perceiving health as excellent or good, receiving rides from others, and traveling to larger centers for medical care were significant predictors of using medical specialists. Living in a senior’s complex and having diabetes were significantly associated with poorer health. Receiving rides from friends, family, or volunteer driving programs was the most available transportation option in rural vs small population centers. Conclusions Accessing healthcare is influenced by both health and transportation for older adults living in rural versus small communities.

In particular, we estimated three well-established mobility models in complexity science: gravity model, radiation model and visitation law for investigating the effects of COVID-19 pandemic in different stages, using the transit Origin-Destination (O-D) data collected in Singapore. Overall, the results show that the three mobility theories remain valid throughout the different periods with visitation law outperforming the gravity and the radiation models. At the pre-pandemic stage, the performance of the gravity and radiation models were comparable. The performance of the gravity model has improved compared to its pre-pandemic performance, showing 6–18% improvement at the pandemic stage and 9–15% improvement at the post pandemic stage, whereas the performance of the radiation model hasn’t changed much, making gravity model a better-performing model than the radiation model for these periods. Our results also show that in the gravity and radiation models, gross floor area is a better predictor for transit flows than the population, whereas in the visitation law use of population variable results in better predictions.

It introduces battery constraints and the option to recharge vehicles at different charging stations. The present paper proposes a bilevel large neighborhood search approach (BI-LNS) for the E-ADARP. In the outer level of the proposed approach, charging sessions are inserted in the routes of vehicles and in the inner level, the pick-up and drop-off locations of the requests are inserted. In numerical experiments, it is shown that BI-LNS is able to outperform existing approaches on a number of common E-ADARP benchmark instances. Furthermore, the scalability of BI-LNS is evaluated on a set of large problem instances. The results show that the proposed approach is able to find feasible solutions within five minutes for problem instances with up to a few thousand transportation requests.",2590-1982,Not found
Operating at the individual level: A review of literature and a research agenda to support needs-forward models of transport resource allocation,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100887,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Transportation equity is defined as the fair distribution of transportation system outcomes, costs, benefits, and services to individuals or communities. For transportation investments, plans, and projects to advance equitable outcomes, proactive equitable allocation mechanisms are necessary. Proactive equitable allocation mechanisms in transportation refer to the mathematical methods that distribute transportation system outcomes across individuals, particularly disadvantaged individuals, who are expected to benefit from the potential intervention. While existing conceptual and empirical equity literature establishes the need for proactive equity-driven transportation interventions, literature reviews on equity-focused mathematical approaches to allocate transportation system resources are limited. To this end, this literature review draws from the transportation engineering and operations research literature that focuses on the design of proactive or speculative mathematical methods through simulation and optimization to allocate transportation system outcomes in an equitable way. Through categorizing the literature based on the mathematical method first, followed by the application, we find a variety of conceptual and mathematical definitions of equity applied to an array of modes, applications, and scales of intervention. We also review the research that incorporates individual disadvantage status in determining the optimal allocation of transportation outcomes and find that many examples define broad categories of disadvantage across population groups, rather than mathematically model the behavior and needs of disadvantaged individuals. These findings are critical in laying out future research directions in equitable allocation methods that authentically center the positionalities of disadvantaged individuals, while also balancing other important transportation system objectives and public engagement strategies.",2590-1982,Not found
Digitizing and inventorying traffic control infrastructures: A review of practices,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100879,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Transportation planning, management, and operation rely heavily on effective road asset management. As a crucial component of road assets, traffic control infrastructures (TCIs), such as traffic signs and traffic signals, play a pivotal role in managing traffic flows and enhancing road safety. However, in comparison to other road assets (e.g., pavements and bridges), the establishment and maintenance of TCI inventories remain relatively underexplored. This study presents an exhaustive review of current studies and practices concerning TCI digitization and inventorying by integrating a systematic literature review (SLR) with a narrative review (NR). The SLR synthesizes available data sources, models, and solutions for TCI detection and digitization, while the NR compiles essential modules and solutions for inventory establishment and maintenance. This study is among the first to approach TCI inventorying from an interdisciplinary perspective, providing a valuable reference for transportation researchers and practitioners engaged in road asset management.",2590-1982,Not found
Public perception of electric vehicles on Reddit and Twitter: A cross-platform analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100872,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Electrified mobility such as electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions in transportation and mitigate global warming. Understanding public perception of EVs can help better support their adoption. A previous study shows that online social networks (OSNs) such as Reddit can be a valuable source for studying public perceptions of EVs and provide different perspectives from traditional methods that leverage surveys, questionnaires, or interviews (Ruan and Lv, 2022). Our work aims to investigate this direction further through the following research question: Given the distinct mechanisms of various OSNs, can we obtain a more comprehensive picture of public perception of EVs by integrating the analysis from different platforms? Specifically, our study is based on EV-related discussions on two popular OSN platforms: Twitter and Reddit. We have collected 3,437,917 Reddit posts (including 274,979 submissions and 3,162,938 comments) and 7,383,327 Tweets between January 2011 and December 2020 and analyzed them from several perspectives. Our analysis shows that users have had different topic and sentiment patterns in EV-related discussions on the two platforms over the past decade. We also leverage the verified account information on Twitter to reveal that the most influential users are politicians and news media; however, the general public has very different conversation patterns with the two types of accounts — politicians seem to be increasingly (over) optimistic about EVs while the public may think differently.",2590-1982,Not found
Significance of face-to-face service quality in last mile delivery for e-commerce platforms,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100885,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This study aims to clarify how the quality of face-to-face service in last mile delivery affects consumer use of e-commerce (EC) platforms. We implemented a questionnaire survey for Japanese EC users and obtained 1137 valid responses. Based on this dataset, we implemented the following statistical analysis procedures: (1) We employed clustering of the dataset based on the respondents’ sensitivity to pricing, product variety, delivery period, and face-to-face service quality at delivery within the context of a customer’s journey of EC platform use; consequently, five clusters were established. (2) For each cluster, we statistically calculated the influence of face-to-face service quality on EC platform use. (3) Additionally, we statistically analyzed which factors are considered as important in last mile delivery by the users belonging to the cluster requiring high quality of face-to-face service. The results suggested the following: Low level of face-to-face service quality generally reduces EC platform use among customers in all clusters. High level of face-to-face service quality increases EC platform use in one cluster that included approximately 19% of the users. However, two clusters including approximately 41% of the users exhibited decreased EC platform use in the condition of high-level service quality; Second, users in a cluster desiring high quality face-to-face service do not necessarily demand receiving parcels face to face. Rather, such users showed a significantly high acceptance of the self-pickup option. Consequently, we discuss how platform firms should manage face-to-face service quality in last mile delivery on EC platforms.",2590-1982,Not found

Moreover, in Western Africa, where several economic communities have been established, logistics growth is still unstable due to civil conflicts and political changes. These factors are rapidly changing the logistics situation in Western Africa, and there is a need to identify changes in the competitiveness of countries and seaports that handle cargo to/from landlocked countries. The objective of this study is to quantitatively analyse the time-series changes in the logistics situation in West Africa applying the global logistics intermodal network simulation model to the African continent with different parameters by time points. Scenarios regarding political upheavals in Western Africa are examined to clarify the effect on the cargo flow of landlocked countries. The simulation results indicate that Côte d’Ivoire gets greater access to Burkina Faso if border facilities in neighbouring countries stagnate. Moreover, the absence of civil conflicts may raise the presence of Abidjan Port as a regional transhipment hub more prominent and increase its container throughputs. The findings of this study contribute to quantitatively visualising the impact of the events on the logistics situation in Western Africa, which can help formulate future logistics policies and development strategies.",2590-1982,Not found
How can authorities be enablers in the deployment of CCAM?

This study sets out to assess how the public administration in the transport authorities in Norway perceive CCAM and what they see as the drivers and barriers for CCAM deployment. Our analysis is based on a unique combination of different data collection methods: interviews, survey and workshop, a mixed-method approach using a stepwise-deductive induction research design. The research design is tailored to understand individuals working with deploying CCAM policies in the public administration, an issue that is not well understood today because research is lacking. We investigate both how they perceive the deployment of CCAM, and how they suggest that the public sector should work to act as enablers of deployment of CCAM. The most prominent drivers identified in the analysis are competence, followed by cooperation, while the most prominent barriers are resources and technical maturity. Political steering and regulations are considered as being neither drivers nor barriers. Based on our results we provide three policy recommendations: first, there is a need for more clear and powerful strategies, second, there is a need to increase focus on learning-oriented approaches, and three, a need to expand cooperation and interest across the organizations.",2590-1982,Not found
Does shipping cause environmental emissions? Evidence from African countries,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100873,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Shipping is particularly important for international trade and the economic performance of economies globally. Despite its relevance, emissions from shipping have been a global concern in recent years. Given this, it is imperative to empirically understand the influence of shipping on environmental emissions. This paper, therefore, examines the impact of shipping on environmental emissions in Africa using data from 31 countries for the period 2006–2016. The system- Generalised Method of Moments estimation technique is employed for the regression analysis. The findings reveal that, in the short run and long run periods, shipping increases environmental emissions in Africa. Based on this outcome, it is recommended that attention is paid to emissions from ships since it could be an effective mechanism that policymakers can prioritize in the quest to reduce environmental emissions in African countries.",2590-1982,Not found
Structural analysis of driver fatigue behavior: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100865,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Fatigue is always accompany with the driving task, which have been extensively investigated for driver monitoring and traffic safety. While many scholars dedicate to the study of fatigue detection methods with higher accuracy, but the basic correlation between detection methods and fatigue cause or prevention receive relatively little attention. This study systematically reviews the authors’ studies of fatigue influential factors, fatigue identification and measurement, and fatigue prediction; and then structurally and comparably describes the research of driver fatigue behavior from the above three components within the literature of interest. Time-related indicators are usually considered as the main driver fatigue influential factors, and driving environment and vehicle performance are also found to be contributive to driver fatigue. The elastic control of driving time and rest time is an effective measure for the prevention of driver fatigue. Sensitivity analysis can test the correlation between measurements of fatigue identification and fatigue level, and then ensure the performance of measurements. Models that consider time-related factors based on bio-mathematic model theory can be used for real-time fatigue level prediction and characterizing the fatigue dynamics in the planned travel time. Driver individual differences should be considered for the fatigue behavior research as the performance of fatigue detection model and prediction models could vary greatly within drivers from different population. This review described the structure of driver fatigue behavior studies, and the link between fatigue influential indicators, fatigue identification, prediction. The effect of fatigue identification should be further explored, not just for detection or high accuracy.",2590-1982,Not found
Double-layer control architecture for motion and torque optimisation of autonomous electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100866,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Optimising energy autonomy for autonomous electric vehicles is a significant challenge in sustainable and environmentally friendly mobility. To this end, we propose a novel double-layer control architecture designed to drive the longitudinal motion of electric vehicles equipped with a regenerative braking system. The first layer resembles an Adaptive Cruise Control, while the second one is enabled during the braking phase and is devoted to the blending between the motor torque and the hydraulic one. This layer is synthesised as a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control strategy so as to maximise the efficiency of the regenerative system. The control architecture, by combining the two control strategies, allows to reduce the overall energy consumption for electric vehicles, while simultaneously ensuring a safer, more sustainable, and comfortable driving experience. Additionally, this combination is capable of compensating for any efficiency issues arising from external factors, such as different traffic conditions encountered by the vehicle. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control architecture, extensive simulation analysis was carried out using the MiTraS virtual testing platform, considering two realistic driving scenarios. Results confirm the robustness and safety of the proposed control architecture in ensuring the tracking of the desired trajectory while optimising the energy consumption.",2590-1982,Not found
Social equity and public transit in the inland empire: Introducing a transit equity analysis model,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100870,21,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Public transit is a critical part of transportation infrastructure and social equity. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on transit systems throughout the nation. The study area for this paper, the Inland Empire (I.E.) in Southern California, has a significant minority and disadvantaged population, highlighting the importance of creating opportunities and new means of transportation. The transportation system has been built to support automobile travel, but public transit is an important mobility factor for many people. This paper aims to study the performance of public transit services and their impact on underserved communities. Pre-pandemic, during and post-COVID-19 vaccination rollout time periods, were selected to analyze the impact on transit equity. A transit equity analysis model was built using multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) on demographic and transit-related data from 645 census tracts. This model creates a transit equity index (TEI), which includes a transit service index (TSI), a socially disadvantaged index (DAI), and a race index (R.I.). The transit equity index shows a strong relationship between TSI and R.I. on DAI, reflecting the region's lack of efficient transit services in racially marginalized census tracts. As a result, new policies are needed to promote public transportation, create adequate infrastructure, and envision urban planning to decrease public transit social inequities within the I.E.",2590-1982,Not found

This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the influence of socio-demographics, working history, theory of planned behavior (TPB) variables, and risk perceptions on MBRH drivers’ intentions to use smartphones to read and text while driving in three varying traffic conditions. A number of 497 MBRH drivers in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, were sampled using both a convenience and a random sampling method. The findings revealed that younger MBRH drivers had more positive attitudes and had higher subjective norms and total control over this behavior, resulting in higher texting while driving intention. The empirical results also showed significant associations between TPB variables and intention, in which attitudes was found to be the strongest predictor of intention to text while driving. In addition to the TPB variables, the perceived risk of accidents was a significant predictor of intentions to text while driving in smooth and congested traffic, while risk perception of being apprehended by the police becomes a determinant of intention to text while stopping at signalized intersections. In order to minimize texting while driving intention, the study underscores the necessity for strategies that target attitude change and risk perception improvement.",2590-1982,Not found

The aim of the present study is to assess the associations between commuting and poor mental health in workers. This is a cross-sectional study extracting information from the ‘Commuting, Daily Habits and Urban Health Survey’ in Mairena del Aljarafe (Spain), including a representative sample of 294 workers. Poor mental health was accessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Associations were tested using Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests, while Pearson's correlation was used for each item of the GHQ-12, and multiple linear regression was applied to explore factors associated with poor mental health. Of the 294 workers, the mean age was 43.1 years old, 46.6% female, 49% had a university education, 38.4% smoked, and 44.5% were overweight/obese. For their commute, 77.1% used a private motor vehicle (vs. 6.9% public and 16.0% active), spent 51.9 min/day (54.8 min/day private, 44.2 min/day public, and 39.3 min/day active), and expended €91.9/month (€99.7/month private, €59.0/month public and €59.5/month active). The multiple linear regression model shows that people who used their private motorised transport and those who spent more time on their commute to work are associated with poorer mental health. The results of this study show that both driving a motor vehicle and commuting time are associated with poorer mental health. Therefore, the use of public and/or active travel should be encouraged, as well as better management to improve traffic congestion and thus reduce travel times.",2590-1982,Not found

Although strategies such as improving fuel efficiency, enhanced logistics, etc., are already being pursued, the primary way to reduce the carbon intensity (CI) of the rail sector will be through the use of low-CI fuels such as bio/renewable diesel. Alternatives such as battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cells are still evolving and, while liquid/compressed natural gas (LNG/CNG) can be used as “transition (lower-CI) fuels”, they are not drop-in, requiring considerable investment in engines and infrastructure. By contrast, bio-based diesels are low-carbon solutions that can be readily deployed to reduce rail associated GHG emissions. However, the high price of bio-based diesels, competition with other modes of transport (e.g., trucking), and the lack of “enabling” policies have limited bio/renewable diesel use by the rail sector. Canada’s current biodiesel production could supply 40% of Canada’s rail sector fuel needs, reducing its GHGs by about 34%.",2590-1982,Not found

The RTBS refers to the combined utilization of both modes (rail and bike-sharing) of transportation within a single journey or trip, allowing individuals to seamlessly switch between rail transit and bicycles for enhanced accessibility and convenience. The study aims to identify the specific BE factors and sub-factors that have a significant impact on RTBS, the direction of this influence, and the most consistently linked BE variable to RTBS. The findings reveal that land use, population and employment density, intersections, branch roads, number of public transportation (PT) stops and stations, PT located in suburban areas, bikeways, and distance to the central business district (CBD) significantly impact RTBS, while housing density does not. Among these BE variables, distance to the CBD is the most consistently significant predictor of RTBS. The study also indicates that employment density has a more significant impact on the integrated usage of dockless bike-sharing and rail transport compared to docked bike-sharing systems. The study identifies high heterogeneity in all BE-RTBS relationships and further investigates the possible causes of these discrepancies.

Understanding the behavioral intention of the rural population to use demand-responsive transport services,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100984,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Global efforts to reduce carbon emissions include endeavors to raise the use of public transport means. In rural areas, this poses a distinctive challenge. Demand-responsive transport (DRT) services are a form of public transport that is regarded as a potential contribution to the required mobility behavior change. They mainly utilize small floor buses and require a pre-booking of each trip (via internet, app or telephone). Despite the growing number of active DRT services and trial operations, occupation numbers remain small. To understand this gap, this study investigates latent constructs that influence the behavioral intention of inhabitants living in rural regions to use DRT services. For this purpose, a questionnaire based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology was adapted, tested independently through an exploratory factor analysis and distributed in Austria. The sample (n = 186) was subjected to a structural equation model. Results show that performance expectancy and attitude towards public transport have a significant impact on the behavioral intention of inhabitants to use DRT services in rural regions, whereas the attitude towards private cars was insignificant. Inter alia, we suggest concentrating on the determination of people’s specific everyday mobility needs in rural areas, analyzing and optimizing the public transport offer as an interrelated system, and communicating its benefits more efficiently.",2590-1982,Not found

In an online survey, 408 participants experienced videos of virtual environments with different designs to assess various attributes and their influence on the perception of the space and crossing behaviour. The results indicate that pedestrians and cyclists do favour similar attributes and space configurations. While both find motor vehicles undesirable, they hold a positive view of the central placement of design elements and protective barriers separating them from other road users. To design liveable environments that integrate and accommodate road users’ needs, this paper reiterates that it is crucial to systematically structure the space to deliver the concept of integration while reinforcing the place function and providing a sense of protection for vulnerable road users.

Framing availability and usability of transportation for people with disabilities,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100961,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Transportation planning researchers use the term “accessibility” to characterize the ability of people to reach jobs, school, healthcare and other services and activities. Disability scholars use that term to characterize the ability of people with disabilities to use transportation modes where and when present. In the United States of America (US), transportation policymakers’ use of the latter definition only for minimal legal compliance at the expense of the former definition, without synthesizing both definitions, has led to real-world negative consequences for transportation for people with disabilities, including when new train lines lead to consolidation of bus routes and in regulatory debates about how ridehailing services may serve people with disabilities. Thus, in the context of transportation policy, we propose a new set of terms that, when used consistently, can more accurately distinguish these concepts. These terms are “provider-view availability”, referring to where & when a transportation mode is present or legal to use, “immediate usability”, referring to the ease of interacting with a vehicle or (physical or digital) infrastructure upon encountering it, “user-view availability”, referring to how some people cannot start trips on a given mode due to severe problems with immediate usability, and “cumulative usability”, referring to the challenges that users of a certain mode may face more often as trip times or distances increase. We argue that transportation policymakers in the US could more accurately characterize holistic problems with transportation facing people with disabilities by consistently using these terms and thereby mitigate similar negative consequences going forward.",2590-1982,Not found
The impact of rising maritime transport costs on international trade: Estimation using a multi-region general equilibrium model,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100985,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This paper evaluates the impact of the 2021–22 surge in rates for containerized and bulk shipping costs. Employing a detailed transport database and applying a set of detailed shocks by transportation mode, regions and commodities in a multi-region general equilibrium model, the paper analyses the sectorial (agri-food sectors, manufacturing) and macroeconomic (trade, wide-economic indicators) impacts of the recent surge in shipping costs. Maritime transport costs are sensitive to imbalances between global demand and supply, which rose further after the Covid-19 pandemic. In a globalised world, an increase in shipping rates can have widespread repercussions on international trade, creating risks for the global economic activity. The results allow the analysis of how shocks in transport costs can affect prices in international trade and explain the short- and medium-term impacts on the economy. The main finding is that rising maritime transport costs tend to reverse the trend towards globalisation of international trade and favour localization.",2590-1982,Not found
Patients with urea cycle disorder struggle when driving: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy review,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100983,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Previous studies have shown that lack of attention and delayed reactions cause most car crashes. Populations with known deficits in executive function domains such as inattention and lack of mobility would potentially be vulnerable. Understanding the underlying neural networks that are responsible for driving behavior is important to train safe drivers. In rare diseases, particularly inborn errors of metabolism such as urea cycle disorders (UCD), we are starting to unravel the underlying neural networks that are impacted by exposure to toxic metabolites. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism are living into adulthood due to better treatments. Driving is considered an intricate adult task that requires higher-level executive function. Higher-level executive functioning involves the ability to manage complex tasks requiring focus on the task such as attention to the road, while simultaneously, managing relevant information and distractions, and adapting to the task demands. During a recent adult focus group of patients with UCD, we learned that at least 50% of them decided to never drive or stop driving. UCD is associated with executive dysfunction, which may affect their driving. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is one of the most effective modalities to examine neural activation related to executive function, working memory, attention, and cognitive development. We have previously shown hemodynamic variations for UCD patients compared to controls in a twin case study. Here, we are reviewing the use of imaging modalities such as fNIRS to detect brain biomarkers in adult individuals with neurological dysfunction such as UCD during a driving task.",2590-1982,Not found
Validation of a new method for designing air traffic control alarms,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100965,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Alarms, alerts, and warnings are critical to maintaining safety in the National Airspace System and should be designed to support aircraft separation as well as supplementary tasks such as weather avoidance. The purpose of this study is to validate a novel alarm design framework by asking air traffic controllers to evaluate an existing alarm. Methods We invited four air traffic controllers to participate in a structured interview that is part of a novel Signal Design Framework. Controllers were asked a series of scripted questions about 15 specific alarm properties. They were then asked to choose the three properties most important to the design of the conflict alert. Lastly, controllers were asked a series of questions about the overall quality of the taxonomy and its potential for impacting aviation safety. Results All participants agreed that the taxonomy captured all the important characteristics of an alarm and that no gaps or failures existed in the alarm framework. They also agreed that the framework was easy to understand, that the structured interview was easy to understand, and that applying the framework to alarm design and revision would improve alarm ease of use, reduce confusion, and improve overall safety. Conclusions The structured interview encouraged controllers to think about the Conflict Alert and helped them to develop novel solutions that could potentially improve this alarm in the Air Traffic Control environment.",2590-1982,Not found
"Investigating the changes in travel behaviour during an economic crisis in a developing country: A case study of the Greater Beirut Area, Lebanon",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100957,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Lebanon is currently facing one of the worst economic crises in its history, which has been compounded by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating explosion at the Port of Beirut in August 2020. This research focuses on the Greater Beirut area in Lebanon, aiming to examine the impact of the ongoing economic crisis on travel behavior. The study analyzes changes in travel behavior before and during the crisis for various trip purposes, including the number of trips and modes of transportation used. Socio-economic factors that may have influenced these changes are also considered. Descriptive analyses and multivariate statistics reveal that the economic crisis had a significant influence on people's travel behavior. Multinomial logistic regression models highlight the impact of factors such as age, nationality, occupation, household size, income, and spending fluctuations on trip frequency changes during the crisis. The analysis of the data indicates a decrease in all trip types during the crisis, partly due to the adoption of online study and work, resulting in fewer commuting trips. Private car usage declined for shopping trips, while motorcycles and public transport witnessed an increase. Recreational trips reduced significantly, with more respondents opting for fewer trips per year, showing a noticeable preference for buses. Despite the shift away from private cars, the adoption of public transport remains modest, partly due to limited accessibility, safety concerns, and unreliable services.",2590-1982,Not found
A novel framework to redefine societal disability as technologically-enabled ability: A case of multi-disciplinary innovations for safe autonomous spatial navigation for persons with visual impairment,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100952,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Autonomous spatial navigation (ASN) is a challenge for millions of disabled people globally, especially persons with visual impairment (PwVI) who depend on either caregivers or trained animals. To enable ASN, PwVI resort.. to simple assistive devices such as the white cane. Modern architecture, increasing traffic volumes, and transport infrastructure pose new challenges and technological innovations e.g., self-driving cars (SDCs) and wearable assistive devices (WADs) are promising. PwVI cannot drive conventional cars. Meanwhile, there is remarkable progress in innovating SDCs and pedestrian WADs. Therefore, this review was motivated by the need to assess the operational implications of the technologies for ASN by PwVI. We focused on the components, functions, and operationalization of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) embedded in instantaneous sensor-platform--algorithm systems. Existing ADAS prototypes and research directions show the benefits of adopting appropriate technology (AAT) based on supercomputing and powered by artificial intelligence facilitating real-time perception and safe ASN by PwVI. SDC innovations can economically benefit pedestrian PwVI. The study used ASN for PwVI to present a novel model; Integrated Computer-based Technologically-Enabled Ability Model (ICTEAM); that redefines disability as a ‘technologically-enabled ability.’ The ICTEAM subscribes to optimistic sociology advancing technological rehabilitation of disability based on AAT, instead of ‘talk-show advocacy’ within social model.",2590-1982,Not found
Understanding the behaviour of motorcycle riders: An objective investigation of riding style and capability,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100971,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Human errors are the primary cause of powered two-wheeler crashes worldwide due to the demanding control required and the often ineffective rider-training programs. Literature on rider behaviour is limited, partly due to the lack of standard investigation methodologies. This work investigated the differences in riding style and capability of a diverse set of riders. It explored the impact of familiarisation and riding instruction through objective metrics. Correlation with experience was a particular focus. Seven riders of various experience levels performed trials on an instrumented motorcycle, following three riding instructions: ‘Free Riding’, ‘Handlebar Riding’, and ‘Body Riding’. Objective metrics assessed rider familiarisation, capability and willingness to excite motorcycle dynamics, riding style, and input preference. Results indicated that riders asymptotically converged to their motorcycle dynamics intensity level after a specific distance; both intensity and distance were positively correlated with experience. Experienced riders achieved higher longitudinal acceleration and utilised combined dynamics to a higher degree. The negative longitudinal jerk during braking varied greatly among riders and correlated with experience. A clustering approach identified two prominent trial groups concerning the motorcycle response intensity. Higher diversity emerged in the inputs, leading to five clusters with distinct riding style meanings. Instructions influenced behaviour, particularly regarding input usage. The unsupervised approach and metrics proposed should make rider behaviour research more straightforward and objective. It could be applied to naturalistic riding sessions for more conclusive evidence of inter-driver differences. The diversity that emerged concerning the command inputs used warrants a revision of training practices to promote riding safety.",2590-1982,Not found
Logistics of patient evacuation in response to disease Outbreaks: Critical considerations for transportation planning,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100975,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The recent outbreaks of diseases have emphasized the importance of having robust decision-making models in place to aid in the evacuation of patients, particularly from overwhelmed hospitals to alternative facilities. The sudden surge of patients during an outbreak can quickly deplete a hospital's resources, leading to compromised healthcare delivery and an increase in mortality rates. Evacuating patients to other hospitals can alleviate the burden on a single facility, but numerous factors need to be considered when making evacuation decisions, including patient acuity, transportation logistics, and bed availability at other facilities. Despite the critical role of patient evacuation in disease outbreaks, there has been a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on developing decision-making models that identify the critical factors. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing the key factors that should be considered when creating decision models for patient evacuation in response to contagious disease outbreaks. The findings reveal that decision-making processes are influenced by a multitude of factors, including patient numbers and classifications, staff scheduling and assignments, resource availability for transportation, road traffic conditions, capacities and numbers of evacuation and receiving hospitals, as well as the behaviour of disease outbreaks. These findings provide practical insights for relevant authorities to optimize emergency strategies during disease outbreaks and enhance the overall resilience of the healthcare system against external disruptions.",2590-1982,Not found
Making road freight transport more Sustainable: Insights from a systematic literature review,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100967,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Road-based transportation being the most used transport mode globally has associated negative externalities such as traffic accidents, higher product costs, greenhouse gas emissions, air and noise pollution necessitating improvement. The study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art knowledge about improving road freight transportation sustainability (RFTS) and discuss ways key stakeholders can do for its improvement. Therefore, the study adds to the existing reviews by providing more insights and a nuanced appreciation of improving RFTS. This is of relevance to policymakers, practitioners, and other key actors in the road-based freight transportation sector. The study utilized a meta-aggregation approach involving 75 peer-reviewed articles. Three themes under which RFTS can be addressed, namely (1) policy and regulation-based measures, (2) logistics and transportation efficiency-based measures, and (3) innovative technology-based measures were identified. Furthermore, the study found that the successful attainment of RFTS depends on the cooperative nature of both direct and indirect actors, strengthening of existing laws, capital investment, and stakeholder demands and pressure. However, less focus on stakeholder collaboration was observed to achieve the needed benefits for all three sustainability aspects. The study has limitations as only peer-reviewed articles were utilized. Other literature types including books would have provided a wider view of the topic.

Determining change factors for demand and supply in motorcycle-based ride hailing operations,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100981,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"There are various factors that are considered to influence the perspectives and motivations of users and drivers so that they have an impact on the demand and supply of motorcycle-based ride-hailing operations. This study investigates the factors that cause changes in user motivation to use motorcycle-based ride-hailing and the factors that cause changes in driver consistency as a motorcycle-based ride-hailing driver in Bandung, Indonesia. We use a survey questionnaire to explore the perspectives of both users and drivers. Based on survey data and the structural equation modeling method used to test the validity of the factor with the strongest influence from the two perspectives, The study results from the user’s perspective indicate that the impact of the tariff adjustments has an effect on users, especially those for incidental use, and is more dominated by faster achievement times, while for drivers, it is indicated that the revenue variable from motorcycle-based ride-hailing has a smaller effect because this is strongly influenced by the number of orders tending to decrease, so that it is considered no longer a prospective source of income for most of the drivers. Finally, several proposed efforts and policies for the government, applicators, and other relevant stakeholders, both related to legal aspects, setting tariffs and limiting quotas for drivers who operate, etc., in managing the operational sustainability of MBRH and the public transportation system, especially in urban areas.",2590-1982,Not found
Pedestrian path changing behaviour prediction models for urban mid blocks,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100973,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Pedestrian’s behaviour at a crosswalk is a critical influencing factor in determining pedestrian safety in urban areas. A facility will be ineffective when most pedestrians fail to use it effectively; moreover, using a location without a pedestrian crossing facility further increases the risk of involvement in accidents. Although several studies have been done to identify pedestrian behaviour at the crosswalk, only a few have been on path changing behaviour. The objective of this study is to analyse the pedestrian behaviour at midblock and to develop a model predicting the path changing behaviour. The pedestrian behaviour study was conducted at Kozhikode city and location with zebra marking and without zebra marking is considered simultaneously. The study shows that male pedestrians make more path change when compared to female pedestrians. About 88.6% pedestrians make path change at no zebra marking area, whereas only 60.5% in locations with zebra marking. This indicates that pedestrians tend to make a perpendicular or straight crossing when there is a facility like zebra marking. Crossing time is more for path changing pedestrian than the straight moving pedestrian and waiting time is lesser for pedestrian using zebra marking area. Path changing behaviour prediction is done by binary logit and machine learning techniques. Study shows that waiting time has negative influence on path changing behaviour and stages of crossing shows a positive influence on path changing behaviour. Increase in waiting time by 50% will result in 40% decrease of path changing behaviour.",2590-1982,Not found
Analysis of factors that influence injury severity of single and multivehicle crashes involving at-fault older drivers: A random parameters logit with heterogeneity in means and variances approach,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100974,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The number of older drivers on our roads have been increasing given the upward shift of older people in the population. It is well-known that older drivers are more susceptible to injury given a crash. They are also likely to be at-fault in certain types of crashes due to health conditions associated with old age. This paper identifies factors that influence the severity of crashes involving at-fault older drivers at a disaggregated level for single and multivehicle crashes. Two random parameters multinomial logit with heterogeneity in means and variances models of injury severity were developed to assess the impact of various crash factors on crash outcomes based on the crash type. The study used five years of crash data from Alabama. The model estimations show that rainy weather and dark roadways were associated with an increased likelihood of serious injuries for single-vehicle crashes. Older male drivers were also found to have a higher probability of being at-fault in fatal single-vehicle crashes. For multivehicle older driver crashes, the model estimation results revealed that fatal injury was more likely to occur when the airbags were deployed. In addition, drivers between 65 and 75 years are less likely to be involved in fatal injury crashes for both single and multivehicle crashes. It was further found that older driver at-fault crashes that occurred in the open country were more likely to be fatal regardless of the manner of collision. The findings of this study are expected to help policymakers and transportation stakeholders to implement countermeasures that will make the road safer for older drivers and all other road users.",2590-1982,Not found
A computational investigation of the dynamic factors governing severity of head injury to pedestrians involved in e-scooter collisions,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100972,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"A rapid rise in the popularity of e-scooters has brought forth an increasing number of e-scooter-related conflicts, crashes, and injuries to pedestrians in many cities. There is a pressing need to understand the factors influencing the severity of injury to pedestrians involved in e-scooter collisions. This paper investigates the dynamics of e-scooter-pedestrian collisions and presents a new method for relating the probability of severe head injury to collision speed in e-scooter-pedestrian collisions. A total of 160 computer simulations representing different collision scenarios have been analyzed. Our results have shown that e-scooter speed is the main determinant of the severity of pedestrian head injury. E-scooter speed ranging from 10 to 15 km/h is found to be critical for pedestrian safety as the probability of severe head injury rises rapidly within this speed range. Moreover, an e-scooter-pedestrian collision is more likely to cause severe head injury to the pedestrian than a bicycle-pedestrian collision within the same speed range. It has also been found that the weight of the e-scooter and the direction of impact do not have a strong influence on the collision metrics, especially on the probability of severe head injury. The study has also investigated the post-collision fall mechanism for different pedestrian profiles and the influence of different impact angles. Finally, some recommendations have been proposed, including a speed limit of not more than 11 km/h for e-scooterist on shared paths where the likelihood of pedestrian and e-scooter conflicts is higher. The recommendations could help authorities develop legislation for safe micro-mobility.",2590-1982,Not found
Trading activity and market liquidity in tradable mobility credit schemes,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100970,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The interest in tradable mobility credits (TMC) is growing steadily. Compared to existing instruments, its cap-and-trade design for the demand side ensures that a limited quantity, e.g., traffic and related emissions, can by design not be exceeded. However, most TMC schemes are market-based financial instruments that can only be successful, if the market ensures the most efficient allocation of resources and if one can rely on the price. Hence, TMC schemes require trading activity and a liquid market that only emerges when participants are able and willing to trade. In this paper, we systematically review the TMC literature for aspects of trading activity and market liquidity, summarize the literature streams, and discuss determinants of participants’ ability and willingness to trade TMCs. During the literature review we separate those into demand-side, supply-side, and market regulation factors. This first coherent discussion of creating liquid TMC markets with substantial trading activity challenges the instrument and allows us to draw valuable conceptual implications for the TMC scheme design, but also implications for stakeholders beyond concept. Generating trading activity and liquid markets is thoroughly possible, but robustly achieving it can be challenging.",2590-1982,Not found

Fostering an inclusive public transport system in the digital era: An interdisciplinary approach,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100968,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"As digitalisation is making its way into public transport (PT) services, policy approaches to ensure that such services remain inclusive are at best fragmented, at worst inexistant. This study pieces together existing initiatives and lessons learnt in the transport sector itself, and takes inspiration from other fields with a more mature understanding of digitalisation. We interviewed twenty-two experts working either in the PT sector or in other sectors such as healthcare and public administration to present an overview of possible measures to foster inclusion in PT in the digital era. We used both triangulation and a two-step respondent validation process to improve results’ trustworthiness. We conclude that there is no one-size-fits-all, but a series of complementary strategies to address digital inequality. A focus on an inclusive design from the start, courses, showing the added value of digital tools, specialist products and non-digital alternatives are building blocks to foster a more inclusive PT system in the era of digitalisation. The role of the public transport staff ought not to be underestimated in digital transformations. Importantly, securing the issue of unequal access to public transport due to digitalisation at a decision-making level is essential. Nevertheless, there is only so much that the transport sector can do. Tackling more systemic issues that often underlie digital barriers like poverty and low literacy is crucially relevant.

Fuel-saving opportunities for automated vehicles: A driving cycle analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100964,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"We calculate the energy demand of automated vehicles for different driving cycles. We alter standard driving cycles to depict the driving behavior of automated vehicles. We further assume additional energy demand for automation systems and investigate trade-offs between reductions in mechanical energy demand and increases in auxiliary energy demand. In the case of trucks, we find that smoother driving and the additional energy demand offset one another for highway driving. However, a notable reduction in energy demand can be achieved by lowering the maximum driving speed. For cars, we find that the additional energy demand slightly outweighs the effects of smoother driving on highways. When considering city driving, the additional energy demand increases the energy demand of a mid-size car in the standard driving cycle by one third. Reducing driving speeds and stops is not able to offset this increase in energy demand.",2590-1982,Not found
"Impacts of on-demand ride services on the number of traffic crashes – A case study of RideAustin in Austin, TX",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100966,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"On-demand ridesharing services are rapidly growing and are predicted to continue to do so, as they offer millions of trips to potential riders every day. Empirical research have extensively investigated the effects of ridesharing services on travel behaviour, traffic congestion, and environmental factors. However, the potential influence of these services on the occurrence of traffic crashes has been largely overlooked. Previous research examining the safety implications of ridesharing services has primarily focused on the existence of such services. Nevertheless, we contend that the mere presence of a ridesharing service does not inherently ensure either a favorable or unfavorable influence on traffic safety. It is the frequency of service consumption that is more likely to have an influence. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of ridesharing services on the incidence of traffic crashes and injuries. The analysis will focus on RideAustin, a locally based ridesharing service operating in Austin, TX, as a specific case study. The difference-in-difference methodology is employed in this study to examine the impact of RideAustin on traffic accidents at the U.S. census block group level. This analysis considers sociodemographic characteristics and built environment variables as control factors. The dataset utilised in this study comprises over 1.4 million trips from 2016 to 2017, sourced from RideAustin. Additionally, the traffic crash and injury data included in this study spans the period from 2012 to 2020 and encompasses approximately 373,000 traffic crashes, as obtained from the Texas Department of Transportation. The use of difference-in-difference models revealed that a statistically significant reduction in the occurrence of traffic crashes was observed solely when the number of trips within a certain block group above a specific threshold. The study determined that the mere presence of services and their infrequent utilization (less than one ride per block group) did not have a statistically significant effect on traffic safety. The results obtained from this study will contribute to a more comprehensive comprehension of the safety advantages associated with ridesharing services, consequently assisting transportation and policy planners in mitigating the occurrence of traffic accidents in metropolitan regions.",2590-1982,Not found
Design effects of cycle infrastructure changes: An exploratory analysis of cycle levels,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100949,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Introduction Cycling infrastructure policies yield health and environmental benefits. However, design variations may impact intervention effectiveness. This study explored relationships between infrastructure form (e.g., width, length) and function (e.g., access, safety) and cycling behavior. Methods We analysed data from a study evaluating 15 streets with new cycling infrastructure improvements in Paris and Lyon. Comparison streets were chosen based on having similar pre-intervention cycling trends and periods of data availability as intervention streets. The outcome was the difference in daily cycle counts between intervention and control streets. We conducted a virtual street audit with Google Street View to assess 14 street features and derived a function score based on 7 components. We used induced smoothed LASSO regression to identify relevant form or function variables associated with cycle count changes. Results The effects of new cycling infrastructure varied, with significant increases at half (7/15) of the sites and no change at the rest. For every 1 SD increase in cycle lane length, an increase of 83 cycle counts per day (95% CI 32, 134) was observed. Removing car parking and traffic lanes were associated with an increase of 197 counts (108, 285) and 154 counts (58, 249), respectively. Adding a public transport stop showed a negative association with a change of −83 counts (−158, −8). Functions positively associated with cycle count changes were improving safety (75, 95% CI 8, 141) and space (72, 95% CI 10, 135). Conclusions This study sheds light on cycling infrastructure design influences on cycling behavior.

With these data, a novel analysis was completed to further the understanding of where, when, and why (meteorologically) roadway flooding occurs on Nebraska state and federal highways. In the study period, 298 roadway floods occurred, with an annual median of 16 per year. There was a greater risk for roadway floods to transpire more frequently in eastern Nebraska, which was attributed to the spatial climatology of heavy rainfall and the higher density of roadways and rivers. Consequently, this increases the exposure and vulnerability of the highway system across the eastern portion of the state. Further, precursor soil moisture and river conditions proved to be critical initiators of roadway floods, as precipitation totals prior to each flood only averaged at 40 mm, while precursor Palmer Hydrological Drought Index values for 75% of events were above 4.0 and river levels were 200 cm above its daily medians. Overall, the complexities of these roadway flooding events are challenging for proactively forecasting as opposed to reacting to the situation. With the top roadway flooding locations identified along with the weather-related causes, further investigation of roadway flooding hotspots across the state needs to take place for mitigation and resiliency in a changing climate. The methods of this research can be used across other states and by other agencies to analyze and increase the resilience of their respective roadway networks.",2590-1982,Not found

Very few studies have assessed the effect of various COVID-19 restrictions (i.e., Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and Movement Control Order (MCO)) on the trip duration. This study aims to 1) examine the changes in travel patterns, the frequency of daily and weekly trips and trip duration; 2) evaluate the significant difference between trip duration before COVID-19, during CMCO and MCO; 3) analyse the effect of COVID-19 restrictions on the trip duration of different age groups; and 4) investigate the influence of household characteristics, daily, and weekly trips on trip duration in Greater Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. The research was based on the data collected in Greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during CMCO (December 2020) and MCO (January 2021). The visualisation techniques (Chord and Sankey diagrams), statistical tests (McNemar and Spearman correlation), and multinomial logistic regression modelling were applied in this study. The results revealed that daily trips were directly linked with car availability during CMCO, weekly trips were indirectly associated with age, and medium (3 to 8 h) duration trips were directly linked with car availability and household size during MCO. Moreover, the work, recreational and other trips of 1 to 2 h were decreased, while grocery and dine-out trips of 1 to 2 h were increased during CMCO. COVID-19 restrictions affected the trip duration of older people, asolder people had shorter trips before COVID-19 and during CMCO. On the other hand,no association was found between age and average trip duration during MCO, which meansyounger and older people had the same proportion of shorter (0 to 2 h) duration trips during MCO.

According to recent scientific literature and institutional inputs at the European level, operational innovations such as the combination of passenger and freight flows may be an effective approach for promoting sustainable and energy-efficient FLM transport. In this study, the energy and environmental performances of an integrated passenger and freight transport system based on the bus network of Zrenjanin (Serbia) were investigated with different future energy mix and transport policy scenarios. The operational aspects of the integrated system were designed through collaboration with territorial stakeholders and an analysis of local planning documents. The performance was evaluated and compared with current public transport and freight schemes considering vehicle fuel and technology, total mileage, and other relevant endogenous and exogenous factors. The results of our analysis indicate operational benefits and energy savings, mainly due to reduced total mileage and the predisposition to shift to the active modes for the last mile. However, most expected long-term energy savings are the result of technological development of vehicles and modal shifts induced by policy strategies.",2590-1982,Not found
Contrail minimization through altitude diversions: A feasibility study leveraging global data,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100953,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"As global flight volume rises, the aviation industry is facing increasing climate challenges. One major factor is the impact of contrails, which trap outgoing terrestrial radiation and counteract emission reduction benefits from emission-optimized flight routes. Our study quantifies contrail-forming flights globally and assesses altitude adjustments necessary to avoid these regions. Using the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive and global flight data from 2021-2022, we highlight several contrail-prone regions with high air traffic volumes and high potential for contrail-formation. We propose an operational strategy in altitude diversion, which can halve the amount of persistent contrails. Further, we analyse the additional carbon emissions caused by the altitude diversions and safety risks in terms of potential new conflicts. Our findings provide actionable strategies for policymakers to balance climate mitigation and operational challenges in aviation.",2590-1982,Not found
"Older adult access to health care services in Ban Phaeo, Thailand: A case study using geospatial analysis",10.1016/j.trip.2023.100946,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Ensuring the aging population can access health services is a major challenge for those living in the rural areas of Thailand. This study focuses on examining health care access in older adults aged 60 years and older in the Ban Phaeo, Samut Sakhon Province of Thailand. We used spatial analysis to examine roadway networks that connect Ban Phaeo to the health care system. Those that could access health care were in better physical health. Conversely, those who could not access health care had poorer health and more difficulties with activities of daily living. Geospatial modelling shows that access to health care was impacted by poor road connectivity and road conditions, which further exasperate health issues of rural older adults who are in poor health as they cannot receive timely care. This study shows the lack of transportation infrastructure impacts that marginalized groups the most. To improve connectivity from rural regions to health care facilities, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed to facilitate collaboration among multiple groups of stakeholders to improve transportation access for older adults living in the rural regions of the Ban Phaeo District of Thailand.",2590-1982,Not found

This study examines the travel behavior of low-income individuals with chronic medical conditions, namely, diabetes and hypertension, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Special attention is paid to grocery shopping and medical-related trips, two major types of activities these individuals perform that require transportation, especially their use of public transport for these activities. From a survey of 263 individuals in Atlanta, Georgia, the study suggests limited adjustments in travel behavior among low-income, chronically ill individuals during the pandemic. The frequency, length, and modal choice of the two types of essential trips (i.e., grocery shopping and medical-related trips) largely followed their pre-COVID behavior, and the use of public transport was not significantly affected by local levels of COVID transmission. Apart from pre-COVID modal choice, the most important factors affecting public transport use were access to private vehicles and transportation assistance programs.",2590-1982,Not found

Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a viable environmentally friendly alternative that has the potential to facilitate an effective shift towards a sustainable transportation system with low emissions while preserving environment; however, well-intentioned policies and other incentives have not been able to transcend the technological, infrastructure, and financial barriers that prevent their adoption. This study aims to develop a model that depicts the impact of the barriers on EV adoption. The model, developed and empirically validated with data collected from 733 respondents to a questionnaire survey, employed the structural equation modeling technique and revealed that of the four categories of barriers, only the environmental barriers are not significant.

Predicting modal choice for urban transport using an algebraic equation,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100947,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Demand estimation and forecasting is an essential step in urban passenger transport planning. Relating the factors that influence the modal choice behavior of individuals facilitates demand estimation. In this study, we develop machine learning models that consider individuals' demographic, socioeconomic, and travel characteristics to justify their mode choice. Two datasets are used to train and validate the models. We use logistic regression and multilayer perceptron models to classify public or private transportation trips. It was observed that a multilayer perceptron model with a low number of parameters could predict modal selection with an accuracy exceeding 90%. We derive an algebraic equation from this result to perform modal selection prediction. Our results show that the models can effectively predict the mode of transportation of individuals based on their demographic and travel characteristics.",2590-1982,Not found
A human factors perspective on how to keep SAE Level 3 conditional automated driving safe,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100959,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines Conditional Automated Driving (CAD) or SAE level 3 as the next step in the transition to higher automated driving. A human factors challenge at this level is to keep the fallback-ready user aware of the driving situation. The problem with the widely accepted terminology of SAE is that it does not consider the human factors of achieving this safety-critical transition and lacks in defining a required or appropriate state of fallback readiness and how a human reaches this state. This paper aims to understand how research and industry currently perceive the problem and how they counteract it. We conducted exploratory expert interviews with N = 15 subject matter experts from universities, research centres and vehicle manufacturers. Based on the findings of the expert interviews, we discuss how fallback-ready users might be kept in the loop. The results show that the user should remain physically and sensory in the state of regular drivers to allow a safe transition, which narrows down the problem to maintaining an appropriate cognitive state, level of arousal, and motivational conditions. Lastly, the experts identify that the NDRA should be (a) limited to the onboard-entertainment system and (b) context-aware and (temporarily) restricted or interrupted. We provide concrete design recommendations grounded in (or drawing upon) theoretical frameworks and current human factors expert views and highlight specific challenges that require more research.",2590-1982,Not found
Association of bike-sharing service with gentrification in a transit-rich city: A catalyst or an outcome?,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100941,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This research aims to clarify the relationships between bike infrastructure changes and the gentrification processes by considering the pre-existing mass rapid transit (MRT) system and using gentrifiable neighborhood data from 2011 to 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan. Empirical evidence suggests that gentrifying neighborhoods accorded further accessibility to bike-sharing service (BSS), and increasing MRT service accessibility raised gentrification and BSS accessibility. However, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that equipping bike infrastructure catalyzes gentrification. Instead, an MRT system has a more significant effect on gentrification than bike infrastructure in a city where BSS acts as a last-mile mode of public transport. The results of this research not only clarify relationships between bike infrastructure and gentrification but also offer policy directions to develop inclusive bike-friendly cities.",2590-1982,Not found
Systematic review on the evaluation of the effects of ride-hailing services on public road transportation,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100943,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"In the last few years, there has been a rise in interest in ride-hailing as a novel form of urban transportation and mobility service. This comprehensive literature analysis evaluates how ride-hailing services affect public road transportation in terms of traffic congestion, safety and security. The evaluation is grounded in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, which includes a thorough search for pertinent studies, careful article screening and selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. This systematic literature review analyses and summarises data from 160 studies examining how ride-hailing services affected public road transportation. The literature review results indicated that ride-hailing services affect public road transportation positively and negatively, depending on various variables such as the regulatory environment, user behaviour, and service accessibility. The positives include greater environmental sustainability, lessening traffic congestion, and increased accessibility and comfort for riders. Nevertheless, the negatives comprise heightened competition among public transportation companies, decreased funding for public transit agencies, and perhaps even unfavourable consequences on ride-hailing drivers' working conditions. Based on the results of our literature review, we can conclude that there is a need for additional research to investigate the intricate relationships between ride-hailing services and public road transportation, as well as to develop suitable policy measures to minimise unfavourable effects and maximise the potential benefits of these ride-hailing services.",2590-1982,Not found
Strategy and safety at stop intersections in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and visual decline,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100939,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This study assessed the impact of age-related cognitive and visual declines on stop-controlled intersection stopping and scanning behaviors across varying roadway, traffic, and environmental challenges. Real-world driver data, collected from drivers’ personal vehicles using in-vehicle sensor systems, was analyzed in 68 older adults (65–90 years old) with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and with a range of age-related visual declines. Driver behavior, environmental characteristics, and traffic characteristic were examined across 2,596 approaches at 173 stop-controlled intersections. A mixed-effects logistic regression modeled stopping behavior as a binary response (full stop or rolling/no-stop). Overall, drivers who scanned more on intersection approaches (OR = 0.77) or had more visual decline (OR = 2.28) were more likely to make full stops at a stop-controlled approach. Drivers with a contrast sensitivity logMAR score > 0.8 showed the greatest probability of making a full stop compared across all drivers. Drivers without MCI were ∼ 5 times more likely to come to a full stop when they scanned more (23 % versus 5 % when they scanned less) compared to drivers with MCI, who were only twice as likely to stop (14 % versus 6 % when they scanned less). Drivers were more likely to fully stop on two-lane roadways (1.5 %), during night (2.0 %), and at intersections with opposing vehicles (10.4 %). Findings illuminate how driver strategies interact with underlying impairment. While drivers with visual decline adopt strategies that may improve safety, when drivers with MCI adopt strategies it did not result in the same degree of improvement in stopping which may result in greater risk.",2590-1982,Not found

Although several researchers have focused on accessibility to libraries, these works only consider the travel time or distance between communities and libraries, which may be an inadequate way of analyzing their accessibility. To provide a more realistic analysis, this paper uses the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA), and Three-Step Floating Catchment Area (3SFCA) methods to measure the accessibility of U.S. Census block groups to public libraries within Calhoun County, Florida, a rural county hit hard by Hurricane Michael in 2018. These methods define the service areas of libraries by a threshold travel time while accounting for their availability by the demand surrounding these facilities. Findings indicate there are disparities in accessibility among census block groups. The ones with higher population densities have lower accessibility to libraries which indicates that accessibility does not depend only on travel time as determined by other research works but also on the capacity of the service area. To improve the accessibility of public libraries in rural counties, this study recommends the creation of service areas for libraries in order to provide better service to the public, including vulnerable populations such as older adults.",2590-1982,Not found

However, the e-bike platform lacks discussion as a viable option for people with different abilities. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap, and in doing so, help realize the potential of e-bikes for all users. We reviewed the literature to understand people’s e-bike perceptions and any concerns and barriers that may be delaying the adoption of e-bikes among marginalized populations in the United States. The findings suggested that disabilities and advanced age negatively affected the way people perceive e-bikes. Conversely, positive perceptions were shaped by various factors including e-bike experience, personal cycling history, and openness to innovative technology. Significant concerns about e-bikes included safety, security, social stigma imposed on electric assistance, and loss of disability benefits. Along with these concerns, lack of knowledge, misperceptions, limited access, high purchase costs, and inadequate infrastructure were identified as major deterrents to adopting e-bikes. The findings also highlighted the need for programs, policies, and education to promote the acceptance of e-bikes as mobility aids.

The study employs a GIS statistical approach, namely spatial autocorrelation analysis, to identify the hotspots of traffic accidents in the city for the year 2014. Additionally, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 2017 among drivers involved in road accidents in Abu Dhabi City, which was divided into six major categories: accident-related, seatbelt-related, speed-related, policy-related, and general socio-related. The responses of 1,072 drivers were analyzed using logistical regression models, revealing careless driving as the primary reason for city road accidents. The study also found that age and driving experience had a significant impact on accident probability, indicating that middle-aged drivers were more likely to be involved in accidents and that the risk rate decreased as driving experience increased. The study concludes with suggestions for preventive measures to improve traffic safety in Abu Dhabi City. Finally, the study evaluated the hypothesis that most accidents occur near central business districts using 2014 crash data for Abu Dhabi city.

We considered the Lima Metropolitan Area as the target population because it represents the third largest part of Peru, with 8,894,412 inhabitants (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica, 2015). We developed and validated a pedestrian moral disengagement scale that provides relevant information about the justifications concerned when pedestrians commit transport infractions, which those in charge of transport management can use to make decisions regarding the design and planning of the infrastructure. The study was conducted in two phases. First, a questionnaire was developed with a 100–100-pedestrian sample in a two-stage brainstorming process validated by transport academic experts and psychologists. Second, a clustered instance of two stages of 405 pedestrians from Metropolitan Lima was analysed by applying exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results showed that the data collected were not parametric; Spearman’s correlation index validated the correlation between the items on the scale, and polychoric correlational analysis confirmed an underlying metrical variable; and the model exhibited a p-value of less than 0.001, a chi-square of 173 with 59 degrees of freedom, a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.0692, a comparative fit index (CFI) of o.937, a Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) of 0.917, and a standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) of 0.0457. The main conclusion was that the adjustment of the model was sufficient, considering the results obtained within the theoretical model proposed by Albert Bandura (1986) and within the phases of reliability and validation confirming the representation of the eight mechanisms of pedestrian moral disengagement in Metropolitan Lima through the 13 identified items. Furthermore, a chi-square analysis found that residents and commuters in the El Agustino district enjoyed holding on to moving vehicles while skating or cycling (item P1.10), with an asymptotic significance of 0.018. Similarly, residents and travellers in the Cieneguilla district were likely to ignore traffic lights and police instructions (item P1.13), with an asymptotic significance of 0.009.

Current approaches, using sparse networks of counters provide one possible route to more comprehensive data. In this paper we investigate another, using data collected from Paris’ bicycle sharing system to explore use during 2020. We chose 2020 as a test year because the use of bicycles was strongly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to explore how bicycle use adapted to both legal and environmental influences. We used interactive visualization to allow hypothesis generation and data exploration, before analysing bicycle use as a function of weather and COVID-19 restrictions. Our results show that bicycle sharing system data and Paris’ counters both capture very similar behaviour patterns, and therefore bicycle sharing system data are a reliable proxy for overall cycling behaviour, providing finer spatial granularity than existing sparse counter networks.

But the indicator focuses only on the mobility aspect of accessibility, omitting consideration of facility proximation. This article proposes a modified version of the RAI that incorporates two critical facilities: healthcare and education. Additionally, it examines whether the new RAI would result in a better representation of accessibility for Bangladesh. For this study, 40 upazilas (sub-regions) having above 80% rural population and reflecting diverse geographical regions were chosen as study areas. All data were collected from secondary sources. Buffer analysis and multiple regression models were developed for the two RAIs separately. Findings reveal the mean RAI to be 47.24, which was 76.83 for the World Bank (WB) method. About 29.6% people per upazila are located near quality roads but do not have basic facilities nearby. Based on regression models and further analysis, the proposed RAI is more credible for evaluating accessibility, whereas all parts of the existing RAI do not guarantee service availability. Irrespective of opportunities available, the average WB RAI remains around 75.53, which may not entirely reflect accessibility accurately.

Prolonged exposure to Covid-19 reduces risk perception which in turn leads to a weakened behavioral response. Attention responses and mobility reductions across all three mobility types are weaker in the second phase, given the same levels of actual and perceived risk, respectively.

The drivers in the experiment were encouraged to use electricity as much as possible within the LEZs, and the drivers were given a monetary incentive which simulates a distance-based RUC within the zones. Forty participants tested the system for several weeks. The technical data from the vehicles, and the participants' attitudes were measured both before and after testing the system and were analysed together to measure the participants' behavioural change and how this correlated with their attitudes towards the system. The results revealed a significant change in the drivers' attitudes before and after testing the system. The participants who were successful in using the LEZ system as intended (i.e. increased use of the electricity mode within the LEZ) gained a more positive attitude. There was no difference between the successful and the unsuccessful groups in their attitudes towards distance-based RUC. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how innovative transport policies aiming at regulating negative externalities from car use are affecting people's everyday life, as this is the major explanatory variable for user acceptance. Furthermore, the study also shows that using distance-based RUC as an incentive for stimulating to a mode shift to the electric engine in PHEVs is a promising avenue.",2590-1982,Not found
Impacts of North Carolina's medicaid transformation on community transit systems: A qualitative analysis with policy implications,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100918,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"North Carolina began its Medicaid Transformation implementation process in July of 2021. The Transformation shifted responsibility for arranging non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) for transportation-disadvantaged Medicaid beneficiaries from county Departments of Social Services (DSS) to private transportation brokers. Brokers also decide NEMT eligibility and select transportation service providers that best meet beneficiaries' transportation needs. Before this transition, county DSS offices relied on community transit organizations (CTOs) to coordinate NEMT and other human transportation services. This is a significant shift from North Carolina's coordinated transportation model, which emphasized coordinating medical and other trips using local transit providers. This paper examines how the Medicaid Transformation in the state has altered CTOs' ability to continue coordinating individual human service transportation programs. Findings from interviews and policy content analyses indicate that the Medicaid Transformation has negatively affected CTOs' ability to coordinate between individual human service transportation programs. Control of several mechanisms CTOs historically used to coordinate transportation programs has shifted to brokers, who are neither prepared nor intended to take on the coordination role. Since these programs serve various transportation-disadvantaged residents in the state, including those enrolled in Medicaid, obstacles that CTOs encounter while coordinating transportation affect these communities disproportionately. Several factors explain CTOs' diminished ability to coordinate transportation, including goals and policy misalignment between health and transportation state authorities, regional location disadvantages, and logistical constraints that emerged with the Transformation.",2590-1982,Not found
Using vignettes to explore policy tools for a self-driving transport future,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100922,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Researchers struggle to create simple yet nuanced diagrams or short abstracts that are easily comprehendible by non-experts. Research articles may be our primary communication method, but they are generally difficult to understand, making them unsuitable for general communication. This paper investigates a rarely used method in transport research – vignettes – to convey research results and elicit implications for public planners. Historically, these vignettes have been designed using qualitative methods, e.g., the Delphi method or by researchers' review of trends. However, this paper uses two vignettes originating from quantitative results from a simulation model paper (Almlöf et al., 2022), investigating the impacts of self-driving technology. Rewriting the results into two short stories – vignettes – these stories then served as the starting point for semi-structured interviews and a workshop with six public officials in Stockholm, Sweden. The vignettes were used to understand what these results would mean to the participants and how they would combat potential problems connected to sustainability, given the vignettes. Finally, the interviews and the workshop were qualitatively analysed, and policy tools were identified that can steer the transport system towards societal goals. The vignettes were a powerful tool to help the participants envision a future with self-driving transport options and promote critical thinking regarding how each participant would be affected, given such a future. As such, vignettes should be further explored to help researchers investigate abstract subjects which participants may have difficulties understanding.",2590-1982,Not found
Railway maintenance windows: Discrepancies between planning and practice in Sweden,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100927,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Efficient and timely maintenance is essential for the robust operation of infrastructure across all types of transport. In the railway sector, track maintenance presents unique challenges. Specifically, some maintenance tasks require track closures, which can disrupt train schedules. Coordinating these closures with regular train operations makes the scheduling process complicated. To ensure sufficient time for maintenance and prevent conflicts with train operations, the Swedish Transport Administration introduced “maintenance windows.” Maintenance windows, ranging from two to six hours, are periods designated for maintenance, with the track free from train operations. They are set before finalizing the annual train timetable. In this study, we examined the practical application of maintenance windows on a railway line in Southern Sweden from 2019 to 2020. Our findings reveal that while 10% of the total line capacity was allocated for maintenance windows, 11% of the capacity was used for maintenance. Alarmingly, 68% of trackwork occurred outside maintenance windows, and only 34% of the reserved maintenance window capacity was utilized. There is a significant discrepancy between the time and location reserved for maintenance windows and their actual utilization. To address this, we propose aligning maintenance windows more closely with contractor needs by 1) incorporating maintenance windows on the weekends, 2) making maintenance windows available closer to the end of the planning horizon, 3) extending the duration of some maintenance windows, and 4) designing and integrating incentives to encourage contractors to operate within planned maintenance windows.",2590-1982,Not found

As one of the top-ranked global tourist destinations, Thailand has experienced significant effects on its economy and the well-being of its inhabitants. The objective of this study is to investigate the variations in tourists' behavior during and after the COVID-19 epidemic using the Health Belief Model and Travel planned behavior theories. Invariance analysis was tested across groups. The analysis revealed that attitude, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, government support, and perceived control had the most positive impact on travel intentions during the 2019 coronavirus epidemic. In contrast, perceived barriers, perceived severity, and health motivation had significant negative influences. Concerning behavioral intention after the outbreak, all the factors were significantly associated positively. The most influential factors were perceived susceptibility, attitude, health motivation, perceived behavioral control, perceived benefits, perceived severity, perceived control, and government support, respectively. Furthermore, the models of both groups during and after the epidemic were significantly different.

Rail liberalization for Indonesian railways: Learn from the experience of Germany and France,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100916,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The European Union (EU) has long been regarded as a model for global rail liberalization. Rail reform experiences from EU members have been well documented in recent years to comply with new EU legislation requiring EU members to introduce competition for passenger rail services beginning in 2020. However, outside of Europe, the discussion of rail restructuring remains limited. This article examined rail reform in South East Asia, more specifically in Indonesia, by examining domestic policy, access charges, and pricing principles, as well as market growth. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of two European Union members – Germany and France – to identify lessons learned. Several critical issues include the following: 1) the vertical integration model used in France and Germany can be adopted with some adjustments to accommodate the national context; 2) government support through the use of subsidies cannot be separated from public transportation such as railways, but the amount will most likely depend on the rail market, policy, and institutional landscape; and 3) an independent regulatory body should be established to open the rail market to competition and promote fair access and contracting.",2590-1982,Not found
Predictors of rural driver self-reported passing behaviors when interacting with farm equipment on the roadway,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100926,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Background Crashes involving farm equipment (FE) are a major safety concern for farmers as well as all other users of the public road system in both rural and urban areas. These crashes often involve passenger vehicle drivers striking the farm equipment from behind or attempting to pass, but little is known about drivers’ perceived norms and self-reported passing behaviors. The objective of this study is to examine factors influencing drivers' farm equipment passing frequencies and their perceptions about the passing behaviors of other drivers. Methods Data were collected via intercept surveys with adult drivers at local gas stations in two small rural towns in Iowa. The survey asked drivers about their demographic information, frequency of passing farm equipment, and perceptions of other drivers' passing behavior in their community and state when approaching farm equipment (proximal and distal descriptive norms). A multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the relationship between descriptive norms and self-reported passing behavior. Results Survey data from 201 adult drivers showed that only 10% of respondents considered farm equipment crashes to be a top road safety concern. Respondents who perceived others passing farm equipment frequently in their community were more likely to report that they also frequently pass farm equipment. The results also showed interactions between gender and experience operating farm equipment in terms of self-reported passing behavior. Conclusions/implications Results from this study suggest local and state-level norms and perceptions of those norms may be important targets for intervention to improve individual driving behaviors around farm equipment.",2590-1982,Not found
Brussels mobility in 2050: Participatory mixed-method scenario building to explore alternative futures,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100919,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Mobility is deeply embedded in people’s everyday lives and fundamental in shaping society. Therefore, transport policy needs to be embedded in a well-grounded view of the future, while also being resilient to external shocks. One of the difficulties in ensuring the resilience of transportation systems is the large variety of factors of uncertainty that characterizes the field. Scenario building is one method that can address this issue by exploring alternative futures besides a most likely or desired one. But to increase the likelihood of translating exploratory scenarios into policy making, these should be developed in a participatory manner. One of the difficulties encountered when developing scenarios using quantitative methods is that these methods are often a black box for participants, while qualitative methods on their own can lack legitimacy. Mixed-method approaches can therefore be an interesting avenue for research to facilitate participation in transport scenario building, by providing a mathematical structuring of the scenarios, enriched with qualitative stakeholder input. In this paper, we explore how participation can be facilitated in mixed-method scenario building. We further elaborate on the combination of a systems dynamic-approach (cross-impact balance analysis) with creative workshops by testing three approaches to facilitate participation: a Delphi survey, personas, and the use of visual harvesting. We develop four scenarios for the future of urban mobility in Brussels, Belgium, by 2050, and report on the lessons learnt. We find that the use of Delphi as a stakeholder engagement method too rapidly closes down the scenario funnel when used for selecting factors of uncertainty. The use of personas allows for the development of engaging narratives, and could be helpful for the involvement of people less familiar with participatory exercises. Lastly, the use of visuals throughout the workshops was found to stimulate active discussion and resulted in a more transparent scenario development process, by increasing traceability.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring walking from the perspective of theory of planned behavior,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100931,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Theory of planned behavior (TPB) is a social cognition model that proposes that a persons’ surroundings influences their behavior. Pedestrian studies based on TPB are few, and often, not only measure walking subjectively, but also have very generic measures of TPB constructs that do not account for built environment. Urban planners have, on the other hand, emphasized for decades the importance of built environment on walking and use of public spaces. This paper aims to develop a detailed understanding of the factors that affect an individual’s walking that would assist planners in developing strategies to increase the modal share of walking. Thus, unlike most studies, it measures attitude towards and perceived control over the behavior (i.e., walking) and the built environment, in addition to measuring walking objectively (at both individual and trip levels). Data was collected in the autumn of 2019 in Umeå, Sweden, using a smartphone app in the form of GPS-based travel data (i.e., distance, time, location, activity) and survey questions (i.e., demographics and psychological constructs of TPB). The results reinforced previous findings that attitude and perceived control correlate to walking and identified the key variables under each behavioral construct. The purpose, the reasons people like to walk and their attitude towards the built environment showed significant correlation to individuals’ walking behavior. Perceived control over the behavior and built environment, was also found to have a significant correlation to walking. Thus, this paper makes important methodological contribution towards using TPB to analyze walking.",2590-1982,Not found
Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on use and perception of shared e-scooters,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100925,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Micro-mobility, such as electric scooters (e-scooters) and bicycles, has gained attraction in recent years by offering reduced emissions, decreased congestion, and improved public health. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior and mode choices have changed. As such, shared micro-mobility are likely more vulnerable to these changes, as a relatively new mode, with less habitual riders and their shared nature perceived as a higher risk. The objective of this paper is to understand how preferences and perceptions of micro-mobility changed before, during, and potentially after the pandemic, and relative to quarantine behavior. Shared e-scooter trip data (N = 2604) before and during the pandemic, and survey data (N = 134) during the pandemic, were collected in one small- to mid-sized US city. Number of e-scooter trips decreased while duration of trips increased during the pandemic. People who only left their houses for essential activities and/or work reported using public transit and transportation network companies (e.g., Uber) significantly less during the pandemic, but there was no association between their use of micro-mobility and timeframes of the pandemic. People who left their houses similar to before the pandemic did not significantly change their mode choices during the pandemic. Most respondents were neutral in opinion about sanitary levels of shared micro-mobility, suggesting an opportunity to attract riders through new hygiene initiatives. Micro-mobility operators and jurisdictions can use these insights on perception and use of shared transport modes as travel behavior adjusts post pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found

This study investigated travel constraints and constraint negotiation in post-COVID-19 road-based tourism in Indonesia. An online questionnaire survey was administered to Indonesian road tourists including self-drive tourists between May to July 2022. The resulting 510 completed questionnaires were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling. Road trips were more popular than flights during the recovery stage of COVID-19. Intrapersonal travel constraints were the largest problem for road-based tourism. This research advances the understanding of road trip travel behaviour in Indonesia and travel constraints after a crisis. The study applies the constraint negotiation model in a road-based travel context.

Reduced leisure activity space and differing risk profiles due to public health interventions changed people’s ability to participate in different discretionary activity types. Using survey samples collected in 2019 and 2020, this paper conducted comprehensive statistical tests for temporal stability and gender difference of leisure variety and its contributing factors such as social capital, mobility, personalities, and demographics on leisure variety. Model inference shows an average 37% reduction in leisure variety in 2020, ceteris paribus. Individuals with more social capital, particularly instrumental capital, have substantial and significantly higher leisure activity variety, and the effect size remains temporally stable before and during the pandemic. This result suggests social capital robustly impacts activity variety even under drastic changes and restrictions. Openness to experience remains temporally stable and consistent between genders, but age, household size, and extraversion are among the factors that exhibit temporal instability.",2590-1982,Not found
Gendered access to household car in China: The mediation role of subjective attitudes,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100914,22,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Increasing women’s access to car is advocated as a key strategy to improve women’s capability to move. However, car ownership is not equal to car access and independent car use. The men-favored car distribution within the household may exist to limit women’s access to car. This paper enriches the understanding of gendered access to household car by unpacking the mediation role of subjective attitudes. Perceived necessity to use household car and confidence in driving ability are examined specifically. The results of structural equation modelling support the assumptions that in China, (a) perceived necessity increases individual access to household cars; (b) being employed and in parenthood both increase women’s perceived necessity and thus the access to household car, while men’s access to household car and perceived necessity is increased only by the employment status; and (c) women’s access to household car is reduced by their tendency to lack confidence in driving. The findings suggest that recognizing the necessity of using a car and developing the confidence to drive is essential for women to improve their automobile mobility.",2590-1982,Not found

Most recently, the bike market is being differentiated and sales of innovative bike types such as cargo bikes and e-bikes are growing rapidly. Even though the importance of these particular vehicles is increasing greatly, little is known about specific route preferences applicable. Hence, we evaluate a graphically assisted online discrete choice experiment. We investigate the route preferences of users of different types of bikes. By applying mixed logit models, we estimate the differences in the valuation of infrastructure characteristics between users of regular bikes, cargo bikes and e-bikes. Results show that users of both, cargo bikes and e-bikes value a high-quality infrastructure even higher than users of regular bikes do. Higher route requirements of users of innovative bike types strengthen the importance of upgrading the infrastructure as these vehicles are becoming increasingly popular.",2590-1982,Not found

This article analyzes how car use interacts with living an active life and how this has changed over time in Sweden. National time use data were used to analyze change in two cross sections of older people (65–84 years old) over a ten-year period (2000/01–2010/11). Previous studies concentrated on the relationship between travel behavior as such and older adult’s access to driver’s licenses and cars. We offer an integrated approach that includes all daily activities as we explore the changing social distribution of car use, as well as how different levels of car use are associated with time spent on active aging activities that benefit individuals and society. We conclude that an increasing proportion of the older population in Sweden are moderate to heavy car users and identify convergence over time between car use by older women and older men. We also find that heavy car users spend more time traveling to active aging activities. At first glance, this finding suggest that older people in Sweden are dependent on a car for living an active life. However, examination of how much time is actually spent on active activities after travel time is excluded reveals that few significant differences remain. This nuances the idea that access to a car is a necessity for spending time in activities that contribute to society and to personal well-being in old age.",2590-1982,Not found
Will air taxis extend public transportation?

Electrical vertical takeoff and landing aircrafts, also known as air taxis, enable the use of a new dimension, the skyscape. Air taxis provide a local, emission-free transport option and an infrastructure-conserving solution for the public transportation sector. While the technical implementation has already proved itself, user awareness is not yet widespread. Additionally, essential feasibility factors for public use, such as price, have received scant attention. Since user acceptance is necessary for successful implementation, and willingness to pay is another important indicator for future infrastructure planning, this study aims to investigate different urban transport scenarios. Within the framework of the study, societal acceptance, individual intention to use, and willingness to pay were investigated. Data collection took place in the greater Dresden area in Germany, with a final sample of 1,074 participants. The resulting data suggest an overall limited intention to use and societal acceptance. The scenario analysis revealed a “limousine-like” dial-a-ride scenario as a potential successful path to follow, in which a transitional path with initial dial-a-ride services and growing scheduled services over time is regarded as the most probable. Consumers’ willingness to pay was highest for the limousine scenario. Based on this research, governmental authorities and industry stakeholders may consider the findings to develop a human-centered approach for future mobility and ensure successful implementation in the mobility networks of the future.",2590-1982,Not found
Project risks and regulation in transport infrastructure: A study in Brazilian agencies concessions planning process,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101031,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Concession of transport assets has been widely adopted in transport infrastructure projects to improve efficiency.

The concession of transport infrastructure assets is complex and involves many stages, from planning to the end of the contract. In the planning stage, the project’s potential risks can be identified, and strategies to mitigate them can be defined. Many studies have been published recently discussing risks in transport concessions, however, the practices of regulatory agencies in risk identification and mitigation are incipient. In this scenario, this study debates the inclusion of potential project risks in real concession projects in a developing country. The first step to achieving our goal is identifying the main risks in Public-Private Partnership (PPP) published studies through a literature review. As a main result of this phase, 78 risks are presented and classified as measurable and unmeasurable. In a second step, we have selected recent Brazilian transport concession appraisal studies: an airport, a road, and a port terminal.

The responses were analyzed using FAHP method, which resulted in a prioritized list of factors affecting mode choice for freight transport and the preferred mode choices for different future routes. Results indicated that the criteria for mode choice can be ranked as follows in order of decreasing significance: safety, CO2 emission, cost, reliability, speed, flexibility, and capacity. The rail mode is the preferable one for 2, out of the 3 proposed routes, while the dedicated truck lane is the most convenient choice because of the short distance and the nature of the commodities moved along this corridor.

Supply level planning for shared e-scooters considering spatiotemporal heteroscedastic demand,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101019,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Accurate demand forecasting is a key success for mobility service businesses, especially shared electric (e-)scooters, for their volatile demand, high operational costs, and strict regulations. The heteroscedasticity of transportation demand is usually overlooked even it is very important for designing efficient supply management. This study proposed a supply planning framework considering heteroscedasticity in the hourly e-scooter demand. Three shared e-scooter datasets (Austin TX, Minneapolis MN, and Thammasat TH) were examined to extract temporal patterns. These features were used as inputs for the demand prediction models, including machine learning and deep learning models. Then, the squared residuals were subjected to variance prediction, including constant or daily variance and variance predicted by Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH). Finally, the outputs of these models were combined to determine the supply level. Four supply level models (with constant, daily, Seasonal Generalized ARCH or SGARCH, and Box Cox variances) were compared based on the Mean Oversupply (MO) metric. As a result, demand prediction models with Box Cox transformed data possibly provide higher prediction accuracy than those with original or normalized data, specifically Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Supply level models with Box Cox variance had the lowest MO at lower percentages of served demand, whereas those with SGARCH variance had lower MO at higher percentages of served demand. At 95 % served demand, considering heteroscedastic demand in supply level planning could reduce oversupply by 26.22 %. From a policy perspective, operators could use our framework to minimize the demand uncertainty for daily operation, along with other potential policies such as customer incentives and hybrid real-time and periodic rebalancing.",2590-1982,Not found
Does access to voting locations affect the choice to vote?,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101029,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"One means of increasing voting participation among populations that have been deliberately disenfranchised in the past is to make it easier for them to reach polling locations. The potential abuse of power posed by determining voting locations is underscored by the well-established effect of distance to polling locations on voter turnout. In this work, we address two open questions related to the effect of access to polling locations on voting participation. First, we extend previous studies by evaluating five voting location accessibility metrics in terms of their relationship to voter turnout. Second, in light of concerns about disenfranchisement of non-white voters, we evaluate whether the effects of voting accessibility on participation varies by race. We evaluate voting in the City of Atlanta, Georgia, during the 2020 general election, which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the likelihood of voting differs by as much as 2% for people located one minute closer to a polling location by car, although this relationship is only evident using one of the five accessibility measures. This estimate may be muted due to the prevalence of absentee voting during the pandemic. We also find that the effects of accessibility vary depending on a voters’ race, raising questions about the mechanisms behind the relationship between accessibility and voter participation.

Analyzing impact of infrastructure lockdowns on bike-sharing in Chicago,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101015,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent measures taken to control its spread had deep impacts on transportation behavior. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the changes in bike-share use and focuses on the identification of extraordinary trip-making activity seen in Chicago’s Divvy bike-share program prior to and over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis period from January 2018 to April 2021 was subdivided into three time periods: pre-pandemic, citywide lockdown, and post-lockdown for all census tracts within the city of Chicago. Over the analysis window defined, an anomaly detection algorithm was used to characterize the nature of bike-share usage where anomalous trips were those that fell outside of the forecasted ranges. The changes in census tract-level bike-share usage were used to interpret how static census tract-level attributes—land use, transit connectivity, demographics, and bike infrastructure—may have contributed to varying responses across the city’s bike-share system. Principal component analysis was used to interpret the relationship between the dynamic trip-making characterizations and the static census tract-level attributes. Census tracts that transitioned from exhibiting below average to above average bike-share trip-making tended to have highly correlated bike infrastructure metrics. On the other hand, census tracts with consistently above average trip-making had highly correlated demographic characteristics, the values of which were consistent with their standing as key communities for service and essential workers. Overall, results indicate that post-lockdown, bike-sharing activity had grown significantly across the entire city, supporting the claim that the pandemic worked to accelerate bicycling uptake in urban areas.",2590-1982,Not found
Mill Valley evacuation study,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101021,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Traffic evacuation planning can be essential in saving lives in case of natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires. We build on a case study of traffic evacuation planning for the city of Mill Valley, CA. We run a microscopic traffic simulator to examine various evacuation scenarios. We modify some crucial aspects of a previous study to make the simulation more pertinent. For a citywide evacuation, we quantify the importance of decreasing the number of vehicles per household. We find a set of changes that can significantly reduce the evacuation time by routing more traffic to the least-used highway on-ramps. We show results when evacuating various areas of the city one at a time.",2590-1982,Not found
From local to global: Uniting neighborhood planning units for more efficient walks,10.1016/j.trip.2023.101014,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This study examined the critical but scarcely analyzed topic of integration in neighborhood planning units (NPUs) by analyzing local and global integration across 12 distinct NPU network designs in Abu Dhabi, including two different suburban phases. Utilizing pedestrian route directness (PRD) and Betweenness centrality as analytical tools, this study conducted an analysis covering four specialized tasks, each representing a distinct aspect of a trip ranging from a local to a global scale by using streets only and streets with alley scenarios. The results showed that global directness in NPUs notably outperforms local directness in street-only analyses, challenging longstanding beliefs regarding inherent NPU segregation. Furthermore, the study categorized grid networks as comprising concentrated centrality, whereas fragmented and interlocked networks exhibited dispersed centrality. After incorporating alleys into the analysis, an enhancement of street directness was observed across all networks on the local and global scales. In addition, the alleys exhibited centrality dispersion across all tested networks, along with a slight increase in centrality concentration in the selected segments. This study develops an initiative for improved neighborhood planning by promoting a more comprehensive understanding of global NPU integration.",2590-1982,Not found
Forecasting the demand for railway freight transportation in Kazakhstan: A case study,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101028,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Effective resource planning in railway freight transportation necessitates precise demand forecasting, shaped by a complex array of dynamic variables. In Kazakhstan, the National State-owned Railway Company (KTZ) underwent a transition from traditional expert-based forecasting methods to the application of mathematical models, notably the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Employing historical data spanning from 2012 to 2016, this shift signifies a significant evolution in KTZ's approach to anticipating freight demand. The primary objective of this study is the empirical assessment of the efficacy of the ARIMA model in comparison to conventional qualitative forecasting techniques. Through the analysis of actual data from 2017, utilizing established metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), this research substantiates the utility of time series analysis through ARIMA. The findings not only confirm the model's effectiveness but also emphasize its superiority in refining the precision of railway freight demand forecasts, particularly within the unique context of Kazakhstan. Beyond the validation of methodologies, this research serves as a precursor to advanced forecasting practices, offering the potential to redefine resource planning in the railway industry. By extending the predictive horizon to 2024, the manuscript aligns with contemporary standards, providing nuanced insights for operational and developmental considerations in Kazakhstan's railway freight sector. This expansion positions the study within the evolving landscape of the industry, ensuring a comprehensive and forward-looking contribution to efficient resource allocation and modernized planning practices.",2590-1982,Not found
Socio-environmental factors associated with active school travel in children at ages 6 and 8 years,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101026,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Active school travel (AST) confers considerable health and environmental benefits. While evidence on AST associates for older children, and in relation to the physical built environment, has grown significantly over time, less is known regarding AST associates in younger children and socio-environmental associates of AST in this age group. In this research, we seek to determine the relationships between a range of factors across the ecological spectrum and children’s AST at 6 years and at 8 years of age, controlling for maternal education and number of times moved since 4 years. Structural equation modelling was used to identify factors associated with AST at 6 years. Due to the poor overall fit for the 8 year SEM model, a path model was instead performed to explore the direct relationships between AST and other observed variables. At both 6 and 8 years, importance of living close to schools had a significant and positive relationship with AST (standardised estimates = 0.31 and 0.19 respectively, both p < 0.001), and a significant negative relationship with AST was found for perceived distance to schools (estimates = -0.46 and −0.47 respectively, both p < 0.001). At 8 years, negative associations with AST were detected for parent/caregiver involvement with school (-0.071, p = 0.099) and children being of Pacific ethnicity (-0.100, p = 0.030). Distance remains the overriding factor associated with AST in young children – efforts to ensure children have easy access to, and are supported to attend, schools in close proximity to home are warranted.",2590-1982,Not found
Towards a framework of driver fitness: Operationalization and comparative risk assessment,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101030,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Whereas driver fitness is widely recognized as a prerequisite for safety, the construct lacks a formal framework. We present the first steps towards its operationalization. We interpret availability and allocation of cognitive and physiological resources as fitness dimensions, and risk factors fatigue/drowsiness, distraction/inattention, intoxication, sudden incapacitation and speeding as state variables loading on these dimensions. We collect and synthesize US crash data, and calculate Relative Risks R R and Population Attributable Fractions A F p . Sudden incapacitation ( R R = 32.112) is the most detrimental to individual safety, followed by alcohol intoxication ( R R = 11 . 277 ), fatigue/drowsiness ( R R = 4 . 966 ), speeding ( R R = 2 . 743 ), and inattention/distraction ( R R = 0 . 241 ). Taking into account prevalence, alcohol intoxication has the largest impact ( A F p = 0 . 068 ), followed by speeding ( A F p = 0 . 065 ), fatigue/drowsiness ( A F p = 0 . 059 ), incapacitation ( A F p = 0 . 013 ) and inattention/distraction ( A F p = − 0 . 416 ). Alcohol intoxication plays a major role in fatal crashes ( R R = 47 . 341 , A F p = 0 . 247 ), followed by speeding ( R R = 9 . 364 , A F p = 0 . 25 ). The analysis emphasizes the dangers of intoxicated driving and speeding, but also reveals shortcomings in census data, notably an under-representation of inattention, as well as the need for specific data collection on intoxication, reckless driving and sudden incapacitation in crashes. Taken together, the conceptual model and data synthesis provide a first step towards a framework of driver fitness; formalizing hypotheses on causal relations and providing crude estimates of factor loadings. This framework has practical applications as a model for multimodal driver monitoring systems, and to calculate risk factor impacts to inform policy makers.",2590-1982,Not found
Does range or fiscal policies matter on EV adoption in Jakarta Metropolitan Area?,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101027,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Indonesian Government (GOI) is planning to implement electric vehicles (EVs) in its big cities, especially in the Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA). The GOI implemented fiscal policies (vehicle tax and other related taxes relaxations) to increase EV adoption. At the same time, it is also known that EV has an issue with the driving range. Range extender (RE) is one of the methods to increase the EV range. This study aims to test whether fiscal policies and implementation of RE and other factors are significant on EV adoption. At first, we conducted exploratory study to find out influential attributes for car purchase intention. After that, a stated choice experiment with three alternatives, battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and internal combustion engine (ICE), was carried out with respondents from JMA. In total, we obtained 472 valid responses for eight scenarios which resulted in 3,776 observations. We used a mixed multinomial logit model (MMNL) to show the trade-off among the applications of several hypothetical fiscal policies and RE on EV choice decisions. Additionally, with MMNL, we also calculated the willingness to pay and demand elasticities. We found that fiscal policy in the form of purchase price subsidy significantly influences the decision to choose BEV and PHEV. RE is also found to be significant for BEV and PHEV choice. It is a good sign for implementing fiscal policies on EV adoption. Finally, the results of this study would be beneficial as insight to EV adoption in Nusantara (New Capital City of Indonesia).",2590-1982,Not found
Risky driving behavior among public transport vehicle drivers in Ethiopia using the health belief model,10.1016/j.trip.2023.101011,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Introduction Every year, road traffic accidents cause 1.35 million deaths and up to 50 million disabilities worldwide. Low and middle-income countries account for 93% of all fatalities, despite owning 60% of the world's vehicles. Road traffic accidents contributed to a fatality rate of37 persons per 100,000 inhabitants in Ethiopia each year, with risky driving behavior accounting for 83% of traffic crashes. Using the health belief model, this study aimed to examine risky driving behavior and its associated factors among public transport vehicle drivers in East Gojjam Zone, North West Ethiopia, in 2021. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 369 public transport vehicle drivers selected by a multi-stage sampling technique. Data collected through the interviewer-administered technique were entered into Epidata version 4.6 and exported to Stata software version 14 for further statistical analysis. Multiple linear regression models were fitted with statistical significance at a p-value of 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval. Results A total of 369 drivers were interviewed, with a response rate of 94.1 %. The mean risky driving behavior score was 1.74 (SD + 0.36), with an expected value of a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5, and actual minimum and maximum values of 1 and 3, respectively. Perceived severity (B = -0.23; 95 % CI (-0.37–-0.08)), perceived benefit (B = -0.58; 95 % CI (-0.68–-0.47)), perceived barrier (B = 0.23; 95 % CI (0.16–0.30)), and self-efficacy (B = -0.22; 95 % CI (-0.31–-0.13)) were statistically significant variables. The perceived benefit was the strongest predictor of risky driving behavior, and health belief model constructs explained 62.2 % of the variation in risky driving behavior. Conclusion Perceived severity, perceived benefit, perceived barrier, and self-efficacy were statistically significant variables, so corrective measures should focus on maximizing perceived severity, perceived benefit, and self-efficacy and minimizing perceived barriers.",2590-1982,Not found

Data from a survey of all car-owning households in California are combined with data on public PEV charging and PEV registrations to estimate a structural equation model to test the direct and indirect effects of public charging density on whether participants see charging infrastructure and whether they have considered acquiring a PEV. We also explore the direct and indirect effects of seeing public charging on PEV purchase consideration. Results show the density of public charging is neither directly nor indirectly related to whether people see public charging or their level of PEV purchase consideration. Our results suggests that for public charging to drive PEV sales growth, it may need to be accompanied by strategies to increase consumers’ engagement with PEVs.",2590-1982,Not found

Safety measures in the context of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication have been extensively investigated. However, ensuring safety measures for the Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and e-scooter riders remains an area that requires more focused research effort. The existing AV sensor suites offer diverse capabilities, covering blind spots, longer ranges, and resilience to weather conditions , benefiting the V2V and V2I scenarios. Nevertheless, the predominant emphasis has been on communicating and identifying other vehicles, leveraging advanced communication infrastructure for efficient status information exchange. The identification of VRUs introduces several challenges such as localization difficulties, communication limitations, and a lack of network coverage. This review critically assesses the state-of-the-art in the domains of V2X and AV technologies, aiming to enhance the identification, tracking, and localization of VRUs. Additionally, it proposes an end-to-end autonomous vehicle motion control architecture based on a temporal deep learning algorithm. The algorithm incorporates the dynamic behaviors of both visible and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) road users.

Access over ownership: Barriers and psychological motives for adopting mobility as a service (MaaS) from the perspective of users and non-users,10.1016/j.trip.2023.101005,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) can potentially create positive impacts for sustainability and social equity: MaaS could steer user choices away from the private car, and increase access to transport options for all social groups. Though MaaS is not an entirely new concept anymore, in terms of user numbers, it remains a niche phenomenon. We aimed to identify factors that support or hinder MaaS use by focusing on the perspectives of both users and non-users, considering their personal situations, preferences, and needs. Specifically, we investigated under which circumstances MaaS can convince individuals to reduce the use of or discard their private car, using the theory of material possessions which asserts that the motives for (car) ownership are not only of an instrumental nature, but can also be symbolic and affective. We employed a qualitative research approach, focusing on the MaaS case in Berlin, Germany. Data was collected in 12 focus group sessions of 3 to 5 users and non-users, following a semi-structured guideline. The sessions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results show that socio-economic factors play a smaller role than expected, and use cases center around non-habituated trips. The added value of MaaS compared to regular transit apps was often difficult to discern or irrelevant. Even if MaaS provided perfect service and functionality, certain groups of car users would still not consider it, due to the vehement symbolic and affective motives associated with the private car. However, we found that individuals can associate symbolic and affective motives with MaaS as well. The most prominent lever for MaaS to contribute to a more sustainable mobility system seems to be emphasizing these MaaS related motives as well as the car as a burden, a burden which can be lifted by using MaaS.",2590-1982,Not found

Within these analyses, trends in transport demand serve as a crucial parameter. To address this, a cluster-based transport model was developed to estimate future global transport demand on a national level, encompassing both domestic and international transportation, extending until the year 2050. The transport demand was divided into passenger and freight, which were further split into road, rail, marine, and aviation sectors. According to the available transport-related data, the most influential factors on transport demand are gross domestic product per capita and urban population. Model results show an increase in the total passenger and freight transport demand to 183 trillion passenger-km and 395 trillion ton-km in 2050, respectively. This corresponds to a tripling of transport demand compared to 2020, primarily driven by the more significant rise in developing countries compared to developed ones.",2590-1982,Not found

The resulting scenario collection comprised 20 prototypical scenarios of cyclist-automated vehicle interaction, grouped into four categories based on the road users’ direction of movement: crossing, passing, overtaking, and merging scenarios. The survey results indicated that right-turning vehicles, dooring scenarios, and more complex situations have the highest likelihood of accidents. Passing and merging scenarios are particularly relevant for studying automated vehicle communication solutions since they involve negotiation.

This paper aims to answer the following research questions a) what role and statistical significance do socioeconomic and environmental factors play in PVH deaths? b) effectiveness of the policies enacted, and c) public opinions and perceptions on the PVH deaths? The paper utilized data from different sources to examine the influence of socioeconomic and environmental factors on PVH deaths in 3,012 randomly sampled cities. Findings showed that a) average high temperature and people living in poverty in the city have a significant influence on PVH deaths b) median income had an insignificant effect on PVH deaths however further studies will be needed. However, a median income ratio to the number of deaths suggests states with higher ratios have the lowest PVH death cases c) Texas, Florida, Alabama, and California had a significant number of deaths per year after policy implementation.

Studies focus on the increasing incidence of related injuries, giving limited attention to identifying who uses golf carts as a transportation mode. Using data from a survey of Floridians aged 50 and older conducted between December 2020 and April 2021 (n = 4199), we conducted OLS regression to examine factors predicting the frequency of golf cart use. We examine six sets of predictors: sociodemographics, health, self-perceptions of aging, social relationships, transportation experiences, and built environment. More frequent use is associated with being younger, male, and married or partnered, reporting less loneliness and older age identities, walking and biking more frequently, and interacting more often with friends – but less often with family members. It also is associated with living in an inland rather than coastal county and one with lower golf cart injury rates. Our findings indicate that predictors of more frequent golf cart use differ from those associated with transitioning from driving, suggesting that greater golf cart use is not part of this process.

Assuming that future technical innovations will address the safety and reliability issues associated with automated truck platooning (ATP), societal concerns, especially the employment implications, require deeper exploration to frame adequate policies to allow ATP. Therefore, a systematic review of 33 relevant research articles and reports was conducted using the PRISMA technique. The study analyzed the perspectives of multiple stakeholders including drivers, policymakers, and fleet owners/industry explored in previous studies through interviews and discussions. The review suggests both positive and negative implications on employment rate, dependent on the scenario of ATP, potential of alternative job creation, and the pace of automation deployment. Previous discussions about ATP scenarios and pace of deployment further reveal the barriers perceived by stakeholders. The gap between research, stakeholders’ perspectives, and policy is identified as the root cause of delay in ATP deployment. Additionally, due to the varied physical and industrial geography and stringent safety considerations, platooning laws adopted across the US vary in requirements, such as licensing and on-site human presence, pre-approved travel corridors, etc. This review suggests that owners seek timely and incentivizing policies to invest in automation and upskill the existing workforce.

While gender gaps have narrowed in many social spheres, such is generally not the case for travel. In this study, we examine whether gender differences persist on a relatively new travel mode: ride-hail. We do this by examining the use patterns, experiences, and opinions of nearly 300 travelers in metropolitan Los Angeles, California, USA. Our survey responses show that ride-hail service offers a convenient travel option for women – one that enables many of them to access needed destinations in their daily lives. Women in carless or car-deficit households in particular benefit from using ride-hail services to meet their travel needs, which differ, on average, from men’s. For example, more women use ride-hail services for household-serving trips than men. However, ride-hail is not free of challenges for women. Concerns about safety, fear of personal and financial information leakage, and limited digital literacy and access to financial resources can inhibit or prevent some women from using these services. Compared to men, a larger share of women takes ride-hail trips booked by someone else in the household and/or travels with a companion. These findings suggest that public policy should seek to ensure that the option to use ride-hail is extended to as many people – regardless of gender – as possible, including those without mobile devices with data plans and credit or debit accounts. Riders should also be able to easily report problematic behaviors by drivers or fellow passengers to public authorities, in addition to reviews of and reports to ride-hail companies.",2590-1982,Not found

We rely on a unique dataset of survey responses from 96 Norwegian port organisations, supplemented with insights from qualitative research. We find that most ports have implemented at least one measure that contributes to decarbonisation. Most prominent is shore power, followed by increased energy efficiency. We find that support from owners and surroundings is prominent in decarbonisation efforts and that political guidelines and steering from port owners are important drivers. Heterogeneity in port types and contexts implies that further empirical research is needed.

The cost of aggressive electrification targets – Who bears the burden without mitigating policies?,10.1016/j.trip.2023.101006,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, governments worldwide have set aggressive targets for a transition from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to electric vehicles (EVs). Considering California’s electrification goals for the light-duty vehicle sector as a case study, we estimate the economic cost of achieving aggressive electrification targets based on total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis. When TCO estimates incorporate both technology costs and relevant household factors (income, fleet size, dwelling type), EVs reach cost parity with ICEVs for most consumer segments in the next decade, around 2032 or later. However, the share of households with cost benefits or consumer surplus from the EV transition does not reach 100% even by 2035 without mitigating policies and the benefits and loss from EV adoption vary across sociodemographic groups over the transition period. Before 2030, high-income (middle-income) households bear an average of 35% (59%) of the $2.8 billion transition cost; and after 2030 out of the total 2 billion transition cost incurred in this period low-income households incur an average 41% of the loss. These findings highlight the long-term need for mitigating policies like monetary incentives to achieve aggressive electrification targets even if TCO parity is achieved at the vehicle-level and the temporal distribution of the household segments that will need these policies to transition to EVs.",2590-1982,Not found

Moreover, the results indicate that travel patterns vary depending on the distance traveled. Short-distance travel has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, while medium-distance travel continues to lag. Intriguingly, post-pandemic levels of long-distance travel have exceeded the pre-pandemic figures, indicating a potential alteration in travel behaviors. These observed changes were substantiated by a paired t-test, demonstrating a significant difference across nearly all periods examined. In summary, this research sheds light on the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on travel behavior and mobility in the UAE. The survey data uncovers a noteworthy transformation in travel patterns during the pandemic, with subsequent gradual reversion to pre-pandemic norms. Notably, the findings suggest potential shifts in travel preferences across different distances, with long-distance travel surpassing pre-pandemic levels. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the lasting impacts of COVID-19 on transportation and travel choices.",2590-1982,Not found
Simulating the performance of HOV lanes for optimal urban traffic management,10.1016/j.trip.2023.101010,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Traffic congestion is a significant problem in crowded cities, resulting in increased travel times, air pollution, and reduced productivity. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes have emerged as a promising solution to tackle these issues. HOV lanes are reserved for vehicles carrying multiple passengers, incentivizing shared travel and reducing the number of low-occupancy vehicles on the road like school buses. By reducing the overall number of cars on the road, HOV lanes can significantly alleviate traffic congestion, improve travel times, and reduce air pollution. The effectiveness of HOV lanes depends on the degree of demand for shared travel and the availability of incentives, such as employer-provided benefits or toll exemptions. Additionally, the design and implementation of HOV lanes must be carefully planned to ensure that they do not negatively impact other road users. Tehran, as one of the largest and most populous cities in Asia, is a major destination for daily travel by workers. The Tehran-Karaj freeway serves as the primary and busiest entrance to Tehran city, experiencing heavy traffic every day in the morning towards Tehran and in the evening towards Karaj. In this study, the traffic conditions of this freeway were simulated in the existing state and with the presence of HOV lanes, and the resulting traffic parameters were compared and analyzed under different traffic scenarios. The findings of this research can offer valuable insights for decision-makers and traffic policy makers.",2590-1982,Not found
How can airports prepare for future public health disruptions? Experiences and lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic from a systemic perspective based on expert interviews,10.1016/j.trip.2023.101000,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic proved to be an existential public health and economic crisis for the airport system. An interview study was conducted using Amsterdam Airport Schiphol as a use case to prepare for future public health disruptions. The study aimed to uncover key experiences and lessons learned by an airport system during the COVID-19 pandemic by interviewing 16 experts from airport operators, airlines, public health agencies, security services, and the government. After thematic analysis, four themes emerged. The first theme addressed the limited readiness of the airport system; the COVID-19 pandemic seemed unimaginable regardless of prior experiences with infectious diseases or weak signals. The second theme depicts an airport system running behind the facts, one that had difficulties implementing operational interventions and had to deal with extensive reorganisations. The third theme illustrated the complex relational dynamics within the airport system, such as the hesitancy of public health stakeholders towards aviation stakeholders and the government utilising a top-down approach. Finally, theme four provides lessons learned for the future whereby actively fostering a systemic approach, sensemaking capabilities, and informal relations are recommended. Current constructions like Crisis Management Teams and the Airport Operations Centre support these learnings. Further reflection and operationalisation of the study's findings are critical to proactively supporting the airport system's transition from a potential pandemic liability to a strategic asset in mitigating public health disruptions.",2590-1982,Not found
Digital technologies of transportation-related communication: Review and the state-of-the-art,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100987,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) play a significant role in transportation systems as they provide the connection between transportation system users, system planners, operators, and managers. Over the last few years, with advancements in ICTs, there has been a rapid change in travel behaviour. However, little is known about how ICTs and other emerging digital technologies are being utilised in transportation-related communication for public, private, and active transportation. To bridge this gap, this study aims to explore academic and grey literature focused on the use of digital technologies in transportation-related communication. The methodological approach employs a systematic literature review, with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) protocol, to identify digital technologies that are found promising among scholars and practitioners for research, testing and deployment. The study analysed 158 publications and identified some common themes of how these digital technologies can be implemented to improve access to transportation communication. The study finds that: (a) The main literature focus is how information is gathered and shared with transportation users; (b) Advances in mobile applications afford real-time route updates, easy navigation of complex routes, and personalised journey planning; (c) Some notable knowledge gaps exist in how these technologies are implemented—including, willingness to use and digital literacy to understand them; (d) Many digital technologies are at the trial or development phases, which have potential to improve how transportation information can be made readily accessible to all users.",2590-1982,Not found
Forced labor and Transportation: Multi-disciplinary perspectives,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100999,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Transportation plays a key role in combating human trafficking. This paper discusses data from the 2021 National Outreach Survey for Transportation (NOST), from the first ever United States Department of Transportation Combating Human Trafficking in Transportation Award winning project. Survey data collected from transportation personnel, victim service providers, and trafficking survivors reinforces the documented perceptions, limitations, and challenges in understanding and combating forced labor discussed among frontline workers. Among 173 respondents working in various state DOT construction units, only 26 % feel slightly or very confident (19 % and 7 %, respectively) about identifying labor trafficking in their work environment. Participating transportation workers confirm specific training topics that may help to identify forced labor proximate to the work environment or within the community, transportation-related venues, and events. Respondents from multiple transport modes also provide valuable suggestions on how personnel and industry leaders can help combat human trafficking in supply chains. For the primarily U.S.-based transportation respondents, the most suggested strategy for encouraging companies to use products free from forced labor in their supply chains was high penalties (1,229 respondents), followed by loss of tax benefits (850 respondents) (total n = 1,766).",2590-1982,Not found

Furthermore, this article, as part of a doctoral thesis of one of the discoursers aims to provide assistance to create an assessment system for the public transport service providers. For today we already know that a sustainable metropolis can only exist with sustainable public transport and a fundamental condition for this is that the number of passengers must not fall. It needs investments like any other sectors economic sectors and the first step is to be aware of the expectation of users – here passengers –, which are the most crucial factors, what are the most important factors that make them choose public transport, and what are the factors that make them turn to other transport alternatives because of their absence or low quality.

Using insights on potential users’ behavior and transport requirements to inform the development of a more sustainable vehicle concept as part of a mobility transition,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100979,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Current mobility systems put a burden on people and the environment, e.g., through greenhouse gas emissions, and depletion of natural resources. Therefore, a mobility transition including changes in legislation, infrastructure, and behavior as well as socio-technical innovations is required. Against this backdrop, the inter- and transdisciplinary project presented in this article aims at developing a new vehicle for individual everyday travel. Target characteristics of the vehicle are: resource-efficient, low in harmful substances in its components, and low on greenhouse gas emissions while driving. To inform the vehicle’s development, n = 730 citizens of a medium-sized university city and its surrounding areas in central Germany took part in a survey on their mobility behavior, intention to switch to the new vehicle, their preferences for possible product features, payment models, and road use. Regression analyses revealed that socioeconomic factors (income, children in the household), individual travel characteristics (travel distance, motorization of vehicle), and psychological factors (innovativeness, weather resistance, travel habit strength, attitudes towards cars and bicycles) explained significant portions of the observed variance in participants’ intention to switch from current travel modes to the new vehicle. Furthermore, our results suggest that the new vehicle may be particularly attractive to potential users if it combines advantageous characteristics of bicycles and cars. Compared to sustainability-relevant aspects of vehicle usage, participants ascribed less importance to aspects of vehicle production and disposal. These learnings provide valuable insights for actors in industry, politics, design, and research striving to promote socio-technical innovations for a transition towards more sustainable mobility.",2590-1982,Not found
Did partial lockdown policy effectively reduce the first wave of COVID-19 in Indonesia? A regression discontinuity approach,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100998,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"One of the crucial issues in determining pandemic mitigation is deciding the optimal lockdown policy, whether a complete or partial lockdown could effectively reduce the spreading of COVID-19 without a vaccination policy, which could avoid global economic recession. The conventional pandemic model has limitations in predicting these linkages. The latest Causal Inference method that has been powerful in economic and health policy evaluation, such as Regressions Discontinuity Design (RDD), can contribute to this analysis. In contrast, RDD analysis in existing references is underused. This paper's objective is how the partial lockdown policy in Indonesia effects on spreading COVID-19 virus using RDD analysis. The results indicate that the partial lockdown policy reduced new cases of COVID-19 compared with having no partial lockdown policy. The results close to complete lockdown. This study uses panel data from official health, Waze, and other social variables. The pandemic model was developed from theoretical and empirical estimation. The spillover analysis was estimated using a Bayesian panel fixed-effect with Markov Chain Monte Carlo to relax the SUTVA problem. The DKI Jakarta has effectively reduced the spread of confirmed COVID-19 cases by about 10% to 22% from the baseline. The impact was less in West Java, at about 5%–18.5% from baseline. The government can control mobility during weekend periods and at the beginning of Ramadan. Policy enacted at the level of government (subdistrict level) most proximal to households had more influence on spillover effect reduction than those enacted at higher levels of government. The RDD analysis offers new implications to existing references for incorporating economic and pandemic variables for further research. Collaborating across the government level against the pandemic is paramount to controlling human mobility close to households.",2590-1982,Not found
Availability and usability of transportation for people with disabilities depending on what the user is expected to do,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100960,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"We comprehensively review typical problems that people with disabilities face when using local transportation modes. We show how specific problems with each mode can affect many different disability subgroups at once and can affect or be affected by problems with other modes. Academic literature about transportation for adults with disabilities skews toward walking, driving one’s own motor vehicle, using a ridehailing or taxi service, using a carsharing service as a driver, and using public transit, so this review focuses primarily but not exclusively on those modes. We frame these problems using the terms that we introduced in a previous work. Provider-view availability refers to where & when a transportation mode is present or legal to use. Immediate usability refers to features of a mode’s vehicles or infrastructure, where and when such vehicles and infrastructure are present, that help or hurt a user. User-view availability captures how serious problems with immediate usability for some users can prevent them from using those modes at all, make some aspects of provider-view availability moot for them. Cumulative usability refers to problems with a mode that arise over frequent use, longer trips, or more complicated trips, that may discourage a user from using that mode. We explain how modes that have similar requirements, present or absent, for the user to drive or to make a first-/last-mile connection exhibit consequently similar problems with provider-view availability, immediate usability, user-view availability, and cumulative usability.",2590-1982,Not found

Using an adapted community readiness assessment to inform Vision Zero and safe systems action,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100992,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Fatal and serious crashes on our roadways remain a persistent public health crisis. Vision Zero, based on the principles of a Safe Systems approach, is an initiative that has grown in popularity in the United States in the past decade. While the importance of cross-sector collaboration and the need for a supportive community culture in order to realize community change is well established, such tools and frameworks have not been applied as commonly for road safety initiatives as in other fields. We adapted and utilized the Community Readiness Assessment (CRA) tool, a well-established model within public health for assessing and informing community-based interventions in seven Vision Zero communities in one U.S. state. Three communities assessed were determined to be at an overall readiness level of four out of nine, or at a “preplanning” level and four of the communities scored a level of three, or at a “vague awareness” level. However, levels of readiness across the six dimensions measured varied, with community-related dimensions (e.g., community climate) scoring lower than readiness levels for stakeholder knowledge, leadership, and resources. Additionally, communities with more advanced stages of implementation had higher readiness scores, on average. Assessment results provided unique insights to inform next steps for local initiatives, particularly related to discrepancies between the readiness of the wider community and the readiness of leadership and available resources. Therefore, the CRA represents a potentially beneficial tool for communities pursuing Vision Zero initiatives.",2590-1982,Not found
Effects of a frontal brake light on pedestrians’ willingness to cross the street,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100990,23,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Effects of a frontal brake light (FBL, a potential external human–machine interface for automated vehicles) on participants’ self-reported willingness to cross a vehicle’s path were investigated. In a mixed design online study (vehicles in the experimental group were equipped with FBLs, there were no FBLs in the control group), participants observed videos of a vehicle approaching at different speeds from the perspective of a pedestrian standing at the curb. The vehicles exhibited either yielding behavior (braking onset 55 m or 32 m before standstill in front of the pedestrian’s position) or non-yielding behavior (approach speed was maintained). Participants specified their willingness to cross the vehicle’s path at different distances. When the vehicle yielded (i.e., FBL was activated), willingness to cross was significantly higher in the experimental group than the control group. Notably, we further observed a significantly lower willingness to cross in the experimental group than the control group when the vehicle did not yield (i.e., FBL was deactivated). Novel external human–machine interfaces might therefore influence the interaction with vehicles not only when they are activated but also when they are deactivated.",2590-1982,Not found
A system dynamic road transport modal mix emission analysis and prediction,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101083,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Greenhouse gas emissions are directly linked with fossil fuel-based transport vehicles and vary among individual modes of transport. The modal mix generates scenarios that support environmental sustainability by contributing to countries’ emission reduction targets. Twelve land transport modes using petrol, diesel, and gas as fuel are analyzed in this study for their on-road activity specific to the northern Punjab region of Pakistan. A region-specific scenario on a business-as-usual basis is analyzed for its modal mix emission projection for the coming decade. The study uses a system dynamic model to explore the “travel distance-energy utilized,” correlating it with greenhouse gas emissions with an R-square value of 0.9998. Scenario-based combinations are created with a target to achieve carbon reduction by enhancing, constraining, and trading off modes with the potential to meet nationally determined targets; in a scenario of the study, a 16% carbon reduction in the year 2035 is projected. Multiple scenarios can be created to suggest reductions, low-carbon policy strategies concerning modal choices, and long-term or short-term synergetic measures. In this study, modal trade-off combinations prove the potential to generate decarbonization through policy measures of controlling modal vehicle numbers that can further be supported by abatement strategies and techniques to boost the impact.",2590-1982,Not found
Combining road safety and traffic operations: An integrated approach to implement system-wide transportation improvements,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101091,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Rapid increases in Saudi Arabia’s vehicular traffic are challenging its urbanized road networks' safe and efficient operation. Facing both physical and economic constraints, transportation planning stakeholders in the country are seeking alternative methods for improving traffic operations and safety systemwide that do not rely upon infrastructure expansion. Using a sector of the Dammam metropolitan area in Saudi Arabia as the study area, we proposed and evaluated a comprehensive, integrated approach to improve both traffic system operations and safety in this urbanized road network. A combined route choice and control modeling framework was used to evaluate the potential systemwide benefits of concurrent driver information regarding the best available route and traffic signal control enhancements to facilitate operational improvements. Benefits were quantified as improvements in total systemwide travel times and reduction in total systemwide delays. To evaluate associated road safety improvements, a comprehensive road safety audit (RSA) was performed in the study area and Highway Safety Manual crash prediction methods were applied to estimate the potential reduction in crashes. Results indicated that concurrent driver information and an upgrade to vehicle-actuated traffic signal controls could improve total systemwide travel time by 22% and reduce the total systemwide delay by over 50%. If appropriate remediation measures are taken to address issues identified during the road safety audit, crashes could be reduced by up to 50 % per year at selected intersections. The study results infer that road safety improvements should be an integral part of any broader traffic systems improvement process and that the concurrent consideration of both traffic system operations and safety could provide the best return on investments. Further research could identify additional variables for consideration in the proposed comprehensive, integrated traffic systems improvement process and evaluate the transferability of this approach using a larger road network than the one considered in this study.",2590-1982,Not found
Impact of earthquakes on California's Railways: A comprehensive correlation analysis of magnitude and hypocenter depths with infrastructure accident,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101082,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The seismic events have been suggested as one of the major causes of railroad infrastructure and facility damages in several rail networks located in active tectonic regions, such as California in the US. To prove if there is any correlation between the railway infrastructure and earthquakes, this study aims to investigate their relationship using geospatial density and Spearman Correlation methods. As a result, this study found that the 15-year cumulative numbers of moderate-to-large ( ≥ M4) magnitude crustal earthquakes, occurring at depth ≤ 40 km, have a strong correlation with the cumulative number of infrastructure incidents. Although the small earthquakes (3 ≤ M < 4) do not seem to have a strong correlation with the overall accidents, these events appear to have moderate to strong correlation with the T3 (rail switch worn/broken/defected issues) and T4 (flangeway and overall structural defects) accidents. This suggests that even smaller earthquakes have a correlation with the railway infrastructure accidents, and these earthquakes can lead to the damage in the long term since they seem to have occurred shallowly and repeatedly around the same areas. Accordingly, our study provides the initial results that can further be used to examine and develop a more complex model to represent the relationship between the railway infrastructure accidents and seismicity, and possibly to predict the damage and associated causes in the future.",2590-1982,Not found
"Planning for uncertain transportation futures: Metropolitan planning organizations, emerging technologies, and adaptive transport planning",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101055,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In the U.S., Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) play a pivotal role in regional transportation planning. Emerging transportation technologies present new challenges for transportation planning practice, which is experiencing growing uncertainty not only from these new technologies and other uncertainties, and MPOs must increasingly plan for the needs of new technologies and innovation. This study investigates how MPOs are currently planning for emerging technologies by analyzing regional transportation plans (RTPs) of the 50 largest MPOs and interviewing planning staff from 17 MPOs. We examine the extent to which anticipatory governance and responsible innovation, which come from science and technology studies (STS), are integrated into MPO planning efforts, shedding light on trends in transportation planning theory and practice. Findings reveal limited integration of anticipatory governance and responsible innovation into their planning processes. Some include aspects of foresight and engagement, but reflexivity, flexibility, and responsiveness are much less developed. Key actions being taken include more comprehensive thinking about region-specific impacts of technologies, developing policies, piloting technologies, building partnerships, and creating new tools and planning models. The extent to which these practices are creating adaptive capacities within MPOs is still limited. To address this, we propose an adaptive transportation planning model that combines anticipatory governance and responsible innovation with long-range transport planning. This integration is crucial for aiding MPOs and other planning agencies in developing robust governance systems, methodologies, and public policies to effectively manage technology within urban environments and navigate the increasingly complex challenges posed by emerging technologies and other uncertainties.",2590-1982,Not found
Do men and women differ in time-use?

Gender roles and marital status drive them to take part in various economic, leisure and travel activities. Married (or cohabiting) individuals, in comparison to singles, juggle activities interdependently with their partners' resources and work allocation, resulting in potentially complex intersecting schedules. The primary aim of this research is to explore the complexity (measured using Shannon’s entropy) of individuals’ activity patterns by considering diverse factors such as demographics, job/education, residential location, travel behaviour, gendered multitasking behaviour, time use preferences and partner interactions. To examine variations in complexity, we developed three separate models for single and partnered respondents, and all respondents, respectively. We used German Time Use Survey 2012/13 data and employed multilevel linear regression models. Gender interaction variables were additionally included in the analysis to examine the gender differences in coefficients. In general, our results suggest that activity pattern complexity is positively associated with demographics (being women, having young children), job/education (high levels of education, working in non-market sector), travel behaviour (number of trips, car, public transport and cycling), time spent on unpaid multitasking, preference for time use (leisure and unpaid work) and additional work hour preferences, whereas full-time/overtime working, paid multitasking negatively affects the complexity. For partnered respondents, factors such as increase in age, increase in income, working in shifts and time spent on paid multitasking have significant negative effects on the complexity of activity patterns, while partners’ time spent on unpaid work and leisure activities positively affects respondents’ complexity. The gender interaction with multitasking behaviour reveals that men’s activity patterns are increasingly complex with more time spent on unpaid multitasking, while for women, the complexity of activity patterns is positively associated with more time spent on paid multitasking.",2590-1982,Not found

Both the daylight and the darkness scenarios were driven daytime and nighttime in a 2 × 2 design. Sleepiness was measured during the four 1-hour drives in terms of subjective sleepiness ratings, divided attention ability, driving performance, heart rate variability and blink behaviour. Significant differences were found in all measured sleepiness indicators between the daytime and nighttime drives, and in most indicators for time-on- task. No significant main effects were found between simulated daylight and darkness. A psychomotor vigilance test conducted before and after each drive also showed no significant effects for lighting condition.

Simple binary logit models are employed with two types of specifications in the utility function. First, the estimation results of the models without heterogeneity in the utility function showed that the VTTS in AVs is lower than that in non-AVs by approximately 7.3 % on average; however, the reduction of VTTS is not statistically significant. Second, the estimation results of the models incorporating observable heterogeneity into the marginal utility with respect to travel time also revealed that the individual’s preference of in-vehicle multitasking, age, and gender do not significantly affect the reduction of VTTS in AVs. Finally, changes in preference of AV-unique multitasking may affect VTTS, which should be monitored for future updating the VTTS guidelines.",2590-1982,Not found

Optimizing the location and configuration of disaster resilience hubs under transportation and electric power network failures,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101079,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Natural disasters often result in failures of transportation network components and blackouts that imperil the wellbeing of vulnerable populations. In response to these events, resilience hubs have been proposed as a pre-disaster planning strategy to improve access to critical services. This paper introduces an optimization-based approach to locate and configure electric power-generating resilience hubs considering the possibility of failures in transportation and electric power systems. The model’s objective is to identify hub locations and configurations that maximize transportation accessibility to the hubs and maximize the satisfaction of basic energy needs through hub-generated electric power. Besides a budget constraint, the model accounts for limits on the levels of hub energy generation vis-à-vis community energy demands, and on the transportation network distance of communities to hubs. Three heuristics are presented for the proposed planning problem. The first heuristic is a genetic algorithm (GA) with problem-specific solution generation procedures. The other two heuristics implement greedy search techniques. Numerical experiments were conducted, using data from rural Puerto Rico, to illustrate the application of the proposed model and heuristics, and examine their performance. In the numerical experiments, the GA heuristic found better solutions than the greedy heuristics. Additionally, design solutions consisting of spatially dispersed hubs with low energy generation capacity were better than solutions with spatially concentrated high-capacity hubs. Lastly, across a wide range of hub demand scenarios, only a small number of candidate hub locations consistently ranked among the best locations for establishing a hub.",2590-1982,Not found

To address this gap, this paper explores the motivations for the societal need for ADS research for the 500 most cited publications in the field, investigating explicit motivations (e.g., accident reduction), writing style, assumed likelihood of outcomes, and the text's tone. Qualitative and quantitative techniques are used, as well as the tool ChatGPT to investigate the large number of texts. The results show that the most common motivation is the emergence itself (‘ADS are coming, so they need to be studied’), followed by potential benefits such as accident reduction, congestion mitigation, increased comfort and productivity onboard, and environmental concerns. The tone of the publications is primarily neutral or slightly positive but with some deterministic descriptions like ‘ADS will lead to’ rather than more cautious language like ‘can’ or ‘may’. The results offer a glimpse rather than a comprehensive overview of the discourse on ADS within the research community.

Using online tools, experts were invited to introduce concepts they considered relevant to comfort/discomfort in currently available modes of transport which offer a ride (taxi/bus/train) to users and compare these to the concepts used to define comfort and discomfort in AVs. Results showed that a wide range of terms were used to describe user comfort and discomfort for both modes. Although all terms used for existing vehicles were found to apply to AVs, additional terms were proposed for determining comfort/discomfort of AVs. For example, to enhance comfort in AVs, designers should consider good communication channels, as well as ensuring that the AV’s capabilities match users’ expectations. Results also revealed that more terms were used, overall, to define discomfort, and that a comfortable ride in AVs is not just about mitigating discomfort. New concepts specific to AVs were also revealed when considering what increases their discomfort, such as whether riders’ safety and privacy are affected, or if they feel in control. Experts’ input from the workshop was used to enhance and expand a simple conceptual framework, explaining how AV driving styles, as well as other, non-driving-related factors, affect user comfort. It is hoped that this framework provides a more comprehensive list of the concepts affecting user comfort, also allowing more accurate measurement of the concept. As well as allowing for a more accurate comparison between empirical studies measuring comfort in AVs, this study will facilitate the design of more comfortable and acceptable automated driving for future vehicles.",2590-1982,Not found
The first mile towards access equity: Is on-demand microtransit a valuable addition to the transportation mix in suburban communities?,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101071,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"As cities grow, the benefits of living in them are increasingly unequally distributed. USA cities, in particular, have experienced rapid suburbanization of poverty and decreased levels of access to jobs for transit-dependent and vulnerable communities. The public transit challenges in suburbs call for innovative forms of transit to turn the tide on urban inequality. On-demand microtransit, a novel type of shared mobility provides efficient, convenient and affordable transportation. Its potential for redressing inequity had yet to be investigated fully in a suburban setting. We presented a case study from the suburbs of Minneapolis-St. Paul in Minnesota, USA. We combined unique datasets of microtransit ridership from two public transit agencies, transit surveys, land use data, and expert interviews, to conduct spatial analysis, accessibility analysis, and equity impact assessments for these suburbs. We found that microtransit enables public transit agencies to reach a larger number of vulnerable riders than fixed-route transit, particularly for commuting and trips to/from commercial areas. Microtransit also provided a cheaper alternative to ride-hailing and a faster alternative to public transit and walking, without cannibalizing ridership from fixed-rout transit alternatives. Finally, microtransit redressed transportation inequities by alleviating access inequality, reaching vulnerable rider groups effectively, and creating travel opportunities that are less spatially concentrated than those provided by traditional, fixed-route public transit. This study provided a framework for further investigations into the impact of microtransit, including in urban core or rural settings, and highlighted the impact of microtransit in reducing access inequity in a suburban environment.",2590-1982,Not found
Investigation of winter weather crash injury severity using winter storm classification techniques,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101073,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This study employs a unique methodology for analyzing seasonal traffic crashes by first identifying adverse winter-weather events using traditional traffic-crash data (from Nebraska) and correlating them to detailed meteorological data for subsequent analyses. Specifically, the novel component of this analysis utilized a state-specific winter storm and seasonal severity index metric in conjunction with classifications of storm type. Both crash and meteorological data were combined to determine if the amount of snowfall and/or storm intensity/severity could be a predictor of the number and severity of crashes. Analysis was performed to identify weather conditions causing highway safety concerns. The important takeaway of the study was that most winter weather-related vehicular crashes in Nebraska were associated with relatively minor winter weather conditions. The reported crashes typically occurred with relatively low snowfall amounts due to residual snowfall on the ground, emphasizing the importance of continuing winter maintenance operations activities and public service announcements long after a storm has passed through the region. Modeling crash injury severity revealed that icy pavements, higher duration of snowfall, work zones, and higher number of trucks and buses involved in a crash were linked to higher injury severity; higher visibility was associated with a greater chance of crashes involving visible injuries but a lower likelihood of crashes involving disabling injury/fatality. Snowfall was associated with more visible injury crashes, whereas snow-depth was linked to fewer visible injury and disabling injury/fatality crashes. The study's limitations include the spatial and temporal aggregation of weather data and a lack of detailed winter roadway maintenance/clearance activity data.",2590-1982,Not found
Facilitators and barriers to the implementation of community-based transportation services for older adults: Evidence from six case studies,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101062,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In the context of population aging, community-based transportation services are increasingly being relied upon to provide transportation for older adults. Examples of these services include volunteer driver programs and small shuttle bus services operated by non-profits, private companies, and municipalities. Despite filling important gaps in the transportation system, these services are often overlooked in transportation research and planning. This paper contributes to this research gap by providing evidence on the facilitators and barriers to implementation of community-based transportation services for older adults. We present evidence from six case studies in British Columbia, Canada: a paratransit service (Step up ‘N’ Ride), an on-demand transit service (Zunga Bus), a volunteer driver program (Richmond Cares, Richmond Gives Volunteer Driver Program), a semi-fixed route shuttle service (Go Bus), a neighbourhood-based door-to-door service (Collingwood Neighbourhood House Seniors’ Shuttle), and a free door-to-door service (Delta Seniors Bus). Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we reviewed publicly available documents and conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants knowledgeable about the services. Facilitators and barriers to implementation centred on five themes: the availability of the service (innovation), the often overlooked but important role of drivers (individuals), tailoring and adapting the service to meet older adults’ needs (implementation process), the strengths of inter-organizational and -sectoral partnerships (inner setting), and the intermittent and inefficient nature of funding for transportation services in the sector (outer setting). Bringing forward learnings from the implementation of community-based transportation services can help inform the development and planning of these services in other communities.",2590-1982,Not found
A case study of checking national household travel survey data with machine learning,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101078,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In recent years, machine learning techniques have been increasingly tested and applied to physically collected data to optimize the processes. In this paper, machine learning is used to check travel survey data of the German Mobility Panel (MOP). In the MOP, verified and raw data have been available for several decades, on which algorithms can learn the practices of human checking routines. By using machine learning, the algorithm is expected to learn the checking patterns from the past and thus support the data checking of new datasets. To this aim, several algorithms are applied and tested. The presented model framework supports the identification of blatant deficits in the reports at the individual and trip levels. The neural network (NN) shows the most promising results as it decreases the number of data samples checked. The checking effort can be reduced by 20.4 % at the individual trip level. This work shows that machine learning can support the data checking process in the MOP at various levels, thus leading to significant time reduction.",2590-1982,Not found
Long-distance hitchhiking and minibus taxi service demands in rural South African communities: MaaS semi-assessment,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101065,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"For many rural communities in lower-income countries, paratransit services are commonly used. Their service quality is widely debated. There are limited alternative modes, while on-demand mobilities are an option. Some travelers hitchhike and are seen via social media, despite its widely constructed contentiousness. Hitchhiking is, generally, understudied, while social media is also an emerging research field. This paper aims to explore rural (long-distance) hitchhiking demand in South Africa (SA) and compare hitching supply with the commonly used paratransit service, i.e., minibus taxis. Ultimately, probe and encourage assessments of (rural) Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), in the context of lower-income countries. The chosen case study is the Waterberg District Municipality in Limpopo Province (SA). Quantitatively described primary data includes the random one-on-one hitcher interviews (m = 429), social media hitcher (n = 418) and driver (o = 93) posts, and a full day observation of all paratransit services from each of the six rural towns in the case study. The results yield ride characteristics, travel arrangements, waiting times, travelling period and mobility satisfactory factors. More empirical evidence is needed to inform policymakers regarding the establishment of or investment in institutions to develop strategies and enforce the transit-competitions and multimodal information technology system that is user-centric – (rural) MaaS.

Ride-hailing service availability and private transportation mode usage in a motorcycle-based city: Evidence from Hanoi,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101069,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Ride-hailing services (RHS) are widely expected to serve as an alternative to conventional private transportation modes. However, numerous studies on RHS’s impact on private modes’ usage provide inconclusive evidence. Notably, few studies have analyzed RHS’s impacts on modal changes in the context of motorcycle-based societies. This study attempts to identify the critical factors affecting RHS users’ private mode usage (private cars and motorcycles) in response to RHS appearance in Hanoi, Vietnam, a motorcycle-based society. Two empirical analyses were performed with sample data of 642 individuals collected from face-to-face interviews using paper-based questionnaire sheets in Hanoi from December 19 to 21, 2020. The first analysis employed a linear regression model to explain the changes in individuals’ private mode usage before and after RHS adoption. The second analysis estimated a logistic regression model to examine an individual’s private mode choice when RHS are unavailable. Robustness tests were also performed. The results revealed that RHS users’ future vehicle ownership intentions, reasons for using RHS instead of private modes, motorcycle ownership, and public transport usage significantly reduce the impacts of RHS on private mode usage. The reasons for using RHS rather than private modes were found not strong enough to make an essential change to reduce the frequency of private modes usage. The results also showed there is a difference between the RHS’s impacts on motorcycle use and car use. They suggested that policy makers should be aware of the unique factors in motorcycle-based societies such as Hanoi when formulating urban transportation strategies. Finally, the findings further supported an idea that multivariate analyses are more suitable than the simple descriptive statistics method to understand how the motivation for using RHS influences the impacts of RHS on private mode usage.",2590-1982,Not found
Electric vehicle charging infrastructure deployment: A discussion of equity and justice theories and accessibility measurement,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101072,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The ultimate goal of this discussion paper is to inject more rigorous consideration and measurement of equity and justice issues into research and policymaking around the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI). To achieve this, we first examine equity and justice theories in transportation and their alignment with the concept and measurement of accessibility. Equity and justice frameworks abound (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical equity, ladder of justice standards, theories of equity and justice from economic and political philosophy), but all tend to offer different normative perspectives on how to distribute resources among members of society. The accessibility concept is a promising tool for operationalizing these theories, because it explicitly measures opportunities and can be applied to quantify existing disparities or the differential or aggregate outcomes of policies. Next, we interpret these justice/equity frameworks and accessibility measurement in the context of EVCI deployment and literature on disparities in access to charging stations. We discuss which population subgroups to analyze, how to quantify EV charging opportunities and activities, and what to include in travel time and cost calculations. Our paper concludes with additional discussions on community engagement, supply vs. demand, externalities of EVCI, and other issues. A key takeaway for policymakers and researchers is to clarify the ethical perspective being applied in EV analyses and policy, as different equity/justice theories yield diverse responses to how policies should address disparities, including those related to access to EV charging infrastructure.",2590-1982,Not found

The scope of this study covered both federal and state expenditures and revenue sources. The highway cost allocation elements covered in the paper include vehicle miles of travel, highway expenditures highway revenues, and equity analysis. In the day of CAVs, significant changes are expected in all these elements, and these changes are incorporated into the proposed highway cost allocation framework. Pavement-related expenditures would increase due to the addition of CAV-related infrastructure integrated into the pavement infrastructure to ensure it is an intelligent pavement. Bridge-related expenditures are expected to increase due to the infrastructure technologies on the bridges making them smart bridges, and the design loads of these bridges may have to be increased due to potential platooning on long span bridges. It is expected that many of the CAVs on the road will be electric vehicles. All these changes are incorporated into the proposed highway cost allocation framework.",2590-1982,Not found
Optimizing municipal solid waste collection vehicle routing with a priority on infectious waste in a mountainous city landscape context,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101066,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The growth of the economy, urban sprawl, and population expansion precipitate a substantial increase in solid waste generation, particularly in vital regions like the capital area and economically significant cities, including renowned tourist destinations. Furthermore, the protracted spread of the COVID-19 virus has led to a notable increase in the quantity of infectious waste. In this regard, the safe and effective management of municipal solid waste (MSW) collection and transportation emerges as a major concern in MSW management. This paper aims to determine routes for waste collection, both infectious and noninfectious, from waste collection points to diverse waste disposal sites in the mountainous Khao Kho district of Phetchabun province, located in northern Thailand, with the objective of minimizing total fuel consumption and service time. Fuel consumption is contingent upon both the distance traveled and the prevailing condition of the road. The road condition exerts an influence on the vehicle's speed, thereby directly impacting fuel efficiency. In the context of service time, priority is assigned to collection points with substantial quantities of infectious waste, given the imperative to promptly dispose of such waste to mitigate the risk of transmission. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model and three modified differential evolution (MDE) algorithms were developed to solve the problem. The computational results reveal that the MDE outperformed the traditional DE and is effective for the MSW transportation management system.",2590-1982,Not found
A review of global and regional frameworks for the integration of an unmanned aircraft system in air traffic management,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101064,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) applications have increased exponentially in recent years owing to their low cost, improved performance, and the use of advanced technology in this relatively new and rapidly evolving industry. Despite the advanced technologies used in UASs, the integration of UASs into the air traffic management regulatory framework is lacking, which affects air transport. International and regional air transport regulators, having identified the major technological challenges, are gradually developing fundamental principles for the consolidation of manned and unmanned air traffic. In this review, the development of a common framework and fundamental principles set by major international regulatory authorities (International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems) were examined. The related initiatives of major Eastern countries (Russia, China, and Japan) in comparison with Western states (European Union (EU), United States, and United Kingdom) were comprehensively reviewed, focusing on EU activities and projects related to the concepts of operations. Indicative research activities on technology challenges (detect and avoid; command, control, and communication; and artificial intelligence-based unmanned aerial vehicle navigation), jointly identified by all international and national regulatory authorities, were also examined and presented. A comparative analysis of the fundamental principles of the frameworks revealed the similarities and differences between the approaches to the concept and its implementation. In terms of differences, the novel findings and contributions of this review are the different approaches regarding the roles and responsibilities of state authorities in unmanned aircraft traffic management (UTM) as well as approaches for UTM integration into the existing air traffic management systems. Based on this research, scientific groups of regulatory authorities could consider comparing the concepts and frameworks detailed in this review to address the differences and develop a harmonized global UTM framework.",2590-1982,Not found

Maritime transportation operations are also recognized as a major contributor of anthropogenic noise to nearby communities. The Port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada may be a contributor to these concerns because of its noise emitting operations and it being near densely populated areas. This study examines the cost and benefits of implementing noise abatement measures to reduce potential impacts on residents by limiting road and rail traffic and cargo handling noise from Port operations. The upfront investment costs of noise abatement measures are estimated and compared to the associated human health and wellbeing benefits of reducing noise exposures in exposed residential areas. The hedonic price method was used to translate the benefits of reducing noise exposures in monetary terms. Geospatial analysis was conducted to analyze extent of dwellings exposed to unsafe levels of noise before and after the implementation of abatement measures. Total costs were calculated at $6,914,318 CAD and total benefits at $4,127,870 CAD. This equates to a return of investment of $-2,786,448 CAD. Although this may appear to be an unfavourable investment for the Port of Halifax, this study presents opportunities for improvements and recommendations for noise abatement in port operations.",2590-1982,Not found
Moving beyond COVID-19: Break or continuity in the urban mobility regime?,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101060,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Upon its irruption in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spurred a flurry of reflection on its potential long-term effects on urban mobility. Despite widespread speculation about the likely permanent impacts of the pandemic on urban mobility, few academic accounts have re-examined the extent to which these speculations were warranted once the pandemic is over. To this end, the present article explores the retrospective perceptions of key stakeholders regarding the long-term impacts of the pandemic on the urban mobility regime, through a qualitative case study of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region, involving 22 semi-structured interviews. Approaching urban mobility through the lens of sociotechnical regimes and the multilevel perspective (MLP), we identify key perceived changes to the urban mobility regime in the aftermath of the pandemic, as well as four main obstacles to effecting transformative change towards sustainable urban mobility during the “window of opportunity” created by the pandemic. Our findings suggest that the pandemic has generally not led to significant changes in the urban mobility regime, with two key exceptions: the normalisation of teleworking, and the consolidation of tactical urbanism approaches to street redesign. These findings confirm the obduracy of the existing urban mobility regime, while pointing to promising inroads which might result in the transformation or destabilization of the current regime.",2590-1982,Not found
Methodology for the comparative evaluation of vehicle technologies in intermediate cities considering electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101068,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Climate change and emissions reduction are crucial global issues that require transformations in the energy and transportation sectors. This has increased Electric Vehicles (EVs) adoption in various countries, including emerging economies like Colombia. The government in Colombia has implemented incentives and regulations to promote sustainable mobility, increasing the number of EVs and hybrids. However, beyond governmental incentives, factors such as range, availability of charging stations, and acquisition costs impact EV adoption. Therefore, vehicle owners must evaluate total ownership costs over time and technical aspects to understand EVs financial and performance advantages. In this context, a methodology is proposed to facilitate decision-making by comparing technical, economic, and environmental aspects of vehicle technologies in a specific urban transportation context. A case study for individual public transportation in Pasto, an intermediate city in Colombia (Pasto), is presented, which can be extrapolated to other cities with similar characteristics. This methodology supports governmental efforts for transport decarbonization and aims to inform cab owners about the economic benefits of new technological adoptions. The case study constructs a spatial model for individual public transportation simulated in SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). By evaluating technical, economic, and environmental aspects with a realistic approach based on simulation results that considered traffic conditions and network operational parameters, helpful benchmarking is obtained to promote EVs among owners of public vehicles in the city and concludes that EV adoption for individual public transportation in Pasto is notably advantageous from a financial perspective.",2590-1982,Not found

This study investigates the shift in transport mode preferences among parents during school reopening in 2021, focusing on elementary, middle, and high schools. An online questionnaire was distributed to parents in the U.S. The findings indicate a significant shift in parental transportation choices, with reduced reliance on school buses and increased automobile usage. Elementary school parents' bus percentage declined from 39.7% to 36.4% in Spring 2021, while middle and high school parents showed similar trends.

This study assesses the implications of hotspots in refrigerated containers during table grape exports from a packhouse in South Africa, through the other stages of the cold chain until a retailer’s distribution centre in the UK. Ambient and pulp temperature data were collected from temperature sensors inserted at locations distributed horizontally and vertically throughout the container. The mixed analyses results showed that the most severe temperature deviations from protocol, in terms of the maximum temperatures recorded, occurred during the period from when the pallets were removed from cold storage to be loaded into the reefer container up to when the container was reconnected to an electricity supply at the port. Sensors located in the middle and top of the pallet were far more likely to record temperature deviations compared to sensors located at the bottom of the pallet, implying that hotspots are more likely to form in the upper-half of the container than near the floor. The study, a first that covered the entire export cold chain of table grapes to the importing country’s distribution centre, identified key areas industry role players can concentrate on to improve the operational proceduresalong the cold chain.

BinR-LRP: A divide and conquer heuristic for large scale LRP with integrated microscopic agent-based transport simulation,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101059,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The holistic optimisation of transportation systems is one of the key challenges in transportation science, because it requires the simultaneous consideration of the numerous interactions between the strategic planning level (e.g., the Facility Location Problem [FLP]) and the tactical and operational planning levels (e.g., Vehicle Fleet and Vehicle Routing Problem [VRP]). Traditional methods for solving the Location Routing Problem (LRP) often focus on the fixed constraints and ignore the variable vehicle characteristics, dynamic operations, different modes or underlying infrastructure. This paper proposes an integrated approach for modular and intuitive metaheuristic for LRP. The route planning phase is incorporated by means of agent-based transport simulation, which provides additional flexibility with respect to the vehicle fleet, demand characteristics, or the use of external problem constraints. Therefore, this approach can be easily applied to practical problems and used to optimise transport networks in a flexible and modular manner. Moreover, the algorithm developed here can independently converge to the near-optimal number and location of logistics sites. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and the performance of our approach by performing several simulation experiments in the context of a sensitivity analysis and comparing the results with well-known benchmark solutions. The results indicate that the Binary-Partition LRP heuristic (BinR-LRP) is able to identify better solutions than the benchmark heuristics in most cases. This emphasises its suitability as a scalable and robust optimisation framework, even for oversized LRP instances.",2590-1982,Not found

Most research studies focused mainly on the evaluation of the model accuracy, where little has been done to evaluate the models’ performance toward transport attributes. This research aims to calibrate the transportation choice models using ML techniques, then conduct a comparison with the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model to identify the impact on the model accuracy and performance and quantify to what extent the ML models are sensitive to transport policies compared to the traditional MNL model. To this end, eight ML classifiers were examined. As a case study, the models were calibrated to reflect the choice behavior of trip makers in Alexandria City, Egypt. The models were successfully calibrated with satisfying accuracy; however, the ML models have better calibration results in terms of predictability, outperforming the MNL model, where the GBDT classifier records the best prediction accuracy.

This has been a major issue in Indonesia particularly among freight-train drivers. The goal of the present study was to examine the degree of fatigue among freight train drivers across three different shifts and two types of coal cars loading (empty vs. loaded). A video camera was placed on the dashboard inside the locomotive cabin, capturing the face of the train drivers continuously throughout the duration of the driving tasks. In addition to the use of subjective measures, blink duration and video ratings were analyzed every 30 min to determine the level of fatigue. Findings of this study demonstrated that fatigue risks were moderate to excessive. As predicted, fatigue increased as a function of task duration, and more substantial levels of fatigue were observed during afternoon and evening shifts. Note that fatigue was also found to be associated with empty train cars. This was likely due to the fact that this particular train received the lowest priority and stopped very frequently. Such conditions could result in more monotonous and tiresome driving tasks, which lead to greater levels of fatigue. While driving for up to about four hours continuously was generally acceptable for the morning shift, such duration was not recommended for the rest of the driving conditions.

The proposed model is validated using microscopic simulations, and it replicates the given traffic scenarios subjected to assorted Penetration Rate (PR) of CAVs. The proposed model is employed to investigate the dynamics of mixed traffic. The results demonstrate that the average traffic velocity and the Level of Service (LOS) significantly improve with the increase in the PR of CAVs.

From 1,255 valid responses, we found significant influences of gender (t (1253) = 4.22), safety perceptions (F (2,1252) = 52.373), and transport mode frequency (F (4, 1250) = 6.662) on AVs adoption intentions. Both TAM and UTAUT models were moderately effective in explaining willingness to use AVs (R 2 = 34% and 48%, respectively). TAM highlighted perceived usefulness (β = 0.421) and ease of use (β = 0.540), while UTAUT emphasized effort expectancy (β = 0.317) and social influence (β = 0.240). However, the findings from the multigroup analysis did not corroborate the role of residential areas in determining the intention to use AVs. These findings offer crucial insights for developing AV promotion strategies, creating user-friendly designs, and formulating supportive policies for AV adoption in diverse Indonesian regions.",2590-1982,Not found
Will gated community affect public transit service coverage?,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101050,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The proliferation of gated communities (GC) has prompted researchers worldwide to investigate its causes and consequences. The phenomenon has been extensively discussed as a significant residential form in the world, but most of the studies are primarily concerned with non-technical issues such as inequality and segregation, while technical issues such as urban transit (PT) systems have not been fully discussed. The significance of accessibility-focused PT planning to establish a sustainable urban transportation system makes this issue a crucial topic to explore. PT is a public good expected to be accessible to everyone, and this means the distance between people and the system needs to be minimized to maximize the service coverage, but the GC design is observed to be increasing the distance of its residents willing to use this service. Therefore, this study analyzed the impact of GC on the PT system using Bogor Municipality as a case study through GIS (Geographical Information System) methodologies and spatial data. The quantitative evidence showed that GC has a relatively strong negative correlation with PT service coverage (r (66) = from -0.611 to -0.631, p <.001). This means PT service coverage tends to be low in areas with a high GC ratio and vice versa. It was also discovered that an increase in GC ratio is likely to cause a reduction in PT service coverage in the study area (Beta = -0.48, t(67) = -5.17, p =.000). This article concludes with a discussion of a few potential ideas based on the observations to alleviate the negative impact of GC.",2590-1982,Not found
Reliability Assessment of Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Networks through Headway Distribution and Information Propagation Delay,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101053,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Several developed vehicle spaces and time headway distribution models in traffic flow theory have been widely used in the literature, reflecting the primary uncertainty in drivers’ car-following movements and explaining the traffic flow stochastic features. Moreover, effective vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is a key to decentralizing traffic information systems. Accurate vehicle headway distribution estimation will ensure reliable communication and benefit passengers’ safety and comfort. Consider several proposals for headway distribution in the literature; this paper studies the effect of space-headway distribution on information propagation delay in assessing the reliability of the V2V communication networks. We utilize the properties of reliability measurement for headway data by introducing the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) to measure the effects that different headway models have on estimating the parameters of headway distribution in a V2V communication network. The statistical analysis is then applied to the real Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data. It validates the proposed methodology and formulations by measuring the effects of model selection on headway data and information propagation delay on the reliability of the V2V network. The results show that the effect of headway distribution when the vehicle’s transmission range is smaller than the road segmentation is not negligible, especially when cars are very distant. Based on our results, we recommend new metrics based on Kullback–Leibler divergence for model selection of headway data, thereby enhancing the reliability of the V2V network.",2590-1982,Not found
Automated driving regulations – where are we now?,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101033,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Self-driving vehicles are a tool that contributes significantly to sustainable development, both nationally and globally, as their positive effects extend beyond national borders. For their wider use, we need an appropriate regulatory framework as well as certain technical capabilities. It is not only technically sophisticated vehicles that are important, but also the infrastructure that supports automated driving. This paper analyses the legal frameworks of selected states, aside from those frameworks at international and EU level. The research indicates that national regulations often concentrate on the testing phase of automated vehicles. Furthermore, these rules frequently require a certain degree of driver involvement, highlighting that some form of human control remains essential. It seems that regulation does not match the speed of technological development or is sometimes somehow unsynchronized with it.",2590-1982,Not found
Trip generation model for a developing city in an emerging country,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101048,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This paper presents the development of trip generation models in an emerging country. In this paper, trip generation models for a medium-size Palestinian city, the City of Jericho, are established. This study is the first comprehensive city-wide trip generation study that was done within the Palestinian territories. Moreover, the study considers mixed land use while developing trip generation models. Household demographic, socioeconomic, land use and trip data were collected to generate models to represent trip generation for trips with different purposes, such as number of daily trips for educational, shopping, social, and recreational purposes. Stratified and random household samples are drawn from the study area, covering 14 different traffic analysis zones. All the households were visited, and personal face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect demographic, socioeconomic and travel behavior information. A multivariable regression analysis approach is used to analyze the collected data in order to develop overall daily trip generation models, as well as trip generation models by trip purpose and time of day. Most of the trip generation models that were developed have acceptable coefficient of determination (R2), while some of the models did not perform as expected. The Education Trips model resulted in the highest R2, while the Off-Peak Trips model resulted in the lowest R2. Most of the independent variables were also relevant to present the expected socioeconomic characteristics. Using land use variables did not significantly contribute towards improving the regression models, where only marginal improvements are noticed. It is suggested to investigate the transferability of the developed models to other Palestinian cities, and to verify the applicability of these models to other cities with different sizes.",2590-1982,Not found
Predictive models of electric vehicle adoption in the United States: Charging ahead with renewable energy,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101041,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In this paper, we develop several predictive models pertaining to Electric Vehicles in the United States. We set out to understand three phenomena: Public Charging Units, Electric Vehicle Jobs, and Electric Vehicle Registrations. To model them, we include variables from various categories – demographics, economics, education, environment, finance, geographics, public health, and technographics – in the timespan of 2010–2020. We integrate data from multiple data sources and use them to understand, explain, and predict the Electric Vehicle phenomena combining state and county level data. We obtain three random effects linear regression models having variance explained of 51.5–62.4%. We also fit several machine learning models to improve the accuracy of the models, highlighting nonlinearities, to provide additional insights. The overall predictive accuracy of each Gradient Boosted Tree model is far superior to that of each linear regression model and significantly better than the other machine learning models. Our core contribution is that, spanning all three phenomena, the three most important predictor variables are solar generation of electricity, high school graduation rates, and air quality.

Predicting passengers’ feedback rate for airport service quality,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101046,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Airport service quality evaluation is commonly found on social media sites, including Google Maps. The reviews by users of Google Maps are longer in terms of the number of words than those found on Twitter. They also include a rating, whereas those on Twitter need to be labelled. However, they are less well known than those on Twitter amongst researchers who focus on sentimental analysis. This study attempts to fill the gap in the current literature and develops architecture that is based on Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks and Convolution Neural Networks. The combined model developed receives meta-data, such as the number of words in the review and the number of likes the review receives in addition to the key review words. The two models, the first of which predicts polarity and the second reviews ratings, were tested under several variations of parameters and showed consistency in results. The dataset was collected from Google Maps and focused on two crowded airports in the Arabic Peninsula (Doha and Dubai).

Modelling public attitude towards air taxis in Germany,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101045,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Urban air mobility (UAM) holds great promise as an expansion of the transportation system in cities. Despite the progress in UAM technology, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding how the public will accept and react to these mobility services. This study employed a structural equation model (SEM) to construct a comprehensive framework that delves into the factors influencing public attitudes toward air taxis. Data for the model is derived from a sequential exploratory mixed methods approach. The initial phase involved identifying acceptance factors towards air taxis through five focus groups, laying the foundation for the subsequent structural model development. A survey involving 819 participants was conducted in Germany in the next phase. The latent variables in this model are the expected benefits, expected risks, and the personal level of technophilia. The results show that rising stress levels through new air traffic flows, noise, and blocking sky views affect negative attitudes toward air taxis in public spaces. In contrast, the user expectation of avoiding traffic jams and achieving time savings contributes positively. Additionally, people who are more technophilic tend to have a more positive attitude toward air taxis. However, the perceived negative consequences of air taxis exert more substantial and stronger influences on public attitude than the expected benefits. By introducing the acceptance factors and relevant dimensions of a public attitude, this study provides insights to shape the design of UAM in accordance with the common good.",2590-1982,Not found
Public transport in the UK: Considerations for continued rehabilitation and future planning for a sector impacted by COVID-19,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101044,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Global public transport strategies changed significantly through the pandemic to help restrict the spread of SARS-CoV-2, keep travellers and workers safe and ensure service sustainability. UK Government guidance during phases of lock-down led to greatly reduced usage. By February 2022, most restrictions lifted but the sector was struggling with wider issues including the cost of living crisis, effects of war in Ukraine, industrial action, BREXIT and staff shortages. With public transport stakeholders, we developed policy recommendations to assist the sector with recovery from the pandemic. Priorities included increasing footfall while keeping workers and passengers safe following removal of most COVID-19 restrictions, and contributing to wider agendas of societal interconnectivity, levelling up and climate goals. This paper focusses specifically on the UK, drawing on longitudinal qualitative interviews with experts, organisational representatives (including unions), transport workers and passengers conducted between January 2021 and September 2022. This longitudinal approach allowed examination of changes in opinions across the sector over time. There was a shift in perceptions and priorities regarding both COVID-19 safety and business stability. Initially the focus was on delivering/receiving an essential service while maintaining the safety of workers and travellers. However, over time, although safety in relation to potential viral spread remained (especially for experts) this became secondary to business stability (organisational leaders) and service reliability (passengers) and the wider context (COVID-19 risk, energy costs, worker shortages, travel patterns etc.) had changed significantly.

Nonetheless, AV’s governance in the urban transport system is challenging. This paper proposes a novel interdisciplinary methodology and contributes to the governance debate from the ‘policy’ and ‘polity’ dimensions. We attempt to draw insight from the Norwegian cultural context and a willingness to use AV survey in Oslo, Norway. We then attempt to provide insight into the workable governance approach for AV deployment in the Oslo region, Norway. Our result suggests that less than half of the people in the Oslo region are willing to use AV. Based on our analytical insight, we argue that a workable governance approach for AV that will allay fears of privacy loss while making people feel safe and secure, manage uncertainty, pessimism about technological innovation, and embrace time-honoured Norwegian traditions should be considered to support the deployment of AV in Norway.",2590-1982,Not found
Using machine learning techniques to assess the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global aviation industry,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101043,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Prediction of financial distress is a crucial concern for decision-makers, especially in industries prone to external shocks, such as the aviation sector. This study employs machine learning techniques on a comprehensive global dataset of aviation companies to develop highly accurate financial distress prediction models.

The aviation industry holds substantial economic importance, contributing significantly to revenue, employment, and economic activity worldwide. However, its susceptibility to external factors underscores the need for robust predictive tools. Leveraging advances in machine learning, this study pioneers the application of data-driven, non-parametric solutions to the aviation sector, both before and after the pandemic. Importantly, this study addresses a gap in the field by conducting comparative evaluations of prediction models, which have been lacking in previous research efforts, often leading to inconclusive outcomes. Key findings of the study highlight the Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Boosting models as the most accurate in forecasting financial distress within the aviation industry.

"Assessment of pedestrians’ red light violation behavior at signalized crosswalks in Kathmandu, Nepal",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101035,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Disregarding the signal and crossing the road in haste or for other personal motives is a well-established trend seen in signalized crosswalks, particularly among pedestrians in lower-middle income developing countries such as Nepal. At signalized crosswalks, pedestrians are sequentially separated from vehicles (unlike unsignalized crosswalks) due to traffic signals. However, pedestrians’ signal violation especially red-light running can, in unfortunate circumstances, expose them to vehicles that might lead to fatalities. The current study assesses the red light violation behavior of pedestrians at signalized crosswalks in Kathmandu. Binary logistic regression as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analysis have been performed on 1790 pedestrians. The logit model results show that carrying a child/heavy load, crosswalk length, perceived traffic volume, pedestrian crossing speed, number of pedestrians waiting at the crosswalk, group crossing, and the remaining red duration until the green phase significantly affect pedestrians’ decision to commit red light violation or wait until green. This study also introduced a novel variable called perceived volume, which considers fluctuations in traffic flow and quantifies the traffic faced by pedestrians. The survival analysis results show that approximately 35% of the total pedestrians did not even consider waiting for the green signal after arrival (violated immediately). Both logistic regression and survival analysis confirm that pedestrians prefer to wait for green (comply with the signal) when the remaining red phase duration (until the green phase) is below 50 s; pedestrians tend to violate almost instantly when they face a remaining red phase duration of more than 100 s.",2590-1982,Not found

The study area is limited to Thammasat University in an urban environment where pedestrian and vehicle traffic across the crosswalk is simulated in controlled scenarios. The dataset was collected using closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed at locations in the study area. The YOLOv8x with BOT-SORT was used to track pedestrians and vehicles from the CCTV videos. The overall mAP was 0.861 with a precision of 0.899, a recall of 0.785, and the objects classifier’s average accuracy of 0.786. The TTC and PET values were calculated based on the collected data. These metrics can be used to determine the time required for a vehicle or pedestrian to come to a stop or avoid a collision, as well as the time it takes a vehicle or pedestrian to recover from an evasive movement or when the pedestrian has been hit by the vehicle. The 30 videos of near-miss accident scenarios, where 15 videos of pedestrians and vehicles and 15 videos from disordered persons and vehicles, were used to analyze the TTC and PET values to identify areas for further improvement.

Smart loading zones. A data analytics approach for loading zones network design,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101034,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Urban public space is often provided for freight delivery operations in the form of on-street (un)loading zones (LZ). Since public space is scarce and demanded by several users, city authorities have the challenge of managing LZ by gaining knowledge about freight curbside needs and utilization. Although technological solutions and enforcement practices have become popular among policymakers to capture curbside dynamics, there is still an open and promising research field for designing analytical frameworks that shape LZ decision-making processes. This fact has motivated the authors to define the concept of Smart Loading Zones (SLZ) as the involvement of technology and data analytics in the planning and management of LZ in a responsive and user-oriented way. Besides proposing a conceptual approach for the study of SLZ, this paper implements data analytics tools for enhancing decisions on LZ network design, using the City of Vic (Spain) as a case study. The machine learning techniques k-means++, DBSCAN, and integer linear programming prescribed the LZ number, location and service assignment based on establishments' coordinates, walking distances and freight demand. Results from the case study showed how an optimized number, location, and size of LZ improved occupation levels, i.e., from 18 % to 80 %, while freeing up curbside space for other users. Service coverage was also improved by allocating LZ to establishments within walking distances no greater than 75 m.

Life cycle assessment of construction and driving operation of a hydrogen-powered truck built from a used diesel truck,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101020,24,2024-03-01,2024,3,"One option to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles is switching to hydrogen as a fuel, which is converted in drive trains powered by fuel cells. In addition to the production of new hydrogen trucks, it is also possible to convert used diesel-powered trucks to hydrogen-powered vehicles. This paper aims to evaluate the environmental impact of a heavy-duty truck converted from diesel propulsion to a hydrogen fuel cell drive regarding life-cycle GHG emissions and mineral resource scarcity (MRS). This life cycle assessment focuses on the construction and end-of-life phases of the vehicle (first part) and on the entire life cycle, including the use phase (second part). The largest share of GHG emissions for the hydrogen-powered truck (first part) originates from the tank system and the chassis, specifically due to the materials reinforced plastics, steel, and aluminum. The fuel cell system is responsible for half of the MRS, mainly due to the used platinum, which, as well as steel, accounts for about one-third of the MRS. The hydrogen supply path is the most crucial factor determining the overall GHG emissions (second part). To reduce GHG emissions compared to a conventional diesel-driven truck, the share of renewable energy within the power mix has to be at least 61 %. The MRS increases with an increasing share of renewable energy within the power mix. To reduce GHG emission of a converted hydrogen-powered truck, the use of reinforced plastics and platinum should be minimized, thus contributing to more efficient use of mineral resources.",2590-1982,Not found

Thus, this study aimed to identify objective and subjective walkability factors and their relation to current walking behaviour. The findings were expected to contribute to the design and planning of walkable cities and neighbourhoods. The study designed a theoretical framework stemming from social psychology and urban transport geography to elucidate the influence of walkability factors on walking behaviour. Based on this framework, a survey was conducted among 556 participants. Results of the multivariate correlation analyses and binary logistic regression revealed views that differed from those reported in the literature for other contexts. The comparative analysis based on individuals’ characteristics and travel purposes did not detect any strong variation in walking behaviour. Other results were consistent with previous findings on issues of the hierarchy of walking needs. People’s decision to walk in the selected region was not necessarily determined only by the current condition of the physical built environment.

Moreover, feedback-related factors play a crucial role in determining drivers’ proper use of ADAS. The article emphasizes the need for appropriate, continual feedback to enhance driver interaction with ADAS. Traditional methods, such as user manuals or supervised test drives, have limitations in effectively conveying critical information and facilitating driver adaptation. To address these challenges, the proposed Driver Coach app provides personalized, real-time recommendations to drivers based on their individual needs and understanding of both the system and driving context. The app was tested in a field trial involving 17 drivers over a four-month period, and the results regarding the logic design verification and the impact of the Driver Coach app on PA usage are presented.

There was evidence of a moderated mediation in the sense that the indirect effects of CCA on biking and walking were stronger with higher SK. Individuals with higher CCA are more likely to perform GPB and biking, especially with higher SK.",2590-1982,Not found
"Disability, victimisation, and safety in train travel",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101131,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Individuals with disabilities constitute a vulnerable heterogeneous group of travellers in public transport. The present study aims to investigate victimisation and perceived safety patterns among train travellers with disabilities (asthma/allergy, motion sickness, depression/anxiety, and reduced mobility). Exploratory data analysis and logistic regression were used to analyse the data coming from a sample of railway travellers across 28 municipalities in Sweden (N = 3374). Individuals with disabilities are more likely to be victimised in transit than those with no disability and declared feeling more unsafe than the rest of the travellers, especially if they had been previously victimised. Like other passengers, individuals with disabilities complain about aggressive panhandling, sexual harassment, the presence of intoxicated people, and a lack of staff. Including disability groups and their special needs in planning is essential to make public transportation safer and more inclusive.",2590-1982,Not found
Artificial Neural Network-based model to predict the International Roughness Index of national highways in Nepal,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101128,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Reliable predictions of pavement performance are crucial for road maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction planning. To facilitate predictions of the International Roughness Index (IRI) changes over time on national highways in Nepal, this study develops a comprehensive overall model, along with regional models that consider climatic and traffic variations among the highways. The study models IRI over time using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach and compares the results with those obtained from a multiple linear regression-based model. The models are developed using pavement IRI, traffic, and climatic (rainfall and temperature) data specific to national highways of Nepal, encompassing 1745 sections and 3710 total observations. The ANN-based overall model has a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.82 and outperforms the regression-based model, which has an R2 value of 0.76. The regional models developed for the Terai, Hill, high volume Terai and low volume Terai highways have R2 values of 0.87, 0.91, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively, indicating a good fit. Analysis of the IRI trend over time, as observed from the performance curves generated from the ANN-based model, revealed an S-shaped pattern and lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to the regression-based model. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the initial pavement IRI as the most significant parameter in all cases. High temperature days emerged as the second most influential parameter in most models, except for the high volume Terai model, where the number of commercial vehicles serves as the second most sensitive parameter after the initial IRI.",2590-1982,Not found
Access to Emergency Services: A New York City Case Study,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101111,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Emergency services play a crucial role in safeguarding human life and property within society. In this paper, we propose a network-based methodology for calculating transportation access between emergency services and the broader community. Using New York City as a case study, this study identifies ‘emergency service deserts’ based on the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) guidelines, where accessibility to Fire, Emergency Medical Services, Police, and Hospitals are compromised. The results show that while 95% of NYC residents are well-served by emergency services, the residents of Staten Island are disproportionately underserved. By quantifying the relationship between first responder travel time, Emergency Services Sector (ESS) site density, and population density, we discovered a negative power law relationship between travel time and ESS site density. This relationship can be used directly by policymakers to determine which parts of a community would benefit the most from providing new ESS locations. Furthermore, this methodology can be used to quantify the resilience of emergency service infrastructure by observing changes in accessibility in communities facing threats.",2590-1982,Not found
The impact of road accidents on hospital admissions and the potential of ADAS in containing health expenditure: Evidence from Piedmont data,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101125,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"On average, more than 3,600 people die every day on world’s roads: road accidents result in over 1.3 million deaths and 50 million injuries annually, placing a significant burden on society and generating substantial economic costs for Governments and Regions, which are responsible for healthcare expenditures. This study proposes and applies a novel methodology aimed at quantifying the effects obtainable from the use of the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) on the base of a real case, in economic terms as well. The real case consists on the analysis of a very large dataset regarding public health and hospital admissions, made possible by the exceptional access to the internal database, available for this scope, of the Piedmont Region (IT). Unlike the decades that have passed, it is now conceivable to identify transport related technological solutions that make it possible to prevent, sometimes even avoid, road accidents or at least reduce their severity. These solutions can be identified in ADAS. In a nutshell, their aim is to create a protective layer that mitigates the risk of accidents or reduces their severity. This concept is analogous to the “onion diagram” used in the railway sector, where multiple layers of protection prevent a single failure from leading to an accident. In essence, ADAS aim to introduce the industrial concept of fail-safe into road transport, at least providing it with a pre-alert: safety has been so far delegated only to the driver’s alertness, caution and dexterity. Through the selective analysis of the health costs linked to road accidents, it is possible to quantify the elements considered important for the choices of public decision-makers on both subjects of health and sustainable mobility: in the Piedmont region, the average cost of a hospitalization following a road accident in 2013 was significantly higher than a hospitalization due to general trauma and values have remained similar in the following years. In the same period, road accidents accounted for 15% of the total number of injuries due to trauma, which implies this share can be affected by the adoption of ADAS, so as analysed within this paper for the years 2017–2019, i.e. before the COVID-19 pandemic. The weight of road accidents on hospitalisation is quantified: on the base of a huge Italian database, the average costs of hospitalisation due to loss of control is quantified. The role of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) for reducing costs of hospitalisation emerges.",2590-1982,Not found
Using Facebook to Recruit Urban Participants for Smartphone-Based Travel Surveys,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101116,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Social media has become an integral part of everyday life for many individuals, serving as a platform to express opinions, share memories and lifestyles, follow news, and adapt to social trends and norms. The wealth of user information and analytics on these platforms has facilitated the development and sale of tailored products and services, benefiting advertisers and researchers seeking survey participants. Social media advertising has demonstrated its effectiveness in reaching hard-to-reach populations. However, transport researchers have yet to capitalise on this potential fully. This paper presents our experience using social media to recruit participants for two smartphone travel surveys conducted in Australia. We demonstrate that social media recruitment and smartphone-based travel surveys are highly effective, adaptable, and can be rapidly deployed in response to research opportunities, such as during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional methods may be less suitable. This approach also holds great potential for travel surveys targeting the general population. This paper shares several lessons from this experiment, including our administrative approach and detailed technical instructions to utilise open-source software tools for conducting smartphone travel surveys like ours. This approach significantly reduces study costs compared to most commercial solutions.",2590-1982,Not found
Media reporting on cannabis-impaired driving and related traffic policy in Canada,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101120,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Background In 2018, Canada legalized recreational use of cannabis and introduced new traffic laws to deter impaired driving. These laws received a significant amount of media coverage during legalization. News media framing of driving after cannabis use (DACU) and related traffic policy can influence public opinion on these issues. Objectives To understand how DACU and related traffic policy is constructed in Canadian media, examine whether this has changed over time since legalization, and describe and contrast media representation in British Columbia and Ontario. Methods A database of Canadian news content (Canadian Newsstream) was searched for reports published between January 2017 and December 2021. A total of 261 media reports with a focus on DACU published in English in British Columbia and Ontario were selected. Reports were analyzed using content and thematic analyses. Results The majority of reports depicted DACU as dangerous and legal changes were typically framed in terms of preventing impaired driving. Concerns were frequently expressed over the reliability and accuracy of roadside oral fluid testing and police readiness to detect impaired drivers. Media description of the effects of cannabis legalization on DACU became more positive after legalization. Media portrayal did not differ markedly between British Columbia and Ontario. Conclusions Media coverage of the new laws may have enhanced their deterrent effect by informing the public about safety risks and legal repercussions associated with DACU. However, mixed messages about law enforcements’ ability to detect and punish impaired drivers may have encouraged DACU by signalling the uncertainty of punishment.",2590-1982,Not found
Bridging the gap: Do community needs assessments enhance public participation in transportation planning?,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101114,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Traditional avenues of public input in the transportation planning process require residents to have the time, knowledge, and capacity to participate. Those who don’t – often lower-income and other disadvantaged groups – are left out. To encourage more broad-based participation, some states and localities have funded additional community-based, grassroots-organized transportation studies to explicitly engage with underrepresented populations. However, the effectiveness of such studies is an open question. This study analyzes the results of a pilot program in California to determine whether community studies, or community studies, include the disadvantaged groups they intended to include, and whether they offer additional benefits or costs compared to traditional public participation processes in transportation planning. The California Air Resources Board funded a series of community transportation needs assessments under the Clean Mobility Options pilot program that were intended to include historically underrepresented groups in identifying their transportation needs and potential solutions. We examine responses from those programs’ resident surveys, community engagement strategies, and findings from the needs assessments' final reports, to identify factors that predict successful outreach. We also compare public participation methods in community needs assessments with those in long-range transportation plans. Although we are unable to ascertain whether the community studies led to any changes in local transportation systems, we do identify the conditions under which additional engagement encourages traditionally hard-to-reach communities to participate in transportation planning, as well as when it does not. We conclude this paper with recommendations for when additional studies can be useful, and alternative policies to address equity gaps in the transportation planning process.",2590-1982,Not found
Assessing spatial disparities and urban facility accessibility in promoting health and well-being,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101126,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Spatial disparities in health issues persist within urban development, particularly in areas undergoing urbanization processes, especially in developing countries. Consequently, it is imperative to address the challenge of establishing self-sufficient neighborhoods with essential living functions where residents can meet their daily needs. This study aims to address this challenge, which is crucial to explore and comprehend these disparities and to inform appropriate planning. The study focuses on spatial disparities and accessibility to urban facilities, with a specific case study conducted in Pathum Thani Province, Thailand, based on spatial network analysis. Subsequently, the study considers differences in access within the context of the urban hierarchy. The results indicate that Pathum Thani province offers a wide distribution of activities and services directly related to health, with most residents having accessibility within a 15-minute radius.

A latent class analysis of public perceptions about shared mobility barriers and benefits,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101132,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The United States faces urban issues like congestion and pollution due to heavy car dependency, with over 91% owning cars and 87% driving to work. In response to these challenges, various shared mobility solutions have been integrated into transportation systems, encompassing bike-sharing, e-scooter sharing, and ride-hailing, but have not seen widespread adoption. To this end, this study investigates the perception of these services in the context of benefits and barriers. A survey was conducted in Indianapolis, Indiana and distributed online, gathering 424 responses. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to determine groups of individuals with similar perceptions. The LCA identified three classes regarding perceptions of shared mobility benefits, and three others in relation to barriers. Regarding benefits, the classes include “Casual observers of benefits,” predominantly comprising older, less active females; “Benefits proponents,” featuring a majority of young, well-educated, higher-income males who prioritize health; and “Non-believers in benefits,” primarily consisting of older individuals, often identifying as black, with lower incomes and less active commuting. In terms of barriers, the classes are “Indifferent about barriers,” mainly comprising younger, lower-income individuals; “Shared mobility bystanders,” primarily characterized by older individuals with infrequent work commutes; and “Barrier conscious,” mostly including younger, well-educated, racially diverse individuals with complex commuting patterns. In both the benefits and barriers categories, the largest classes consist of individuals with neutral perspectives on shared mobility, signifying that a substantial portion of the population has not fully embraced these services. The study recommends policies to promote shared mobility to this significant population segment.",2590-1982,Not found
Investigating the cost of mechanized unpaved road maintenance operations in Uganda,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101135,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Force Account Mechanism (FAM) is the predominant road maintenance system in Uganda’s local government setup and a similar, though slightly different approach, is used in some large private sector agriculture plantations. With the Uganda Road Fund (URF) 2021/2022 annual report and previous research citing challenges in cost management and efficiency of the FAM method of road maintenance, it becomes paramount to analyse how FAM is implemented in government-led operations, in comparison to similar private sector approaches, while proposing possible solutions to these challenges. This research offered to analyse unpaved road maintenance cost drivers alongside providing a cost model solution to improve on cost prediction of the FAM system. Gulu District Local Government (DLG) and Kakira Sugar Limited (KSL) were selected as case study areas. Two descriptive research methods were used: observations and case study approach. The selected case study areas were accessible and reachable in terms of data. Control parameters affecting unpaved mechanized road maintenance were identified as machine repair costs, tool costs, labour costs, material costs, fuel costs and machine fuel costs. Unpaved mechanized road maintenance costs at KSL and Gulu DLG were computed as a cost/km ratio of 26,442,032Ugx/km (6,958.4USD/km) and 32,674,895Ugx/km (8,598.65USD/km) respectively. The Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) unpaved road maintenance costs were calculated as an average of 34,987,122.9Ugx/km (9,165USD/km) while the World Bank ROCKS database provided a comparable figure of 7,971USD/km (30,553,440.83Ugx/km). A USD to Ugx conversion rate of 3,800 was used. Two linear regression cost models with a 0.679 and 0.687 R2 value were computed, and these can be used in preliminary road maintenance cost prediction. The study recommends the need for an effective, digital road maintenance cost database system for mechanized unpaved road maintenance works, cost driver analytics and management, alongside improvement in aspects of maintenance processes at both the DLG and KSL. Further research can be conducted on equipment condition level prediction and analytics in the private sector and at the DLG.",2590-1982,Not found
Build it and they will come? The effects of a new infrastructure on cycling practices and experiences,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101121,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"What are the effects of cycling infrastructure? This question is crucial as cities begin to give more space to cycling. In this paper, we propose to use the theoretical concept of affordance to consider not only what a cycle lane affords (or enables), but also how it does this and for whom. This has led us to consider three dimensions: (1) the number of cyclists using a route, (2) their characteristics and (3) their experience of cycling. We adopt an approach that combines counting, observation, and intercept surveys both before and then one year after the installation of a new 1.1 km cycle lane in Fribourg, Switzerland. A large increase in cycling traffic following the introduction of the cycle lane (+20 % on weekdays) reveals a latent demand that has been triggered by an improvement in cycling infrastructure. While the characteristics of cyclists (age, gender, etc.) did not fundamentally change, there was a clear improvement in the experience of cycling, particularly in terms of feeling safe. This effect is important, as developing cycling is not only about attracting new users but also reinforcing potentially fragile existing practices. Nonetheless, for a minority of users, the new infrastructure still does not meet safety expectations, and the lack of cycling amenities in the rest of the town limits the expansion of cycling. The approach we have designed could be replicated in other contexts by researchers, advocates, or professionals in order to obtain comparative data on cycling infrastructure.",2590-1982,Not found
Assessing grocery shopping behaviors during a health crisis,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101124,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Though pandemics are relatively rare, epidemics, health crises, and other disasters are not. This study analyzes how people accessed essential goods, specifically groceries, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely representative of how consumers will behave during comparable crises. Specifically, the study explores shopping channels and transportation implications related to public health measures and various population characteristics in the United States and California. The analyses evidenced geographic differences, which the study explores in the Sacramento Area Council of Governments region. This research uses data from several time-varying sources to perform (1) aggregate or population-level (using local projections methodology) and (2) disaggregate or individual-level (using multinomial logit, MNL, models) analyses. The MNL models explore personal attributes related to shopping channel choices using the COVID-19 Future Survey (Salon et al., 2021). The disaggregate analysis explores basket size, trip and order/delivery frequencies, and complementary or substitution shopping patterns collected from the study region (Forscher et al., 2021). COVID-19 led to increased adoption of online grocery shopping, though most people still visited the store. Aggregate patterns show that grocery store visits quickly returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline, with influences from increased COVID-19 cases and mask mandates. Even more, the authors model the revealed preferences of survey participants and identify groups that may have experienced additional barriers or benefits to adopting a shopping channel. This study identifies income, ability status, and age as significant considerations for equitable access to essential goods during a crisis.

Conceptual fault-handling system design for driverless trucks – A case study based on industry practices in Sweden,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101123,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Driverless trucks have the potential to contribute to a more sustainable freight transport system. However, the role of the human driver is crucial when the truck experiences a fault. This paper explores how a fault-handling system for driverless trucks can be designed to achieve high uptime and how an intelligent decision support system (DSS) can support uptime in this context. The study focuses on hub-to-hub freight transport and on the faults where the driver is presently involved. Service design methods such as field visits, semi-structured interviews, and a workshop were used. Service scenarios were developed to visualize system design considerations, and a conceptual system design is proposed. The study has resulted in an actor-network map for the fault-handling system design, a service scenario to illustrate the fault-handling process for driverless trucks, and five considerations for the proposed system design: 1) fault detection and monitoring, 2) decision-making and action, 3) information exchange, communication, and analysis, 4) information retrieval and diagnosis, 5) experience and learning. The main conclusions of this paper are that the driver’s role and activities need to be taken into account when developing new tools and services for driverless vehicle fault handling; an intelligent DSS can support humans in decision-making in fault-handling situations; a remote control center and an updated system design can help maintain uptime for driverless trucks.",2590-1982,Not found

To this end, our time-series vector error correction models analyze the short- and long-run causalities between our focal TIS and its context structures. Using publications, patents, and standards as quantitative TIS indicators, we analyze the modes of technology interaction between FCVs and EVs and FCVs and ICEVs to determine the life-cycle phase of our focal FCV-TIS in more depth.

Understanding what factors help or hinder implementation is important. In the UK, Clean Air Zones (CAZ, a type of LEZ) are being implemented in several cities. We aimed to identify key barriers and enablers to the implementation of a CAZ in real time, as policy was being developed and implemented in a large Northern city in England, UK. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with city stakeholders and implementors approximately 6 months before a CAZ charging non-compliant taxis, buses, heavy goods vehicles and vans was launched. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Implementers were required to operate within a tight policy framework. Key enablers included: freedom to adapt the framework to local context, financial support, and cross-sector working. A focus on health was felt to be useful in justifying the policy to the public. Key barriers included conflict and opposition from local industry, politicians, and communities. Implementation of air quality policy which involves traffic restrictions remains controversial. The voices which ‘shout the loudest’ are often those with negative views, and these can create divisive discourse which shape public opinion and damage confidence of implementers.

Several approaches to doing so exist but lack the ability to compare both service and station performance in a single dimension. The study presented here proposes the use of the Rasch analysis technique within an operational context to compare the relative dwell time performance of stations and services. To do so, we make use of data from commuter trains in Sweden and the UK. The results from the study suggest that the method can be used to study dwell times on a line level and can capture the variability in dwell times. Assessing the model output also shows that the approach adequately reflects the expected variability in both service performance and station difficulty. Comparing the model output to more commonly used indicators for dwell time, we find that the Rasch analysis allows us to better identify cases where planners can make adjustments to reduce the likelihood of dwell time delays. In addition to this, we highlight that a common assumption that more passengers lead to worse dwell times does not hold. Having more in-depth insights into where dwell time performance is troublesome can help planners to make more informed decisions which helps towards improving overall dwell time performance, reducing delays, and improving the attractiveness of trains as a mode of transport.",2590-1982,Not found

On the practical utility of a continuum traffic flow model on curvy highways in adverse weather conditions,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101108,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The macroscopic continuum traffic flow models are being investigated to predict and ameliorate traffic more efficiently. These models are beneficial implementation tools to comprehend and complement the shortfalls in traffic evolution. Despite the significant enhancements in devising the traffic dynamics, the practical utilization of these macroscopic models is not being fully explored. In this study, the Non-Homogeneous Stimulus-Response Model (NHSRM) (Imran et al., 2023) is investigated for its application in forecasting traffic flow on a curvy highway during various weather conditions. The weather impact, in the specific, dry, light rainfall, moderate rainfall, and heavy rainfall on the travel time, velocity, and density spatiotemporal evolution on a curvy highway is analyzed. The flow during different weather conditions is investigated over two curved roads with 120 m, and 500 m radii. As evident from the results, significant velocity breakdowns during heavy rainfall impact the upstream traffic which contributes to congestion development. The average velocity of traffic depletes significantly, and the congestion formation upstream is significant. While the travel time of particular highway segments elevates sharply during heavy rainfall.

"Exploring online shopping behavior in Dhaka, Bangladesh",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101081,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Compared to the Western world, online shopping penetration in Bangladesh is relatively low – a mere 3% of people do online shopping there. However, the country encountered a surge in online buying propensity in 2020 due to COVID-19-related lockdown measures. Online shopping increased in the country by 70 % in 2020 compared to last year. It is forecasted that business-to-customer e-commerce will double by 2026. 50 % of the expanding e-commerce consumers reside in the capital, Dhaka. This study aims to characterize the growing number of online shoppers and capture the heterogeneous impact of online shopping on physical shopping frequency. The study uses data from a survey conducted during the last two months of 2021. Responses from 308 individuals were used to develop a binary logit model to capture the heterogeneity among online shoppers. Additionally, a generalized ordered logit model was developed to capture the heterogeneous change in the physical shopping frequency due to online shopping participation. The study identified exciting gender differences. In Dhaka, females are more likely to shop online than males. Moreover, for females, online shopping is a substitute for physical buying, i.e., female online buyers are almost 50 % more likely to reduce their physical shopping frequency than males. On the other hand, car owners are more likely to engage in online shopping in the city, and when they do, their physical shopping frequency is more likely to be reduced than non-car owners. The latter result indicates that the diffusion of innovation hypothesis is more likely to be at play in Dhaka.",2590-1982,Not found
Attentiveness in urban spaces: The rhythm of the street,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101063,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Driver vigilance research focuses on the safety impacts of maintaining sustained attention in underload conditions when automatic responses are adequate to the task and responses are sparse. However, urban environments have frequent risks that appear chaotically and require high levels of engagement—a very different vigilance task. Although drivers perceive a wide range of task demands as manageable, their movement patterns hint at more active engagement as they approach overload. This condition we are calling “Attentiveness,” to distinguish it from the classic exploration of vigilance in underload conditions. To understand how the built environment impacts driving automaticity and vigilance, data from the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) was used to evaluate driving patterns within urban multimodal street sections. Data for acceleration, jerk, lane position, and speed were tabulated for ten, 5-second epochs at 200 multimodal locations and compared to the behavior for the entire length of the drive. The built environment variables that demonstrated a strong correlation and impact size for a change in driver behavior included doorway density, block length, Walkscore, corridor aspect ratio (height over width), and terminated vistas. The commonality for these variables is that each one impacts the rate that novel stimuli arrive as drivers progress sequentially along their path. Acceleration, jerk, and lane position appear to be related to the rhythm of interruptions that occur along the length of the roadway.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring the components of “Kando” and the factors evoking it during motorcycle riding,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101104,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"This study focused on the physical activity of riding a motorcycle with a mechanical motor or engine and “kando” – a difficult concept to translate into English and explain to a Western audience. Kando is a ubiquitous Japanese expression used when people are emotionally moved. This study elucidated the components of kando regarding motorcycle riding and the factors that evoke it. Data were collected from 23 motorcyclists through online focus-group interviews and analyzed using the KH Coder. Six factors, “convenience,” “inconvenience,” “bodily,” “interaction,” “variety,” and “stimulation,” were identified as the unique aspects of motorcycle riding that evoke kando. Kando’s objects included “motorcycle as a vehicle,” “nature,” and “humans.” Kando was produced through the combination of the six unique factors and the three aforementioned objects; moreover, kando while riding a motorcycle comprised 10 factors, “delight,” “excitement,” “stimulation of the five senses,” “overcoming,” “achievement,” “warmth,” “sense of healing,” “exhilaration,” “sense of release,” and “sense of bonding.” Motorcyclists experience kando through motorcycle riding as a physical activity. The findings could contribute to further elucidating the term kando and motorcycle development.",2590-1982,Not found
Investigating the association between perceived risk levels and commuting mode shifts after the lifting of the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control policies,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101085,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"There is a research gap in understanding people's perceived risks and their commute mode shifts after the major shift in anti-pandemic policies. Our study aims to reveal the relationship between commuters' perceived risks and their commuting mode transfers in the specific context of canceling anti-pandemic policies. We conducted an online sample survey of residents in 6 neighborhoods after one month the lifting of anti-pandemic policies in Kunming, China. Measured perceived risk data suggested that a perceived risk score of 23 ∼ 30 accounted for 62 % of the respondents, who were defined as the high-perceived risk group; while the perceived risk score of 14 ∼ 22 accounted for 36 % of the respondents, who were defined as the middle-perceived risk group; only 2 % of respondents with a perceived risk score of 6 ∼ 14. Commuting mode transfer statistics showed that 22.2 % of the respondents switched from other commuting modes to private cars, of which 56.1 % came from public transportation. Conversely, out of 81 car commuters, only 3 respondents moved to other commuting modes. We used nonparametric tests to find that there were group differences in commuting mode shifts. Specifically, the proportion of commuters with high-perceived risk levels shifted from other travel modes to private cars was 11% larger than that of commuters with middle-perceived risk levels. Public commuters were more likely to switch to car commuting than active commuters. The nonparametric test results also showed that single variables such as car ownership, commute distance, age, and marital status was significantly correlated with the distribution of the shifting in commuting mode. Furthermore, we employed a binary logistic regression model to reveal that commuters with higher perceived risk levels, longer commuting distances, or car ownership were more likely to switch from other travel modes to private cars than other commuters. The conclusion of this study is that the lifting of COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control policies increases the perceived risk level of commuters, which pushes them to switch to private car commuting. It is necessary to pre-estimating people's perceived risk level, and pre-judging changes in daily commute behaviors before deciding to cancel the anti-pandemic policies.",2590-1982,Not found

Impact of internal accessibility on value creation in transit oriented development (TOD) area,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101106,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Accessibility remains an area of concern in Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) design, which involves the integrated planning of transportation and land use. Most of the research has focused on accessibility as the movement using public transportation from one transit node to another, which can be defined as external accessibility. This study uses two accessibility definitions—external and internal accessibility. Internal accessibility defined as mobility using non-motorized transportation in transit node. Along with TOD definition, the non-motorized transportation is a major influencing factor in TOD area. Value creation, which is the process of enhancing value or price to increase efficiency, is derived from land use based on the real price of land and buildings. Value creation might be used as an option for self-financing the TOD area. This paper also uses two methodologies—the TOD index calculation in several Jakarta transit areas and a value creation analysis. The relationship between the TOD index and value creation is tested using regression analysis. The results of the study demonstrate that internal accessibility planning in TOD is crucial, as it contributes 40 % to the TOD index. The model, which suggests exponential correlation, demonstrates that the correlation between internal accessibility and value creation (R2 = 0.8430) is the best compared to the correlation between value creation and TOD index (R2 = 0.7969) and the correlation between external accessibility and value creation (R2 = 0.6739). The results are beneficial for urban and transportation planners, as enhanced internal accessibility increases value creation in TOD.",2590-1982,Not found
Climate mitigation and adaptation strategies in the transport sector: An empirical investigation in Germany,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101102,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Due to climate change, extreme weather events will increase in intensity, frequency, and duration in the future, negatively impacting logistics and transport systems. The threat of missing climate targets and a lack of climate adaptivity strategies in the transport sector leads to growing climate-related risks for transportation companies. The present paper provides a qualitative study exploring mitigation and adaptation strategies within the logistics sector. It analyzes the challenges transportation companies face in developing climate-neutral business models and adapting to the consequences of climate change. Our results show that logistics companies need to be more prepared for the consequences of climate change and, at the same time, insufficiently address climate change mitigation, making the sector more vulnerable to climate extremes in the future. A transformation framework is developed to assess the logistics firms’ climate protection measures and climate adaptation strategies while highlighting existing development lags in climate mitigation and climate adaptation.

This work focuses on the fundamental role that drivers play in shaping the vehicle’s overall behavior. While technological advancements have significantly impacted the automotive industry, defining new methodologies and approaches for vehicle controls, there is not yet a uniquely recognized procedure to objectively define the skills and weaknesses of pilots. This paper aims to present the preliminary results of an innovative study, based on an outdoor test campaign with a fully instrumented vehicle, driven on track by several drivers with different levels of experience. Starting from the collected data, a series of objective and generalized metrics have been defined in order to quantify different aspects related to the direct driver interaction with the car and to the trajectory repeatability. By analyzing the results obtained from these metrics, it has been possible to highlight the differences among the participants in the experimental campaign. In order to create a practical visualization of the goodness of the approach, a driver ranking has been defined and it is coherent with both the best lap times obtained by the drivers and their actual experience.",2590-1982,Not found
Bearing the weight: A qualitative study on expert views on integrating ethics in autonomous vehicles?,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101096,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"AVs are increasingly becoming present on public roads, the ethics of which have captured the publics attention. This study represents the first ever investigation into the opinion of AV development experts on the ethics of programming AVs in collision scenarios. The study makes use of a qualitative research model. A sample of 24 Swiss experts were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The majority of experts were directly involved in the development of AVs and represented both research, private, and public sectors as well as national regulatory bodies. Three core themes emerged from the data. 1) Experts were keenly aware of the ethical challenges involved in AVs on public roads, including in collision situations. 2) Experts felt a moral responsibility for how AVs are programmed and developed. However, experts’ moral framework was not well developed with many experts stating that their own personal moral framework should not be used to program motion planning. 3) Experts saw a need for an ethical framework to guide the development of AVs. The paper concludes that it is clear experts are keenly aware of the ethics involved in AVs on public roads, and in particular collision scenarios. They feel a sense of responsibility for how AVs are programmed but do not feel ethically well-equipped themselves. Experts would, therefore, appreciate an ethical framework that would assist the development of these algorithms. This framework may be driven by either industry or government but should be clear and simple. We recommend countries like Switzerland develop such a framework.",2590-1982,Not found

Change in work arrangement during the COVID-19 pandemic: A large shift to remote and hybrid work,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100969,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"With two repeated cross-sectional datasets collected in Southern California, we investigate changes in work arrangement and commute trip generation across four timepoints before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: fall 2019 (recalled in fall 2020 retrospectively); fall 2020 and summer 2021 (reported at the moment); and summer 2022 (an expectation as of summer 2021 for a near future prospectively). Our results highlight a large shift from physical commutes to exclusively/predominantly remote work for many workers in fall 2020, followed by a transition towards hybrid work (combining in-person work and remote work) in summer 2021. The adoption of remote/hybrid work varied considerably across different types of workers and sociodemographic groups, prominently driven by high-income earners, highly educated individuals, urban residents, full-time workers, and those with white-collar, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), and government jobs. As the pandemic subsides, many workers have returned to physical commutes for some of their workdays, but the prevalence of remote/hybrid work is expected to endure into the future. These findings confirm oft-discussed trends and anecdotal evidence in the study region. However, the study provides rigorous quantitative evidence into reasons behind these observations and heterogeneity across groups. We also suggest forward-looking policies to promote transportation equity, reimagine transportation options, and support public transit to adapt to the evolving travel patterns in the post-pandemic society.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring equity perception of electric vehicles from a social media perspective,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101103,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered a promising solution for climate change. However, their introduction has raised uncertainties in transportation equity, reflecting the diverse public perceptions and discussions on this issue. Understanding these perceptions is crucial for integrating equity into EV adoption effectively. To bridge this gap, our study used a social media approach to conduct a cross-platform equity analysis on two popular online social networks (OSNs): Twitter and Reddit. We identified 22,533 tweets and 12,318 Reddit comments relevant to equity from all EV-related discussions from 2011 to 2022. Our analysis utilized different features of the two OSNs, including verified account identity and Reddit communities, to present a comprehensive picture of equity perception in social media. Additionally, we used machine learning methods to infer Twitter users’ demographic attributes and integrate user demographics into equity analysis. Our findings show that political accounts are the center of attention on Twitter, but they are accompanied by negative attitudes. Many fringe communities are highly active in equity discussions on Reddit. Our study also found that younger people pay less attention and hold more negative sentiments towards equity discussions, while male and female users have similar interests in equity and similar sentiment.

Driving into the future: A scoping review of smartwatch use for real-time driver monitoring,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101098,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The use of smartwatches has increased significantly in recent years for leisure, health, and research purposes. In the transport sector, smartwatches facilitate cost-effective, unintrusive, and dynamic monitoring of the driver’s state and behavior while on the road. This scoping review aimed to analyze and synthesize publications that have collected smartwatch data during driving to examine the driver’s condition, behavior, in-cabin activities, and reactions. The main objective was to assess the extent to which smartwatches have been included in driving-related studies, organize the relevant literature thematically, and identify the issues that arise during the collection and analysis of smartwatch data. A scoping review was conducted and 76 eligible records were identified based on the framework provided by Arksey and O’Malley. The publications differed significantly in terms of their main purposes, number of recruited participants, smartwatches used, and methodologies applied. Five main themes were identified in the relevant literature: driver state assessment, benchmark performance, driver assistance systems and interventions, exogenous and endogenous factors, and detection of driving events. The review confirms the potential of smartwatches as a tool for driver monitoring, which goes beyond the capabilities of questionnaires. Some studies reported data-related problems, mainly related to data loss and sweating. Future research should adopt a more comprehensive approach to driver monitoring by expanding the collection of data beyond the narrow context of the driving task to include measurements related to the long-term health of the driver, such as sleep, resting heart rate, and physical activity.",2590-1982,Not found
Design of flexible partitions for physical distancing in buses in Colombia during COVID-19,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101101,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The scientific community recognizes that the transport of cargo and passengers is a key factor in the spread of infectious disease pandemics. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic, public transport systems have been considered high-risk environments for the transmission of the virus; therefore, in many places around the world, restrictions have been imposed on passenger transport. Although different aspects of transport have been studied during the pandemic, there are still gaps in knowledge about the effect of different means of transport and specific interventions for vehicle design strategies to reduce transmission rates. In this context, this article presents the process of co-designing a flexible partition to divide seats on articulated, standard and complementary vehicles of a bus rapid transit system in a Colombian capital city as a vehicle design strategy to contain the spread of the virus and generate a physical barrier when the physical distance of one meter, as required by national regulations, was unable to be maintained. The design methodology followed an incremental and iterative process of 6 stages until reaching the final design. The process began with the identification of the need, the establishment of the design requirements and determinants, the generation of proposals framed within the requirements, the performance of functionality and cost feasibility tests and the building of the prototype with the chosen design. Additionally, a participatory evaluation was carried out based on the identification of relevant aspects, doubts, criticisms and new contributions to the prioritized prototype. Finally, the generated prototype met the design requirements in addition to a significant cost reduction of 70% compared with the initial proposal by the bus rapid transit. The low cost allows the implementation of the partition throughout the bus fleet, but controlled observational and clinical studies on the effectiveness of the partition in the prevention of COVID-19 are required.",2590-1982,Not found

This paper is part of this process and aims to propose an easily applicable and versatile operational methodology for prioritizing maintenance interventions generally scheduled on road networks of considerable extent. An operational methodology for ranking and prioritizing maintenance interventions is proposed; this method is applicable to road networks of such size that direct inspection of each situation is impossible. The core of the paper is the analytical description of this methodology, based on a weighted sum function of three blocks: i) Category − is a score related to the purpose of the intervention; ii) Asset − is a score due to the road on which the intervention is located (considering Average Daily Traffic, Accidentality, Social Cost, Road Type, Routes); iii) Typology − is a score related to the element on which the intervention is being carried out. After describing the parameters and the implementation procedure for each block, the calibration of the relative weights is described, and a sensitivity analysis is performed. In the case study, the proposed methodology is applied to the ANAS corporate network in Italy. This case study will highlight the usefulness, versatility, and operability of the methodology with GIS (Geographic Information System) tools for implementing thematic maps.

In fact, the current prevalence of disabilities among women exceeds that of men. Conversely, women with disabilities experience elevated levels of risk in transportation as a result of various circumstances, including budgetary constraints, safety and security concerns, and discriminatory practices. Conversations about the travel behavior exhibited by women with disabilities might contribute to developing appropriate transportation strategies and enhancing the productivity and mobility of women with disabilities. This study explored the behaviors of women with disabilities in DKI Jakarta, Indonesia. This was accomplished by examining the travel diaries of 12 participants for one week, followed by interviews. The findings indicate certain resemblances in travel behavior between women with disabilities and women in the general population.

In this research, we examine the adoption and impact of EZfare – a mobile fare payment technology recently adopted by transit agencies in Ohio and Northern Kentucky. We hypothesize that EZfare adoption by riders across the study area will be different based on individual socioeconomic/demographic attributes. We also expect established EZfare users to travel more frequently over time compared to nonusers. We test these hypotheses with survey data of transit users between October 2020 – July 2022. We find that being unbanked or above 45 years of age reduced the odds of EZfare use by 60 % and 49 % respectively. While low-income status (household income below $20,000) was not significantly associated with later adoption, the highest earning respondents (income above $100,000) were almost 4 times as likely to be EZfare users. Also, the odds of EZfare use were at least 2.5 times higher for respondents who had no household vehicle or no driver’s license. We found that among EZfare users who had used the platform for at least six months, travel frequency to work and recreational activity was 16 % and 32 % higher respectively, compared to newer EZfare users and nonusers. This study provides empirical evidence that the adoption of mobile fare payment technology may be influenced by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The potential impact of this technology on the frequency of transit use suggests that adoption may be beneficial for transit providers and users.",2590-1982,Not found

To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted an exploratory study on public perceptions of cybersecurity regulation and consumer data in AVs acceptance by surveying nationally representative individuals from four OECD countries (US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand). A total of 2062 responses collected from the survey underwent Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to examine constructs such as Cybersecurity Regulation, Data Sharing, Data Usage, Data Concerns, and intention to use AVs. Correlation analysis further explored the relationships between these constructs, while Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H tests assessed the significance of differences across participant groups. The empirical findings indicate that 80% of respondents agreed on the necessity of cybersecurity regulation for AV operations, with 67% perceiving it as a means to enhance AV safety. Surprisingly, 66% supported cybersecurity regulation despite the potential risk of exposing their personal information. Individuals who are more willing to share AV data also expressed a higher likelihood of using AVs. Furthermore, those who agreed more with cybersecurity regulations were more inclined to be compensated for their data transmission while expressing concerns about data storage and processing. Moreover, around 53% of participants feel they should be compensated for sharing their AV data, with 68% expressing concern about AVs' data storage and processing and 71% supporting the destruction of AV data post-sale. Regarding data privacy concerns, “In-vehicle Private Conversation” draws notable attention, rated very important or extremely important by 64% of the participants.

Investigation of discrepancies in South Carolina traffic collision forms,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101088,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The aim of this study is to improve the accuracy of information recorded in the South Carolina traffic collision forms. To accomplish this, it examines 200 forms containing information about fatal crashes in work zones between 2014 and 2020 to determine how many discrepancies exist between the written narrative and other fields. In addition to obtaining these statistics, this study seeks to identify factors that influence discrepancies. To test the hypothesis that crash complexity and weather influence the investigating officer’s level of processing (a theory developed by Craik and Lockhart in 1972), and consequentially his/her ability to complete the traffic collision form accurately, a structural equation model (SEM) is developed. The SEM is used to explain the relationships between measured variables and latent variables and the relationships between latent variables (crash characteristics, weather conditions, and level of processing). SEM results show that increases in collision speed, number of units, number of events, and temperature resulted in an increase in the number of words and characters written in the narrative, whereas increases in precipitation and humidity resulted in a decrease in the number of words and characters written in the narrative. Notably, the number of discrepancies was not statistically significant, suggesting crash and weather-related factors do not affect an officer’s reporting accuracy. A multiple linear regression model is also developed to identify factors that influence a form field’s frequency of discrepancies. The form field’s level of difficulty and its number of inputs are found to be statistically significant.",2590-1982,Not found
Network traffic management via exclusive roads for altruistic vehicles under mixed traffic equilibrium,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101042,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"We present a computational study of network ensembles with two types of coexisting vehicle classes: an altruistically routing vehicle (ARV) class – potentially automated vehicles that are routed to reduce total system travel time – and a selfishly routing vehicle (SRV) class, corresponding to human-driven vehicles. We investigate the performance of these networks when some links are reserved for exclusive use by the ARVs. The goal of these interventions is to avoid or mitigate the detrimental effects of the SRVs on the costs of the ARVs. We formulate the problem as a bi-level network design problem, where the upper level deals with optimising the choice of ARV-exclusive links minimising the statistical dispersion of used-route costs, while the lower level finds the corresponding traffic equilibrium under static traffic assignment conditions. We tackle the ARV-exclusive link selection with a genetic algorithm, where the fitness of solutions is based on the dispersion of the costs of routes used by ARVs. The mixed equilibrium is found by solving a multi-class static traffic assignment problem, with constraints on the SRV flows on the ARV-exclusive links. SRVs attempt to minimise their personal travel time, whilst ARVs attempt to drive the flows to system optimal. Our approach is effective in reducing the per-vehicle travel cost of the ARVs to below that of the SRVs, making altruistic routing a more attractive option on average. Our results are consistent across networks with different structures and demand levels.",2590-1982,Not found
School transportation data safety trends,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101089,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The daily trip to and from school represents an important and necessary travel activity for millions of children across the United States.

These travel decisions are also influenced by safety or perceived safety concerns. In this study, the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) was used as a benchmark to assess school transportation safety trends over the last two decades. Although there were some limitations to the dataset, which will be carefully explained in detail, the overall trends indicate that the trip to and from school remains a relatively safe activity, particularly along rural facilities where positive results were identified across four key metrics. Along urban facilities, slightly increasing trends were observed in the annual number of fatalities and in the number of non-motorists involved in a fatal crash, suggesting that opportunities remain to enhance and to improve the travel environment for school children.",2590-1982,Not found
We steer where we stare,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101092,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The aim of this study is to revisit the important question of how human drivers steer in straight and curved roads. We review the two-point and the tangent point models and suggest a new perspective by introducing the center point model. An eye tracking platform was used to investigate the driver’s gaze direction in real-time driving. Extensive data was collected in an urban environment via integration of the eye tracking system and a scene camera. The objectives of the experiments were to investigate the driver gaze behaviour in two scenarios in real traffic settings. In the first set of trials, the driver followed the tangent method whereas in the second set of tests, the driver focused on the perceived center of the road during driving in straight and curved roads. Moreover, the distance between the driver and the gaze point is found to be lower when turning left compared to turning right. This study underpins the improved performance of the center point model over the tangent point model. Furthermore, our analysis reveals correlation between gaze strategy and vehicular control, offering a deeper comprehension of visuomotor coordination essential for safe and efficient driving.These findings provide valuable insight into human driving behavior and can be utilized to develop more effective driver assistance systems and enhance lateral control mechanisms for driverless cars.",2590-1982,Not found
Bus drivers and their interactions with cyclists: An analysis of minor conflicts,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101074,25,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Driving a bus in a city is a challenging task as it demands paying attention to changing conditions (e.g., weather, congestion) while interacting with passengers and other road users who sometimes display unpredictable behaviours. Cyclists play an important role in these interactions. This paper investigates how cyclists are perceived by bus drivers and how conflicts arising from their daily interactions shape the attitudes of bus drivers. A total of 639 bus drivers (4% of the workforce, 91% males) working in Santiago de Chile responded an online survey. The survey asked drivers about their perception of other transport modes, their experience with traffic collisions and the conflicts they have had with cyclists. Later, logistic regression models were estimated, using “coexistence with cyclists” as the dependent variable. The findings show that younger and older drivers have a better perception of cyclists compared to middle-aged ones. Negative experiences with cyclists worsen the perception of co-existence with cyclists; meanwhile, previous cycling experience was unrelated to drivers’ perceptions. The results also suggest that existing norms are perceived as ineffective. Finally, gender was not statistically significant in shaping bus drivers’ perception of cyclists, yet this topic requires further attention as the composition of the public transport labour force is changing.",2590-1982,Not found
"Shuttle tanker operational reliability study by Gaidai multivariate risk assessment method, utilizing deconvolution scheme",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101194,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) or FLNG (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas) vessels produce and store crude oil or liquified natural gas before being transported by ST (Shuttle Tanker). Robust prediction of excessive mooring and hawser stresses being crucial for structural design and operational safety. Offloading activities may result in excessive hawser or mooring line tensions, impacting environmental and operational safety. Current study employed ANSYS-AQWA software to simulate vessels dynamics, subjected to wind-wave hydrodynamic loads, given realistic in-situ environmental conditions. State-of-the-art multi-dimensional risk assessment methodology, presented in this work being based on direct MC (Monte Carlo) simulations, however, it is equally applicable to measured data. Advocated methodology effectively utilizes underlying dataset, offering accurate failure/damage risk assessment. Current study aims to benchmark recently developed multivariate Gaidai risk assessment approach, allowing for the straightforward yet efficient prediction of failure and damage risks for nonlinear multi-dimensional dynamic offshore/naval system as a whole. Primary benefit of the proposed methodology lies in its multi-dimensionality, as it can encompass virtually infinite number of system’s dimensions/components, each having its distinct physical dimension. In contrast, traditional reliability methods are usually limited to a maximum of two-dimensional systems. Novel deconvolution extrapolation scheme offers additional advantage, being non-parametrical by its nature, as opposed to existing parametric extrapolation techniques.",2590-1982,Not found

Comparison of common methods for determining hazardous locations for improving road safety,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101196,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Identifying hazardous locations is crucial for maximising benefits from road safety investments. Using an appropriate method for identifying hazardous road locations (HRL) is essential due to limited research on existing approaches. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the four most commonly used approaches to prioritise HRLs such as crash frequency (CF), crash rate (CR) Empirical-Bayes (EB) adjustment and potential for safety improvement (PSI). This study used six years (2010–2015) of severe-crash data collected from 80 highway segments in Toowoomba, Australia. Crash prediction models were created to anticipate crash expectations. The negative binomial technique was found to be suitable for developing the models. These HRL identification techniques were assessed using rigorous quantitative criteria, such as the site consistency test, the total-rank differences test, the method consistency test and the total-score test. Our data demonstrate that the EB approach significantly outperformed the other ranking strategies. In contrast, the CR method consistently underperformed because of its inherent bias towards low-traffic sites. Notably, this technique assumes a linear relationship between CRs and traffic volume, despite earlier research proving the normal nonlinearity of this connection. As a result of this study, road engineers can develop models to predict crash trends and use the EB approach to prioritise treatment sites and identify the most hazardous locations for safety improvements. In conclusion, building on our current findings and prior research, we strongly recommend that the EB adjustment approach be adopted as the standard for determining HRLs unless alternative methods emerge to replace it.",2590-1982,Not found
Optimisation of mobility hub locations for a sustainable mobility system,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101193,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Mobility hubs facilitate the comfortable transfer between different means of transport. However, the optimal location of mobility hubs challenges municipalities due to the complexity of urban structures and the need to anticipate changes in travel behaviour. This study proposes an interdisciplinary approach to establish a more sustainable transport network by determining optimal locations for mobility hubs from a municipality’s perspective. Based on a pre-selection using a transport planning approach, we use a bilevel optimisation model to find optimal locations. The model minimizes external costs at the upper level while considering users’ route and mode choices at the lower level. We validate our approach in a case study of Aachen, Germany. Our findings indicate that implementing bike-sharing stations can significantly contribute to developing a more sustainable transportation network, while one-way car-sharing stations do not contribute to a more sustainable transport network within the model as they primarily draw away users from more sustainable modes.",2590-1982,Not found

Our approach, called Feature Pyramid biLSTM (FPbiLSTM), is characterized by its ability to reduce the number of sensors required and processing demands, resulting in a more efficient modeling process without sacrificing the quality of the outcomes than the other current models. FPbiLSTM extends an existing CNN biLSTM model with the Feature Pyramid Network, leveraging the advantages of both shallow layer richness and deeper layer feature resilience for capturing temporal moving patterns in various transportation modes. It exhibits an excellent performance by employing the data collected from only three out of seven sensors, i.e., accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, in the 2018 Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) challenge dataset, attaining a noteworthy accuracy of 95% and an F 1 -score of 94% in detecting eight different transportation modes.",2590-1982,Not found
Road traffic regulation and enforcement status: A Nepalese traffic police perspective,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101188,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"In the context of developing countries like Nepal, enhancing road traffic safety (RTS) requires prioritizing aspects such as road safety management, infrastructure improvement, vehicle safety, and promoting safer road user behavior. Importantly, establishing a conducive legal framework and ensuring effective enforcement are crucial for improving RTS. This study aims to analyze the enforcement status of road traffic regulatory factors and provide suggestions for improvement. A set of structured questionnaires comprising thirty items measuring six dimensions of road traffic regulation was developed to gather data from 396 Nepal traffic police officers. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was employed to construct the measurement model. The statistical analysis revealed that road traffic regulatory factors such as seatbelt, helmet, and license laws, along with insufficient penalties for violations related to drunk and distracted driving, speeding, and mobile phone use contribute to road traffic accidents. The findings highlight the pressing need for effective implementation of traffic regulations. To improve road safety in Nepal stricter penalties for drunk driving, speeding, and mobile phone use, advancing vehicle safety technology, formulating transportation safety policies, accrediting pre-hospital care providers, and safety auditing in road planning, construction, and operation are vital. The model developed herein provides valuable insights to policymakers to reinforce prevailing regulations for reducing traffic-related fatalities not only for Nepal but also for other countries encountering similar road safety challenges.",2590-1982,Not found

Safety assessment of tricycles has discovered that associated fatality rate and severity of injuries from tricycle crashes, which has risen steadily, are due to their flawed designs especially the absence of seatbelts and paddings of hard surfaces. Tricycle related crashes were sourced weekly from the regional office of the National Road Safety Authority from January 2012 to June 2022 and modelled with Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model.The results showed ARIMA (1,0,3) errors were retained as the best model for estimating road fatalities caused by tricycle crashes. The exogenous factors: tricycle crashes, time of day, season of the year, and road design were tested and found to be statistically significant relative to its contribution to the fatalities. The time series components were deemed to be relevant contributing factors to fatalities for the study period. Further, crash data forecasted to October 2022 largely exhibited a sinusoidal behaviour with spikes at various weeks. It was recommended that tricycle drivers undergo mandatory refresher courses on safe driving techniques and general road safety regulations as a policy intervention. In addition, the licensing regime for tricycles should be strengthened, and government should create separate lanes along some major routes within the metropolitan, municipal, and district assemblies to eliminate or reduce the negative incidents.",2590-1982,Not found
Cycling towards complete communities: Estimating access to destinations via low traffic stress cycling,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101179,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Cities worldwide are pursuing ‘complete community’ policies so that residents can walk or wheel safely to daily destinations. There are concerns about who benefits from these policies, but evaluation is lacking. This study investigated cycling accessibility in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. We aimed to test open-source tools, estimate cycling accessibility over time, and assess equity impacts. We used OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and r5r routing tools to estimate cycling accessibility before and after construction of the City of Victoria’s “all ages and abilities” (AAA) cycling network (2016 versus 2023). Based on local policy, we defined complete communities as having access to least one active living, community, education, food, health, and shopping destination within 15 minutes of cycling on low traffic stress routes. In 2023, 40% (155/391) of dissemination areas in Greater Victoria could be considered complete communities, an estimated 91% increase since 2016. Census data indicated a higher proportion of racialized people and people without post-secondary education lived in areas that did not meet our complete community definition. We found that the continuous improvement of OSM created challenges for parsing changes in the built environment from changes in data completeness. The r5r method for assigning level of traffic stress may not be sensitive enough to capture impacts from infrastructure interventions on busier roads, or upgrades to existing infrastructure. We share our learnings from this case study such that practitioners wanting to employ these tools in their own contexts are aware of data and decision considerations.",2590-1982,Not found
Pre-disaster evacuation network design with uncertain demand and behavioural choices: A bi-criteria generalized cost perspective,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101186,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Pre-disaster evacuation network design is critical to improving evacuation efficiency and reducing the loss of life and property caused by disasters. However, evacuation network design is complicated by the uncertainty of pre-disaster evacuation demand and the heterogeneity of evacuees’ route choices when faced with a disaster scenario. Therefore, how to design efficient evacuation networks considering these uncertainties has become an important research topic. In this paper, we study the pre-disaster flood evacuation network design problem, define a bi-criteria generalized cost metric based on Evacuation Travel Time (ETT) and Evacuation Network Congestion Degree (ENCD), and develop a model that considers uncertain demand and evacuation behavioural choices to minimize the generalized cost in the evacuation network. For the uncertain behavioural choice, we propose an Expanded Stochastic User Equilibrium (ESUE) model based on the Random Regret Minimization (RRM) principle and Boundedly Rational User Equilibrium (BRUE) conditions to describe it. For the uncertain demand, we design a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) method based on Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) to deal with this uncertain model. This paper designs an Improved Method of Successive Averages Combined with Genetic Algorithm (IMSA-GA) to solve the model and uses the Nguyen-Dupuis test network to verify the applicability and feasibility of the model and algorithm. In addition, we also conduct an evacuation network design in the Hawkesbury-Nepean region of Australia. The larger the threshold value based on the regret utility ratio, the smaller the generalized cost value, which indicates the behavioural choices of the evacuees have an impact on the evacuation network design, and the generalized cost decreases by 6.12% when the threshold value is increased from 0.1 to 0.9. In addition, the generalized cost value obtained by IMSA-GA will be 0.0025 lower than Improved Method of Successive Averages Combined with Simulated Annealing (IMSA-SA) and 0.0005 lower than Improved Method of Successive Averages Combined with Taboo Search (IMSA-TS). The theoretical contribution of this paper is to find an approach to the uncertain evacuation network design problem, especially to improve the practicality of the model by fully considering evacuation behaviour. The practical contribution is that our findings can provide insights for government authorities to design efficient and reliable evacuation networks that balance evacuation travel time and evacuation network congestion. In the future, if evacuation behavioural choices can be analysed based on actual surveys, the estimation of behavioural parameters based on survey data will be more instructive for the evacuation process.",2590-1982,Not found
"Exploring the interplay of transportation, time poverty, and activity participation",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101175,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Transport-related social exclusion describes how a lack of transportation resources hinders participation in society. Time poverty refers to situations in which work and household commitments deprive people of time for other meaningful or necessary activities. Research integrating both concepts is limited, despite evidence that excessive daily travel times can lead to transport-related time poverty. We propose a conceptual framework to bridge existing time use and transport-related social exclusion frameworks to understand transportation’s contribution to time poverty. We apply our framework to the Canadian General Social Survey (GSS)’s time use module by conducting a latent class cluster analysis (LCCA) using individual characteristics, transportation and urban form features, and time poverty standards. Utilizing a data-driven approach, we propose thresholds to define when an individual is at risk of time poverty and when they can be considered time-poor. Similarly, we define these thresholds for transport-related time poverty based on existing literature. Our findings show that one in five Canadians over 24 years old can be classified as time poor, 23 % experience transport-related time poverty and 5 % experience both general and transport-related time poverty. We found ten profiles, which we analyzed into three subgroups: (i) high time poverty and medium rates of transport-related time poverty, (ii) low time poverty and medium to high incidence of transport-related time poverty, and (iii) very low time poverty and transport-related time poverty. From the first subgroup, four profiles display the highest proportions of time poverty (61 % and 70 %), as well as moderated levels of transport-related time poverty (22 % to 32 %). More than 450,000 socially disadvantaged Canadians, mainly characterized by women single parents with medium to low incomes, were categorized into two clusters, where 290,000 experience time poverty, 123,000 transport-related time poverty, and 70,000 both simultaneously. Building on these findings, we discussed the potential impact of different transport and land use policies to alleviate transport-related time poverty as well as avenues for future research.",2590-1982,Not found

Mixed method of research was undertaken together with questionnaire survey, nineteen semi-structured interviews and a validation case study in Australia. Fifteen out of the forty-two strategies showed a significant difference in ranking for economic infrastructure projects which were then categorized and discussed under three main issues in economic infrastructure projects. The identified strategies were further validated and refined through a case study in Australia together with the new strategies that can be related to the issues in economic infrastructure projects. A SM framework was then proposed that is centred around key SM-related issues in economic infrastructure projects i.e. effective management of community stakeholders, improved transparency around PPPs, and dealing with democratic politics around PPPs.

Enhancing transportation accessibility: evaluating the impact of route guidance systems and connected autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101172,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Enhancing accessibility in transportation systems is an escalating interest among researchers, fueled by the rising issues with traffic congestion and technological innovations. Accessibility significantly contributes to improving the quality of life, thereby necessitating an examination of how route guidance systems impact it. This study explores the influence of system optimum (SO) and user equilibrium (UE) route guidance systems on accessibility, particularly in the context of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) embedded in the network. We employ a hybrid assignment model that enables the concurrent allocation of SO and UE assignments, along with the Gravity model to compute accessibility. The Sioux Falls network, previously leveraged in prior research, was chosen for numerical simulations to permit insightful comparisons. Our study scrutinizes three scenarios: the first scenario examines the repercussions of route guidance systems on human-driven vehicles, while the second and third assess their effects on CAVs. The difference between the second and third scenario is in the way of increasing the capacity in the assignment. Our findings reveal that at lower penetration rates of route guidance systems, accessibility initially dips, and then ascends. When all human-driven users adopt route guidance systems, accessibility increases by 12.75% compared to the initial state (without any intervention). Remarkably, should all users employ autonomous vehicles, accessibility would surge by 220% compared to the initial state (without any intervention). These insights highlight the importance of integrating CAVs and route guidance systems into transportation planning to enhance accessibility and improve the quality of life.",2590-1982,Not found

Bridging allocative and productive efficiency in US transit policy research: A review,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101149,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"In this paper, I review literature that can build foundation for integrating allocative and productive efficiency research of transit provision in the United States. Both frameworks concern transit performance but use distinct methods and talk past each other. Productive efficiency research uses economic cost models to measure the economic structure of transit service — economies of scale, economies of scope, etc. — to inform aggregate system size and output. This research shows that bus transit reaches constant scale economies between 300 and 500 vehicles but says little about when and where to allot these resources. Allocative efficiency research uses cost allocation models that disaggregate transit systems into parts — generally spatial areas or times of service — to measure service output and pricing variability. This literature suggests that transit agencies underprice or over-allocate resources to suburban areas and peak travel times. Yet, allocative efficiency scholarship ignores aggregate economic factors. This isolation in research approach and scale of focus leaves unclear the union between how much transit to produce, and when and where to produce it. Both bodies of literature can benefit from representation of transit modes other than bus transit and methodological integration. Allocative efficiency research can benefit from the use of more granular data and spatiotemporally focused studies.",2590-1982,Not found
The potential in moving mobility planning towards a feminine mobility concept,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101168,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"For a century, transport systems have been governed by masculine norms, constraining both women and men within the conditions and mobility behaviour it has established. This article explores the potential implications of adopting feminine norms for mobility and transport systems. Current masculine mobility norms are contested by investigating what including a feminine mobility concept would entail and lead to. The feminine mobility concept is based on documented differences for men and women in mobility behaviour and attitudes towards transport sustainability issues. The potential effects of applying a feminine mobility concept are tested by a climate emission calculation using current travel behaviours in Sweden. Multiday travel behaviour data collected from 475 randomised participants adding up 13 160 days was used to compare present travel behaviour in situations where the transport system reflects women’s attitudes and preferences in planning and policy as well as travel behaviour. The test showed that including a feminine mobility concept would lead to a 33 % reduction of CO2-emissions from passenger land-based transport compared to the current transport system. In the calculation a sustainability potential is uncovered that simply cannot be ignored. We assert that the transport sector cannot truly claim to be gender equal until sustainability becomes a central focus and receive consideration in all aspects of the transport system planning and policy. This includes introducing policy measures that address sustainability issues in the transport sector not only from masculine but also feminine perspectives.",2590-1982,Not found
Addressing transport related social exclusion through transportation policy: A novel evaluation method applied to the Amsterdam Transport Region,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101177,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Recent literature has given increasing attention to the different ways in which people can be excluded from transportation systems, with a reduction in economic, social, and recreational opportunities as a result. These theoretical insights into how transport poverty and transport accessibility can be measured and understood do not always relate directly to actual planning processes. Different government agencies have authority over different policy and infrastructure elements and within a transportation authority, different departments have different actors, goals, and approaches. An important first step in making advances in social inclusion is for transportation authorities to be able to evaluate their current approach as a starting point for policy improvements. Presently, however, no systematic method exists for conducting that evaluation. This article refines an existing Transportation Related Social Exclusion (TRSE) framework and develops a method for comprehensively evaluating existing TRSE reduction efforts in transportation policy. It applies this method to the operating agreements for the three public transportation concession areas in the Amsterdam Transport Region, using textual analysis to develop a policy overview for ten dimensions of TRSE. The application of the method reveals that different forms of TRSE receive substantially different levels of attention within the Amsterdam Transport Region. The evaluation serves as a tool for systematically understanding how different dimensions of social exclusion are being addressed, allowing for a starting point for discussing whether or not existing policy is adequate and creating opportunities for incorporating new theoretical concepts into practice.",2590-1982,Not found

We explore the extent to which private automobility will be reconfigured into a private electric automated mobility regime or substituted by a shared electric automated mobility regime that could effectively address societal sustainability challenges. We draw from the multi-level perspective of technological transition, develop a conceptual model outlining possible transition advancements towards private and shared electric automated mobility and review pertinent literature supporting such developments. Our analysis reveals that shared, particularly pooled, mobility emerges slowly (niche level). Key actors resist a shift from private to shared electric automated mobility for economic (vehicle manufacturers), instrumental, affective, symbolic (users and societal groups), tax-revenue, governance and administrative (public authorities) reasons (regime level). The private automobility regime receives only moderate pressure from the socio-technical landscape pertaining to safety, congestion and environmental issues and effectively reacts by electrifying and automating vehicles (landscape level). We conclude that the most likely transition will primarily entail privately-owned electric AVs as opposed to shared (especially pooled) AVs, unless a landscape “shock” such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime. Hence, the socioeconomic benefits of the so-called “three revolutions of automobility” could be diminished.",2590-1982,Not found

The findings suggest that despite disruptive events, such as the pandemic and its management practice, aviation has improved its energy efficiency, with flights at some airports experiencing significant improvements due to effective management practices derived from changing previous conditions. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse concerning energy efficiency in aviation and supports the development of policies and measures to address energy and environmental-related challenges in the short and medium term.",2590-1982,Not found
Vehicle choice modeling for emerging zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicle markets in California,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101169,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) are major contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. California leads in transitioning towards zero-emission MHDVs through a comprehensive approach that includes financial incentive s for zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) purchases, improved infrastructure for battery charging and hydrogen refueling, and extensive public awareness campaigns. The state has enacted Advanced Clean Fleets (ACF) regulations, requiring all MHDVs—including box trucks, vans, work trucks, and tractors—to adopt ZEVs between 2035 and 2042. Consequently, thorough analysis and forecasting of market penetration for various MHDVs in the next decade are essential. This study introduces a purchase probability analysis-based dynamic discrete choice (PPADDC) model specifically designed for vehicle choice modeling in the MHDV sector. The model assesses the probabilities linked to sixteen decision factors that influence truck adoption from 2024 to 2040. Utilizing this model, we project market share and penetration under eight scenarios, reflecting our comprehensive understanding of the California market through observational, empirical, and mathematical perspectives. These scenarios differ in terms of vehicle cost, procurement incentives, and infrastructure development strategies. Our findings provide a strategic framework for achieving the ambitious ZEV targets set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), illustrating that a combination of technological advancements, policy initiatives, and market incentives can significantly enhance ZEV adoption in the MHDV sector. This study not only confirms the practicality of California ZEV goals but also offers valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers working towards a more sustainable transportation future.",2590-1982,Not found
Investigating the influence of spatial characteristics on cycling volume: A multi-scale geographic weighted regression approach,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101160,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Cycling has seen a remarkable rise, signifying a paradigmatic move towards sustainable, eco-friendly, and efficient commuting alternatives in the contemporary urban setting. Cities also encourage this trend by establishing cycle lanes, bike-sharing programs, and incentives for frequent riders. To enhance these motivations from an urbanistic perspective, it is essential to comprehend the influence of urban characteristics on cycling volume and to incorporate this understanding into data-driven decision-making processes. This research examines the Bicification project data from Istanbul with a spatial perspective. Utilising a comprehensive array of spatial big data, the study explores the impact of urban land use, transport services, land morphology, and sociodemographic factors on cycling volume through a Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR). With an Adj R2 value of 0.68, the model demonstrates a strong relation between cycling volume and several factors, including biking park stations, park and ride points, pier stops, rail stops, transfer points, main roads, elevation, population, industrial facilities, health facilities, sports areas, and residential areas. The findings will serve to develop a data-driven strategic approach to promote cycling in Istanbul.",2590-1982,Not found
Motor vehicle traffic fatalities by race and ethnicity (2010 – 2021),10.1016/j.trip.2024.101163,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Motor vehicle traffic fatalities (MVTFs) are a public health issue that substantially affects the growing Black or African American, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) population. To further understand the racial discrepancies that exist in MVTFs, data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and U.S. Census were utilized to explore factors such as rurality, urbanicity, restraint use, and alcohol-impairment. Calculations considered yearly driver and occupant fatality rates per 100,000 population for each race and ethnicity from 2010 through 2021. A Poisson regression model was used to quantify the relationship between the MVTF rates and the factors of interest. Results demonstrated that the American Indian or Alaska Native population was statistically the most overrepresented group in fatality rates across all factors explored. Additionally, the American Indian or Alaska Native population and Black or African American populations were the only groups to have statistically significant increases in fatality rates in recent years when accounting for factors such as unrestrained vehicle driver/occupants and alcohol-impaired fatality rate. In contrast, the Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander population has consistently experienced one of the largest statistically significant reductions in driver and occupant fatality rates over time. Further analysis is necessary to develop and implement countermeasures that may reduce the increasing fatality rates of the most vulnerable populations while continuing to decrease rates for others as well. Despite limitations of FARS and population data, these results provide a pathway to reducing MVTFs and associated racial inequities that exist in the nation, particularly as the BIPOC population continues to grow.",2590-1982,Not found
Vehicle safety standards as mechanisms for preventing deaths and injuries caused by traffic in Colombia,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101156,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Introduction In Colombia, 6,690 people died from road crashes in 2019; for this and the following two years, deaths from traffic crashes were the second cause of death due to external causes. Many of these deaths can be prevented by implementing cost-effective population-level measures such as the WHO 1 1 WHO: World Health Organization. -established Vehicle Safety Standards 2 2 VSS: Vehicle Safety Standards. (VSS). Our objective was to identify the perceptions of key stakeholders about the adoption and implementation of VSSs in the Colombian context. Methodology Exploratory, descriptive and multimethod study, using analysis and information collection techniques, such as the design and application of semi-structured interviews to recognize the different perspectives, power resources, and characteristics of certain consumers regarding VSS in the Colombian context. The advertising offered in various media about VSS was described and analyzed; sources of information on the rights of consumers and stakeholders regarding this issue were analyzed. Results Relevant and expectant critical actors regarding the implementation of VSS were identified. VSS advertising adapts to different media, sometimes making it difficult to display. We identified that the Colombian market prioritizes the price of vehicles over safety and luxury as the category most valued by consumers in vehicles purchased in Colombia. Some entities were found to have been sanctioned for misleading advertising and technical failures of the VSS. Conclusions To reduce the road crash rate, Colombia must adopt international measures such as the standards of the United Nations World Forum for the Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations known as WP.29, which obliges States to improve the design, production, marketing, and distribution of safe vehicles. Some key players in the automotive industry are favorably disposed to adopting WP.29 due to the reduction in injuries and damage to the health of road users, even more so in the post-pandemic period that shows an increase in these events that impact public health.",2590-1982,Not found
Heterogeneity in activity and travel mode patterns of older Indonesians,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101159,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Older adults aged 50 years and over may experience varied participation levels in out-of-home activities and travel modes, with their ability to walk being a significant factor. However, the heterogeneity of the activity–travel patterns of people at this age, especially in the Indonesian context, is not well understood. Using Yogyakarta as a case study and applying a latent class cluster analysis, this study is the first to categorize older adults’ participation in activities and use of travel modes and to understand the distinct characteristics of older adults. The model results revealed four discrete groups based on older adults’ activity participation and another four discrete groups based on their travel mode use. In the activity participation group, active older adults are the largest group, followed by inactive, working, and very active older adults. Meanwhile, those reliant on their motorized vehicles make up the largest travel mode group, followed by low-cost-vehicle users, captive riders of personal motorcycles, and car users. The model results also reveal that captive riders of personal motorcycles tend to be male and the youngest-old, while smartphone users are more likely to belong to the car users group. Walking ability constraints also significantly affect heterogeneity in older adults’ activity and travel mode, where those with no constraints on their ability to walk tend to be categorized as active older adult car users. The findings of this study may help policymakers identify older people with particular activity patterns and travel modes and develop policies to accommodate their mobility needs.",2590-1982,Not found
The dilemmas of transport equity research in non-Western contexts,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101157,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"This paper critically evaluates the prevailing conceptualisations in transport equity research, emphasising the inadvertent Eurocentrism inherent in many contemporary frameworks. By distinguishing between social equality and social equity, the paper underscores the need for differentiated treatments in varied contexts to truly achieve fairness. Central to this discourse is the assertion that the prevailing Eurocentric models may misrepresent or oversimplify non-Western contexts, particularly in regions with complex societal structures and cultural nuances, such as China. Drawing from China’s experiences, the paper illustrates the potential pitfalls of uncritically adopting Western transport equity theories, revealing how they can lead to significant misunderstandings. These inaccuracies are often perpetuated by a reliance on reductionist methodologies that do not account for the serpentine regional challenges and cultural dynamics unique to non-Western nations. Therefore, I advocate for an evolved, contextually apt approach to transport equity research that is sensitive to cultural and regional intricacies, ensuring a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of transport equity dynamics in global contexts.",2590-1982,Not found
Going to the Zoo: A comparison of travel time ratios in 21 European cities,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101161,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Efficient public transport is an essential component of a sustainable transport system. The travel time ratio, i.e. the public transport journey duration divided by the car journey duration of the same trip, can be used to compare the public transport system with the road transport system within and across cities. However, few studies have used the travel time ratio to analyse the efficiency of the public transport system across European cities. The aim of this study was to compare travel time ratios of a typical leisure trip across 21 European capital cities and to examine the association of journey time and travel time ratio with socio-demographic characteristics of cities. For the purpose of this study trips to the local zoo were selected as a leisure time activity that is comparable across cities in Europe. Within 21 European capital cities random start points were selected based on an 8 km service facilities analysis from the zoo. For each start point to zoo trip the duration and distance of the public transport and car journeys was calculated using the Google Maps Directions API. Our analysis showed that in all cities public transport journeys take longer than car journeys, with a mean travel time ratio of 2.61 (range 0.98–5.82). No correlation was found between public transport and car journey duration, suggesting that they are influenced by different factors. However, mixed model analyses found no association between socio-demographic characteristics of the cities and public transport journey times. In contrast, mixed models showed that a decrease in the travel time ratio was associated with a larger population size, higher population density, higher percentage of working population, more urbanized land area and more registered cars. To encourage a modal shift towards sustainable urban transport, we recommend that travel time ratio should be considered in the design of public transport and car infrastructure in cities.",2590-1982,Not found
Two qualitative case studies on network governance in Swiss transit station district development,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101155,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Designing station districts to support transit-oriented development (TOD) requires multi-actor collaborations across sectors, planning scales, and administration levels. Dedicated planning processes are rare and perceived differently by the relevant actors. Previous TOD studies have shown that actors respond to this challenge with network governance, forming networks through a bottom-up approach to integrating development policies and processes. This article examines whether and how network governance occurs for transit station districts in two Swiss case studies. Through a qualitative analysis of the role of network formations in actors’ handling of governance challenges, the findings demonstrate that actors learn about plurality and structure collaborative operations management through network governance. The article suggests that statutory planning authorities and public transport operating agencies promote the profile of station districts’ spatial imaginaries so local practitioners acknowledge the benefits of dedicating resources to networked development orchestration.",2590-1982,Not found
Disadvantaged workers are not all alike in attitudes towards automation,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101164,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Automated vehicle (AV) adoption is anticipated to affect millions of motor vehicle operators, including gig drivers (platform-based ride-hailing and/or delivery drivers). The multidisciplinary body of research investigating worker attitudes towards automation suggests disadvantaged workers are more likely to fear automation status. Gig drivers may have different views about automation because of the unique aspects of their work context. To contribute to multidisciplinary research about worker acceptance of automation, we analyze focus group and online survey data from a career perspective to understand gig drivers’ attitudes about job longevity with AV adoption. Study findings indicate drivers are not threatened by AV adoption because of the transitory nature of their jobs. Drivers also highlighted unique aspects of their work that cannot be replaced by AVs. This viewpoint means workers are not preparing for potential work displacement, which places them at risk for unemployment.",2590-1982,Not found
Collective or Individual?

While there are numerous studies on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel mode choice in everyday mobility, there are a lack of studies on tourists’ choice of travel mode, even though tourism transport in Switzerland makes up 24% of all distance travelled. Based on an extended conceptual framework of the Health Belief Model (HBM), this study investigates the effect of COVID-19 on tourists’ intentions to choose a particular travel mode during the pandemic. Our findings show that the higher the perceived susceptibility of getting COVID-19 associated with the holiday journey, the lower the choices for collective travel modes. Furthermore, for those tourists who are more likely to take risks, their choices for collective travel modes are increased. The study recommends that public transport operators choose measures that increase the application of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against pandemics while travelling; this may encourage the safe use of collective transport modes during a pandemic.",2590-1982,Not found
Impact of 4-to-3 lane conversions on emergency response,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101158,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"4-to-3 lane conversions, often called road diets, have been implemented throughout the U.S. as a means to reduce crashes. However, the reduction in lanes has led to community wide concerns across the country regarding the possible negative effect on emergency responses. This study investigates the impact of 4-to-3-lane roadway conversions on emergency response in Iowa through surveys and a retrospective analysis of EMS data. The 170 survey responses were analyzed descriptively, and a text analysis was done on two open text survey questions. Generalized linear models were constructed to examine the impact of lane conversions on emergency response times. Over half of EMS respondents believed there was no effect or a positive effect on responses, while 40% believed there was a negative effect. The negative effect was often attributed to driver confusion on how to properly yield to EMS vehicles. Despite the differing perceptions, EMS response rates from before to after the implementation of 4-to-3 lane conversions did not meaningfully differ. Overall, there was a lack of evidence of an effect of 4-to-3 lane conversions on EMS response rates in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. However, survey results showed that public guidance on how to properly respond to the presence of EMS vehicles on these roadways may be needed. This study provides evidence for addressing local concerns about road diets and emergency response to add to other known safety benefits. Results of this analysis may be applicable to other lane conversion sites when appropriately combined with local context relevant to the target area.",2590-1982,Not found
A systemic archetype for enhancing occupational safety in road construction projects through worker behavior,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101154,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Occupational health and safety (OHS) challenges persistently plague road construction endeavours. The pivotal role of worker behaviour in influencing these challenges is widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, a comprehensive exploration of how OHS issues manifest in road construction due to worker behaviour has been conspicuously absent. Within the context of India’s National Highway expansion project, this study investigates the key factors associated with worker behaviour that contribute to accidents and presents a systemic archetype for ameliorating worker behaviour and, consequently, OHS. Data sourced from surveys and robust statistical analyses form the foundation of this research, with the System Dynamics modelling (SD) framework employed to construct the archetype. Furthermore, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) serves as the theoretical underpinning for this study. The findings underscore that accidents are often precipitated by a dearth of knowledge and inadequate training regarding safety codes and practices, which consequently leads to their violation. However, an investment in knowledge dissemination and comprehensive training to heighten awareness, encourage adherence, and facilitate implementation of safety standards and practices could markedly enhance OHS within road construction projects. This study posits that fostering appropriate worker behaviour rooted in knowledge and training, along with promoting the rigorous enforcement of safety codes and practices, stands as a crucial strategy for preventing accidents in road construction. Consequently, it is argued that knowledge acquisition and training should be recognized as pivotal leverage points for enhancing OHS through the prism of worker behaviour in road construction projects.",2590-1982,Not found
Factors affecting the future utilisation of high-speed train services in Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC),10.1016/j.trip.2024.101162,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The high-speed rail project connecting three airports stands as a pivotal public transportation initiative, strategically designed to enhance economic growth within the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), Thailand. This study focuses on examining the factors influencing the future utilisation of this project. Mueang Chon Buri district, positioned at the heart of the EEC, is chosen as a case study. Data is then collected through a stated preference survey involving 400 randomly individuals, and a binary logistic regression model is constructed for the analysis. The results reveal that individuals with larger households and personal vehicles are less inclined to choose high-speed train services in the future, with probabilities of usage being 48.5% and 55.5% lower, respectively, compared to those with smaller households or without personal cars. To address this trend, service providers should undertake comprehensive public relations efforts and consider different pricing strategies. These measures have been found to enhance the likelihood of high-speed train usage by 3.097 and 1.411 times. In addition, the study also found crucial factors for successful high-speed train services, including station facilities, system reliability, efficient train schedules, and reduced travel time throughout the trip (emphasising seamless connections with other modes of transportation).

Furthermore, the effects of two different levels of light intensity capable of revealing or masking the presence of jet fans, thus manipulating the vision of participants, were also evaluated. Forty drivers were involved in this multi–level mixed-factorial experiment, in which twenty car and twenty truck drivers drove on three different layouts of a two–way two-lane long tunnel. Two different pairwise analyses were carried out to assess the effects of these two within-subject factors. The presence of oncoming traffic was also considered as a factor in the study. The presence of jet fans led to lower speeds and affected the transversal behaviour of car and truck drivers in different ways. In the presence of the jet fans trucks reduced the lateral distance to the tunnel wall, while car trajectories were always closer to it. All drivers showed better lateral control when facing the jet fans and when meeting oncoming vehicles. When the light intensity was reduced, truck drivers adopted lower speeds, while with higher light intensity they drove closer to the tunnel wall, thus reducing the risk of collision with any oncoming traffic.",2590-1982,Not found

The aim was to increase traffic safety and accessibility, especially for bicyclists and pedestrians Method The design used was a before- an after-study including both subjective and objective measures. To collect subjective data a survey measuring quality of life was used by asking residents and travellers how they experienced the road and their neighbourhood. The collection of objective data was done with the help of video cameras recording traffic conflicts, vehicle speed and position on the road Results The reconstruction of the road had positive effects on quality of life in general, specifically safety, security, and accessibility for bicyclists and pedestrians. Something which was achieved without reducing car drivers’ experience of accessibility. Subsequent analyses were conducted to increase the understanding of different ‘sub-groups’. Specifically, analyses assessed: if responses could be linked to modal choice; whether the reconstruction of the road resulted in a modal shift; and whether it was any differences between respondents who had or had not a child attending any of the local schools. Overall, the responses from the ‘sub-groups’ were not significantly different from each other (except for respondents with children). The video analyses on traffic safety showed no differences in conflicts before and after the reconstruction. The only negative result was that car drivers’ speed increased by 3 km/h Conclusion The reconstruction of roads with a traffic intensity, equivalent to the selected road is suitable for a two minus one road.

The way this ability is experienced, and its impact on socio-spatial ordering, is shaped by context. In this piece, we use parenting as one particular context to explore the impact of working from home on day-to-day travel in a car-dependent setting. We intentionally seek out the complexity of mundane family life to ground Bauman’s concept of liquidity by demonstrating its embodiment through families working from home. We use in-depth interviews with 30 parents in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, to examine the way the experience of working from home are filtered through the lens of caring for children and onto ways of being mobile day-to-day. We propose that working from home intensifies the complexity of the spatialities, temporalities and emotional landscapes of the parenting task. This intensification is absorbed by families as flexibility, which appeals to parents. This is likely to perpetuate reliance on autonomous modes of mobility for families, namely, the private car, who use cars to order complexity and enact flexibility. We conclude that working from home sustains and augments liquid lives in myriad ways, including the mundane organisation of family life and ways of travelling in cities.",2590-1982,Not found

This scoping review aims to synthesise the available evidence and highlight research gaps on unequal access to public transportation and how these inequalities lead to the social exclusion of older adults and people with disabilities in Bangladesh. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses, Scoping Review Extension (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines and employed thematic analysis to interpret the findings. Four databases Scopus, Embase, PubMed and Web of Science, and online sources such as Google Scholar and TRID were searched from January 2002 to July 2022. The findings show that the existing modes of transportation are inadequate and non-inclusive and pose both physical (including built environments such as roads, ramps, and footpaths) and social barriers (such as low income, low employment opportunities, and negative social attitude) which reduced the accessibility to workplaces, healthcare, and social networks for these two vulnerable groups. An inclusive and sustainable urban transport infrastructure, older adult-specific and disabled-friendly transportation policies, and behaviour changes are significant steps to improve safety and social inclusion.

The value of waiting spaces: Tourists’ willingness to pay for high-quality bus terminals,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101129,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Transport quality has long been recognized as an important factor in influencing travelers’ behavior, and transport terminal quality undoubtedly plays no small part. Indeed, transit promotion policies explicitly based on qualitative factors and high-standard architecture are increasingly being adopted in designing new bus terminals and stops. High architectural standards can be found in several bus terminals worldwide. Nevertheless, the literature in transport sector has yet to explore the impact of bus terminal “hedonic quality” on users’ behavior or use their willingness to pay (WTP) in cost–benefit analyses or other transport policy applications. Hedonic value is here intended as the aggregate of all elements related to travelers’ pleasure in spending time in a terminal where architectural beauty and the passenger services offered are arguably the most visible and representative attributes. Within this context, we propose a quantitative analysis of the perceived hedonic value of bus nodes in terms of users’ WTP (pure preference) for a high-quality bus terminal. To this end a discrete choice experiment based on a visual immersive experience was performed, and data were collected from 324 residents of Milan (Italy) traveling for tourism. Different binomial Mixed Logit models with panel data and random coefficients were estimated for the purpose. Monetary valuation of pure preference for using a high-quality bus terminal was estimated with a mean of about 25 % of the average trip cost observed for the case study considered. This pure preference means that the Italian tourist is willing to spend up to €4.35/trip more for a high-quality bus waiting space or travel up to 28.2 min/trip more, instead of using a traditional bus terminal for the same trip. Category-specific analyses show that females > 30 years old have a greater pure preference for a high-quality bus terminal (up to + 220 %) against males and young users. The employed also have a higher (+42 %) pure preference for the beauty of a bus terminal against others. The results of this paper should be compared with those from other case studies as they have a potential impact for transportation planning applications, underling the importance of also incorporating “hedonic quality” as explicit design variables for new/revamped transportation hub. At the same time, new challenges are posed for modeling user behavior and determining quality-related indicators and measures.",2590-1982,Not found
"The effect of latency, speed and task on remote operation of vehicles",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101152,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Introduction Although self-driving vehicle technology has been developing rapidly in recent years, there are still many challenges left before full autonomy can possibly be achieved. Remote operation could facilitate the development of autonomous vehicles in a safe and efficient manner by putting a human in the loop without the need for the human to be physically present in the vehicle. In the current experiment, three aspects of remote driving have been investigated in a driving simulator to evaluate the effect of i) latency, ii) type of task to perform, and iii) speed on a number of performance measures. Method Thirty-one participants drove in simulated rural (high-speed) and urban (low-speed) scenarios. Five hazards were created for each scenario and the participants drove each scenario three times with different latencies (baseline, +100 ms, and +200 ms). The latency condition was masked for the participants. The hazards were designed with the intention of creating challenging traffic situations. For example, in hazard one (H1) a car parked next to the road activates their turn indicators and then cuts into the participant’s lane close in front of the ego vehicle, forcing the participant to either brake or veer. Latency, type of hazard, and scenarios (high- and low-speed) were all within participants’ variables. Objective simulator data collected included variables such as reaction time, post-encroachment time, speed variation, distance to hazard, collisions, etc. Subjective data was gathered through questionnaires between each of the balanced latency conditions to assess trust, perceived control, realism of scenarios, and workload etc. After the completed drive, participants were asked to rate in which order they believed they had been subjected to the different latencies. The participants were divided into two groups, experienced drivers and experienced gamers. Result The results of the simulator study show that for some of the hazards, but not all, there were significant differences in the latency conditions and there were interaction effects between participant groups and environment/speed. For example, in H1 the effect on the reaction time was significantly larger than the added latency. Overall, the experienced gamers drove with larger safety margins although they had not been told that the latency was varied. Speed, latency, and group characteristics were interacting in significant ways and affected performance measures. The subjective ratings show that participants experienced less control of the vehicle during higher latency conditions, even though they were not told in which order they had been subjected to the latency conditions. The separate tasks to perform were affected differently by the independent measures. The number of collisions was not affected by latency. Conclusion There seems to be a certain level of adaptivity among the participants, although they were not told that the latency varied between scenarios, and they could also not guess in which order they drove with the different conditions. In some situations, they drove with larger safety margins, especially experienced gamers in the high-speed scenario. Moreover, the subjective ratings show that participants felt less in control of the vehicle at higher latencies without being able to pinpoint what it was that affected their driving.",2590-1982,Not found

The results of the data analysis showed that the customers’ perceived quality of information, service, system, and value of the Gojek app significantly affected their level of satisfaction in using the GoClub loyalty program. This study also found that customers’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control also influenced their loyalty to Gojek app. Furthermore, no relation was found between customers’ satisfaction in using the GoClub loyalty program and their loyalty to the Gojek application where millennial loyalty on certain app in Indonesia is very low. The findings of this study can help ride-hailing companies understand the factors that increase customers’ loyalty to such companies.",2590-1982,Not found
A topological analysis of Milan historical surface transport networks from 1856 to the present,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101145,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"This research examines the transport networks operating in Milan, Italy, in seven years, from 1856 to 2016. The networks are transformed into graphs and analysed with several techniques from graph theory, including a new centrality index called Icentr. With the help of this index, we identify the nodes, to be considered primary in the transportation network, that are better related both in terms of topology and more interconnected in terms of distance. The findings provide a detailed picture of how the primary nodes have shifted from the city’s inner core to outer areas over the course of the investigated decades, both for the topological case and when the graphs are weighted based on the distance between nodes. Particularly, the effect of distance is more evident in those historical phases when the city expands, creating longer connections between nodes, in contrast to phases when the city becomes denser. The proposed method of analysis appears suitable to be applied to other cities, both for simplicity and effectiveness.",2590-1982,Not found
Influence of public transport training for people with disabilities: Protocol for a systematic review,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101143,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Travel training programs that include components of the real environment, simulation, application, and virtual reality may facilitate increased use of fixed-route public transport among people with disabilities (PWD). Existing evidence on travel training programs focused on outcomes in youth with disabilities. However, little is known about how such programs may influence knowledge and psychosocial skills for public transport use among adult with disabilities and older adults. This systematic review aims to examine the influence of travel training on knowledge, psychosocial skills (e.g., transportation-related self-efficacy and self-determination), and public transport use among adult with disabilities and older adults. This protocol of systematic review will be guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015. The literature search will include empirical studies published in French and English from 1990 to 2023 in the following database: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Transport Database via Ovid platform, and Embase and the Web of science. An update will be made to ensure that all relevant material is retrieved. All literature search results will be imported in Covidence software for screening and data extraction. Given that we expect to have studies with a variety of data collection methods and tools, the meta-analysis will not be used. The results of this review will be reported according to PRISMA 2020. A review of the influence of travel training on various outcomes will facilitate transport operators to develop and implement the best travel training interventions to better meet public transit needs of PWD.",2590-1982,Not found
Classification of driver fatigue in conditionally automated driving using physiological signals and machine learning,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101148,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Conditionally automated vehicles (Level 3 SAE) are emerging on the roads, but long periods without engaging in a non-driving-related task can reduce drivers’ vigilance. This study aims to determine whether driver fatigue can be accurately predicted using physiological signals and machine learning (ML) techniques in such a context. 63 young drivers completed two separate conditional automated drives of 30 min each, in either a rural or a urban area. Half of them had been mildly sleep-deprived the previous night (slept less than six hours). Electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration were collected, along with subjective measures of sleepiness and affective state. Using ML, sleep deprivation, driving environment, and sleepiness could be predicted from physiological features with an accuracy of 99%, 85%, and 73% respectively. Signal segmentation increased model accuracy, and EDA features were the most predictive. The differences between the results obtained from statistical analyses of sleepiness measures and the accuracy achieved by ML models are discussed. The results of this empirical study indicate that even mild sleep deprivation affects the physiological state of drivers, which can have serious consequences when combined with long periods of inactivity. Car manufacturers and researchers should take this into account when designing intelligent systems capable of providing drivers with appropriate warnings before a critical situation arises.",2590-1982,Not found
Latent class models for capturing unobserved heterogeneity in major global causes of mortality: The cases of traffic crashes and COVID-19,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101147,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Existing models for correlating global mortality rates with underlying country-specific factors overlook the variations in the effects of these factors on mortality across different countries. These may arise from social, cultural, and political complexities which are usually not measurable and are therefore referred to as unobserved heterogeneity in the statistical literature. Unobserved heterogeneity leads to biased parameter estimates in the models, erroneous inferences about the effects of factors contributing to mortalities, and ultimately inefficient policies. In this paper, latent class modelling is proposed for capturing such unobserved heterogeneity on the cases of traffic mortality and COVID-19 mortality. The ‘pyramid’ model of safety management is used as a common framework for model formulation. The proposed latent class model is an extension of the Negative Binomial (NB) model used in risk epidemiology. The model is tested with data from 105 countries, retrieved from international databases, including socioeconomic, infrastructure, exposure, transport, and COVID-19 variables. The results suggest that there exist two (different) latent country classes in both causes of mortality. The probability of a country belonging to a certain latent class is a much more efficient metric of country membership than previous deterministic groupings (e.g. income or geographic). Variables such as the elderly population, the GDP per capita or the level of motorization, have different effects in different country classes; these effects are not identifiable by conventional statistical modelling. The impact of ignoring unobserved heterogeneity in country mortality modelling is shown by comparing the results with those of conventional NB models.",2590-1982,Not found
Exploring the future: A meta-analysis of autonomous vehicle adoption and its impact on urban life and the healthcare sector,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101110,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a paradigm-shifting advancement with the potential to transform urban life, transportation, and safety standards. Their impact transcends conventional mobility, permeating industries like healthcare and shipping services. AVs operate autonomously, devoid of direct human intervention, and mark a pivotal juncture in transportation evolution. Our comprehensive meta-analysis employed the PSS (Product Related, Social Related, and Security Related) framework to discern the converging and diverging factors influencing individuals’ proclivity towards adopting AV technology. Scrutinizing 72 studies from 54 articles, with a cumulative sample size of 32,540, our research identified critical determinants of AV adoption: perceived usefulness, attitude, trust, safety, hedonic motivation, and social influence. Noteworthy, our study unveiled that these relationships were subject to modulation by factors like automation levels, vehicle ownership, and cultural nuances. Significantly, our findings shed light on a relative scarcity of incentives for widespread public acceptance of AVs. Our study provides empirical insights and theoretical contributions that offer valuable guidance for practitioners and policymakers navigating this transformative technological landscape. These recommendations are poised to steer the evolution of AV technology towards a more widely accepted and integrated future. In healthcare, integrating autonomous vehicles is a groundbreaking opportunity to elevate patient care and medical services. AVs can facilitate swift, precise transportation of critical medical supplies, enabling timely responses to emergencies and ensuring the availability of vital resources in remote or underserved areas. This advancement holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, ultimately saving lives and enhancing the overall well-being of communities.",2590-1982,Not found
Bringing home the bacon: Estimating willingness to pay for autonomous grocery delivery across U.S. households,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101118,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"We conduct a discrete choice experiment across 771 U.S. households to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) values for autonomous and human grocery delivery. We estimate that urban households, on average, are willing to pay about $6.70 for same-day human delivery to the household’s doorstep. This value drops by about $1.90 for autonomous delivery, by $2.30 per day of delivery delay, and by $3.10 or $7.90 for delivery to curbside or neighborhood locker locations, respectively. Households located 20 min or more from the nearest major grocery store are willing to pay $3 more for delivery than other households and are more willing to accept delivery delay and curbside or locker delivery locations, while households below the poverty line are less sensitive to delivery delay. Using a latent class logit model, we identify three distinct types of consumers: (1) Delivery Compromisers, representing 45% of weighted respondents, prefer delivery but are sensitive to timing, location, and automation; (2) Delivery Indifferent consumers (39%) have no statistically significant WTP for delivery over in-person shopping; and (3) Delivery Enthusiasts (16%) have high WTP for delivery. Simulation results suggest that if autonomous delivery were able to provide rapid delivery at low cost, it could potentially capture a majority of shopping choices for the Enthusiast groups and a substantial share of choices for Compromisers.",2590-1982,Not found
Developing a digital transformation maturity model for port assessment in archipelago countries: The Indonesian case,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101146,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Digital transformation (DT) has become a crucial driver of efficiency and competitiveness in the maritime industry. To effectively guide further digital transformation in ports, evaluating maturity is crucial as an initial assessment step. This research aims to achieve two main objectives: firstly, to develop a comprehensive model for evaluating the digital transformation maturity of ports in archipelago countries, using Indonesia as a case study; secondly, to gain a deeper understanding of Indonesia’s current maturity level and provide tailored suggestions for improvement. The choice to study archipelago countries comes from the absence of a maturity model that considers their unique geographical challenges and specifically the presence of a wide range of ports with varying sizes in hub-spoke networks. The research utilized mixed methodologies, including a multidisciplinary literature review, an empirical test on 45 Indonesian ports, and interviews to gather further insights. As a result, this research proposes the Digital Transformation Maturity model for Ports in Archipelago countries (DTMPA) which comprises five maturity levels based on the measurement of five dimensions. Additionally, the study reveals that Indonesian ports face challenges in their digital transformation, including the adoption and integration of technologies across their vast network of ports. Nevertheless, this model serves as a valuable tool for practitioners to assess their port’s digital maturity independently, facilitating informed decision-making, strategic actions, and improved competitiveness. Additionally, it contributes essential insights into the digital transformation landscape, guiding archipelago countries to navigate the complexities of digitalization within their maritime sector.",2590-1982,Not found
Advancing safety in short-term utility work zones: Assessing the role of work zone intrusion alert technologies (WZIATs),10.1016/j.trip.2024.101133,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Work zone safety is significantly impacted by vehicle intrusions, which are challenging incidents to control. Although the Federal Highway Administration and US state transportation agencies have implemented safety procedures to enhance worker and motorist safety, the rate of intrusions in work zones remains high, necessitating the development of additional solutions. Work zone intrusion alert technologies (WZIATs) have shown promise in highway work zones; however, their application in short-term utility settings remains insufficiently studied. This research aims to characterize the features of intrusion alert systems that can enhance the safety of workers in utility work zones. To achieve this aim, the study adopted a mixed-method design approach, relying on literature review, archival data analysis, experimental assessments, and a case study. The study reveals that motorist/driver behavior is a primary safety risk factor in utility work zone intrusions. Insights from deploying two technologies, AWARE and Alpha SafeNet, in experimental and live utility work zones indicate that an effective WZIAT must be able to alert both drivers and workers, be deployable in less than three minutes, integrate audio, visual, and haptic alarms, have an adjustable warning light, incorporate a pneumatic tube triggering mechanism, and be waterproof. This study contributes to both knowledge and practice by characterizing the safety risks associated with utility work zones and identifying key performance and operational features for deploying WZIATs in short-term work zones.",2590-1982,Not found

"The impact of non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 interventions on collisions, traffic injuries and fatalities across Québec",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101136,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The association between non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 (NP-COVID-19) interventions, which aimed to regulate public behaviour to curb the spread of COVID-19, and road safety has become an important area of research to explore the unintended consequences of this pandemic. This study focuses on the 17 regions of the province of Quebec in Canada to assess the relation of NP-COVID-19 interventions on collisions, light and severe injuries, and traffic fatalities. Interrupted time-series analyses were conducted from 2015 to 2022, using daily traffic fatality and injury data per 100 000 population. A COVID-19 NP interventions index for Québec (QCnPI-Index) was created based on 58 interventions implemented from March 2020 to June 2022 in each region. Multiple controls commonly used in the road safety literature, such as weather conditions and seasonal patterns, were applied. The association between the QCnPI-Index and the four outcomes was mixed. First, the QCnPI-Index was associated with considerable reductions for collisions and light injuries in all regions. Significant reductions in severe injuries were linked to the index across six regions: Montérégie, Laurentides, Lanaudière, Laval, Outaouais and Montréal. No concomitant changes were observed in traffic fatalities across any region. Findings underscore the complex relationship between NP-COVID-19 interventions and road safety, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive efforts to understand their diverse effects. Further investigation is warranted to comprehend the discrepancy in the reduction of injuries and collisions compared to fatalities. This study ultimately highlights the importance of continuing exploring in future research additional factors, such as road safety interventions during COVID-19 periods, and concentrating on pedestrians and cyclists, to better understand the impact of NP-COVID-19 interventions on other road safety dimensions.",2590-1982,Not found
Resistance towards autonomous vehicles (AVs),10.1016/j.trip.2024.101117,26,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The resistance towards automated vehicles (AVs) is little understood. The main objective of this study is to examine the resistance towards AVs, identifying the factors explaining resistance. Comments submitted by residents of California to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on the fared deployment of AVs were analyzed. In total, we identified four main themes, and twenty-nine sub-themes. We developed a conceptual framework for resistance that explains resistance by individual and vehicle characteristics, the direct and indirect consequences of use, reactions of others, and external events. AVs were considered incompetent, and unpredictable, violating traffic rules, blocking traffic, not explicitly engaging in communicating with other road users, and causing conflict situations. Respondents questioned the effectiveness of AVs in meeting today’s transportation-related challenges, and feared the indirect negative consequences of the deployment of AVs for traffic safety, flow efficiency, transition towards sustainable mobility, environmental efficiency, privacy, economy, social equity, livability of cities, and humanity. Respondents perceived a low responsibility of stakeholders involved in the manufacture, deployment, and regulation of AVs given a lack of accountability, and legal liability. Moreover, they reported a limited involvement of local residents and community in the decision-making processes behind AV deployment and an unjust distribution of costs and benefits. The scientific dialogue on acceptance of AVs needs to shift towards resistance as the ‘other’ essential element of acceptance to ensure that we live up to our promise of transitioning towards more sustainable mobility that is inclusive, equitable, fair, just, affordable, and available to all.",2590-1982,Not found
Views from the statehouse: Survey results from state legislative committee members,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101245,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"We ask how statehouse lawmakers in the U.S. understand the connection between the energy transition in transportation and state resources for transport infrastructure and services. We administered a national-level survey of state legislators serving on state transportation committees to gauge perceptions of these key policy gatekeepers about the pressing transportation issues in their state, the policies likely to be legislated, and the extent to which likely policies address important issues. The delegation of investment and funding decisions to state governments make state legislatures a critical conduit for U.S. transportation policy, and committee actors can crucially shape early stages of the agenda setting process. As the transportation sector moves increasingly toward low carbon energy sources, transportation revenues—traditionally derived from taxes on gasoline—are eroded. We explore what policies state legislators could or would adopt to ensure that states, cities, and metro regions have the resources for maintaining and renewing aging transportation infrastructure and to connect transportation funding policy with energy and climate concerns. What level of interest do committee members have in pursuing such policies, and how do they weigh transportation decarbonization alongside competing objectives including environmental protection, economic development, and social equity, and against the perceived priorities of other actors in their orbit, including the committee on which they serve, the legislature as a whole, and constituents in their own district? Our survey results document the relative deprioritization of climate change and decarbonization as policy priorities, which stands in contrast to the relative urgency of these issues for federal and local transportation policymakers. Instead, we find legislators prioritize more short-term, practical issues, like needs to maintain infrastructure, tend to safety, and promote economic growth, as well to provide stable funding for these needs. Lawmakers see policy solutions centered on raising revenue, e.g. electric vehicle registration fees, as most viable. Legislators also believe, we find, that more abstract issues like climate change and decarbonization are of greater importance to themselves than to their constituents. This work informs public policy by collecting new and original data about lawmakers’ knowledge of and opinions about available legislative opportunities to facilitate the energy transition in transportation.",2590-1982,Not found

Ride-Hailing vs. Fixed-Route: Preferences of the Transit-Dependent Populations in U.S. Urbanized Areas,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101237,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Transportation inequality poses significant challenges in car-dependent cities in the US, especially for Transit-Dependent Populations (TDPs) who rely on public transportation to meet their travel requirements. Research indicates that despite the rapid growth of ride-hailing services like Uber, TDPs primarily depend on conventional transit options such as buses and metros. This study differentiates between two classifications of ride-hailing services: Private Ride-hailing (PRH), represented by platforms like Uber and Lyft, where individuals hire and pay for their rides, occasionally sharing the journey with guests; and ride-sharing (RS), like UberPool, which allows users to divide travel expenses. However, a more profound comprehension is necessary to clarify why TDPs show a preference for one mode of transportation over another and the factors that influence their decision-making. This study utilises Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to examine the direct and indirect relationships between explanatory and outcome variables, while investigating modal preferences and usage frequency in 48 densely populated urban areas in the US (N = 384). TDPs choose to use transportation services like Uber because of their effectiveness in reducing both travel and waiting time, in contrast to traditional Fixed-Route Transit Services (FRTS), which are relatively less efficient. TDPs’ inclination towards PRH leads to a greater dependence on ride-hailing services, whereas a preference for FRTS reduces this dependence. Significantly, the study demonstrates that TDPs’ modal preferences are not only influenced by their socioeconomic status or rational decision-making, but also by the complex interaction between these factors. These findings provide valuable information for policymakers who want to evaluate the sustainability of ride-hailing services for TDPs and effectively tackle transportation inequalities.",2590-1982,Not found
Toward real-time deterrence against fare evasion risk in public transport,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101238,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Fare evasion is a critical threat for Transit Agencies (TAs) and/or Public Transport Companies (PTCs) everywhere, especially in Proof-of-Payment Transit Systems (POP-TSs). The research on fare evasion risk is limited and based on econometric models restricting time characterization to a single period. This paper aims to enhance the use of fare evasion risk over several periods for possible real-time deterrence against fare evasion. The paper moves from an existing framework, identifying the factors of fare evasion and risk exposure in terms of frequency (or probability) and severity (or vulnerability), and adopts Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to shed light on the intricate nexus between these components, estimating the fare evasion risk for every (segment of a) route. Next, the risk index is evaluated for each time period of interest. The predictions are ranked and represented by time-dependent dashboards to recognize routes with high-risk evasion that require deterrence strategies. Some real-time strategies are simulated from fare inspection logs, passenger surveys, and probability distributions on data collected in three years. In conclusion, this research provides actionable insights for TAs/PTCs in dealing with fare compliance and can be integrated into any bus transit management system.",2590-1982,Not found
Enhancing digital road networks for better transportation in developing countries,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101217,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Data scarcity in developing countries often poses significant challenges to the use of analytics in addressing development issues. In transportation research, digitized road data is one of the most fundamental data structures, and a poorly digitized road network significantly reduces the ability to optimize trade of micro-enterprises (SDG 8) and placement of hospitals (SDG 3). Unfortunately, current methods to enhance or create digital road networks are not well-adapted to regions with sparse geospatial data, often resulting in poor digital representations of road networks in less-developed regions such as rural areas of developing countries. We present a novel projection-based incremental insertion method that is well-suited to either enhance large existing road networks or combine multiple sources of road networks in regions with sparse geospatial data. In collaboration with PemPem and the World Bank, we perform two case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Together with PemPem, we show that our method significantly improves the digital road network for smallholder farmers in Indonesia, where only 40% of the origin–destination pairs in our dataset were previously digitized. Moreover, in a case study of optimizing geospatial accessibility to healthcare in Timor-Leste (World Bank), the improved digital road network detects an additional 5% of people to be in the vicinity of a hospital.",2590-1982,Not found
The present and future of road Financing: Leveraging knowledge from the tolling industry to implement road-usage charge programs in the u.s,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101240,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Historically, transportation funding in the United States has been supported primarily by motor fuel taxes. In recent years, revenues from fuel taxes have been shrinking. In response to the revenue shortfalls, many states have launched pilots or full-scale programs of road-usage charge (RUC) as an alternative to motor fuel taxes for transportation funding. Some of the challenges facing RUC is the cost of implementation compared to traditional motor fuel taxes, operational complexities, and the equity concerns (Caltrans, 2017). To address these challenges, states are looking to leverage existing vehicle-level pricing programs, such as road tolling, to learn about synergies between RUC and tolling. In this paper, we conducted semi-structured interviews with experts from tolling programs across the U.S. to identify areas of overlap between tolling and RUC. We built upon the interview findings by conducting a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate how well the state-level RUC pilots and programs can integrate with tolling systems. Our results demonstrate that there are numerous mutual benefits of a RUC-tolling integration. Both the tolling industry and RUC implementations can benefit from the increased scale of operations and the spur of technical innovations, which would reduce administrative costs. RUC programs can also learn from the tolling industry to address data privacy and security issues. In terms of policy and program designs of RUC, it is essential to design RUC rates which are equitable by considering the financial burdens on low-income populations and ensuring access to the system for the unbanked and underbanked populations.",2590-1982,Not found

Hence, we employ the quantum game to analyze the interactions among heterogeneous parking providers. This study explores quantum non-entanglement and entanglement strategies in the context of parking sharing and investigates the impact of heterogeneous and fairness preferences on gaming strategies. The findings indicate that in the absence of quantum entanglement, achieving a Pareto optimal strategy in which both parties share private parking is challenging. However, at the maximum quantum entanglement, the cost incurred by the unwilling side must be borne individually, whereas adopting mutual-sharing quantum strategy leads to a win–win situation. Furthermore, owners’ fairness preferences significantly motivate parties with higher sharing revenues. When the disparity in revenues is too high, leading to distinctly unfair aversion to the side with lower sharing revenues, owners’ willingness to engage in sharing is reduced.",2590-1982,Not found

Methods Two air traffic controllers participated in a detailed structured interview, describing aspects of the current alarm that worked well and identifying features that should be changed. They then chose the properties most important to the design of this specific alarm. This information was used to develop a prototype microburst alarm while making iterative changes. A short interview asking about those properties was then conducted with sixty-two controllers at a national conference. Results We developed an effective microburst alarm using the Signal Design Framework. Informativeness, Distinguishability, Saliency, Disruptiveness, Exclusivity, and Recognizability were improved by adding an electronically accelerated verbal component (‘Microburst!’) to the beginning and midway through the alert. The tonal component, volume, and timing of the prototype alarm were similar to that of the original alarm. During the alarm testing phase, most controllers agreed that the prototype would work well in both Air Traffic Control Tower and TRACON environments. Controllers agreed that incorporating an audible ‘Microburst!’ helped to direct their attention to the source of the alarm, especially in facilities where this alarm is uncommon. Controllers also spoke favorably of the length, pitch, oscillation, and timbre of the auditory component. Conclusions We used a validated framework to develop a new alarm that would work well for controllers in their environment.

It highlights an ambiguity within user-centred design in the extant literature, specifically the inadequate exploration of user requirements. The discourse propounds the necessity for a paradigm shift in the research focus—advocating for a more profound inquiry into user needs instead of the prevailing emphasis on the advancement of enabling technologies and the operations of digital platforms. Given the increasing demand for personalisation within intricate transportation systems, comprehending users’ cognitive and psychological preferences emerges as paramount. Such an understanding is imperative to allow the service framework to adapt and identify principal offerings that resonate with user inclinations.

While cycling shows great potential, it is essential for urban planning to consider attributes influencing the choices that cyclists act upon. Cyclists’ route choices have been studied since the Eighties with knowledge being applied in cycling network planning. Yet, the role of cycling as a sustainable transportation mode has been largely absent from travel demand modelling. This paper researches cyclists’ route choice preferences and evaluates the opportunity of incorporating route choice modelling into travel demand modelling to improve the accuracy of cycling route choice. To this end, a route choice framework is developed in which a stated preference survey for data collection is conducted, a multinomial Logit model is applied to the data to identify the factors that significantly influence cyclists’ route choice behaviour. The generated route choice utility models are further integrated into an existing regional travel demand model to evaluate the performance of cyclists’ route choice modelling in the presence of additional factors. Then, the route choice model outputs are validated against two sets of external data.

This paper delves into the opportunities that emerge from this concept, which is driven by the resurgence of walkable, human-centric cities and the advancements in autonomous vehicles. While most autonomous vehicle research has focused on cars and taxis, SAmM proposes more lightweight and environmentally friendly alternatives that align with the vision of more human-centered, walkable cities. At the same time, the integration of autonomy into micro-mobility systems holds the potential to enhance efficiency by reducing fleet sizes and increase convenience by transforming them into on-demand mobility services. This study presents a roadmap for the successful implementation of SAmM, covering essential aspects such as vehicle design, infrastructure requirements, and operational strategies. This research sheds light on the transformative potential of SAmM and provides insights for mobility operators, urban planners, policymakers, and researchers.",2590-1982,Not found
How will women use automated vehicles? Exploring the role of automated vehicles from women's perspective,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101228,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The emergence of automated vehicles promises a revolution in urban mobility. To benefit from a new mobility system, women who have specific mobility considerations necessitate inclusion in designing automated vehicles. This study explores women’s perspectives and the potential impact of automated vehicles through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Results demonstrate concerns among women about safety in current mobility systems, vulnerabilities regarding personal safety, and stereotypes about female drivers. Additionally, mothers face additional challenges managing items for children and their demands during travel, and senior women consider safety issues and declining capabilities when contemplating driving cessation. Current experience with mobility is reflected in concerns and visions regarding automated vehicles. The absence of a driver is expressed as improved safety in driverless taxis, while it is perceived as a safety concern in automated public transportation. Mothers with children anticipate convenience in travel, whereas senior women expect enhanced mobility and social participation. These findings underscore the importance of safety in women’s mobility experiences and provide insights into addressing safety and interaction issues in the design of automated vehicles. Researchers, transportation authorities, and vehicle manufacturers can leverage these results to understand women’s needs better and consider them in future designs and policy developments for automated vehicles. Prioritising women’s perspectives in automated vehicle research is essential to realising the innovative potential of this technology and fostering a more inclusive and accessible future in urban mobility.",2590-1982,Not found
Delay propagation patterns in Japan's domestic air transport network,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101235,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"We experience air traffic delays every day, but are there any recurrent patterns in these delays? In this study, we investigate the recurrence of delay propagation patterns in Japan’s domestic air transport network in 2019 by integrating delay causality networks and temporal network analysis. Additionally, we examine characteristics unique to delay propagation by comparing delay causality networks with corresponding randomized networks generated by a directed configuration model. As a result, we found that the structure of the delay propagation patterns can be classified into several groups. The identified groups exhibit statistically significant differences in total delay time and average out-degree, with different airports playing central roles in spreading delays. The results also suggest that some delay propagation patterns are particularly prominent during specific times of the year, which could be influenced by Japan’s seasonal and geographical factors. Moreover, we discovered that specific network motifs appear significantly more (or less) frequently in delay causality networks than their corresponding randomized counterparts. This characteristic is particularly pronounced in groups with more significant delays. These results suggest that delays propagate following specific directional patterns, which could significantly contribute to predicting air traffic delays. We expect the present study to trigger further research on recurrent and non-recurrent natures of air traffic delay propagation.",2590-1982,Not found
Total capacity and LOS estimation of innovative and conventional roundabouts through macroscopic fundamental diagrams,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101232,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Traffic congestion remains a significant problem, especially in urban areas. To avoid congestion phenomena, several measures can be adopted, including the construction of roundabouts and the control of the measures of effectiveness (MOEs) at intersections. This article compares different types of roundabouts by estimating the deterministic fundamental diagram (MFD) and using microscopic traffic simulations. The deduction of MFD for different roundabout types (single and double-lane, flower and turbo-roundabout) is based on reasonably simplified traffic and boundary conditions. MFDs are estimated through several OD traffic matrices, considering as outputs the values of the macroscopic traffic variable deduced in time intervals of 5 min and 1 h. The findings from this research, in terms of total capacity, travel times, and level of service (LOS) estimation, may be useful for traffic and highway engineers in many realistic applications to partially face congestion phenomena in urban areas. MFDs allow us to determine the best roundabout type based on the traffic demand and represent a parsimonious method for monitoring and controlling traditional and unconventional or smart roundabouts, even in the presence of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs).",2590-1982,Not found
Analysis of wave characteristics near the pilot station,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101231,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"As one of the primary services ports provide, pilotage services aim to ensure the safe passage of vessels when entering and leaving the port. This study uses Taichung Port, located in the central part of the Taiwan Strait, as an example to analyze the impact of monsoon characteristics on wave conditions at pilot boarding points and to highlight their crucial role in safeguarding pilot boarding safety. By analyzing data from the ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) station north of the port’s northern breakwater and the Taichung buoy located southwest of the port, compare wave height distributions at the boarding point. The research addresses the impact of current and planned expansions, including constructing a new LNG receiving terminal with extended breakwaters, on wave dynamics and pilot operations. The study demonstrates that data from multiple sources—such as ADCP and buoy measurements—helps mitigate issues caused by missing data from specific stations. The analysis shows that numerical values differ slightly, while wave height trends at the boarding point are similar under current and expanded port conditions. The study concludes that the proposed expansion will likely affect wave diffraction patterns but will enhance the predictability and safety of boarding operations by reducing uncertainties associated with single measurement stations. Overall, the results of this study can enhance the understanding of marine meteorological information, improve the safety of pilot boarding operations, and thereby increase the efficiency and safety of port operations.",2590-1982,Not found
Can rural counties benefit from high-speed rail investments? The distributive economic impacts of constructing the Dallas-Houston line,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101234,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"High-speed rail (HSR) investments have demonstrated significant economic benefits in many regions around the world. However, there have been ongoing concerns over the potential unjust effects of HSR development on the rural areas where HSR routes traverse. In the United States, resistance from rural landowners is a major factor that has delayed or derailed numerous HSR projects. Understanding whether and how rural areas may or may not benefit from HSR investments helps facilitate timely project delivery and inform supplementary policymaking to achieve broader societal benefits. This paper presents a case study of the Dallas – Houston HSR line in Texas, USA, a proposed project with private investments totaling $16 billion from Texas Central Railroad, LLC. Applying Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) modeling, the study estimates the economic impacts of investing in the Dallas-Houston HSR line and examines the spatial and sectoral distributions of the impacts across the rural counties along the project alignment. The privately funded Dallas – Houston HSR project stalled after a decade-long effort, largely due to opposition from the rural counties along the line. The recent formation of the Amtrak-Texas Central partnership has brought back hope to revive the HSR proposal. The findings of this study are informative for Amtrak-Texas Central to develop strategies that address the unbalanced rural–urban impacts of constructing the HSR line for ultimate project success.",2590-1982,Not found
A fuzzy hybrid approach to investigate commuter satisfaction in Central Europe,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101223,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Commuter satisfaction with their chosen mode of transport significantly affects quality of life, well-being, and the sustainability of commuting practices. This study uses a fuzzy-hybrid TOPSIS approach, applied to data from seven functional urban areas in Central Europe. The method effectively creates a composite indicator for assessing satisfaction levels by considering factors such as socioeconomic conditions, geographical features, and mobility-related data. The research analyzes how satisfaction varies according to these factors. Results indicate that commuter satisfaction levels vary across different factors, including age, education, occupation, gender, travel distance, travel time, commuting cost, and income. Notably, those with shorter commuting times and lower expenses tend to report higher satisfaction, while unemployed and low-income commuters, as well as those using active modes of transport, often express lower satisfaction levels. Interestingly, bus riders find their trip more satisfactory than car drivers, but train commuters are the least satisfied of all. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into commuter satisfaction, informing the development of policies and strategies to improve the transport infrastructure and services and promote the choice of sustainable modes.",2590-1982,Not found
Identifying factors influencing electric vehicle adoption in an emerging market: The case of Thailand,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101229,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered a technological innovation that helps reduce not only fuel consumption but also air pollution and greenhouse gases that exacerbate global warming concerns. Despite these benefits, the understanding of factors influencing EV adoption remains obscure, as it varies greatly across countries and perspectives (e.g., the acceptance of EV technology, decisions to purchase and use EVs, and policies that affect user decisions to purchase and use EVs). To better comprehend the dominance of such factors — especially in an emerging market with a huge leap in EV usage, like Thailand — we devise a multi-perspective multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework and apply it to datasets of Thai EV users, including both general EV user and expert groups. Our results reveal that “Attitude Toward Using EVs” and “Subjective Norms” are crucial for the acceptance of EVs, while “Product and Service Attributes” and “Purchasing Incentive Policies” greatly impact the adoption decisions. Besides these factors, we also identify causal-effect relationships among factors in each of these three different perspectives. This research thus allows stakeholders — including EV manufacturers, transport authorities, and governments — to properly devise relevant mechanisms supporting countrywide EV adoption in a more sustainable fashion.",2590-1982,Not found

The large amount of solid waste comes from the 62 local government organizations (LGOs) in Rayong, with 36 of these directly dispatching their solid waste to CISWM, while for the remaining 26 LGOs, the solid waste is first transshipped via a solid waste transshipment station in Klang district before being dispatched to CISWM, due to the long distance otherwise involved. The amount of solid waste is expected to increase in the future and the Rayong Provincial Administrative Organization (RPAO) wishes to decrease the associated transport costs. Therefore, this paper optimized the location of a solid waste transshipment station for the RPAO by forecasting the number of loads of solid waste from the 62 LGOs for the next 30 years. An integer programming model was developed to minimize the total system costs, combined with comparative economic analysis. Based on the results, Pluak Daeng district was the optimal location to establish a new solid waste transshipment station.

This paper reports on the use of connected truck data to evaluate the impact of the solar eclipse on traffic mobility on Interstate routes in those thirteen states. Approximately 192 million connected truck data records from more than 240,000 trucks were systematically analyzed. Overall, eleven states (Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Vermont) were observed to have a total week over increase in the number of mile hours of Interstate operating below 45 mph by 66%. The other two states, Texas and Oklahoma were observed to have an actual reduction in week over congestion during the eclipse by 35%. Indiana had the highest increase in congestion on eclipse day by 856 mile-hours and significant mobility impacts were observed the day before and the day after the eclipse as well. This was likely due to the number of large viewing events distributed across the region of totality. A combination of roadside ITS cameras and on-vehicle dash camera images were used to qualitatively assess the prevailing roadway conditions and provide context. In addition to demand induced congestion in areas within or adjacent to totality, the dash cameras identified a variety of unstructured roadside parking adjacent to or within areas of totality.",2590-1982,Not found

Throughout the years, in the field of transportation several attempts were made to optimize travelers’ activity chains with different parameters to set, but there is a lack of comprehensive solutions. In this research, the activity chain optimization algorithm is applied, which requires high computational efforts. To provide an adequate calibration of the parameters, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. The aim of the analysis is to reveal how changes in the attribute values modify the final outcomes. The relevant parameters, activity chains, transport modes, optimization algorithms, and fitness functions, are identified and considered. For each parameter, an investigation is conducted to reveal its behavior throughout the runs. For example, changes in the population size and crossover function lead to more reliable results, while alteration in the number of generations and the mutation function have no effects on the outcomes. The analysis presents a peculiar behavior of the parameters related to the activity chains.

Fairness perspectives of airport residents: A qualitative approach,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101221,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Long-term exposure to aircraft noise has been linked to various negative health impacts, with annoyance playing a key role in mediating stress-related health effects. Fairness can be seen as a fundamental aspect potentially reducing annoyance reactions. This study delves into the concept of fairness within airport management, drawing on research from fields such as social and organizational psychology. It specifically examines the viewpoint of noise-affected residents, offering insights into their perception of fairness in regard to airport management. The research involved focus group discussions and in-depth interviews at three different European airports in Germany and France. These sessions were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Participants were surveyed based on their exposure to lower (≤55 dB L den) and higher (>55 dB L den) levels of aircraft noise. The findings indicate that distributive, procedural, informational, and interpersonal fairness are viewed as important elements for fostering a fair and neighborly relationship with the airport. Residents emphasized the importance of receiving adequate compensation for the disadvantages they incur due to their proximity to the airport, such as aircraft noise-related sleep disturbance. Additionally, residents expressed the need for earnest inclusion in the decision-making processes, as well as access transparent information. Additional focus group discussions were conducted to validate the results and to gather input from affected residents, aiming to establish a fair and neighborly relationship.

Towards development of a roadway flood severity index,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101218,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Flooding is among the costliest and deadliest weather disasters. Moreover, different types of flooding have significant impacts on the transportation network and infrastructure including flash, riverine, urban, coastal, and storm surge. The variety of flooding scenarios makes it challenging to quantify the impacts of flooding on transportation across spatial scales; however, such metrics would be beneficial both prior to and after the event. Pre-flood metrics can promote enhanced impact-based decision-support guidance and hazard communication, while post-flood metrics may include larger regional disruptions located away from the most inundated areas and their associated secondary societal impacts. This study developed a retrospective Roadway Flood-Severity Index (RFSI) from 1982 to 2020 capable of integrating geo-located hydrometeorological data and transportation mobility information across localized and multi-state, sub-national regions to (1) categorize larger-scale, flood-related transportation disruptions, (2) understand the origins of those disruptions, and (3) identify severity risk levels of individual road segments and broader regions of transportation disruption during flood events. The fundamental question is, as flooding events unfold, can past hydrometeorological inundation information be coupled with transportation system network and mobility data to identify the most vulnerable roadway segments and regions? The overall mobility impacts of flooding on transportation were highly variable and relatively uncommon throughout the study period. Given this variability in other mobility data (e.g., vehicle speeds), hydrometeorological parameters were used exclusively as model inputs and crowdsourced Waze flood reports were used as the target response variable. A logistic regression based RFSI was found to best align with the dataset providing a “no flood” or “flood” classification. Eventually, this retrospective analysis will be extended to provide predictive capability as well. The RFSI is intended to provide transportation agencies with a quantitative metric to classify, categorize, and communicate the potential impacts of flood events throughout the transportation network.",2590-1982,Not found

For the data analysis, apart from direct investigation for keywords throughout the material for analysis (aviation accident/incident reports with maintenance involvement), a survey tool was also employed. The items of this survey tool (Communication and Trust Question Set) were used to filter the reports’ text to indirectly identify the two factors under examination (communication and trust). As a qualitative tool, the content analysis yielded results via mapping and narrative techniques. As a quantitative tool, results were obtained and reported with the help of descriptive statistics (counts, frequencies). The results indicated that elements of trust and communication are indirectly detectable in aviation maintenance occurrences.

While restrictions are necessary, being overly restrictive on plans has a negative impact on capacity, safety and efficiency. In this article we propose the combination of no-fly zones and flight grids into design elements for airspace design, to be used only where and when necessary. City planners can use these design elements to make both strategic decisions and real-time updates, and thereby set the rules for an automated system for planning and authorization.

This study aims to construct and analyze a stand-alone solar PV-powered electric car charging station to fulfil electric vehicle load demand and make recommendations for optimizing its operation. The goal is to achieve 3D’s i.e., Decarbonization, Digitalization and Decentralization in both the transport and power supply (electricity supply). Advancing towards attaining 3D’s goal, an off-grid solar PV-powered EV charging station was built at the University of Sharjah to meet the load demand. The EV charging station includes PV panels, inverters, energy storage devices and EV charging outlets. A solar PV system of 7.4 kWp with an energy storage capacity of 34.56 kWh is installed. A battery inverter of 4.6 kW is incorporated to meet the load demand of three electrical vehicles simultaneously. The performance of the system is monitored over a year. The EV charging station is in off-grid mode; thus, it is following the load demand for PV energy production. The findings reveal that the total energy production by the PV system is 2971.59 kWh from which the direct consumption is 383.77 kWh (12.91 %), and 2587.83 kWh (87.09 %) is stored in the energy storage devices. The total energy consumption by electric vehicles is 2379.01 kWh of which 1995.24 kWh (83.87 %) is taken from the battery bank. The PV system is working at 24.58 % of its full capacity. By elevating the daily load demand to 33 kWh, the full utilization of the solar resource can be achieved. To evaluate the adverse effect of dust, natural dust is allowed to settle down on the surface of PV panels continuously for 322 days. A linear degradation was recorded in the performance ratio from 77.92 % to 27.30 % in 218 days. Thereafter a plateau was attained and insignificant variation (min. 26.36 % and max. 33.78 %) was observed in the next 104 days. It is concluded that once a thick layer of dust forms on the surface of the PV panels, further dust accumulation becomes minimal.",2590-1982,Not found

Assessing the impact of driver compliance on traffic flow and safety in work zones amid varied mixed autonomy scenarios,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101213,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The safety of work zones is a critical issue for drivers, transportation agencies, and governing authorities. In particular, the vehicles that perform lane changes in the proximity of the work zones involving lane closure, pose a significant threat to the safety of the public and the work zone workers, as they need to complete a forced merging. Yet, there is no comprehensive simulation framework to examine the work zone traffic safety under different compliance distributions of the drivers to the warning delivery for the work zone in a mix-autonomy operation of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. To fill this void, we present an integrated microsimulation framework to assess the correlation between the number of vehicles that perform late merge at the taper (LMT) and traffic mobility and safety under different empirical compliance distributions of the drivers to the warning delivery for the downstream work zone. We employ different work zone configurations to illustrate the relationship between late merges at the taper and performance indicators for traffic mobility and safety of the work zone under a variety of work zone configurations. Simulation results show that compliance distribution significantly impacts the number of late merges at the taper (LMTs) and thereby traffic safety and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that when human-driven vehicles exhibit high compliance behavior to the merging warning signs, it can offset the impact of the lower percentage of market penetration rate (MPR) levels for autonomous operation to achieve comparable traffic safety and efficiency. We further employ the conflation of microsimulation observations and data-driven models to design a regression model to predict LMTs as an indicator for traffic conditions using the work zone configuration as input variables. In particular, we address the heterogeneity induced by the compliance distribution of drivers by sampling the data points from the distribution to capture the diversity in compliance behaviors of the drivers. Our findings can provide insights for practitioners and researchers regarding the optimal compliance distribution using the performance measurements demonstrated in this work.",2590-1982,Not found
Assessing walkability in Dhaka's Central Business districts,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101184,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The Central Business Districts (CBDs) of Dhaka are characterized by heavy traffic congestion, air pollution and peak office hour commuting density. Pedestrian-friendly environment is crucial for accessing the CBDs as it reduces auto-mobile dependency and encourages transit use. As of now, no research has assessed the walkability of Dhaka’s CBDs considering meso-scale factors such as land use diversity, density, street connectivity and micro-scale factors such as footpath continuity and quality, accessibility, safety, security, amenity and comfort of the streets. This paper evaluates the built environment attributes of total 15 wards across core CBDs of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC): Motijheel, Karwan Bazar, Mohakhali, Gulshan-Banani, and Mirpur to objectively assess walkability at both meso and micro scales. At meso-scale, a walkability index is generated that categorizes the wards into the most and least walkable using GIS, with Mirpur DNCC Ward-03 identified as the most walkable and Motijheel DSCC Ward-08 as the least walkable. At micro-scale, the walking environments in Mirpur Ward-03 and Motijheel Ward-08 are assessed based on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach. Results reveal several challenges such as narrow and discontinuous footpaths, presence of multiple barriers including utility poles, pillars, trees and, limited accessibility in Mirpur Ward-03 and garbage dumping, illegal car parking, haphazard hawker encroachments in Motijheel Ward-08. Our findings identify targeted areas needing improvement to enhance overall pedestrian-friendliness of the CBDs. The methodology followed in this study could be applied to evaluate the walkability of CBDs worldwide.",2590-1982,Not found
Extracting dashcam telemetry data for predicting energy use of electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101189,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Prior to the acquisition of an electric vehicle, pre-evaluation of vehicle energy use is desirable to assess whether the intrinsic vehicle electrical storage capability is satisfactory. However, inconsistency in general vehicle modelling may provide unreliable predictions concerning energy usage. To increase the prediction reliability, the use of route-specific driving cycle data is essential. This paper presents a case study of a novel method of extracting vehicle telemetry data from archived dashcam videos without the need to deploy conventional telemetry techniques. Utilising dashcam videos as input, and employing image processing and recognition technology, textual en-route driving data embedded in the video can be extracted. This data can then, in-turn, be used to model the performance of the vehicle, or an electric equivalent in terms of energy use and emissions. Results from preliminary testing with real-life dashcam videos, demonstrate negligible errors with regards to energy requirements and pollutants emitted from an EV operating on the modelled routes. Consequently, the proposed solution opens up the possibility to gather a significant amount of new data in order to better assess the transport sector’s energy requirements. This is especially important for situations where conventional telemetry is difficult to obtain. In addition, results from vehicle fleet modelling may inform policy decisions with regard to the impact of introducing low emission zones.",2590-1982,Not found
Clarifying new urban mobility services based on a threefold business model framework,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101207,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Market entrants have brought a variety of new urban mobility services over the past years, which are rooted in the sharing economy and have their origin in digitalization. Digital data serve as key resource of a business model and, accordingly, digital technologies are the basis of key activities. Building our analysis on the resource-based view and on the business model debate, we ask: what degrees of digitalization do urban mobility service business models exhibit? We perform a systematic literature review and a qualitative content analysis. As a result, we identify a continuum of highly and lowly digitalized business models. We derive a threefold business model framework, substantiated in conventional mobility, hybrid, and data-driven business models. (1) Conventional mobility business models are dominated by mobility as a key resource, digitalization is low and performed by key partners, (2) hybrid models contain both conventional mobility and data-driven key resources, and (3) data-driven models take digital data as key resources, while conventional mobility is carried out by key partners. As a first main contribution, we conceptualize conventional versus purely data-driven business models along the continuum of data-driven business model components. New urban mobility services are the group of both hybrid and data-driven business models, while conventional urban mobility stands on its own. As a second contribution, we clarify the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) concept by corroborating it as a purely data-driven business model with key partners provisioning mobility.",2590-1982,Not found
An Investigation of factors Influencing electric vehicles charging Needs: Machine learning approach,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101211,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Decarbonization of the world is greatly contributed to by the recent technological advancements that have fostered the development of electric vehicles (EVs). The EVs relieve transportation dependence on natural fossil fuels as an energy source. More than 50 % of the petroleum products produced worldwide are estimated to be used in the transportation sector, accounting for more than 90 % of all transportation energy sources. Consequently, studies estimate thatthe transportation sector produces about 22 % of global carbon dioxide emissions, posingsignificant environmental issues. Thus,using EVs, particularly on road transport, is expected to reduce environmental pollution. To accelerate EV development and deployment, governments worldwide invest in EV development through various initiatives to make them more affordable. This research aims to investigate the changing needs of EV users to establish factors to be considered in the selection of charging demands using machine learning, usingan extreme gradient boosting model. The model reached high accuracy, with an R2-Score of 0.964 to 1.000 across all predicted needs. The model performance is greatly affected by age, median income, education, and car ownership. High values of people with high income, high education, and age between 35–54 years show a positive contribution to the model’s performance, contrary to those with 65+, low income, and low education attainment. The outcomes of this research document factors that influence EV charging needs; therefore, it provides a basis for decision-makers and all stakeholders to decide where to locate EV charging stations for usability, efficiency, sustainability, and social welfare.",2590-1982,Not found
Competition in the African air transport market,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101209,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The air transport market in Africa is regulated and viable for designated carriers. Although there are some sub-regional liberalizations, airlines primarily compete based on the specifications of bilateral air service agreements. However, this competitive landscape has not been thoroughly investigated. This study examines market concentration in the African aviation industry and explores its impact on the output of African airlines. The competition was measured at the airport level using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. Panel data were drawn from 54 countries, 339 airports, and 221 airline groups for the period 2015–2019. Kernel density estimation shows that the region’s market for air transport services is fragmented, with many small airlines. Strong competition is more prevalent at larger hub airports, airports near tourist destinations, and major airports far from larger African hubs, while markets tend to be concentrated where dominant and protected flag carriers operate. Competition is also low or limited at smaller airports offering limited flights. The results of panel regression analysis reveal a nonlinear relationship between market concentration and airline output, as strong competition may limit airlines’ output, and high concentration may promote a dominant airline or alliance that may hinder other airlines from entering or remaining in the market.",2590-1982,Not found
Lacking knowledge or lacking support? An informed choice study of support for mileage fees as an alternative to gas taxes,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101208,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Governing bodies are continuing to research, conduct pilot programs, and adopt policy for mileage fees as alternatives to the gas tax, yet public support remains critically low. Lack of support generally stems from assumptions that mileage fees will cost more, be inequitable for rural and low-income households, and will impede privacy through invasive mileage collection. In this study, we assess the extent to which these perceptions of mileage fees, which ultimately shape policy opinion formation, are related to low levels of information or lacking information. We also evaluate the unique aspects of policy opinion formation, including engagement with both individual and aggregate ideologies and material self-interests. Our survey instrument encourages issue engagement through iterative voting and educational experiences, through which we see information has a statistically significant effect on policy opinions and changes what we think we know about public support for mileage fees. Across the educational experiences, which include policy-relevant information provided through videos and tailored annual cost calculations for the policy alternatives, 24% of respondents changed their opinion by the end of the study, and 44% changed their opinion at least once during the study. We conclude with suggestions for public opinion polling around controversial policies that apply to both researchers and practitioners looking to engage with their constituents.",2590-1982,Not found
Towards sustainable urban logistics: Exploring the implementation of city hubs through system dynamics,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101204,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The urban logistics system causes negative externalities, such as pollution, noise and congestion. This study focuses on city hubs as a concept to reduce these externalities by improving consolidation and adopting zero-emission vehicles. Our research employs system dynamics as a method to uncover the dynamics and mechanisms related to the barriers and potentials of city hub implementation in Stockholm from the perspectives of the Logistic Service Providers (LSPs), the receivers and the public sector. Moreover, a mixed method approach is used for data collection, allowing us to extract the knowledge from the real implementation case, co-create a qualitative model as a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) with the stakeholders involved in the system, and generalise the model. The mixed method approach includes a group model-building workshop, literature review, existing city hub analysis and stakeholder interviews. The main result is a CLD, visualising the dynamics of the introduction of city hubs. The CLD explores three potential incentives and policies: (i) the receivers change address; (ii) shippers oblige LSPs to use the hubs; (iii) the public sector gives monetary incentives to LSPs. The CLD presented in this paper establishes a validated system structure for the urban logistic system and facilitates the policymakers’ understanding of the barriers to implementing city hubs and what policies could help their implementation.",2590-1982,Not found

Due to the transport system’s complexity and uncertainty about the future, identifying drivers and choosing effective policies to make the city more sustainable is challenging. Additionally, the chosen policies need to be supported by relevant actors. This study aims to support the municipality of The Hague in generating robust policies supported by and within the municipality. We build on participatory modeling and decision-making under deep uncertainty to create a novel approach to address this goal. In two workshops, the participants formulated goals and objectives, created Causal Loop diagrams, and identified potential interventions. Using a set of possible futures, the interventions were then stress-tested to evaluate their robustness. By explicitly linking, for the first time, participatory modeling and decision-making under deep uncertainty approaches, the participants could understand the system better and deal with uncertainty. Participants gained insight into systemic complexity and methods to deal with it, the inter-relatedness of interventions and their effects, and a shared understanding of the problem and its scope.

Assessment of the sustainability of online food delivery from the perspective of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and transport intensity: A case study in Jakarta,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101200,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This study examines the impact of online food delivery on CO2 emissions and transport intensity in Jakarta, Indonesia, by integrating data from both delivery drivers and customers. A total of 235 delivery instances were analyzed to discern typical distances and patterns inherent in these services. Additionally, insights into the demand side were obtained through customer surveys, yielding 203 valid responses, that included waiting times, costs, and behaviors related to alternative meal acquisition methods. CO2 emissions generated by delivery processes were estimated, utilizing travel distances recorded by drivers. The traffic impact was assessed by calculating the road occupancy of motorcycles used for deliveries. Furthermore, the assessment of CO2 emissions and transport intensity considered hypothetical emission scenarios without such delivery services based on customer indications of their alternative means of meal acquisition. This analysis revealed that frequent short journeys by delivery motorcycles significantly contribute to urban traffic congestion and CO2 emissions, highlighting the environmental and traffic pressures resulting from the rise of food delivery services. Results from the customer survey revealed a profound dependence on these services, indicating that their availability prompts a significant number of additional trips, thereby exacerbating these impacts. The findings suggest recommendations for mitigating these adverse effects, including promoting the use of electric motorcycles for deliveries and managing demand by reassessing delivery fees to reflect the actual environmental costs.",2590-1982,Not found
Identifying electric vehicle charging styles among consumers: a latent class cluster analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101198,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The market share of electric vehicles (EVs) is growing rapidly, making it crucial to understand the charging behaviour of current and prospective users. Such understanding is essential for designing policies that positively influence consumers’ charging behaviour and facilitate EV adoption. In this study, we examined the heterogeneity in charging preferences of 994 respondents across Australia using a latent class cluster model that considers indicators of charging behaviour as outcomes of interest. We used sociodemographic characteristics, travel needs, and EV adoption status as covariates to predict class membership. Our findings indicate five segments of consumers with distinct charging preferences: routine-focused frugals, cost-oriented deliberators, range seekers, flexibility seekers, and indifferent late adopters. These segments differ in the importance they attach to charging attributes, their coping strategies with limited battery resources, and their risk attitude. Our results suggest that a uniform approach to EV-related policies is not appropriate, as each consumer segment has unique charging preferences and requirements. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the significance of accounting for charging behaviour heterogeneity in demand modelling, as assumptions in current models may not accurately represent the decision-making of most segments.",2590-1982,Not found
European ports transition to carbon-neutral energy: A multiple regression analysis,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101187,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This paper focuses on sustainable initiatives in the maritime industry, specifically energy transition in EU ports. Our research aims to apply the stakeholder theory in port contexts, to examine the influence of different actors on the adoption of carbon–neutral energy generation technologies, from a port-employee perspective. To that aim, the proposed conceptual model is empirically tested through a survey among port employees, following the identification of applicable technologies via a literature review. Specifically, six types of energy generation technologies that advance the goal of carbon neutrality are identified, and likewise, following the stakeholder theory approach, we identified six categories of relevant stakeholders, perceived as external or internal. By means of a multiple regression analysis, we assess the influence of stakeholders identified regarding the carbon–neutral generation technologies. The results corroborate the suitability of the stakeholder approach for assessing port environments. The findings suggest the existence of different perceptions among port employees regarding the various technologies, while stakeholder influence can be either positive or negative depending on the type of technology. Among the stakeholders involved, customers and competitors appear as most influential. The main contribution of our results derive of tackling the differences in perception of carbon neutrality within the European Ports, and the carbon–neutral technologies in ports contributing towards carbon neutrality. By providing a more thorough understanding regarding the influence of diverse stakeholders in promoting carbon neutral energy generation technologies, this study can serve as a guideline for future research and be of value for practitioners in the field.",2590-1982,Not found
Evaluation of speed characteristics and gap acceptance behavior of pedestrians of Asian Countries: A review,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101199,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Daily pedestrian travels involve navigating various locations, putting them at risk because they are vulnerable worldwide to road users. Road traffic accidents claim the lives of many pedestrians every year. Any roadway and traffic management design must consider the speed at which pedestrians cross or walk. To improve current operating policies and to provide logical safety assessments, it is essential to comprehend the characteristics of pedestrian speed. While crossing several vehicular lanes, pedestrians must look for vehicle gaps in each route according to the direction of traffic. However, existing studies often overlook the diversity in pedestrian behaviors. This paper seeks to summarize the pedestrian crossing speeds, delays, and gap acceptance behavior in Asian nations based on several investigations. Several notable pieces of information were also formulated through tabulation. By averaging the pedestrian speed of some Asian countries, it was found that pedestrians move at 1.23 m/s, and Indonesian pedestrians move slower than other countries’ pedestrians. Gap acceptance behavior depends on age, gender, group/individual, education status, day/night, vehicle type, traffic flow, waiting location etc. Such factors are also the influencing factors for pedestrian speed too. The study’s conclusions will help mitigate traffic safety issues by creating an effective intersection control system. Practitioners and policymakers can use the study results to develop effective management strategies to lessen collisions between pedestrians and vehicles in uncontrolled locations in urban areas.",2590-1982,Not found
PREDICTOR: A tool to predict the timing of the take-over response process in semi-automated driving,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101192,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This paper presents PREDICTOR (PREDICting Take-Over Response time): an interactive open-source research software tool to predict the timing of various stages of a transition of control, or take-over, in semi-automated driving. Although previous work has investigated extensively what factors affect the minimum time needed for a successful take-over by the driver, less is known about how specific stages within the take-over process are affected by those factors. PREDICTOR applies a theoretical framework that describes the take-over process as interruption handling through a series of stages. It then ties this theory to a database that summarizes results from previous take-over studies. PREDICTOR can be used to interactively predict through simulation how specific human factors (e.g., alert modality, alert onset time) impact four distinct stages of the take-over response process. The tool simulates and visualizes expected reaction time distributions for each stage of the take-over process. The use of distributions also highlights the likelihood of an accident – as long responses (“outliers”) are quantifiable. Moreover, it can help understand at which stage drivers might take relatively longer or shorter, and which stages are most impacted by a specific factor (e.g., alert modality). PREDICTOR also allows users to add their own data, and to define their own dependent variables for analysis. As a tool that allows exploration of various scenarios, PREDICTOR can aid in the prediction and analysis of potential future accidents.",2590-1982,Not found
"Clustering bike sharing stations using Quantum Machine Learning: A case study of Toronto, Canada",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101201,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a field that combines the principles of Quantum Computing (QC) and Machine Learning (ML). QC works by taking advantage of the properties of quantum physics, such as superposition and entanglement. To fully realize the potential of this technology, more research is necessary, as the field of QML is still in its early stages. Since QC technologies and devices continue to develop quickly, it is important to identify the use cases and applications that benefit the most. This paper investigates the potentials of QC, and more specifically, Quantum Annealing (QA), for clustering real-world data in transportation systems. The Bike Sharing System (BSS) is used as a case study applying a clustering model on QA computers. The main contribution of this research is to introduce a hybrid model to cluster stations in a BSS by solving it as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) problem with different methods on a QA computer using a real-time dataset. In addition to the practical contribution, this research also offers theoretical advancements in the field of computational optimization by defining a new topology for the input data that is compatible with QC topology (e.g., Chimera topology). The goal of real-time clustering BSS stations based on dynamic and static datasets is, in fact, to assist decision-makers in better managing and minimizing the risk of bike unavailability at each station and rebalancing bikes shared. Three different methods have been used to determine the number of clusters, and Euclidean, Manhattan, Pearson, and Spearman dissimilarity functions have been applied to cluster the stations. The evaluation is done using the magnitude vs. cardinality approach. The distribution of the stations, magnitude, and cardinality of the results indicate the potential to use QC for clustering for a real-world application, e.g., BSS.",2590-1982,Not found
Modelling driver expectations for safe speeds on freeway curves using Bayesian belief networks,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101178,27,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Sharp curves in freeways are known to be unsafe design elements since drivers do not expect them. It is difficult for drivers to estimate the radius of a curve. Therefore, drivers are believed to use other cues to decelerate when approaching a curve. Based on previous successful experiences of driven speeds in curves, drivers are thought to have built expectations of safe speeds given certain cues, minimalising risks. This research employs a Bayesian Belief Network to model driver expectations using measured speeds in 153 curves and data on the characteristics of the curve approaches. This model mimics expectations as the probability of measured speeds given certain cues. Using Bayes theorem, prior beliefs on safe speeds are updated towards a posterior belief when a new cue is observed during curve approach. We refer to this posterior belief as expected safe speed. Drivers are assumed to adjust their operating speed if it does not match their expected safe speed. The model shows that the visible deflection angle has a large influence in setting the expectations of a safe speed for an upcoming curve. In addition, the preceding type of roadway and the number of lanes are both important cues to set a driver’s expectations of a safe speed. Speed and warning signs are shown to be interdependent on the road scene and hence have less influence in setting expectations. This research shows that design and safety assessment of freeway curves should be considered aligned with the road scene upstream of the curve.",2590-1982,Not found

Through a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed research, we summarise shock events into four categories based on the cause of the shock: economic recessions, infectious disease pandemics, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. The major impacts are identified as a reduction in air travel demand, interruptions in operations, modified operating procedures, and changes in facilities and infrastructure. We further bring these together into a conceptual typology of event-impact interactions.

Methods We conducted a survey of a nationally representative sample of 16–19-year-olds, recruited from the National Opinion Research Center AmeriSpeak panel, a probability-based sample. Participants completed the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Risky driving measures were adapted from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Spline regression analysis was performed to identify the threshold where mindfulness scores significantly changed driving behaviors. Results After adjusting for age, gender, and race, adolescents reporting higher mindfulness scores were significantly less likely to engage on all risky driving behaviors and significantly less likely to have been involved in a crash. Spline regression analysis indicated that a mindfulness score of 75 corresponded to the minimum marginal probability change averaged across the outcomes of interest. Discussion This paper describes a previously unknown association between mindfulness and risky driving in a vulnerable population which is at higher risk of injury and death from motor vehicle crashes. The strength of the associations across a range of behaviors suggests mindfulness could be a general protective factor for adolescents’ driving behaviors and suggests that mindfulness training may be a promising safety intervention for adolescents. A mindfulness score of 75 could be a potential target for mindfulness training interventions aiming to reduce risky driving behaviors and crashes among teenage drivers.

Identifying the role of route choice behavior of motorcycle riders in microscopic simulation modeling under mixed traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101247,28,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Microscopic simulation models are pivotal in transportation planning for their ability to intricately capture complex traffic patterns. This study specifically explores the role of dynamic route choice behavior within micro-simulation frameworks, emphasizing its application in the context of motorcycle-dominated traffic in Ninh Kiều District, Cần Thơ, Vietnam. By integrating discrete choice models for route selection with rigorous calibration and validation in AIMSUN, the study developed a comprehensive traffic simulation model for large-scale networks. Findings reveal that motorcycles dynamically adjust routes based on current traffic conditions rather than adhering strictly to shortest path strategies. However, the availability of roadside traffic information systems accessible to motorcycles in developing countries is limited, hindering optimal route choices. To address this gap and encourage the enhancement of route choice behavior, the study evaluates the impact of real-time traffic information provision using Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams within the micro-simulation model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in network efficiency when informed route selection behaviors are facilitated, particularly with comprehensive coverage across all road types. Higher compliance rates notably improved network capacity by up to 84%. Overall, this study contributes methodologically by increasing model precision and practical insights into managing heterogeneous traffic environments, highlighting the transformative potential of traffic information systems and advocating for broader implementation in similar motorcycle-centric regions, which currently still rarely extend beyond toll roads.

The current study recorded the usage of motorbikes during dry season in three villages surrounding the northwestern Serengeti ecosystem and compared the patterns with those observed in a control village (Ntyuka) located in Dodoma District, farther from any protected area, to confirm the possible usage of the motorbikes in illegal hunting. Nattambiso Village (highly patrolled area) and patterns observed at Ntyuka Village were similar. Interviewed anti-poaching personnel confirmed the usage of motorbikes in illegal hunting during the day and at night while all village leaders ignored the question relating to motorbike usage in illegal hunting. The movement patterns recorded and analysed from this study do not directly reflect the usage of motorbikes in illegal hunting but they demonstrate the differences that exist among villages with different law enforcement levels. A detailed study, including the application of advanced technology, should be conducted to reveal the day and the night usage of motorbikes in villages adjacent to protected areas. The abundance of resident herbivores in/and around the villages close to protected areas should be assessed too. All motorbikes operating in each village should be registered and the record kept available to public.",2590-1982,Not found
Railway capacity utilization and service quality of freight trains with increased top speed in mixed traffic,10.1016/j.trip.2024.101242,28,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This paper attempts to provide a better understanding of the service quality risks that are associated with freight train operations in mixed traffic. Adequate operational quality requires a certain level of robustness to delays and disruptions, but on segments with confined capacity, robustness becomes more fragile with increased traffic demand and speed heterogeneity. This trade-off between capacity utilization and service robustness predominantly manifests itself by compromising the reliability of rail freight services for two main reasons. Firstly, passenger trains are often prioritized in dispatching over freight trains. Secondly, many freight trains operate over longer distances and they accumulate more delays. Decreasing speed heterogeneity in mixed traffic may become pivotal in the interplay between robustness and capacity utilization. In this paper, we investigate possible improvements in capacity utilization and in railway service quality when introducing faster freight trains in mixed-traffic operations. The analysis is carried out on the Swedish Southern Main Line, which forms part of the Scandinavian–Mediterranean freight corridor. Microscopic simulation is used to explore performance indicators, such as simulated running times with respect to scheduled running times, capacity utilization, and punctuality, by implementing and comparing scenarios with different maximum speeds for freight trains. The results suggest that increasing the top speed of freight trains might seem as a promising approach for reduced utilization of capacity in the planning stage, but the stochasticity of operations in mixed traffic may become more challenging for delay recovery.",2590-1982,Not found
"Unlocking telecommuting patterns before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic: An explainable AI-driven study",10.1016/j.trip.2024.101244,28,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The COVID-19 pandemic has instigated a global paradigm shift in employment practices, precipitating a widespread transition to telework. While past events had no long-lasting effect on the continued working conditions of the population, it is unclear what a prolonged need for telecommuting on such a nationwide scale would continue to have on the working population. This study uses an explainable artificial intelligence approach to investigate the changes in those telecommuting across three periods: i) pre-pandemic, ii) pandemic, and iii) post-pandemic periods. Machine learning methods, including decision trees, random forest, extreme gradient boost, naïve Bayes, and artificial neural networks, were developed across the study periods. Shapely Additive Explanations, a model-agnostic approach, explains the best-performing model for each period. Results show that before the pandemic, gender and occupation were major determining factors of telecommuting adoption. However, the pandemic reduced the impact of these factors, making income and education levels a more significant factor for identifying telecommuters. Additionally, the study examines interaction effects between these features, allowing for a deeper investigation of specific aspects of interest. These insights can be instrumental in shaping policies surrounding telecommuting as the pandemic gradually subsides. By understanding the changing dynamics of telework, decision-makers can better support and adapt to the evolving needs of the working population.",2590-1982,Not found
