A copula-based estimation of distribution algorithm for calibration of microscopic traffic models,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.008,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The importance of calibration of microscopic traffic models as the main core of traffic simulation software results from the need for more realistic traffic behaviors. The latent essence of several parameters in such models as well as the uncertainties resulting from the noise in the data, make the process of calibration much more complex. Usually, the calibration process is formulated as an optimization problem. Selecting the appropriate solution algorithm due to nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem is crucial. The importance of the issue is more significant when the matter of calibrating the medium or large-scale simulation model is considered. This is mainly due to the expensive cost that running the simulation models impose. Therefore, applying the current algorithms in which finding the appropriate solutions requires a large number of simulation runs is not deemed suitable. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm based on copula theory has been suggested. In contrast with traditional solution algorithms, in the proposed algorithm complex interaction between parameters of a model has been considered by constructing and sampling from a copula-based probabilistic model. Copulas are functions that describe the dependence structure of a set of random variables and connect multivariate distribution functions to one-dimensional marginal distribution functions. The results indicate that applying an explicit probabilistic model based on copula helps the estimation of distribution algorithm to explore the search space more effectively and efficiently as well as provides the possibility of extracting the knowledge with regard to the structure of the calibration problem through analyzing the probabilistic models that are constructed during the evolution process. Furthermore, this new algorithm has been compared with the genetic algorithm and kernel-based cross-entropy method on synthetic and real trajectory data. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in terms of convergence rate, resource usage and more robust in terms of the probability of finding the global optimal solution.",0968-090X,Not found
A dynamic two-dimensional (D2D) weight-based map-matching algorithm,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.009,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Existing map-Matching (MM) algorithms primarily localize positioning fixes along the centerline of a road and have largely ignored road width as an input. Consequently, vehicle lane-level localization, which is essential for stringent Intelligent Transport System (ITS) applications, seems difficult to accomplish, especially with the positioning data from low-cost GPS sensors. This paper aims to address this limitation by developing a new dynamic two-dimensional (D2D) weight-based MM algorithm incorporating dynamic weight coefficients and road width. To enable vehicle lane-level localization, a road segment is virtually expressed as a matrix of homogeneous grids with reference to a road centerline. These grids are then used to map-match positioning fixes as opposed to matching on a road centerline as carried out in traditional MM algorithms. In this developed algorithm, vehicle location identification on a road segment is based on the total weight score which is a function of four different weights: (i) proximity, (ii) kinematic, (iii) turn-intent prediction, and (iv) connectivity. Different parameters representing network complexity and positioning quality are used to assign the relative importance to different weight scores by employing an adaptive regression method. To demonstrate the transferability of the developed algorithm, it was tested by using 5,830 GPS positioning points collected in Nottingham, UK and 7,414 GPS positioning points collected in Mumbai and Pune, India. The developed algorithm, using stand-alone GPS position fixes, identifies the correct links 96.1% (for the Nottingham data) and 98.4% (for the Mumbai-Pune data) of the time. In terms of the correct lane identification, the algorithm was found to provide the accurate matching for 84% (Nottingham) and 79% (Mumbai-Pune) of the fixes obtained by stand-alone GPS. Using the same methodology adopted in this study, the accuracy of the lane identification could further be enhanced if the localization data from additional sensors (e.g. gyroscope) are utilized. ITS industry and vehicle manufacturers can implement this D2D map-matching algorithm for liability critical and in-vehicle information systems and services such as advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS).",0968-090X,Not found
Where shall we sync? Clustering passenger flows to identify urban public transport hubs and their key synchronization priorities,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.013,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Minimizing passenger transfer times through public transport (PT) transfer synchronization is important during tactical planning and real-time control. However, there are computational challenges for solving this Timetable Synchronization Problem (TSP) for large, real-world urban PT networks. Hence, in this study we propose a data-driven, passenger-oriented methodology as a preparatory selection stage to reduce problem dimensionality by (1) determining the significant transfer hubs in the network, and (2) identifying subsets of lines within these hubs that need to be prioritized for transfer synchronization. In the first phase of our methodology we determine the spatial boundaries of transfer locations, using a clustering technique based on the passenger transfer flow matrix inferred from smartcard data. After that, a subset of hubs to be prioritized for synchronization is selected. In the second phase, we characterize the transfer patterns within the hubs based on a topological representation. Based on these topological graphs, the line bundles that need to be prioritized within the hubs are further identified using a modularity-based community detection technique. We apply our methodology to a real-world case study, i.e. the PT network of The Hague, the Netherlands. For this case study, our approach allows for prioritizing 70% of all transfers within identified transfer locations while only requiring 0.9% of these transfer locations, thus reducing the complexity of solving the TSP substantially at a relatively low cost. Our method supports public transport operators during timetable design and real-time control in determining where and which lines to prioritize when devising measures for improving transfer experience and synchronization.",0968-090X,Not found
Machine learning approach to predict aircraft boarding,10.1016/j.trc.2018.09.007,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Reliable and predictable ground operations are essential for punctual air traffic movements. Uncertainties in the airborne phase have significantly less impact on flight punctuality than deviations in aircraft ground operations. The ground trajectory of an aircraft primarily consists of the handling processes at the stand, defined as the aircraft turnaround, which are mainly controlled by operational experts. Only the aircraft boarding, which is on the critical path of the turnaround, is driven by the passengers’ experience and willingness or ability to follow the proposed procedures. We used a recurrent neural network approach to predict the progress of a running boarding event. In particular, we implemented and trained the Long Short-Term Memory model. Since no operational data of the specific passenger behavior is available, we used a reliable, validated boarding simulation environment to provide data about the aircraft boarding events. First predictions show that uni-variate input (seat load progress) produces insufficient results, so we consider expected passenger interactions in the aircraft cabin as well. These interactions are aggregated to a prior-developed complexity metric and allow an efficient evaluation of the current boarding progress. With this multi-variate input, our Long Short-Term Memory model achieves appropriate prediction results for the boarding progress.",0968-090X,Not found
Data-driven activity scheduler for agent-based mobility models,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.002,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Activity-based modelling is a modern agent-based approach to travel demand modelling, in which the transport demand is derived from the agent’s needs to perform certain activities at specific places and times. The agent’s mobility is considered in a broader context, which allows the activity-based models to produce more realistic trip chains, compared to traditional trip-based models. The core of any activity-based model is an activity scheduler – a software component producing sequences of agent’s daily activities interconnected by trips, called activity schedules. Traditionally, activity schedulers used to rely heavily on hard-coded knowledge of transport behaviour experts. We introduce the concept of a Data-Driven Activity Scheduler (DDAS), which replaces numerous expert-designed components and their intricately engineered interactions with a collection of machine learning models. Its architecture is significantly simpler, making it easier to deploy and maintain. This shift towards data-driven, machine learning based approach is possible due to increased availability of mobility-related data. We demonstrate DDAS concept using our own proof-of-concept implementation, perform a rigorous analysis and compare the validity of the resulting model to one of the rule-based alternatives using the Validation Framework for Activity-Based Models (VALFRAM).",0968-090X,https://github.com/danielefm/DistanceMatrix
Cordon control with spatially-varying metering rates: A Reinforcement Learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.007,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The work explores how Reinforcement Learning can be used to re-time traffic signals around cordoned neighborhoods. An RL-based controller is developed by representing traffic states as graph-structured data and customizing corresponding neural network architectures to handle those data. The customizations enable the controller to: (i) model neighborhood-wide traffic based on directed-graph representations; (ii) use the representations to identify patterns in real-time traffic measurements; and (iii) capture those patterns to a spatial representation needed for selecting optimal cordon-metering rates. Input to the selection process also includes a total inflow to be admitted through a cordon. The rate is optimized in a separate process that is not part of the present work. Our RL-controller distributes that separately-optimized rate across the signalized street links that feed traffic through the cordon. The resulting metering rates vary from one feeder link to the next. The selection process can reoccur at short time intervals in response to changing traffic patterns. Once trained on a few cordons, the RL-controller can be deployed on cordons elsewhere in a city without additional training. This portability feature is confirmed via simulations of traffic on an idealized street network. The tests also indicate that the controller can reduce the network’s vehicle hours traveled well beyond what can be achieved via spatially-uniform cordon metering. The extra reductions in VHT are found to grow larger when traffic exhibits greater in-homogeneities over the network.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimization of terminal maneuvering area and airport at the macroscopic level,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.006,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Airports and surrounding airspaces are limited in terms of capacity and represent the major bottlenecks of the air traffic management system. This paper addresses the problems of terminal airspace management and airport congestion management at the macroscopic level through the integrated control of arrivals and departures. Conflict detection and resolution methods are applied to a predefined terminal route structure. Different airside components are modeled using network abstraction. Speed, arrival and departure times, and runway assignment are managed by using an optimization method. An adapted simulated annealing heuristic combined with a time decomposition approach is proposed to solve the corresponding problem. Computational experiments performed on case studies of Paris Charles De-Gaulle airport show some potential improvements: First, when the airport capacity is decreased, until a certain threshold, the overload can be mitigated properly by adjusting the aircraft entry time in the Terminal Maneuvering Area and the pushback time. Second, landing and take-off runway assignments in peak hours with imbalanced runway throughputs can significantly reduce flight delays. A decrease of 37% arrival delays and 36% departure delays was reached compared to baseline case.",0968-090X,Not found
What have we learned? A review of stated preference and choice studies on autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.003,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper provides a review of studies published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and technical academic and private sector reports on surveys about autonomous vehicles (AVs) from 2012 onward.

The second most prevalent category includes studies about individuals’ willingness to pay to use AVs. The reviewed studies were also categorized according to the study population.

Long-term vehicle reservations in one-way free-floating carsharing systems: A variable quality of service model,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.017,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Reservations in daily services can improve user satisfaction, and give additional information about the demand patterns to the operators. However, providing reservations to carsharing clients is difficult. While carsharing is especially convenient if it is allowing one-way trips and vehicle drop-off anywhere in the service area (called free-floating), this flexibility increases management complexity because of vehicle stock imbalance. Most of the commercial providers of free-floating carsharing offer reservations under highly restrictive terms, for example only up to 30 min in advance. In this paper, we propose an innovative reservation enforcement technique that allows substantially longer reservation times while keeping the system profitable and achieving high service quality. A simple way to enforce reservations is locking vehicles until the departure time of a client. However, it comes at the cost of idling vehicles that could be used by other users and decreasing the revenue. Our approach, called relocations-based reservation enforcement method (R-BR) combines vehicle locking and relocation movements. It locks vehicles only a short time before the trip departure if a suitable vehicle is close enough due to the natural trip patterns. If no such vehicle is available, a car is relocated from another place. Further, we propose a variable quality of service (QoS) model in which the guaranteed radius around the user within which the reserved vehicle will be placed, and the maximum allowed reservation time before the departure depends on the zone of trip departure. A simulation-based optimization is used whereby the carsharing operation is simulated and optimized using an iterated local search (ILS) metaheuristic for adjustment of service level parameters. The proposed technique is tested on a set of artificial problem examples and a case study of a simulated working day in the Lisbon Municipality, Portugal. Results show that the proposed R-BR method is substantially better than the simple vehicle locking when the constant QoS approach is used and that the devised ILS metaheuristic can further increase the system performance, especially with high trip volumes.",0968-090X,Not found
Enabling the use of a planning agent for urban traffic management via enriched and integrated urban data,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.005,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Improving a city’s infrastructure is seen as a crucial part of its sustainability, leading to efficiencies and opportunities driven by technology integration. One significant step is to support the integration and enrichment of a broad variety of data, often using state of the art linked data approaches. Among the many advantages of such enrichment is that this may enable the use of intelligent processes to autonomously manage urban facilities such as traffic signal controls. In this paper we document an attempt to integrate sets of sensor and historical data using a data hub and a set of ontologies for the data. We argue that access to such high level integrated data sources leads to the enhancement of the capabilities of an urban transport operator. We demonstrate this by documenting the development of a planning agent which uses such data as inputs in the form of logic statements, and when given traffic goals to achieve, outputs complex traffic signal strategies which help transport operators deal with exceptional events such as road closures or road traffic saturation. The aim is to create an autonomous agent which reacts to commands from transport operators in the face of exceptional events involving saturated roads, and creates, executes and monitors plans to deal with the effects of such events. We evaluate the intelligent agent in a region of a large urban area, under the direction of urban transport operators.",0968-090X,Not found
The roles of initial trust and perceived risk in public's acceptance of automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.018,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting users’ acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs, Level 3). A theoretical acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with new constructs: initial trust and two types of perceived risk (i.e., perceived safety risk [PSR] and perceived privacy risk [PPR]). It was hypothesized that initial trust was built upon perception factors (i.e., perceived usefulness [PU], perceived ease of use [PEOU], PSR, and PPR) and was a key determinant of AV acceptance. The validity of the model was confirmed with a structure equation modeling analysis based on data collected from 216 survey samples. Results revealed that initial trust was the most critical factor in promoting a positive attitude towards AVs, which, together with PU, determined users’ intention to use AVs. Initial trust could be enhanced by improving PU and reducing PSR associated with AVs. Theoretically, these findings suggest that initial trust offers another and probably more important pathway for other factors to impact consumers’ adoption of systems with uncertainty. Practically, the findings provide guidance for designing interventions aimed at improving public’s acceptance towards AVs.",0968-090X,Not found
Data-driven stochastic transit assignment modeling using an automatic fare collection system,10.1016/j.trc.2018.09.011,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"In modern urban transit networks, buses and subways are not distinguished as different modes of transportation; this makes it challenging to analyze travel behaviors with multiple modes for the purpose of developing policies and plans. With the introduction of Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems, these modes are operated along a complex of links and nodes that constitute a multimodal transit network. Methods for analyzing travel behaviors in mass transit have been developed, but previous approaches fail to adequately reflect travel behaviors and network features (e.g., transfers, mode and route preferences). To overcome such limitations, this research proposes a smart card data-based analytical method with which travel behaviors can be efficiently and accurately examined. AFC systems provide a tremendous amount of data that contain detailed trip information, and using these data reinforces the reliability of the proposed data-driven method. The proposed method of analysis involves four core processes: establishing a scheme for how multiple transit modes can be integrated into one multimodal transit network on the basis of information derived from the AFC system, selecting feasible paths, assigning trips using a stochastic approach, and verifying analytical results by comparing them with findings from trip datasets. This method was used to analyze monthly smart card data collected from the AFC system in 2009 in the greater Seoul area. Multimodal transit networks were constructed from 34,852 bus stops and 539 subway stations using smart card data, and in total, 3,614,875 trips were used in the analysis. The final model for stochastic transit assignment was developed using the proposed method, which was verified by comparing actual and assigned trips. The proposed method exhibits high accuracy (83.93%) and a high R-square value (0.981), which supports the strength of the proposed stochastic transit assignment model. The findings reveal new interesting research directions for exploration, such as developing more disaggregated models (e.g., for specific regions, times, and users), considering detailed transfer features (e.g., transferable boundaries, transfer facilities, and transfer times), confirming the method’s applicability by testing it in other cities, and incorporating both multimodal transit and road networks into the proposed model.",0968-090X,Not found
Assessment of airport arrival congestion and delay: Prediction and reliability,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.015,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Air traffic networks are highly dependent on airport arrival processes, which are common triggers for capacity constraints and delay propagation. Arrival Manager tools aim to improve arrival flows at airports. To do so they need reliable, accurate assessments of potential congestion and delay issues. This paper sets out a methodology for predicting and evaluating the operational state of the airport arrival system. This methodology is structured in two steps: the prediction stage and the reliability stage. The prediction model is based on a Bayesian Network approach, which reflects the stochastic and time-varying nature of airport operations. It also provides insights into the interdependencies between factors contributing to airport performance. The reliability model uses a Multi-State System structure, as the airport arrival system has a large number of performance levels. It is developed via a Markov process technique. By combining these prediction and reliability models we can assess the characteristics of the airport arrival system: stationary state, availability, performance and degradation. The methodology is applied to a case study at a busy European airport, using real data from peak traffic months. Results for the scenarios analyzed show that the factors that have a greatest impact on delay and congestion are the level of saturation at arrival processes, the time frame of the day (which determines the arrival declared capacity) and the meteorological conditions. Moreover, arrival states of congestion reduce the airport’s ability to maintain optimal performance rates. The model represents an evolution from the traditional corrective and binary vision of performance analysis towards a predictive and multi-state approach. The results can be applied to derive operational strategies and draw conclusions regarding arrival performance and management.",0968-090X,Not found
ProbDetect: A choice probability-based taxi trip anomaly detection model considering traffic variability,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.016,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Taxi service is an essential complement to public transport systems due to its convenience and availability. It often provides hundreds of millions of rides for urban travelers every year in cities across the world. At the same time, the number of trip-induced passenger complaints about trip anomalies (trips with anomalous trip length, time, fare, etc.) is also considerable. Hence, the taxi regulators impose harsh penalties on verified trip anomalies. The existing anomaly verification process is labor-intensive, and it does not consider the traffic variability as well as the passengers’ perception of trip anomalies. Quite often the imprecise and unfair outputs are generated as a result. To tackle this issue, we propose a choice probability-based taxi trip anomaly detection model (ProbDetect) that considers the taxi drivers’ route choice behavior as well as the traffic variability. We first generate a route choice set for each OD pair based on the massive taxi GPS trajectory data. Second, we assign each route with a choice probability derived from a cumulative multivariate probability over differences of generalized costs. Third, we distinguish the unintentional anomalies from the intentional anomalies using the expected and the realized choice probability. Lastly, the model is tested on 5000 OD pairs using 180 days of taxi GPS data in Shanghai, China. Three types of anomalies are detected as a result. Insights into the driver’s route choice behavior are derived as well.",0968-090X,Not found
Congestion pricing in a world of self-driving vehicles: An analysis of different strategies in alternative future scenarios,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.002,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The introduction of autonomous (self-driving) and shared autonomous vehicles (AVs and SAVs) will affect travel destinations and distances, mode choice, and congestion. From a traffic perspective, although some congestion reduction may be achieved (thanks to fewer crashes and tighter headways), car-trip frequencies and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are likely to rise significantly, reducing the benefits of driverless vehicles. Congestion pricing (CP) and road tolls are key tools for moderating demand and incentivizing more socially and environmentally optimal travel choices. This work develops multiple CP and tolling strategies in alternative future scenarios, and investigates their effects on the Austin, Texas network conditions and traveler welfare, using the agent-based simulation model MATSim. Results suggest that, while all pricing strategies reduce congestion, their social welfare impacts differ in meaningful ways. More complex and advanced strategies perform better in terms of traffic conditions and traveler welfare, depending on the development of the mobility landscape of autonomous driving. The possibility to refund users by reinvesting toll revenues as traveler budgets plays a salient role in the overall efficiency of each CP strategy as well as in the public acceptability.",0968-090X,Not found

Next, we apply our trained ANN to classify the respondents from a recent Value-of-Time Stated Choice experiment in terms of their most likely employed decision rule. We cross-validate our findings by comparing our results with those from: (1) single class discrete choice models estimated on subsets of the data, and (2) latent class discrete choice models.

Dynamic origin-destination matrix calibration for large-scale network simulators,10.1016/j.trc.2018.09.023,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper considers offline dynamic OD (origin-destination) calibration problems for large-scale simulation-based network models. We formulate the problem as a simulation-based optimization (SO) problem and propose a scalable and efficient metamodel SO algorithm. For a network with n links and a problem with T time intervals and Z OD pairs per time interval, the corresponding SO problem is a high-dimensional problem of dimension T · Z . At each iteration of the SO algorithm, we solve a set of T independent analytical and differentiable metamodel optimization problems, each of dimension Z. The T analytical problems are constrained by n nonlinear equality constraints. Hence, they scale linearly with the number of links in the network and independently of other network attributes, such as the dimension of the route choice set or the link lengths. The temporal correlation, of the link performance metrics across time intervals, is approximately captured through the parameters of the metamodel. Since the T analytical optimization problems are decoupled and can be solved independently, the proposed approach scales independently of the number of calibration time intervals, making it suitable for the calibration of demand over numerous time periods. The approach is efficient and scalable. It is suitable to address high-dimensional calibration problems for large-scale network models. It is benchmarked on both a toy network and a Singapore network versus two general-purpose algorithms: SPSA and a derivative-free pattern search algorithm. The validation experiments indicate that the proposed method identifies points with objective function estimates that outperform the benchmark methods by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. As the problem dimension and the temporal correlation, across time intervals, increase, so does the magnitude by which the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods. The Singapore case study considers a problem of dimension 16,200. This is 2 orders of magnitude higher than what is currently considered high-dimensional for continuous SO problems. The proposed method identifies solutions with an estimated objective function that is 1 order of magnitude better than those of the benchmark methods.

Joint optimization of vehicle trajectories and intersection controllers with connected automated vehicles: Combined dynamic programming and shooting heuristic approach,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.010,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies offer promising solutions to challenges that face today’s transportation systems. Vehicular trajectory control and intersection controller optimization based on CAV technologies are two approaches that have significant potential to mitigate congestion, lessen the risk of crashes, reduce fuel consumption, and decrease emissions at intersections. These two approaches should be integrated into a single process such that both aspects can be optimized simultaneously to achieve maximum benefits. This paper proposes an efficient DP-SH (dynamic programming with shooting heuristic as a subroutine) algorithm for the integrated optimization problem that can simultaneously optimize the trajectories of CAVs and intersection controllers (i.e., signal timing and phasing of traffic signals), and develops a two-step approach (DP-SH and trajectory optimization) to effectively obtain near-optimal intersection and trajectory control plans. Also, the proposed DP-SH algorithm can also consider mixed traffic stream scenarios with different levels of CAV market penetration. Numerical experiments are conducted, and the results prove the efficiency and sound performance of the proposed optimization framework. The proposed DP-SH algorithm, compared to the adaptive signal control, can reduce the average travel time by up to 35.72% and save the consumption by up to 31.5%. In mixed traffic scenarios, system performance improves with increasing market penetration rates. Even with low levels of penetration, there are significant benefits in fuel consumption savings. The computational efficiency, as evidenced in the case studies, indicates the applicability of DP-SH for real-time implementation.",0968-090X,Not found
A Bayesian tensor decomposition approach for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.003,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The missing data problem is inevitable when collecting traffic data from intelligent transportation systems. Previous studies have shown the advantages of tensor completion-based approaches in solving multi-dimensional data imputation problems. In this paper, we extend the Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization model by Salakhutdinov and Mnih (2008) to higher-order tensors and apply it for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation tasks. In doing so, we care about not only the model configuration but also the representation of data (i.e., matrix, third-order tensor and fourth-order tensor). Using a nine-week spatiotemporal traffic speed data set (road segment  ×  day  ×  time of day) collected in Guangzhou, China, we evaluate the performance of this fully Bayesian model and explore how different data representations affect imputation performance through extensive experiments. The results show the proposed model can produce accurate imputations even under temporally correlated data corruption. Our experiments also show that data representation is a crucial factor for model performance, and a third-order tensor structure outperforms the matrix and fourth-order tensor representations in preserving information in our data set. We hope this work could give insights to practitioners when performing spatiotemporal data imputation tasks.",0968-090X,https://github.com/mcgill-smart-transport/bgcp_imputation
A fractionally owned autonomous vehicle fleet sizing problem with time slot demand substitution effects,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.006,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"We study an autonomous transport service for population where users buy future time slots in which they are guaranteed service.

Upper level model is solved using Bender’s decomposition and the results are sent to lower level finding an equilibrium using the values of willingness to pay by population under different pricing mechanisms. The values of willingness to pay and the reservation of vehicles among users depends on the fleet size and routing/scheduling results obtained from the upper level model, where spatial temporal distribution of the demand for ride by users impacts the solution to fleet sizing problem.

Understanding the linkage between electric vehicle charging network coverage and charging opportunity using GPS travel data,10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.008,98,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Using GPS travel survey data from three metropolitan areas, this paper estimates the relationship between plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) public charging infrastructure coverage and charging opportunity. The former is defined as the percentage of public areas with charging stations installed and the latter represents the drivers probability of accessing a public charger at their trip stops (stop-based) or during at least one stop of their travel day (trip chain-based). Understanding this relationship is important to PEV manufacturers and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) providers, as well as government agencies, for evaluating different levels of EVSE deployment and estimating the impact of its availability on PEV adoption. Heuristic procedures are developed to estimate stop- and trip chain-based charging opportunities. Charging opportunity reflects the visibility of EVSE as the incremental security that charging stations enable, while evaluating the potential of a driver to access EVSE at travel stops or during the day, for different levels of EVSE deployment on the transportation network. The metrics proposed do not assess the probability of completing trips with electric vehicles of a given range. The analysis results indicate that drivers’ trip destinations concentrate in a few popular places and EVSE deployment in these areas could achieve relatively high levels of charging opportunity. This finding is also robust to regional variations.",0968-090X,Not found

In this work, we propose a rule-based method for systematically generating and integrating alternative lining options, such as short-turning and interlining lines, into the frequency and resource allocation problem by considering the dual objective of (a) reducing passenger waiting times at stops and (b) reducing operational costs. The bus allocation problem for existing and short-turning/interlining lines is modeled as a combinatorial, constrained and multi-objective optimization problem that has an exponential computational complexity and a large set of decision variables due to the additional set of short-turning/interlining options. This constrained optimization problem is approximated with an unconstrained one with the use of exterior point penalties and is solved with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) meta-heuristic. The modeling approach is applied to the bus network of The Hague with the use of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data and Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data from 24 weekdays.

Modeling household-level hurricane evacuation mode and destination type joint choice using data from multiple post-storm behavioral surveys,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.009,99,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Since Hurricane Katrina, transit evacuation service has been seen to serve critical needs in affected cities and an increasing number of hurricanes have struck the east coast where more people rely on public transportation to evacuate. Thus, it is important to model mode choice in evacuation for a better estimation of evacuation transit demand. In this study, a joint mode and destination type choice model was estimated based on multiple post-storm behavioral surveys from the northeastern seaboard to the Gulf coast. A Nested Logit model specification was used to estimate this joint choice model. The estimated model showed a significant linkage between mode and destination type choice, which validated the choice of a nested structure for the model. Selected variables include both household and zonal characteristics, reflecting the attributes of alternatives (e.g., hotel price and occupancy), the characteristics of households (e.g., residential stability and community density), and the interactions between them (e.g., average accessibility to a destination type). The use of multiple-storm data allowed the use of some variables that have not been considered in the past because of few variations in their values in a single dataset. Overall, the findings of this study provide insight into the factors affecting mode and destination type choice of residents during hurricane evacuation.",0968-090X,Not found
Timetable synchronization of last trains for urban rail networks with maximum accessibility,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.003,99,2019-02-01,2019,2,"In urban rail networks, passengers usually make transfers from one line to another during their trips. Toward the closure of daily service, certain destinations will become inaccessible for last trains as the connecting service may have already been closed when passengers arrive at the transfer station. This study focuses on timetable synchronization of last trains to improve the network accessibility. A mixed integer programming model is first proposed to determine the scheduled time of last trains. The objective of the model is to maximize the weighted sum of accessible origin-destination (OD) pairs for last train services on the network, which indicates the percentage of passengers using last trains at origins who can reach their destinations successfully. A simple network is used to highlight the difference of the proposed model from existing transfer models in the literature. To solve for large networks, a genetic algorithm combining with a timetable-based Dijkstra's algorithm is developed.

Tracking vehicle trajectories and fuel rates in phantom traffic jams: Methodology and data,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.012,99,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The traffic experiment conducted by Sugiyama et al. (2007) has been a seminal work in transportation research. In the experiment, a group of vehicles are instructed to drive on a circular track starting with uniform spacing. The isolated experimental environment provides a safe, economic, and controlled environment to study free flow traffic and phantom traffic waves. This article introduces a novel method that automates the data collection process in such an environment. Specifically, the vehicle trajectories are measured using a 360-degree camera, and the fuel rates are recorded via on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) scanners. The video data from the 360-degree camera is then processed by an offline unsupervised computer vision algorithm. To validate the data collection method, the technique is then evaluated on a series of eight experiments. Analysis shows that the collected data are highly accurate, with a mean positional bias of less than 0.002 m and a small standard deviation of 0.11 m. The positional data also yields reliable velocity estimates: the derived velocities are biased by only 0.02 m/s with a small standard deviation of 0.09 m/s. The produced trajectory and fuel rate data can be readily used to study human driving behaviors, to calibrate microsimulation models, to develop fuel consumption models, and to investigate engine emissions.

Deep reinforcement learning enabled self-learning control for energy efficient driving,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.018,99,2019-02-01,2019,2,"To address the air pollution problems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have been developed to achieve higher fuel efficiency. The Energy Management System (EMS) is a very important component of a PHEV in achieving better fuel economy and it is a very active research area. So far, most of the existing EMS strategies are either just simply following predefined rules that are not adaptive to changing driving conditions; or heavily relying on accurate prediction of future traffic conditions. Deep learning algorithms have been successfully applied to many complex problems and proved to even outperform human beings in some tasks (e.g., play chess) in recent years, which shows the great potential of such methods in practical engineering problems. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning (Deep Q-network or DQN) based PHEV energy management system is designed to autonomously learn the optimal fuel/electricity splits from interactions between the vehicle and the traffic environment. It is a fully data-driven and self-learning model that does not rely on any prediction, predefined rules or even prior human knowledge. The experiment results show that the proposed model is capable of achieving 16.3% energy savings (with the designed PHEV simulation model) on a typical commute trip, compared to conventional binary control strategies.

Coordinated optimization of tram trajectories with arterial signal timing resynchronization,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.008,99,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Modern trams run on exclusive rail lanes along urban streets, but they usually share the right of way with general traffic at intersections and often get interrupted by traffic signals. To improve tram operation reliability, this paper develops a methodology to optimize a multi-period tram timetable by simultaneously adjusting bidirectional scheduled tram trajectories and traffic signal timings. The objective balances the operational priorities of minimizing tram running time and maximizing timetable adherence. The scheduled trajectories depict tram movements along the roads and dwell processes at stations. Arterial signal timings are resynchronized to favor tram movements. The proposed methodology was evaluated in a simulation of a real-world tram line. Compared with a traditional approach, the proposed methodology reduced tram running time, number of stops at intersections and schedule delay by 11.1%, 82.4% and 37.5%, respectively.

Maximum coverage capacitated facility location problem with range constrained drones,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.001,99,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Given a set of demand and potential facility locations and a set of fully available charged drones, an agency seeks to locate a pre-specified number of capacitated facilities and assign drones to the located facilities to serve the demands. The facilities serve as drone launching sites for distributing the resources. Each drone makes several one-to-one trips from the facility location to the demand points and back until the battery range is met. The planning period is short-term and therefore the recharging of drone batteries is not considered. This paper presents an integer linear programming formulation with the objective of maximizing coverage while explicitly incorporating the drone energy consumption and range constraints. The new formulation is called the Maximum Coverage Facility Location Problem with Drones or simply MCFLPD. The MCFLPD is a complex problem and even for relatively small problem sizes a state of the art MIP solver may require unacceptably long running times to find feasible solutions. Computational efficiency of MCFLPD solutions is a key factor since conditions associated with customer demands or weather conditions (e.g., wind direction and speed) may change suddenly and require a fast global reoptimization. To better balance solution quality and running times novel greedy and three-stage heuristics (3SH) are developed. The 3SH is based on decomposition and local exchange principles and involves a facility location and allocation problem, multiple knapsack subproblems, and a final local random search stage. On average the 3SH solutions are within 5% of the best Gurobi solutions but at a small fraction of the running time. Multiple scenarios are run to highlight the importance of changes in drone battery capabilities on coverage.",0968-090X,Not found

Traffic speed prediction for urban transportation network: A path based deep learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.002,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Traffic prediction, as an important part of intelligent transportation systems, plays a critical role in traffic state monitoring. While many studies accomplished traffic forecasting task with deep learning models, there is still an open issue of exploiting spatial-temporal traffic state features for better prediction performance, and the model interpretability has not been taken serious. In this study, we propose a path based deep learning framework which can produce better traffic speed prediction at a city wide scale, furthermore, the model is both rational and interpretable in the context of urban transportation. Specifically, we divide the road network into critical paths, which is helpful to mine the traffic flow mechanism. Then, each critical path is modeled through the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (Bi-LSTM NN), and multiple Bi-LSTM layers are stacked to incorporate temporal information. At the stage of traffic prediction, the spatial-temporal features captured from these processes are fed into a fully-connected layer. Finally, results for each path are ensembled for network-wise traffic speed prediction. In the empirical studies, we compare the proposed model with multiple benchmark methods. Under a series of prediction scenarios (i.e., different input and prediction horizons), the superior performance of the proposed framework is validated. Moreover, by analyzing feature from hidden-layer output, the study explains the physical meaning of the hidden feature and illustrate model’s interpretability.",0968-090X,Not found
Safety benefits of arterials’ crash risk under connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.029,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"This paper aims to investigate the safety impact of connected vehicles and connected vehicles with the lower level of automation features under vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication technologies. Examining the lower level of automation is more realistic in the foreseeable future. This study considered two automated features such as automated braking and lane keeping assistance which are widely available in the market with low penetration rates. Driving behavior of connected vehicles (CV) and connected vehicles lower level automation (CVLLA) were modeled in the C++ programming language with considering realistic car following models in VISSIM. To this end, safety impact on both segment and intersection crash risks were explored through surrogate safety assessment techniques under various market penetration rates (MPRs). Segment crash risk was analyzed based on both time proximity-based and evasive action-based surrogate measures of safety: time exposed time-to-collision (TET), time integrated time-to-collision (TIT), time exposed rear-end crash risk index (TERCRI), lane changing conflicts (LCC), and number of critical jerks (NCJ). However, the intersection crash risk was evaluated through the number of conflicts extracted from microsimulation (VISSIM) using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). A logistic regression model was also developed to quantify the crash risk in terms of observed conflicts obtained in the intersection influence areas. The results suggest that both CV and CVLLA reduce segment crash risk significantly in terms of the five surrogate measures of safety. Furthermore, the logistic regression results clearly showed that both CV and CVLLA have lower intersection crash risks compared to the base scenario. In terms of both segment and intersection crash risks, CVLLA significantly outperforms CV when MPRs are 60% or higher. Thus, the results indicate a significant safety improvement resulting from implementing CV and CVLLA technologies at both segments and intersections on arterials.",0968-090X,Not found

While many researchers have begun to study the characteristics and impacts of ridesourcing, there are few published studies specifically on ridesplitting, a ridesourcing service that matches riders with similar origins or destinations to the same ridesourcing driver and vehicle in real time. This paper aims to explore the characteristics and effects of ridesplitting using observed ridesourcing data provided by DiDi Chuxing that contain complete datasets of the ridesourcing trajectories and orders in the city of Chengdu, China. First, a ridesplitting trip identification (RTI) algorithm is developed to separate the shared rides from the single rides (non-ridesplitting orders) and derive ridesplitting scales. Second, a ridesplitting trajectory reconstruction (RTR) algorithm is proposed to estimate the ridesplitting effects on delays and detours. Then, we analyze and compare the scales, spatiotemporal patterns and travel characteristics between shared rides and single rides, which are very different. The results show that the current percentage of ridesplitting in ridesourcing is still low (6–7%), which may be explained by the extra delay (about 10 min on average), detour (about 1.55 km on average), and degraded travel time reliability caused by ridesplitting. In addition, built environment factors, such as density, diversity, and development, are also correlated with ridesplitting demand and delay.

These systems combine connectivity, coordination, adaptivity, and automated response for transportation policy optimization, thus increasing “smartness” and efficiency. However, the control and sensing systems of implemented ITS can open new vulnerabilities, especially to cyber-attacks. Currently vulnerability is managed within the framework of traditional risk assessment that assesses potential failures of the system in response to specified threats. Emerging technologies by their nature have threats that are not fully known, therefore, resilience, defined as the system's ability to recover and adapt to both known and unknown threats, is an emerging area that holds promise for assessing threats to ITS. To illustrate the applicability of resilience to ITS, we conducted a study of network efficiency and resilience in response to random and targeted disruptions of ITS systems in 10 urban areas. Disruptions were generated to affect either intersections or roadways controlled by ITS under different threat scenarios. Modeled attacks, under worst case scenarios, disrupted 20% of intersections causing on average 14.6% more additional delays than the same severity attacks on roadways. Additionally, locking traffic signal states was found to cause more disruption than fully disabling signals. Thus, as cities adopt ITS and other smart systems resulting in potentially unknown vulnerabilities, it is important to consider resilience of transportation infrastructure affected by potential cyber-attacks.",0968-090X,Not found

Don't pass the automated vehicles!: System level impacts of multi-vehicle CAV control strategies,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.024,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"With increasing number of vehicles registered on road the CO2 emissions and the amount of fuel wasted because of congestion has been rising. V2X and Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technology allows vehicles and traffic infrastructure to communicate with each other, and could facilitate better use of existing resources by providing vehicles information about their surroundings and traffic signals. The information regarding the phase of traffic signal, vehicles’ position and vehicles’ speed can be used by drivers and autonomous vehicle control algorithms to make informed decisions as they approach traffic signals. This research proposes a coordination heuristic to improve traffic flow of CAV vehicles through traffic signals and reduce system wide emissions. A simulation was used to compare the system level impacts to emissions, travel time, and wait time of the proposed coordination heuristic to a single vehicle optimization strategy and baseline driver behavior. The results of this research suggest that traffic density and CAV market penetration impact the potential benefits of CAV control strategies. At low CAV penetration rates both the single vehicle and coordination heuristic produced increased emissions primarily driven by driving behavior of non-V2X enabled vehicles. At higher CAV penetration rates the coordination heuristic significantly outperformed the single vehicle control strategy and baseline driver behavior with regards to emissions reduction. The analysis indicates that at 900 vehicles per hour for either of the two driving strategies: coordination heuristic or single-vehicle optimization, to be more preferred over baseline driver behavior, at least 50% of the vehicles should be CAV. Once a threshold penetration rate of CAV vehicles is achieved, vehicles following the coordination heuristic generate nearly 10% fewer CO2 emissions than vehicles following baseline driver behavior, a 30% improvement over the reduction in CO2 emissions obtained using single-vehicle optimization. The vehicles following the coordination heuristic also have less travel time than vehicles following single-vehicle optimization, and less wait times than vehicles following baseline driver behavior.",0968-090X,Not found

Are people willing to pay extra for the technology? What demographic and psychological factors can influence people’s WTP for this technology? These questions are not yet well investigated. We conducted surveys in two cities in China (total N = 1355) and examined WTP and its potential demographic determinants (familiarity, age, gender, education, and income) and psychological determinants (perceived benefit and risk of SDVs, anticipated perceived dread riding in SDVs, and trust in SDVs).

Younger and highly educated participants with higher-income were willing to pay more. Participants who had heard about SDVs before the survey reported higher WTP and higher trust and perceived higher benefits, lower risks, and lower dread.

Feature extraction and clustering analysis of highway congestion,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.017,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Classification of congestion patterns is important in many areas in traffic planning and management, ranging from policy appraisal, database design, to prediction and real-time control. One of the key constraints in applying machine learning techniques for classification is the availability of sufficient data (traffic patterns) with clear and undisputed labels, e.g. traffic pattern X or Y. The challenge is that labelling traffic patterns (e.g. combinations of congested and freely flow areas over time and space) is highly subjective. In our view this means that assessment of how well algorithms label the data should also include a qualitative component that focuses on what the found patterns really mean for traffic flow operations and applications. In this study, we investigate the application of clustering analysis to obtain labels automatically from the data, where we indeed first qualitatively assess how meaningful the found labels are, and subsequently test quantitatively how well the labels separate the resulting feature space. By transforming traffic measurements (speeds) into (colored) images, two different approaches are proposed to extract the features of a large number of traffic patterns for clustering: point-based and area-based. The point-based approach is widely applied in the image processing literature, and explores local interest points in images (i.e. where large changes occur in color intensity); whereas a new area-based approach combines domain knowledge with Watershed segmentation to partition the images into different spatial-temporal segments from which domain specific features, such as wide moving jam patterns, are extracted. The results show that the Watershed segmentation separates the traffic (congestion) patterns into more meaningful and separable classes, comparable to those that have been proposed in the literature. Since there is no ground-truth set of labels, the quantitative assessment tests how well both methods are able to separate the respective feature spaces they construct for the (large) database of traffic patterns. We argue that the more crisp this separation is; the better the labelling has turned out. For this quantitative comparison we train a multinomial classifier that maps unseen patterns to the labels discovered by each of the two labeling approaches. The most important result is that the classifier using the area-based feature vector achieves the highest average levels of confidence in its decisions to classify patterns, implying a highly separable feature vector space. We argue this is good news! Not only does the combination of image processing (Watershed) and domain knowledge (traffic flow characteristics) lead to meaningful labels that can be automatically retrieved from large databases of data; this method also leads to a more efficient separation of the resulting feature space. Our next endeavor is to further refine and use this method to develop a search engine for the (rapidly growing) 200 TB historical database of traffic data hosted by the Dutch National Datawarehouse (NDW).",0968-090X,Not found

The methodology uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier to classify individual data points into one of four basic vehicle flow states (Free Flow, Stopped, Acceleration, and Deceleration) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify ‘stop and go’ segments in the trajectory. The identification of vehicle flow state is used for varying the sampling rate. The proposed SAS method can reduce the total amount of data by 67–77%, while keeping the most critical data points. The reduced data using SAS also show promising result in traffic modeling applications.",0968-090X,Not found

Many retail stores, for example, are examining the pros and cons of introducing crowd-sourced delivery in their omni-channel strategies. However, few models exist to support the analysis of service area, service quality, and delivery capacity planning, and their interaction, in such environments. We introduce a model that seeks to do exactly that and can answer many fundamental questions arising in these settings.

A consensus-based distributed trajectory control in a signal-free intersection,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.004,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"This paper develops a distributed cooperative control logic to determine conflict-free trajectories for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in signal-free intersections. The cooperative trajectory planning problem is formulated as vehicle-level mixed-integer non-linear programs (MINLPs) that aim to minimize travel time of each vehicle and their speed variations, while avoiding near-crash conditions. To push vehicle-level solutions towards global optimality, we develop a coordination scheme between CAVs on conflicting movements. The coordination scheme shares vehicle states (i.e., location) over a prediction horizon and incorporates such information in CAVs’ respective MINLPs. Therefore, the CAVs will reach consensus through an iterative process and select conflict-free trajectories that minimize their travel time. The numerical experiments quantify the effects of the proposed methodology on traffic safety and performance measures in an intersection. The results show that the proposed distributed coordinated framework converges to near-optimal CAV trajectories with no conflicts in the intersection neighborhood. While the solutions are found in real-time, the comparison to a central intersection control logic for CAVs indicates a maximum marginal objective value of 2.30%. Furthermore, the maximum marginal travel time, throughput, and average speed do not exceed 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.5%, respectively. The proposed control logic reduced travel time by 43.0–70.5%, and increased throughput and average speed respectively by 0.8–115.6% and 59.1–400.0% compared to an optimized actuated signal control, while eliminating all near-crash conditions.",0968-090X,Not found

To analyze security, efficiency, and the relationships relations between them, an agent-based methodology was proposed in this work. This methodology combines an agent-based security risk assessment approach with agent-based efficiency estimation. The methodology was applied to a case study that analyzes security regarding an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack, different commonly used efficiency performance indicators in the aviation domain, such as queuing time for passengers, and the relationships between them. Results showed that reducing security risks and improving efficiency were not always conflicting objectives. Reducing the number of passengers before the security checkpoint was found to be an effective measure to reduce security risks and improve efficiency aspects.

An eco-drive experiment on rolling terrains for fuel consumption optimization with connected automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.010,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Eco-drive is one of the many techniques that has been developed to increase vehicle fuel efficiency and improve the sustainability of the entire transportation system. Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) data is now being used to allow vehicles to cooperate better with current and future environments, such as traffic conditions, signal timing, and terrain information. This study proposes an eco-drive algorithm for vehicle fuel consumption optimization on rolling terrains, which frequently causes additional fuel waste due to the inefficient transformation between kinetic and potential energy. The algorithm using the Relaxed Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (RPMP) is computationally efficient and applicable in real time. While similar algorithms have proven effective in simulations with many assumptions, it is necessary to test these algorithms in the field to better understand the algorithm performance and thus make enhancements to optimally control vehicles for eco-drive. Therefore, this study further tested and verified the newly developed algorithms on an innovative CAV platform and quantified the fuel saving benefits of eco-drive. The proposed eco-drive system is compared against conventional constant speed cruise control on a total of 7 road segments over 47 miles. Experimental data shows that more than 20 percent of fuel consumption can be saved. Detailed analysis through linear models also reveal the main geometrical contributors to the eco-drive fuel savings. This finding can provide a rough estimate of the fuel saving potential of given roadways and help state departments of transportation to identify roadways where eco-drive should be implemented.

A hybrid approach for identifying factors affecting driver reaction time using naturalistic driving data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.016,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) estimates that 80% of the deaths and injuries resulting from rear-end collisions could be prevented by the use of advanced collision avoidance systems. While autonomous or higher-level vehicles will be equipped with this technology by default, most of the vehicles on our roadways will lack these advances, so rear-end crashes will dominate accident statistics for many years to come. However, a simple and cost-effective in-vehicle device that uses predictive tools and real-time driver-behavior and roadway data can significantly reduce the likelihood of these crashes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid physics/data-driven approach that can be used in a kinematic-based forward-collision warning system. In particular, we use a hierarchical regularized regression model to estimate driver reaction time based on individual driver characteristics, driving behavior, and surrounding driving conditions. This personalized reaction time is input into the Brill’s one-dimensional car-following model to calculate the critical distance for collision warning. We use the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP-2)’s Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data, the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind, to model driver brake-to-stop response time.

Arch formation-based congestion alleviation for crowd evacuation,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.015,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Congestion in pedestrian crowds is a critical issue for evacuation management. This paper presents an approach based on arch formation to alleviate congestion formed by crowds gathering at a bottleneck. In this approach, analyzing a specific self-organized motion pattern, namely, arch formation, the position of the arch formation has a great influence on congestion alleviation. Specifically, an arch formation at an outer position is beneficial for congestion alleviation because it is unstable and collapses easily. The symmetrically placed obstacles, which have a similar role as anti-slide piles, are used to change the position of the arch formation in a crowd. The spacing between the symmetrically placed obstacles is an important parameter for adjusting an arch formation. We present a modified model that originates from the soil mechanics in civil engineering to calculate the proper spacing between the symmetrically placed obstacles. This model analyzes the static attributes of an arch formation and improves the spacing calculation. The proper spacing between symmetrically placed obstacles can alleviate congestion and increase evacuation efficiency.

Optimization of shared autonomous electric vehicles operations with charge scheduling and vehicle-to-grid,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.011,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Shared autonomous electric vehicles, also known as autonomous mobility on demand systems, are expected to become commercially available by the next decade. In this work we propose a methodology for the optimization of their charging with vehicle-to-grid in parallel with optimized routing and relocation. The methodology presented is based on previous work expanded to include charge optimization. The proposed model optimizes transport service and charging at two different time scales by running two model-predictive control optimization algorithms in parallel. Charging is optimized over longer time scales to minimize both approximate waiting times and electricity costs. Routing and relocation are optimized at shorter time scales to minimize waiting times, with the results of the long-time-scale optimization as charging constraints. This approach allows efficient optimization of both aspects of system operation. The problem is solved as a mixed-integer linear program. A case study using transport and electricity price data for Tokyo is used to test the model. Results show that the system can substantially reduce charging costs without significantly affecting waiting times, with cost reduction dependent on electricity price variability.

Analyzing drivers’ preferences and choices for the content and format of variable message signs (VMS),10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.013,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Background Recent advance in variable message signs (VMS) technology has made it viable to provide spatio-temporal information on traffic and network conditions to drivers. There is a debate whether VMS diverts drivers’ attention away from the road and may cause unnecessary distraction in their driving tasks due to inconsistent VMS contents and formats. There are also other external factors such as weather conditions, visibility and time of day that may affect the integrity and reliability of the VMS. In China, only about 23% drivers were persuaded by VMS to follow route diversion. Objective In order to capture the full benefits of VMS, the aim of this paper is therefore to identify the factors affecting VMS by examining what kinds of VMS contents, formats and their interactions are more preferable to drivers, specifically in China. Methods A revealed preference (RP) questionnaire and stated preference (SP) survey consisting of 1154 samples from private and taxi drivers was conducted and analyzed using discrete choice model. Results The results revealed that the information showed by amber-on-black on text format, white-on-blue on graph format or the suggested route diversion information showed by single line are preferred by drivers in fog weather. In addition, highly educated drivers or drivers with no occupation are more prone to the qualitative delay time on a text-graph format in fog weather. In normal weather, drivers with working trip purpose are mostly preferred to receive the information on a congested traffic condition with a reason on a text-only format. However, the congested traffic condition along with the information on the apparent causes shown by red-on-black or green-on-black on a text-only format was least preferred by drivers. Regarding current and adjacent road traffic information, drivers prefer to receive the suggested route diversion on a graph-only format in fog weather and the qualitative delay time on a text-graph format in normal weather. Irrespective to weather conditions, male drivers incline to the qualitative delay time on a text-graph format. Conclusions The findings of this study could assist traffic authorities to design the most acceptable VMS for displaying traffic information for the purpose of improving road traffic efficiency and provide the theory evidence for the design of in-vehicle personalized information service system.",0968-090X,Not found

Firstly, a new macroscopic model for VSLs is presented, combining characteristics of previously proposed models, in order to have the capability of modeling different capacities, critical densities, and levels of compliance for segments affected by speed limits. Subsequently, the effects of VSLs on the fundamental diagram of traffic flow are studied concluding that, at least for the considered stretch of the A12 freeway, the capacity of the freeway segment is decreased (and the critical density is increased) when the speed limit is reduced from 120 to 90 km/h. Furthermore, analyzing a wider range of VSLs, it is shown that the VSL-induced fundamental diagram is not triangular and that the speed limit compliance can be very low if enforcement measures are not applied. Finally, the proposed model is compared analytically, numerically, and graphically with the two most well-known macroscopic models for VSLs. The analysis and the simulation results show that the proposed model delivers more accurate predictions in cases where the compliance is low and/or the capacity is reduced by the use of VSLs.",0968-090X,Not found

Life cycle assessment and tempo-spatial optimization of deploying dynamic wireless charging technology for electric cars,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.002,100,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), or dynamic wireless charging technology, enables charging-while-driving and offers opportunities for eliminating range anxiety, stimulating market penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), and enhancing the sustainability performance of electrified transportation. However, the deployment of wireless charging lanes on highways and urban road networks can be costly and resource-intensive. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to compare the sustainability performance of DWPT applied in a network of highways and urban roads for charging electric passenger cars. The assessment compares DWPT to stationary wireless charging and to conventional plug-in charging using a case study of Washtenaw County in Michigan, USA over 20 years. The LCA is based on three key sustainability metrics: costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and energy burdens, encompassing not only the use-phase burdens from electricity and fuel, but also the upfront deployment burdens of DWPT infrastructure. A genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the rollout of DWPT infrastructure both spatially and temporally in order to minimize life cycle costs, GHG, and energy burdens: (1) spatial optimization selects road segments to deploy DWPT considering traffic volume, speed, and pavement remaining service life (RSL); (2) temporal optimization determines in which year to deploy DWPT on a particular road segment considering EV market share growth as a function of DWPT coverage rate, future DWPT cost reduction, and charging efficiency improvement. Results indicate that optimal deployment of DWPT electrifying up to about 3% of total roadway lane-miles reduces life cycle GHG emissions and energy by up to 9.0% and 6.8%, respectively, and enables downsizing of the EV battery capacity by up to 48%, compared to the non-DWPT scenarios. Roadside solar panels and storage batteries are essential to significantly reduce life cycle energy and GHG burdens but bring additional costs. Breakeven analysis indicates a breakeven year for solar charging benefits to pay back the DWPT infrastructure burdens can be less than 20 years for GHG and energy burdens but longer than 20 years for costs. A monetization of carbon emissions of at least $250 per metric tonne of CO2 is required to shift the optimal “pro-cost” deployment to the optimal “pro-GHG” deployment. A roadway segment with volume greater than about 26,000 vehicle counts per day, speed slower than 55 miles per hour (1 mile ≈ 1.609 km), and pavement RSL shorter than 3 years should be given a high priority for early-stage DWPT deployment.",0968-090X,Not found
Vehicle energy consumption estimation using large scale simulations and machine learning methods,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.012,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Vehicle energy consumption and powertrain operations for future vehicle powertrain technologies are predicted through full-vehicle simulations using Autonomie, a simulation tool developed at Argonne National Laboratory. Over 1 million vehicles, with different powertrain types (conventional and numerous electrified powertrains) and component technologies (advanced engines, batteries, electrical machines, light weighting) are simulated for outputs including vehicle fuel economy and cost. Despite the ability of Autonomie to predict fuel economy given various combination of vehicle inputs, the full-vehicle simulation is very time-consuming. It takes approximately 84 h to simulate for 33,060 vehicles even using distributed computing on a cluster of 128 worker nodes. Moreover, Autonomie is unable to populate a continuous output space through simulation since it only yields outputs with discrete values instead of an input-output relation. This paper proposes a novel large-scale learning and prediction process (LSLPP) via machine learning approaches to answer the need for a continuous space of vehicle fuel economy and a more efficient simulation process. By learning in a supervised fashion to discover structures in data, the machine learning approaches seek to train a model that can explain the data with which we can perform prediction over unseen data. As such, we are able to accomplish analytic continuation on the current discrete space of simulation results. In addition, we present a random-sampling-based numerosity reduction algorithm incorporated in LSLPP that reduces simulation runs and improves efficiency of data procurement. We analytically derive a theoretical bound in order to guarantee the effectiveness of our algorithm. We also compare random sampling to stratified sampling and suggest sampling strategies. A user-friendly tool is developed to support the process. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed LSLPP is able to greatly accelerate prediction and analysis of vehicle fuel economy.

Inferring dynamic origin-destination flows by transport mode using mobile phone data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.013,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Fast urbanization generates increasing amounts of travel flows, urging the need for efficient transport planning policies. In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport modes using mobile network data e.g., Call Detail Records. For this study, we pre-process 360 million trajectories for more than 2 million devices from the Greater Paris as our case study region. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm. The later involves clustering of mobile network areas and Bayesian inference to generate transport probabilities for trajectories. After attributing the mode with highest probability to each trajectory, we construct Origin-Destination matrices by transport mode. Flows are up-scaled to the total population using state-of-the-art expansion factors. The model generates time variant road and rail passenger flows for the complete region.

Existing CB systems aggregate similar travel demands and plan bus lines manually, which is inefficient and costly.

A mathematical programming formulation is proposed to simultaneously optimize bus stop locations, bus routes, timetables and passengers’ probabilities of choosing CB. We then developed a heuristic solution framework that includes a grid-density based clustering method for discovering potential travel demands efficiently, a bus stop deployment algorithm to minimize the number of stops and walking distance, and dynamic programming based routing and timetabling algorithms for maximizing estimated profit. We conduct an experiment on a small-scale network to verify the performance gap between the optimal solution and our proposed heuristic solution. A case study is then conducted on one-month taxi trajectory data in Nanjing, China. The study demonstrates that CB lines generated by our CB-Planner can achieve higher profit compared with baseline methods, and they also provide efficient transit services with short walk distances and small departure time adjustments.

Real-time city-scale ridesharing via linear assignment problems,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.019,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"In this paper, we propose a novel, computational efficient, dynamic ridesharing algorithm. The beneficial computational properties of the algorithm arise from casting the ridesharing problem as a linear assignment problem between fleet vehicles and customer trip requests within a federated optimization architecture. The resulting algorithm is up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art, even if it is implemented on a less dedicated hardware, and achieves similar service quality. Current literature showcases the ability of state-of-the-art ridesharing algorithms to tackle very large fleets and customer requests in almost near real-time, but the benefits of ridesharing seem limited to centralized systems. Our algorithm suggests that this does not need to be the case. The algorithm that we propose is fully distributable among multiple ridesharing companies. By leveraging two datasets, the New York city taxi dataset and the Melbourne Metropolitan Area dataset, we show that with our algorithm, real-time ridesharing offers clear benefits with respect to more traditional taxi fleets in terms of level of service, even if one considers partial adoption of the system. In fact, e.g., the quality of the solutions obtained in the state-of-the-art works that tackle the whole customer set of the New York city taxi dataset is achieved, even if one considers only a proportion of the fleet size and customer requests. This could make real-time urban-scale ridesharing very attractive to small enterprises and city authorities alike. However, in some cases, e.g., in multi-company scenarios where companies have predefined market shares, we show that the number of vehicles needed to achieve a comparable performance to the monopolistic setting increases, and this raises concerns on the possible negative effects of multi-company ridesharing.",0968-090X,Not found
Allocation of street parking facilities in a capacitated network with equilibrium constraints on drivers’ traveling and cruising for parking,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.015,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This study presents a method of mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) to determine the optimal sites of street parking facilities in a working area where drivers travel through or cruise for parking spaces in the morning commute. The optimal sites of street parking facilities incur shortest queuing delay in the capacitated network. We first propose a variational inequality to formulate the heterogeneous quantal response equilibrium (HQRE) for parkers in non-cooperative parking game and the logit-based stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) for travelers traversing the area. The HQRE is developed under the “infinite cyclic flows” assumption, allowing all possible routes, containing the cyclic routes of all times including the infinite. Therefore boundedly rational parkers who search the same curb for more than once via cyclic cruising strategies can be modeled in the parking game. Then based on the equilibrium conditions, the MPEC was developed to minimize the total queuing delay for all drivers in the area. The radial basis function (RBF) model algorithm, one of the surrogate model-based algorithms, was proposed to iteratively solve the MPEC problem. A numerical example from a real working area is presented to illustrate the proposed MPEC problem. The numerical results show that the traffic flow increase caused by cruising for parking can be presented by our model.

One commonly accepted definition of travel time reliability, given by the Federal Highway Administration, states that “Drivers are used to congestion and they expect and plan for some delay, but most travelers are less tolerant of unexpected delays. Travel time reliability measures the extent of this unexpected delay.” However, most widely used measures of travel time reliability replace the notion of “reliability” with “variability,” and there lacks measure that directly incorporates the unforeseen levels of travel time. Thus, we extended travel time reliability from the perspective of predictability based on the Lempel–Ziv algorithm in the field of information theory, which provides an upper bound of travel time predictability based on historical data. To demonstrate the advantages of proposed measure and correlations with traditional metrics, we conduct thorough case studies with various data sources along with artificial simulations to explore the nature of the proposed predictability measure and its distinct features from other reliability measures.",0968-090X,Not found

While GPS data, typically collected by smartphone apps, are restricted to rather small samples of the population, mobile phone network data, routinely collected by mobile network operators, potentially allow to analyze travel behaviors and social interaction of the whole population, with full temporal (e.g., longitudinal) coverage at a comparatively low cost. Therefore, recent years have seen an increasing interest in using such data for human mobility studies.

Adaptive long-term traffic state estimation with evolving spiking neural networks,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.011,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Due to the nature of traffic itself, most traffic forecasting models reported in literature aim at producing short-term predictions, yet their performance degrades when the prediction horizon is increased.

This work introduces a method to obtain long-term pattern forecasts and adapt them to real-time circumstances. To this end, a long-term estimation scheme based on the automated discovery of patterns is proposed and integrated with an on-line change detection and adaptation mechanism. The framework takes advantage of the architecture of evolving Spiking Neural Networks (eSNN) to perform adaptations without retraining the model, allowing the whole system to work autonomously in an on-line fashion. Its performance is assessed over a real scenario with 5 min data of a 6-month span of traffic in the center of Madrid, Spain.

These ILP models enable bus operators to solve their bus & driver scheduling problems by directly invoking an available optimization solver such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. However, our numerical experiments do not show remarkable improvements, as CPLEX takes more than 12, 17, and 35 h respectively to reduce the optimality gap to at most 0.5% for solving the above three models in an over 12-hour bus & driver scheduling problem. To improve the computational efficiency, we develop a valid inequality approach that can generate valid cuts incorporating with the CPLEX. An investigation into the valid inequality approach proves its high computational efficiency. In addition, we develop a self-adaptive search method for determining the upper and lower bounds of driver group and bus fleet sizes. Finally, we test our models and approaches on a real round-trip bus route. The results indicate that compared with the only use of CPLEX to solve the above three models, the valid inequality approach can address large-scale instances in a reasonable CPU time.",0968-090X,Not found
Trajectory optimization of connected and autonomous vehicles at a multilane freeway merging area,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.016,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Merging areas on freeways are primary locations for bottlenecks due to vehicles’ mandatory lateral conflicts. These critical conflicts, however, are potentially avoidable with Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technology. However, current literature using CAV technology mostly focuses on merging maneuvers between a single-lane mainline and an incoming ramp. An algorithm dealing with multilane merging areas is absent. In this paper, an online system control algorithm for multilane freeway merging areas is presented with a CAV environment based on optimizing vehicles’ lane changing and car following trajectories. First, the lane flow distribution is adjusted upstream of the merging point under a rule-based lane changing decision, which eventually balances downstream lane flow distribution. A Cooperative Lane Changing Control (CLCC) optimization model is proposed to ensure safe and smooth lane changing execution. Second, a Cooperative Merging Control (CMC) model is adopted, analyzed, and generalized to conduct merging maneuvers around the merging point. Third, a dynamic moving border point method is designed to coordinate the consecutive execution of the CLCC and CMC models. To validate the proposed algorithm, a simulation platform based on VISSIM is developed for online computation and visualization. A typical two-lane freeway merging area is studied. Results under various demand scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous cooperative merging algorithms consistently with respect to delays and average travel speeds.",0968-090X,Not found
Effects of peer-to-peer carsharing on vehicle owners’ travel behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.007,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing is a system where car owners rent their vehicle out to other individuals, usually through a facilitating company. One public policy objective of carsharing is to reduce vehicle miles travelled (VMT), which happens as members (renters) reduce car ownership. With a P2P system, VMT reductions could also occur if vehicle owners leave their car to be rented when they would normally drive. This paper assesses how participation in P2P carsharing affects the driving behavior of participating car owners. Data are from 235 car owners in Portland, Oregon who enrolled in a P2P program. The analysis is based on surveys, vehicle use data collected via in-vehicle GPS, and in-depth interviews. Overall, vehicle owners made very few changes to their driving behavior according to the GPS data, with average vehicle use increasing slightly. However, a subset of owners (39%) did decrease their driving by 10% or more one year after the baseline. Factors associated with this reduction in use included higher baseline vehicle use, higher rental activity, income constraints, and more flexibility in daily travel. In addition, some owners appear to use P2P as a catalyst to change travel behavior, including increased use of other modes.",0968-090X,Not found
Pigouvian road congestion pricing under autonomous driving mode choice,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.004,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Advanced autonomous vehicle technology is suggested to offer a unique solution to many of the current problems in road transport. This paper studies the impact of the transition in automated driving capabilities (driving mode choice) on road congestion pricing and vice versa, accounting for the interdependencies between traffic flow, the choice level of autonomous driving, effective road capacity and marginal travel cost. It is shown that (in a more or less distant future) when drivers can choose among various levels of car automation during a trip and when shortcomings associated with autonomous driving – e.g. adverse effects regarding privacy, software hacking, liability, safety, driving pleasure, manual control recovery – are non-negligible, their generalized user cost curve is the lower envelope of a swarm of traffic flow dependent individual cost curves whose slope is determined by the level of autonomous driving. This has several implications for our understanding of Pigouvian road congestion pricing. Most importantly, marginal social trip costs are then no longer convex and strictly increasing in traffic flow even when traffic is only ‘normally congested’, thereby introducing the possibility of multiple congestion pricing equilibria even in the absence of what is usually called ‘hypercongestion’. When inconveniences related to autonomous driving are sufficiently high, the imposition of congestion tolls may lead to a situation where drivers abandon autonomous technologies entirely and opt instead for fully manual driving. Our findings suggest that the emergence of advanced autonomous driving capabilities and the transition from manual to automated control on the road will probably make congestion pricing more, not less, complex for researchers and policymakers.",0968-090X,Not found

In the first part, thresholds and a Station Ruin Prevention Method for relocation computation are proposed. In the second part, an Integer Linear Programming model for relocation plan optimization is formulated. Both Vehicle relocation and the Staff rebalancing are optimized in a unified framework. Furthermore, in order to improve the efficiency of the programming, a zoning scheme was proposed to divide the large-scale network into separate zones. Finally, a simulation model, which was calibrated and validated using the field data, was built to conduct tests on the performance of the proposed method. The results showed that the number of allocation tasks and distance for allocation have been greatly reduced because of the proposed methods, and the computing time can be reduced significantly with a small loss of accomplished tasks under the zoning scheme.",0968-090X,Not found
Predictive maintenance using tree-based classification techniques: A case of railway switches,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.001,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"With growing service demands, rapid deterioration due to extensive usage, and limited maintenance due to budget cuts, the railway infrastructure is in a critical state and require continuous maintenance. The infrastructure managers have to come up with smart maintenance decisions in order to improve the assets’ condition, spend optimal cost and keep the network available. Currently, the infrastructure managers lack the tools and decision support models that could assist them in taking (un) planned maintenance decisions effectively and efficiently. Recently, many literature studies have proposed to employ the machine learning techniques to estimate the performance state of an asset, predict the maintenance need, possible failure modes, and such similar aspects in advance. Most of these studies have utilised additional data collection measures to record the assets’ behaviour. Though useful for experimentation, it is expensive and impractical to mount monitoring devices on multiple assets across the network. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop predictive models that utilise existing data from a railway agency and yield interpretable results. We propose to leverage the tree-based classification techniques of machine learning in order to predict maintenance need, activity type and trigger’s status of railway switches. Using the data from an in-use business process, predictive models based on the decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees are developed. Moreover, to facilitate in models interpretability, we provided a detail explanation of models’ predictions by features importance analysis and instance level details. Our solution approach of predictive models development and their results explanation have wider applicability and can be used for other asset types and different (maintenance) planning scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found

Optimization-based nonlinear control laws with increased robustness for trajectory tracking of non-holonomic wheeled mobile robots,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.003,101,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This paper presents the integration of kinematic and dynamic trajectory tracking control problem for non-holonomic wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. The non-holonomic constraints, inherent nonlinearities and model uncertainties of WMRs are the main difficulties arising in trajectory tracking control for these systems. To address this problem, after modeling of a WMR incorporating wheel actuators dynamics, optimization-based nonlinear control laws are analytically developed for the kinematic and dynamic based controllers using the prediction of WMR responses. The tracking precision is more increased, under disturbances and uncertainties by appending the integral feedback technique to the design method. The performed analyses as well as the simulation results show that the tracking errors are remarkably decreased by the proposed control system in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is compared with that of a sliding mode controller, reported in the literature, through simulation results.",0968-090X,Not found

Empirical evaluation of influential factors on bifurcation in macroscopic fundamental diagrams,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.005,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Observations from empirical data in the roadway network showed that the relation between averages of network flow versus density often exhibit hysteresis and bifurcation phenomena, which may obscure the reproducibility of a well-defined macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). In this paper, we analyzed large-scale trip data from passenger vehicles in an urban network of South Korea and evaluated the shapes of MFDs over many days. It was found that MFDs have two distinctive, reproducible forms: a well-defined, unique relation on weekends and a bifurcation in high-density regime on weekdays. With regard to the bifurcation, we observed higher network flows in the morning and lower network flows in the evening for the same average network density. This implies that the same set of drivers in the network collectively formed two different trip patterns. Hence, we evaluated possible factors that may have effects on the bifurcation phenomenon. In view of this, four factors – heterogeneity, trip completion rate, detouring ratio and commute trips – were analyzed in this study. The findings showed that travelers’ detours could be a key factor for the occurrence of bifurcation because, by detouring travelers improve neither their own travel times nor network-wide travel times, and thereby degrade the network production.",0968-090X,Not found

Modeling charging behavior of battery electric vehicle drivers: A cumulative prospect theory based approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.027,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The behavior of drivers in charging a battery electric vehicle (BEV) can be influenced by psychological factors such as personality and risk preference. This paper proposes a cumulative prospect theory (CPT) based modeling framework to describe the charging behavior of BEV drivers. CPT captures an individual’s attitude and preference toward risk in the decision-making process. A BEV mass-market scenario is constructed using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. This paper applies the CPT-based charging behavior model to study the battery state-of-charge (SOC) when drivers decide to charge their vehicles, charging timing and location choices, and charging power demand profile under the mass-market scenario. In addition, sensitivity analyses are used to examine the drivers’ risk attitudes and public charger network coverage. BEV drivers who display a higher degree of risk-seeking tend to charge vehicles at a lower SOC. Some home charging shifts to workplace and public charging as the public charger network expands, but home charging still plays the most significant role in BEV use. The power demand from public chargers increases significantly with BEV expansion and has a larger impact on the power grid. The time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate can shift peak power demand to off-peak periods from midnight to early morning.",0968-090X,Not found
An energy-efficient reliable path finding algorithm for stochastic road networks with electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.020,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"In this paper, we develop a novel reliable path finding algorithm for a stochastic road network with uncertainty in travel times while both electric vehicle energy and efficiency are simultaneously taken into account. We first propose a bi-objective optimization model to maximize (1) the on-time arrival reliability and (2) energy-efficiency for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in a path finding problem. The former objective requires finding the reliable shortest path (RSP), which is the path with the minimal effective travel time measured by the sum of the mean travel time and a travel time safety margin for any given origin-destination (OD) pair. Then, we refer to energy-efficiency as the minimum of the electric energy consumption. We discuss the non-additive property of the RSP problem since we also consider the link travel time correlations, whereas the latter objective satisfies the additive criterion. To this end, we illustrate the existence of non-dominated solutions that satisfy both of the two objectives. Furthermore, it is shown that the intersection of two candidate sets – one for the RSPs and the other for paths with minimal energy-consumption - actually contains the optimal solution for the bi-objective optimization problem. The upper and lower bounds of the effective travel time are mathematically deduced and can be used to generate the candidate path set of this bi-objective problem via the K-shortest algorithm. Our proposed algorithm overcomes the infeasibility of traditional path finding algorithms (e.g., the Dijkstra algorithm) for RSPs. Moreover, using two numerical examples, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We numerically demonstrate promising potential applications of the proposed algorithm in real-life road traffic networks.",0968-090X,Not found

A novel solution methodology is developed which extends the classic Clarke and Wright algorithm to solve the HVDRP. The performance of the developed heuristic is benchmarked against two other heuristics, namely, the vehicle-driven routing heuristic and the drone-driven routing heuristic. A set of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed heuristics and to illustrate the capability of the developed model in answering a wide variety of questions related to the planning of the vehicle-drone delivery system.",0968-090X,Not found
Using advanced adaptive cruise control systems to reduce congestion at sags: An evaluation based on microscopic traffic simulation,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.021,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Sags are roadway sections along which the gradient increases gradually in the direction of traffic. Sags are generally bottlenecks in freeway networks. Previous research suggests that traffic management measures using advanced Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems could reduce congestion on freeways, but little is known about their potential effectiveness at sags. This article evaluates the effectiveness of a basic ACC system (B-ACC) and two advanced ACC systems – Traffic State-Adaptive ACC (TSA-ACC) and Cooperative ACC (C-ACC) – in mitigating congestion at sags. TSA-ACC adapts the ACC parameters to the macroscopic traffic state estimated by the vehicle itself. C-ACC uses information of other vehicles in the surroundings to adjust its accelerations. Results are obtained using microscopic traffic simulations with different penetration rates. They show that, under high-demand conditions, congestion decreases with increasing percentage of vehicles equipped with B-ACC. With high penetration rates (75% and above), traffic no longer becomes congested at the sag. Moreover, the results show that TSA-ACC and C-ACC reduce congestion more than B-ACC, mainly because they increase the queue discharge capacity of the sag. The two advanced ACC systems prevent the formation of congestion at the sag at lower penetration rates than B-ACC. TSA-ACC is the most effective system. C-ACC is only more effective than B-ACC in scenarios with 20% penetration rate or higher; below that, connectivity between equipped vehicles is too low. Our findings show the potential of using advanced ACC systems to mitigate congestion at sags and indicate some challenges of this traffic management approach.",0968-090X,Not found
A distributionally robust optimization approach to reconstructing missing locations and paths using high-frequency trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.012,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Daily high-frequency trajectory data (e.g., 0.1-s connected vehicle data) provide a promising foundation to improve the observability of travel demand dynamics. However, the raw trajectories are not always accurate and complete due to technical and privacy issues. This paper proposes a data-driven optimization modeling framework to reconstruct the location-duration-path choices for the missing observations from the incomplete trajectories. By processing many-day raw trajectories, we observe a set of historical choices of location-duration-path and identify missing observations in space and time dimensions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply data-driven network-time prisms that reduce the search space for the missing choices. Then, we formulate Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) models with likelihood bounds, a special case of data-driven optimization models using phi-divergences (i.e., χ 2 distance), to reconstruct the missing choices. To solve the minimax programs of the DRO models while maintaining tractability, we reformulate and solve the equivalent dual problems of the DRO models based on the strong duality theory. To demonstrate and validate the proposed models, we use a real-world connected vehicle dataset containing around 2,800 connected vehicles over two separate months in Southeast Michigan from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) project and a transportation network from OpenStreetMap.",0968-090X,Not found
Making intersections safer with I2V communication,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.017,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Intersections are hazardous places. Threats arise from interactions among pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles, more complicated vehicle trajectories in the absence of lane markings, phases that prevent determining who has the right of way, invisible vehicle approaches, vehicle obstructions, and illegal movements. These challenges are not fully addressed by the “road diet” and road redesign prescribed in Vision Zero plans, nor will they be completely overcome by autonomous vehicles with their many sensors and tireless attention to surroundings. Accidents can also occur because drivers, cyclists and pedestrians do not have the information they need to avoid wrong decisions. In these cases, the missing information can be computed and broadcast by an intelligent intersection. The information gives the current full signal phase, an estimate of the time when the phase will change, and the occupancy of the blind spots of the driver or autonomous vehicle. The paper develops a design of the intelligent intersection, motivated by the analysis of an accident at an intersection in Tempe, AZ, between an automated Uber Volvo and a manual Honda CRV and culminates in a proposal for an intelligent intersection infrastructure.

Autonomous shuttle bus service timetabling and vehicle scheduling using skip-stop tactic,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.018,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The development of new technologies that allow us to know more precisely real-time public transport (PT) passenger demand enables the introduction of new methodologies to improve autonomous shuttle bus service (ASBS) from the perspective of both the user and the operator. This work develops a new methodology to determine the optimized PT timetable integrated with vehicle scheduling, including the possibility of using the skip-stop tactic based on real-time passenger demand. The consideration of a skip-stop operation allows for a reduction in the passengers’ total travel time and in the number of autonomous shuttle vehicles in use. The analysis is based on the deficit function (DF) graphical concept and considers the constraints of the vehicle with regard to capacity. The methodology is developed for a single-depot bidirectional circle ASBS route using the DF as a multi-decision choice model. Because of the complexity involved in large-size genetic algorithm problems, a binary-variable iteration method is applied to attain efficient solutions. A case study in Auckland, New Zealand, is employed to assess the new model. The case study shows a reduction of 1.83% in total passenger travel time and 8.11% in the number of vehicles as compared to solutions that do not consider the skip-stop tactic.

An adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic for the vehicle routing problem with drones,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.018,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have attained considerable interest in recent years due to the potential of revolutionizing transport and logistics. Amazon were among the first to introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several other distribution companies working on similar services. The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones, resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft. Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route, making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase productivity. In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational experiments are carried out.

A Bi-objective efficiency-fairness model for scheduling slots at congested airports,10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.023,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Slot scheduling has emerged as an issue of major concern at congested airports. A commonly used metric for assessing airport slot scheduling efficiency is total schedule displacement. In addition to schedule efficiency, fairness has also been identified as another important slot scheduling criterion. However, the literature currently does not provide sufficient modelling capabilities for investigating the single airport slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off. The objective of this paper is to develop and solve a novel airport slot scheduling model which considers simultaneously slot scheduling efficiency and fairness objectives. We introduce a fairness metric for slot scheduling and formulate the airport slot scheduling problem as a bi-objective optimization model which considers fairness and efficiency simultaneously. We use an integrated solution framework that combines the ε-constraint method and a row generation algorithm to solve the proposed bi-objective model. We investigate the slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off under the following two slot scheduling regimes: (i) a regime that considers historical slot usage rights (hierarchical), and (ii) a regime that does not consider historical slot usage rights (non-hierarchical). The proposed model generates the efficient frontiers describing the slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off for both slot scheduling regimes. The results of the model are presented at the aggregate (airport-wide) and disaggregate (individual) airline level providing information that enhances the transparency of slot scheduling decisions. The efficient frontiers produced by the proposed model can facilitate discussions among different stakeholders in making slot scheduling decisions.",0968-090X,Not found

Next, we formulate the problem of designing the locations and capacities of charging facilities under a fixed budget constraint and solve the optimization problem with a customized neighborhood search strategy. A lower bound for the system cost is also developed to evaluate the qualities of solutions acquired using our proposed heuristic.

A geometry-driven car-following distance estimation algorithm robust to road slopes,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.009,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Locating the surrounding vehicles is an important environment perception task for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. This task is usually explored based on the sensors’ pre-calibration (e.g. height or pitch angle), but can be challenging when the calibration fails (e.g. on the sloping and uneven roads). In this work, we propose a calibrated feature-point based (CFPB) method to estimate the car-following distance adaptive to rough roads, using a single camera. Instead of using the pre-calibrated parameters, CFPB method is based on the surrounding vehicles’ feature points. It benefits from the fixed coordinate relations among these points, which enables the algorithm to be adaptive to rough roads. These fixed coordinate relations can be calibrated during driving. Namely, after a few seconds of observation to a surrounding vehicle, the CFPB method can start working for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm takes the perspective-n-point method as the framework. YOLO V3 and scale-invariant feature transform are applied as the vehicle detector and feature point extractor. The feature point calibration is dynamically updated and the results are smoothened by a Kalman filter. The camera is chosen because of the good performance on objects detection and feature extraction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a real-world road with dynamic traffic flow. Mobileye, a widely used car-following distance estimator on AV, is installed during the tests as the benchmark. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves decimeter-level accuracy and outperforms the Mobileye system in cases where the road slope changes significantly.",0968-090X,Not found
What drives the use of ridehailing in California? Ordered probit models of the usage frequency of Uber and Lyft,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.016,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The availability of ridehailing services, such as those provided by Uber and Lyft in the U.S. market, as well as the share of trips made by these services, are continuously growing. Yet, the factors affecting the frequency of use of these services are not well understood. In this paper, we investigate how the frequency of use of ridehailing varies across segments of the California population and under various circumstances. We analyze data from the California Millennials Dataset (N = 1975), collected in fall 2015 through an online survey administered to both millennials and members of the preceding Generation X. We estimate an ordered probit model with sample selection and a zero-inflated ordered probit model with correlated error terms to distinguish the factors affecting the frequency of use of ridehailing from those affecting the adoption of these services. The results are consistent across models: sociodemographic variables are important predictors of service adoption but do not explain much of the variation in the frequency of use. Land use mix and activity density respectively decrease and increase the frequency of ridehailing. The results also confirm that individuals who frequently use smartphone apps to manage other aspects of their travel (e.g. to select a route or check traffic) are more likely to adopt ridehailing and use it more often. This is also true for long-distance travelers, in particular, those who frequently travel by plane for leisure purposes. Individuals with higher willingness to pay to reduce their travel time use ridehailing more often.

A Lagrangian heuristic and GRASP for the hub-and-spoke network system with economies-of-scale and congestion,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.011,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"We consider a hub-and-spoke network design problem with inter-hub economies-of-scale and hub congestion. We explicitly model the economies-of-scale as a concave piece-wise linear function and congestion as a convex function. The problem is modeled as a nonlinear mixed integer program that is difficult to solve directly since the objective function has both convex and concave nonlinear terms and hence finding an optimal solution may not be easy. A Lagrangian approach is proposed to obtain tight upper and lower bounds. The Lagrangian decomposition exploits the structure of the problem and decomposes it to convex and concave subproblems. Furthermore, we add some valid inequalities to accelerate the convergence rate of the Lagrangian heuristic. To tackle large instances, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) is developed. Both the Lagrangian heuristic and GRASP provide high-quality solutions within reasonable computational time. The optimal designs of hub-and-spoke networks with nonlinear inter-hub economies-of-scale and congestion at hub locations are analyzed in comparison with other models in the literature to demonstrate the significant impact of modeling nonlinearity in economies-of-scale and congestion simultaneously rather than independently.",0968-090X,Not found
A closed form railway line delay propagation model,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.022,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Railway service quality can be measured by the aggregate delay over a time horizon due to an event that delays a given train. Timetables for railway services may dampen delay propagations to subsequent trains by adding either supplement time or buffer time to the timetable. The evaluation of these variables is often performed by time consuming analysis with simulation software, or other complex, time-consuming calculations. This paper proposes instead an analytical closed form formulation of aggregate delay, which offers theoretical insights into railway delays and managerial insight into the properties of timetables at an aggregate level, and which may function as a fast sub-algorithm for timetable evaluations in larger optimization and transport models. Analysis of the function recommends a restraint in the utilization of timetable supplement and buffer, as their delay-damping effect decreases with their magnitude. Further, the effect of different threshold values in delay measurement is demonstrated, giving information valuable to the design of service contracts. Numerical analysis of a common suburban railway line shows that the polynomial function provides guidance and insight even when theoretical assumptions are violated.",0968-090X,Not found
Obtaining transit information from users of a collaborative transit app: Platform-based and individual-related motivators,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.011,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The traditional practice of transit information provision considers operators as active communicators of information, while transit users are considered as passive, only receiving information. Encouraging reciprocity and active involvement of users by enabling them to share information may increase transit information quality and ridership. Nowadays, active user participation is starting to take shape with the development of new apps with commercial market potential. This study focuses on willingness to share travel information as part of daily routine transit app use. The applied behavioral framework is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology adapted to the context of information sharing. The empirical analysis consists of estimating a structural equation model on a data set including 1,369 people from Innsbruck and Copenhagen as cities differing in size and general social trust. The results show that the most important motivational factors for information sharing are pro-sharing social norms and self-actualization weighted against effort expectancy, which is more closely related to the logistic effort of using the platform than to network familiarity. Trust in the information provided and social network engagement are secondary motivational factors, with perceived information quality and need of communication being less influential. Greater transit use and interest in level-of-service and real-time information are correlated with greater information sharing motivation. Women and generation Z had higher motivation for information sharing as well as people who reside in Denmark, a country with high social trust.",0968-090X,Not found
Exploring the impact of foot-by-foot track geometry on the occurrence of rail defects,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.004,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Predicting rail defects is of great importance for safe railway transportation. Using foot-by-foot track geometry and tonnage data, this paper develops a new machine learning based approach to identify the track geometry parameters that contribute most to the prediction of rail defects occurrences. Taking more than 60 types of track geometry measurements into account, this study develops a Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm for feature selection and compares its results with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In addition, to capture more knowledge from the geometry data, some additional features, including Track Quality Index (TQI), energy spectral density, and time-trend are extracted. This, in turn, facilitates the learning and predicting process. Moreover, since there exists a very limited number of rail defects, the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN) is applied to overcome the issue of imbalance in the dataset. In terms of machine learning algorithms, the proposed approach employs an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in which the hyper-parameters are optimized using a Bayesian optimization method. Furthermore, the proposed approach investigates the impact of each track geometry parameter as well as a subset of them on rail defects occurrences with Partial Dependence Analysis (PDA). Finally, our approach is implemented on a six-year dataset with over 60 million track geometry records collected from a 100-mile section of a U.S. Class I railroad to demonstrate its applicability and efficiency.",0968-090X,Not found
Evaluating connected and autonomous vehicles using a hardware-in-the-loop testbed and a living lab,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.010,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) applications focusing on energy optimization have attracted a lot of attention recently. However, it is challenging to evaluate various optimizations and controls in real-world traffic scenarios due to safety and technical concerns. In light of this, our previous work has developed a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed with a laboratory powertrain research platform to evaluate CAV applications. An actual engine is loaded by a hydrostatic dynamometer whose loading torque is controlled in real-time by the simulated vehicle dynamics. The HIL testbed mimics the performance of a target vehicle and the dynamometer generates the same load as the target vehicle. In this work, the HIL testbed is further enhanced to match the performance of actual testing vehicles at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and a living lab is developed to incorporate real traffic information. The same engine as the actual testing vehicles at the FHWA was installed and the vehicle models were calibrated using testing data from actual vehicles. The same roadway conditions (speed limit, the degree of road slope, etc.) were input into the testbed and the dynamometer generates the same load as an actual vehicle’s engine is getting. The HIL testbed emulates the performance of an actual vehicle and both fuel consumption and emissions are measured by precise instruments in the lab. In eight testing scenarios, the results have shown that the performance of the HIL testbed matches very well with the actual testing vehicles with about 1% error. In addition, the living lab has enabled the HIL testbed to interact with real traffic and extended the testing capabilities of the HIL testbed. Two new testing capabilities have been demonstrated through two CAV applications. This is an exciting result since the HIL testbed could provide an effective and economical way for the testing of fuel consumption and emissions on various roadway conditions for CAVs and other types of vehicles.",0968-090X,Not found

However, the execution of large infrastructure projects causes disturbances in the network due to the occupation of infrastructure over extended periods of time. In this paper we propose a multiobjective project scheduling optimization model for railway infrastructure projects that takes inconvenience caused to users of the infrastructure into account. We illustrate how the model can be used in an interactive way by planners based on their preferences, and we show that Pareto optimal solutions can be found in reasonable time using instances with realistic features.

Cooperative control of high-speed trains for headway regulation: A self-triggered model predictive control based approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.023,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The advanced train-to-train and train-to-ground communication technologies equipped in high-speed railways have the potential to allow trains to follow each with a steady headway and improve the safety and performance of the railway systems. A key enabler is a train control system that is able to respond to unforeseen disturbances in the system (e.g., incidents, train delays), and to adjust and coordinate the train headways and speeds. This paper proposes a multi-train cooperative control model based on the dynamic features during train longitude movement to adjust train following headway. In particular, our model simultaneously considers several practical constraints, e.g., train controller output constraints, safe train following distance, as well as communication delays and resources. Then, this control problem is solved through a rolling horizon approach by calculating the Riccati equation with Lagrangian multipliers. Due to the practical communication resource constraints and riding comfort requirement, we also improved the rolling horizon approach into a novel self-triggered model predictive control scheme to overcome these issues. Finally, two case studies are given through simulation experiments. The simulation results are analyzed which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Reducing time headway for platooning of connected vehicles via V2V communication,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.002,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"In a platoon of connected vehicles, time headway plays an important role in both traffic capacity and road safety. It is desirable to maintain a lower time headway while satisfying string stability in a platoon, since this leads to a higher traffic capacity and guarantees the disturbance attenuation ability. In this paper, we study a multiple-predecessor following strategy to reduce time headway via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We first introduce a new definition of desired inter-vehicle distances based on the constant time headway (CTH) policy, which is suitable for general communication topologies. By exploiting lower-triangular structures in a time headway matrix and an information topology matrix, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on feedback gains for internal asymptotic stability. Further, by analyzing the stable region of feedback gains, a necessary and sufficient condition on time headway is also obtained for the string stability specification. It is proved that a platoon can be asymptotically stable and string stable when the time headway is lower bounded. Moreover, this bound can be reduced by increasing the number of predecessors. These results explicitly highlight the benefits of V2V communication on reducing time headway for platooning of connected vehicles.",0968-090X,Not found
Is dynamic traffic sensor network profitable for network-level real-time information prediction?,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.006,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Optimally deploying sensors into a complex highway network can significantly enhance the socio-economic benefits through accurately providing system users and operators with the latest traffic state information. This paper presents a linear optimization framework for designing a sensor network for travel time surveillance. The presented framework consists of a traditional static network model and a novel dynamic network model as well as an integer cut-based speed-up solution approach. The aims of the study are twofold. First, the proposed optimization model maximizes the network-level travel time surveillance benefits by taking into account the values of real-time measurements induced from both temporal and spatial traffic state patterns. Second, the mechanism of sensor relocation operations is designed and incorporated into the proposed model. This mechanism enables one to evaluate whether appropriately relocating sensors can optimize the utilization of the surveillance resources and further enhance the surveillance benefits over a given time horizon. We applied the proposed optimization framework to a mixed arterial-freeway commuting network located in Washington. D.C.-Baltimore metropolitan area. The study empirically revealed and illustrated two interesting findings: (1) relocation operations do bring additional surveillance benefits on travel time prediction, and the marginal benefit is highly correlated with the sensor fleet size; (2) spatial measurement is not a trivial part in travel time prediction, and one should fully recognize the effectiveness of temporal and spatial measurements when designing a traffic sensor network for real-time travel time surveillance.",0968-090X,Not found
Predicting taxi demand hotspots using automated Internet Search Queries,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.001,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Disruptions due to special events are a well-known challenge in transport operations, since the transport system is typically designed for habitual demand. Part of the problem relates to the difficulty in collecting comprehensive and reliable information early enough to prepare mitigation measures. A tool that automatically scans the internet for events and predicts their impact would strongly support transport management in many cities in the world. This study addresses the challenges related to retrieving and analyzing web documents about real world events, and using them for demand explanation (if related to a past event) and prediction (if a future one). Transport demand is predicted with a supervised topic modeling algorithm by utilizing information about social events retrieved using various strategies, which made use of search aggregation, natural language processing, and query expansion. It was found that a two-step process produced the highest accuracy for transport demand prediction, where different (but related) queries are used to retrieve an initial set of documents, and then, based on these documents, a final query is constructed that obtains the set of predictive documents. These are then used to model the most discriminating topics related to the transport demand.

Modeling EV charging choice considering risk attitudes and attribute non-attendance,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.007,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"In this paper, we developed and compared logit based models of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) drivers’ charging choice behaviors in terms of whether or not to charge at a destination with a charging facility. First, we conducted a web-based stated preference survey to obtain EV drivers’ charging choice data and EV-related risk attitudes. Using these data we developed EV drivers charging choice models based on hybrid choice modeling (HCM) framework, incorporating risk attitude and different decision strategies. The HCM binary logit model results indicate that the risk attitude variable is a significant predictor of EV drivers’ charging choices. Comparing the two HCM latent class logit (LCL) models, the attribute non-attendance (ANA) LCL model gets a better goodness-of-fit over the fully compensatory LCL model. The ANA LCL model result shows that the EV drivers are divided into two classes: risk averse class focuses primarily on the amount of excess or buffer range they have available to complete their next trip; and risk seeking class balances price against their current state of charge.

Fleet operational policies for automated mobility: A simulation assessment for Zurich,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.020,102,2019-05-01,2019,5,"We evaluate performance of four different operational policies to control an automated mobility-on-demand system with sequential vehicle-sharing in one public open-source-accessible, agent-based, high fidelity simulation environment.

The results indicate that automated vehicles’ shared mobility systems can provide approximately six times higher occupancy rates than conventional private cars, but that their costs – in Switzerland – are considerably higher than those of subsidized public transport or private cars in the short term. However, these services are predicted to be considerably cheaper than the full costs of owning and using a private car, which makes the long-term adoption of automated taxi services likely. Simulations demonstrate that choice of fleet operational policy determining customer-vehicle assignment and repositioning of empty vehicles (rebalancing) heavily influences system performance, e.g., wait times and cost.

In this study we present a stated-choice survey to investigate the attractiveness to customers of two mechanisms for managing fleet volatility: Virtual Queuing (VQ) and Guaranteed Advance Reservation (GAR). We investigate socio-demographic features and “Big Five” personality traits that are associated ceteris paribus with choosing to use the existing FFCS service model, willingness-to-pay (WTP) for VQ and GAR, and risky-choice behaviour under the uncertainty of FFCS systems. Data (n = 289; 232 employed in analysis) are sourced from existing users of a FFCS service in London, UK. Within the survey context, we found that customers are on average not willing to pay for VQ (i.e. negative WTP), however have £0.54 per journey WTP for GAR, with low-frequency FFCS users and users scoring highly on the Big Five “Conscientiousness” dimension having larger WTP for GAR. When analysing the two dimensions of uncertainty, we found that respondents exhibit risk-seeking behaviour towards price and weaker and insignificant risk-aversion towards walking time. This pattern holds across the three standard model types of nonlinear risky-choice behaviour that we investigated. The results are intended to be useful both to policymakers and carsharing operators who are likely, as the industry matures, to seek mechanisms to differentiate their service offers to better serve individual market segments with distinctive characteristics.",0968-090X,Not found
Design analysis of a decentralized equilibrium-routing strategy for intelligent vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.028,103,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Intelligent vehicle technologies are opening new possibilities for decentralized vehicle routing systems, suitable for regulating large traffic networks, and at the same time, capable of providing customized advice to individual vehicles. In this study, we perform a rigorous simulation-based analysis of an in-vehicle routing strategy that aims to achieve a user-equilibrium distribution in traffic. Novel features of the approach include: a mechanism based on forward propagation of individual vehicle decisions to anticipate future traffic dynamics; time-dependent prediction of route travel times with neural network-based link predictors; and a stochastic routing policy for in-vehicle decision-making based on predicted travel times. However, for an effective application of the approach, design choices need to be made regarding the accuracy of the link predictors, and some control settings. These choices may depend on the network size and structure. We investigate the impact of two important design aspects: sequentially using link-level predictors for route travel time estimation, and the control parameter values, on the equilibrium performance at the network-level. The results suggest functional scalability of the approach, in terms of the prediction model accuracy and routing performance. Overall, the work contributes to a qualitative and quantitative understanding of emergent performance from the given routing approach.",0968-090X,Not found

Big GPS trajectory data analytics offers new opportunities for gaining insights into vehicle movement dynamics and road network usage patterns that are important for transportation studies and urban planning among other fields. Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for Maryland’s road network.

To improve the probability of on-time arrival, the reliable path concept and collected travel time information are used to facilitate path finding for SATs, and the potential benefits are examined. Two simulation scenarios—one based on historical traffic information and the other based on real-time traffic information—are executed to evaluate the information’s usefulness in reliable path finding. In simulation results, reliable path scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than shortest path scenarios, in which the shortest path algorithm is used in path finding for SATs, and the historical information-based scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than the real-time information-based scenarios.

Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is tailored for CAVs aiming at replacing the conventional traffic control strategies. In this work, using the communication and computation technologies of CAVs, the sequential movements of vehicles through intersections are modelled as multi-agent Markov decision processes (MAMDPs) in which vehicle agents cooperate to minimize intersection delay with collision-free constraints. To handle the huge dimension scale incurred by the nature of multi-agent decision making problems, the state space of CAVs are decomposed into independent part and coordinated part by exploiting the structural properties of the AIM problem, and a decentralized coordination multi-agent learning approach (DCL-AIM) is proposed to solve the problem efficiently by exploiting both global and localized agent coordination needs in AIM. The main feature of the proposed approach is to explicitly identify and dynamically adapt agent coordination needs during the learning process so that the curse of dimensionality and environment nonstationarity problems in multi-agent learning can be alleviated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under a variety of traffic conditions. The comparison analysis is performed between DCL-AIM and the First-Come-First-Serve based AIM (FCFS-AIM), with Longest-Queue-First (LQF-AIM) policy and the signal control based on the Webster’s method (Signal) as benchmarks.

From univariate to bivariate extreme value models: Approaches to integrate traffic conflict indicators for crash estimation,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.015,103,2019-06-01,2019,6,"This study develops bivariate extreme value models to integrate traffic conflict indicators for crash estimation. Based on video data collected from four sites of two signalized intersections, the automated traffic conflict analysis system was used to extract the TTC and PET between left-turn vehicles and through vehicles. Bivariate Generalized Extreme Value (BGEV) and Bivariate Generalized Pareto (BGP) models that jointly used the two conflict indicators were then developed, and the number of crashes were derived from the estimated model parameters. Univariate Generalized Extreme Value (UGEV) and Univariate Generalized Pareto (UGP) models were also applied using individual conflict indicators. The developed bivariate models and univariate models were evaluated by comparing model estimated crashes to observed left-turn crashes. The results show that the BGP model performed the best, followed by the BGEV model, UGP model, and UGEV model. It is found that crash estimates from univariate models based on PET and TTC are underestimated and overestimated, respectively. The bivariate models integrating the two indicators improve the crash estimation accuracy and precision. The BGP model outperforming the BGEV model is likely due to the former allowing more efficient use of the collected data. Overall, it is concluded that the bivariate extreme value modeling approach that is capable of integrating traffic conflict indicators with clear boundaries between traffic conflicts and crashes is more promising for crash estimation. Moreover, with the emerging automated traffic conflict analysis and connected vehicle techniques that facilitate the indicators extraction, the bivariate approach can be readily applied to provide accurate crash estimations for proactive road safety analysis.",0968-090X,Not found

High passenger loads has implications on train punctuality. One of the important parameters affecting punctuality is the average boarding/alighting time.

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of minimizing the boarding/alighting time by maintaining a uniform load on carriages through systematic distribution of passengers with flexible tickets, such as season or anytime tickets where no seat information are provided at the time of reservation. To achieve this, the proposed algorithm takes other information such as passenger final destination, uniform load of luggage areas, as well as group travelers into account. Moreover, a discrete event simulation is designed for measuring the performance of the proposed method.

Investigation of pedestrian dynamics in circle antipode experiments: Analysis and model evaluation with macroscopic indexes,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.007,103,2019-06-01,2019,6,"We organized a series of novel circle antipode experiments in which pedestrians are uniformly initialized on the circle and they are required to leave for their antipodal positions simultaneously. In the experiments, a conflicting area is naturally formulated in the center region due to the converged shortest routes, so the practical motion navigation strategies, as well as the conflict avoidance behaviors, can be explored and summarized. Besides, the symmetric experimental conditions of pedestrians, e.g., symmetric starting points, symmetric destination points, and symmetric surroundings, lay the foundation for further quantitative comparisons among participants. In the paper, the pedestrian trajectories are recognized, and the pedestrian dynamics are accordingly investigated from the perspective of macroscopic indexes, i.e., route length, route potential, travel time, velocity and time-series. It is found that the route length has a log-normal distribution, the route potential obeys the exponential distribution, and the travel time is normally distributed as well as the speed. Furthermore, a model evaluation based on the experimental results is performed, using four distribution indexes and two time series indexes in both space and time dimensions. We graded the simulated distribution indexes by applying a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test based method and the simulated time series indexes by a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based method. We evaluated two models: the traditional social force model, the modified model with default parameters and with calibrated parameters. The evaluation results showed that the two models cannot well reproduce the six macroscopic indexes, which indicates that the models do not capture the route choice and conflict avoidance behaviors of pedestrians. Our study is expected to shed light on the pedestrian modeling. Specifically, it indicates that apart from classical indexes such as a fundamental diagram, more comprehensive indexes are needed to evaluate the pedestrian flow models.",0968-090X,Not found

Second, the proposed model strikes a delicate balance between model complexity and accuracy. In contrast to the existing models that view a sensor network as a weighted graph and use graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) to model spatial dependency, we represent a sensor network as an image and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the prediction model. The image is generated by the correlation coefficient between the flow series of sensors, which is different from other CNN based prediction approaches that convert the transportation network into an image by the spatial location of sensors or regions. Compared with the GCNN based model, the CNN based DeepTrend 2.0 can achieve much faster convergence during training, and it guarantees similar prediction quality.

It is shown that the number of conflicts can be significantly reduced by slightly modifying flight plan speeds while not altering the routes, nor the altitudes, both selected by the airspace user. The impact of this resolution strategy in flight efficiency is also analyzed.",0968-090X,Not found
Simulating dynamics of adaptive exit-choice changing in crowd evacuations: Model implementation and behavioural interpretations,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.009,103,2019-06-01,2019,6,"A crucial aspect of simulating crowds’ evacuation processes is that humans can dynamically revisit and change their decisions. While a relatively great deal of attention has been paid by recent studies to modelling directional decision making, the ‘exit decision changing (or decision adaptation)’ phenomenon has been largely overlooked. Here, we quantitatively investigate (I) how important is to include a decision changing module in evacuation simulation models, and (II) whether decision changing is beneficial to evacuation processes. We propose and implement a parsimonious discrete-choice model of decision changing. The model embodies the most influential factors that make an evacuee revise and adapt their choice of exit. This includes the effects of ‘relative queue-size imbalance at exits’, ‘visibility of exits’, ‘social influence’ and ‘inertia (for maintaining initial decisions)’. Results showed that, the inclusion of the decision changing module made a very substantial difference in enhancing the accuracy of the simulation outputs. Simulating exit choices as one-off decisions strictly limited the degree of match that could be achieved between the simulated and experimental outputs (in terms of replicating the observed exit shares and evacuation times) (question I). Further analyses also revealed that an intermediate degree of decision changing is a strategy that most benefits the system. By contrast, the extreme decision-changing strategies (i.e. “no change” and “too many changes”) were found to be suboptimal. Also, while we have observed, in our other studies, that imitative (or the so-called herd-type) behaviour in ‘exit choices’ is invariably detrimental to evacuation systems, here, we observed that when it comes to ‘adapting exit choices’, a moderate degree of imitation (or follow-the-peer) tendency makes the system more efficient (question II).",0968-090X,Not found

Using Internet-based marketplaces to conduct surveys: An application to airline itinerary choice models,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.025,103,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Within the transportation community, there has been increasing interest in using online outsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to conduct surveys. To date, transportation researchers’ use of AMT has been justified based on findings from studies in other fields. That is, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study that has evaluated how the distribution of responses associated with each question and behavioral model estimated from AMT survey data compares to survey data collected from a traditional platform for a travel behavior application. This paper fills an important gap in the literature by examining (1) whether the distributions of responses from AMT and Qualtrics (a traditional market research firm) respondents are statistically equivalent, and (2) whether itinerary choice models estimated from these two surveys are statistically equivalent? Results show that AMT and Qualtrics respondents reported similar air trip characteristics and were drawn from a similar geographic distribution, but they exhibited distinct sociodemographic characteristics. After controlling for different age distributions in the two datasets, we found that airline itinerary choice models estimated from the AMT and Qualtrics survey data produced similar results, with the key difference related to price sensitivities.

A longitudinal scanline based vehicle trajectory reconstruction method for high-angle traffic video,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.015,103,2019-06-01,2019,6,"In this paper, a robust and efficient High-angle Spatial-Temporal Diagram Analysis (HASDA) model is built to reconstruct high-resolution vehicle trajectories from infrastructure traffic surveillance videos. A combined methodology was developed, comprising of scanline-based trajectory extraction and feature-matching coordinate transformation. A scanline-based trajectory extraction technique is introduced to separate vehicle strands from pavement background on the spatial-temporal diagram by considering color features, gradient features, and motion features. Particular cleaning algorithms for removing static object noises, shadows, and occlusions are also established. Feature-matching coordinate transformation converts the pixel coordinates to the real-world coordinates to generate the physical vehicle trajectory. To evaluate the algorithm, generated trajectory results were compared to the reconstructed version of the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset. 15-min NGSIM video was divided into a 5-min dataset for the calibration and the remaining 10-min data for evaluation. Model parameters calibrated based on the 5-min video data are then applied to the 10-min testing data. Two levels of performance measurements are considered to evaluate both trajectory-level and point-level results. A reference algorithm based on mainstream motion-based detection and tracking methods are used as a baseline algorithm. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed method shows promising trajectory detection results, that on average more than 90% of vehicle trajectories are constructed by the proposed methods from the NGSIM videos. The HASDA model outperforms the reference algorithm and shows superior transferability in the training-testing experiment.

Empowered by modern technologies (e.g., GPS devices and smartphone-based APPs), a new generation of free-floating bike-sharing systems has recently become popular. Usage data generated by such systems produce rich information. This study presents a model framework to explore the spatio-temporal usage patterns of free-floating shared bikes using the usage data. The framework includes modules of probability fitting, Random Forest, a cluster-based time-domain analysis, and a visualization toolset. A case study is discussed based on the usage data from Mobike, one of the largest operating bike-sharing systems in Shanghai (China). The daily usage dynamics is modeled using log-normal distributions. Random Forest is adopted to explore the impact of factors on the usage frequency in different districts. It is found that residential area, park & green area, and population size are the top three factors influencing the frequency. Particularly, usage near metro stations is delved using the hierarchical clustering method, resulting in three typical usage modes. Visualization analysis is demonstrated to understand the time-varying flow patterns and the spatial distribution of shared bikes. This study improves our understanding of the usage patterns of this emerging transport mode and provides insights for the promotion and dynamic deployment of the bike-sharing system in urban areas.",0968-090X,Not found
Quasi-vehicle-trajectory-based real-time safety analysis for expressways,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.003,103,2019-06-01,2019,6,"There have been plenty of segment-based real-time safety analyses for expressways or freeways. In these analyses, it was considered that the occurrence of a crash is because of segment conditions, including traffic and geometric. However, the movement of a vehicle is continuous from upstream to downstream. Thus, the crash occurrence of a vehicle might also be because of the traffic conditions along its trajectory. Under this idea, the study on the quasi-vehicle-trajectory-based real-time safety for expressways is proposed. It is hard to directly obtain the trajectory data of the vehicle involved in a crash. Thus, the crash-related vehicle’s trajectory is derived from other traffic data sources, and it is called quasi-trajectory. To find vehicles’ quasi-trajectories, the exact crash time was first identified by observing significant speed drops, and then, the vehicle locations for every one minute was distinguished by using the data from HERE, which provides space-mean speed information. The traffic information along the quasi-trajectories is from the Microwave Vehicle Detection System. A Bayesian matched-case-control logistic regression model was built to explore the impact of traffic parameters along the vehicle quasi-trajectory on real-time crash risk. The results showed that the segment speed difference and segment volume difference along the vehicle quasi-trajectory in the 0–4 min interval before crash occurrence all had a significant positive impact on crash risk. Meanwhile, the truck volume difference and average segment speed in the 0–1 min interval before crashes also have a positive impact on real-time crash likelihood. This study is new in real-time safety analysis and the findings have the potential to be applied to improve the safety of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). A CAV continuously collects the traffic information along with its trajectory and could calculate the crash risk. When the hazardous traffic condition happens, actions can be taken by CAV to prevent the crash occurrence.",0968-090X,Not found
Assess the impacts of different autonomous trucks’ lateral control modes on asphalt pavement performance,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.001,103,2019-06-01,2019,6,"With ongoing massive investment in the field of autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous self-driving vehicles are set to become a reality soon. Despite the benefits in traffic safety and economy, the potential effects of autonomous vehicles, especially autonomous trucks, on transportation infrastructure remain to be determined. In this study, a finite element model was developed based on a typical flexible pavement structure. The effects of autonomous trucks’ lateral distribution within the lane with respect to rutting depth and fatigue damage were estimated by finite element analysis under certain environmental condition. Characteristics of the pavement structure and environmental condition have been collected and presented in this paper. Four possible lateral control modes on managing autonomous trucks’ lateral distribution were proposed, listed as zero-wander mode, uniform mode, double peak Gaussian mode, two-section uniform mode. Considering the difference between autonomous trucks and human-driven trucks, the ratio of autonomous trucks was also evaluated. Based on the simulation results, it has been confirmed that, if controlled appropriately, autonomous trucks could be highly beneficial to asphalt pavements for wider using of pavement. Conversely, if without appropriate lateral control, the effect of autonomous trucks on the typical flexible pavement life could be negative, owing to repeated single point load caused by lane centering and keeping. For example, the uniform mode, double peak Gaussian mode and two-section uniform mode all throw positive effect on the pavement. On the contrary, under the zero wander mode, the time when the rutting depth of the proposed pavement reaches 15 mm (defined as maintenance year) may advance by 1.56 years and fatigue damage at the bottom of asphalt layer increases by 146%. Compared with the normal situation nowadays, the two-section uniform distribution of autonomous trucks, the best performing control mode, delays the maintenance year by 2.3 years. From the aspect of fatigue, a much uniform distribution curve of fatigue within the lane can also be found under this mode. When all trucks’ lateral positions were in control, the two-section uniform mode could reduce the fatigue damage by up to 35% under repeated standard axle load on the flexible pavement. Finally, a framework of dealing with the lateral control was proposed as a reference for different conditions, such as asphalt pavement structures and materials.",0968-090X,Not found

In this problem, we select delivery centers that are accessible for all customers and determine the optimal delivery route that minimizes the costs proportional to the distance traveled by the delivery vehicle, the delivery time, and costs. This is an extension of the traveling salesman problem with a time window constraint, which simultaneously determines the locations of the delivery centers for customer pickup and the delivery route.

Managing such a complex multi-modal system requires a holistic modeling framework of transportation network flow in terms of both passenger flow and vehicular flow. In this paper, we formulate and solve for spatio-temporal passenger and vehicular flows in a general multi-modal network explicitly considering multi-class vehicles, parking facilities, and various travel modes. Vehicular flows, namely cars, trucks, and buses, are integrated into a holistic dynamic network loading (DNL) model. Travel behavior of passenger demand on modes and routes choices is encapsulated by a multi-layer nested logit model. We formulate the multi-modal dynamic user equilibrium (MMDUE) that can be cast into a Variational Inequality (VI) problem. A simple flow solution performed at the origin-destination level and based on the gradient projection is derived from the KKT conditions and shown to efficiently solve for the VI problem on large-scale networks. Numerical experiments are conducted on a multi-modal network in the Pittsburgh region along with sensitivity analysis with respect to demand and management strategies.

With the CLL design, one or multiple left-turn lanes are setup in the opposing through lanes adjacent to the median. The basic idea of the CLL design is to provide additional capacity to left-turning vehicles by making use of the opposing through lanes. The primary objective of the present study was to propose an actuated signal control strategy to improve the operations of the CLL design at signalized intersections. The proposed control strategy introduced an extra stage between the pre-signal and the main signal at the signalized intersection with the CLL design. Two detectors were installed: one at the upstream median opening and the other at the contraflow lane. A procedure was proposed for optimizing the distance between the upstream median opening and the main signal, such that the discharge rate of the left-turning vehicles and the utilization rate of the contraflow lane can be maximized. Simulation experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed actuated control strategy versus the fixed time control strategy.

Traffic signal control by leveraging Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicle platooning capabilities,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.027,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Vehicles equipped with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) have the capability to broadcast their real-time speed and location information via wireless communications. They can also safely operate in multi-vehicle strings while keeping shorter than normal gaps among adjacent vehicles in the high-speed traffic stream. Such capabilities can greatly benefit the management of urban signalized intersections. In this study, we have developed a cooperative signal control algorithm that adopts the CACC datasets and the datasets collected by the traditional fixed traffic sensors to predict the future traffic conditions. The prediction allows the signal controller to assign signal priority to the intersection approach that accommodates the most CACC strings. Such a control strategy can significantly enhance the CACC string operation, which ultimately improves the overall intersection performance. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been tested in a simulated 4-way signalized intersection. The algorithm substantially outperforms the traditional actuated controller as it perceives the traffic flow more comprehensively and assigns the green time resource more efficiently than the traditional controller. Particularly, the average vehicle speed and the average vehicle miles travelled per gallon fuel consumed (MPG) can be increased by more than 10% when the CACC market penetration is 100%. In mixed traffic where CACC fleets frequently interact with manually driven vehicles, the algorithm is found to be more beneficial. The speed and MPG improvement exceed 30% when the CACC market penetration is 40%. The signal control algorithm can bring about significant benefit even when the CACC market penetration is 0%. In this case, it completely relies on the datasets obtained from the traditional traffic sensors. This finding demonstrates the robustness of the algorithm.

A fleet of supply vessels delivers all the necessary equipment and materials to a set of offshore installations from an onshore supply base, according to a delivery schedule or sailing plan. Supply vessels, being the major cost contributor, are chartered on a long-term basis. The planning of supply vessels implies resolving the trade-off between the cost of the delivery schedule and the reliability of deliveries on the scheduled voyages, i.e. the service level. The execution of a sailing plan is affected by stochastic demands at the installations since a high demand fluctuation quite often leads to insufficient vessel capacity to perform a voyage according to the sailing plan. In addition, the average demand level at the installations may change over time, while the number of vessels in the sailing plan remains the same. Maintaining a reliable flow of supplies under stochastic demand therefore leads to additional costs and reduced service level. We present a novel methodology for reliable supply vessel planning and scheduling, enabling planners to construct delivery schedules having a low expected total cost. The methodology involves the construction of delivery schedules with different reliability levels using an adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic algorithm combined with a discrete event simulation procedure for the computation of the expected solution cost.",0968-090X,Not found

An advanced intersection control system is proposed in this study to coordinate vehicle trajectories and ensure safety and operation efficiency at intersections. A temporal-spatial dimension extension-based trajectory coordination model is developed by formulating all possible trajectories of vehicles at the intersection. Correspondingly, according to the trajectory coordination model, two signal-free control algorithms, including the priority-based algorithm and the Discrete Forward-Rolling Optimal Control (DFROC) algorithm are proposed in this study to manage vehicles at the intersection. These two algorithms, together with the FCFS policy, are compared with the conventional signal control method in a SUMO-based simulation platform. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the signal control method in terms of reducing total traffic delays at intersections and increasing intersection capacity and operation efficiency.",0968-090X,Not found
A mixed traffic speed harmonization model with connected autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.005,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Emerging connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) technologies provide an opportunity to the detailed vehicle trajectory control to reduce adverse impacts of stop-and-go traffic imposed by freeway bottlenecks. This study proposes a CAV-based trajectory-smoothing concept to harmonize traffic, improve fuel-efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. The presented algorithm is applicable to mixed-traffic environments with human-driven vehicles (HVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and CAVs. This algorithm controls CAVs so that they smoothly hedge against the backward deceleration waves and gradually merge into the downstream traffic with a reasonable speed. This model addresses the full spectrum of CV and CAV market penetration rates and various traffic conditions. Numerical experiments are performed to assess the algorithm performance with different traffic conditions and CV and CAV market penetration rates. The results show significant improvements in dampening traffic oscillation and reducing fuel consumption and emissions.",0968-090X,Not found
Whereabouts of truckers: An empirical study of predictability,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.020,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This study examines the predictability of a truckload trucker’s whereabouts, using a GPS trajectory data set from about 1000 active users of an on-line freight exchange (OFEX) platform. To describe a trucker’s whereabouts, two different location mapping schemes are proposed. The first divides the entire study area into rectangular grids using a simple geographic rescaling method and treats each grid as a unique location. In the second scheme, a location type (LT) is first assigned to each GPS point, using Point Of Interest (POI) information. Then, each GPS trajectory is converted to a trajectory of LT data. We then process both types of trajectory data, grid-based and type-based, to develop various entropy and predictability measures. We find that the whereabouts of truckers possess strong regularity, but are substantially more difficult to predict than that of an average person. Specifically, the predictability of truckers’ next location on the grid map peaks at 83%, about 10% percentage point lower than that reported in the literature. Surprisingly, predicting the type of the location that a typical trucker may visit the next is even more difficult, with a predictability around 81%. Findings from this study could help guide the development of algorithms for predicting truckers’ next visit location and the type of the location.",0968-090X,Not found
Combined alignment effects on deceleration and acceleration: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.027,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Excessive longitudinal deceleration and acceleration reduce driving comfort and increase safety risk. There is a dearth of research, however, on how geometric design characteristics, especially complex alignments and their adjacent segments, affect deceleration and acceleration. The Tongji University driving simulator was used to collect vehicle operation data. Deceleration and acceleration values were measured and classified as deceleration, near-cruising and acceleration. A random parameter multinomial logistic regression model was used to reflect the relationships between drivers’ deceleration and acceleration and the geometric alignments of a mountainous freeway. Vehicle speed was treated as a random slope parameter to account for the heterogeneity among subjects. Model results showed deceleration and acceleration were significantly influenced by the fixed effects of maximum curvature in the following 50 m, difference between maximum and minimum slope in the preceding 100 m, maximum slope change in the following 400 m, and maximum curvature in the preceding 50 m.

Road grade estimates for bicycle travel analysis on a street network,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.004,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Road grade is a major factor influencing walking and cycling speed, energy expenditure, and travel behaviour. Bicycling research and commercial travel applications typically use digital elevation models to estimate road grades. The goal of this research is to determine the best methods of obtaining road grade data for bicycle travel analysis on an urban street network. Multiple elevation data sources are collected for eight sample locations in the city of Vancouver, Canada. Road grade extraction algorithms are applied and compared to precise ground surveying data. Estimates of cycling power and energy are used to assess the road grade accuracy in a specific analytical context. Road grades on all 35 elevated roadways of at least 30 m in the city are also characterized and classified into 3 modalities of road grade distribution. Results show that road elevations and grades extracted from raw Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data are the most accurate where directly measured grades are unavailable. Interpolation of digital elevation models (DEM) and digital surface models (DSM) can provide adequate grade estimates on non-elevated roads, but are highly inaccurate on elevated structures, leading to substantial errors in cycling power and energy estimates. Short elevated network links (under 100 m) often have unimodal grade distributions which can be approximated with straight-line elevation profiles, but longer elevated structures (such as arched spans) have more grade variability. Recommendations are made for estimating grades on a network with and without LIDAR data, with the caveat that propagation of errors in grade data should be considered in walking and cycling analysis.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamics of social groups’ decision-making in evacuations,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.029,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The possible presence of social groups amongst occupants in indoor evacuation scenarios and the potential discrepancies between their behaviour and that of single individuals have been acknowledged in the evacuation dynamics literature. Yet, empirical studies on the behavioural characteristics of social-group evacuees, particularly those related to their decision-making mechanism, are relatively underrepresented. This study reports on a lab-in-the-field experiment of evacuations that investigates the effect of group size and stress level on multiple aspects of groups’ behaviour. These aspects include pre-movement time, decision time (i.e. time taken to reach a directional exit decision), exit-choice behaviour, exit-choice changing and intra-group decision dynamics. Our main findings showed that: (I) Group size had a significant effect on pre-movement times and decision times (and to lesser extent, on evacuation times). People took longer to initiate their movement or to make a directional exit decision when in groups compared to when acting alone. The influence of group size on pre-movement and decision times, however, was not monotonic. For smaller group sizes (sizes 2 and 3), pre-movement and decision times increased with the group size. But for the larger group size (size 4), the effect was reversed. (II) The exit-choice mechanism of groups, overall, showed a great degree of similarity to that of single individuals. This suggests that, from a modelling perspective, the directional exit choices of groups could be approximated with the models obtained from datasets of individually-made choices. (III) Groups were more likely to revisit and change their initial exit decisions under the higher level of stress. In addition, social influence was a major factor in triggering changes in the exit choices of groups. Nearly 50% of the changes in group decisions occurred shortly after another neighbour group changed its exit decision. In other words, instances of group decision-changing was often followed by another group taking a similar action. (IV) As to the within-group dynamics of decision-making, our analyses suggested that, regardless of the group size, leadership was the dominant group decision-making mechanism (compared to the consensus or the conform-to-majority mechanisms). In nearly 50% of the cases, group decisions were made by one individual taking the lead and hinting the direction of the movement to other members of the group.",0968-090X,Not found
Two-stage stochastic approximation for dynamic rebalancing of shared mobility systems,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.021,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Mobility systems featuring shared vehicles are often unable to serve all potential customers, as the distribution of demand does not coincide with the positions of vehicles at any given time. System operators often choose to reposition these shared vehicles (such as bikes, cars, or scooters) actively during the course of the day to improve service rate. They face a complex dynamic optimization problem in which many integer-valued decisions must be made, using real-time state and forecast information, and within the tight computation time constraints inherent to real-time decision-making. We first present a novel nested-flow formulation of the problem, and demonstrate that its linear relaxation is significantly tighter than one from existing literature. We then adapt a two-stage stochastic approximation scheme from the generic SPAR algorithm due to Powell et al., in which rebalancing plans are optimized against a value function representing the expected cost (in terms of fulfilled and unfulfilled customer demand) of the future evolution of the system. The true value function is approximated by a separable function of contributions due to the rebalancing actions carried out at each station and each time step of the planning horizon. The new algorithm requires surprisingly few iterations to yield high-quality solutions, and is suited to real-time use as it can be terminated early if required. We provide insight into this good performance by examining the mathematical properties of our new flow formulation, and perform rigorous tests on standardized benchmark networks to explore the effect of system size. We then use data from Philadelphia’s public bike sharing scheme to demonstrate that the approach also yields performance gains for real systems.",0968-090X,Not found
Traffic state estimation and its sensitivity utilizing measurements from the opposite lane,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.016,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This study proposes a method that estimates traffic states using measurements from a vehicle running on the opposite lane in addition to probe vehicle data and examine the sensitivity of the estimates in relation to variabilities of the input data and measurements. A number of studies on traffic state estimation fusing several sensing data have been reported. Most of the studies use data from traffic detectors installed at fixed locations and data from moving objects such as probe vehicles. Traffic detectors provide valuable volume information of all running vehicles which cannot be observed from sample moving objects. However, in local areas in Japan as well as in Asian cities, detector installations are very much limited like one in every 10 to 15 km on a motorway in our country. This study therefore attempts to utilize measurements from a vehicle running on the opposite lane instead of detector measurements, since a vehicle on the opposite lane running backward can in principle measure counts of passing vehicles running forward. In this study, we employ the variational theory to estimate the traffic states utilizing the count measurement from the opposite lane in addition to probe vehicle data on the forward direction and examine the sensitivity of the estimates in relation to variabilities of the input data and measurements. The validation finds that the proposed method can estimate traffic states more accurately than one using only probe vehicle data. Especially, this method has the advantage in quickly responding unexpected incidences such as accidents and vehicle malfunctions.",0968-090X,Not found
Quantifying privacy vulnerability of individual mobility traces: A case study of license plate recognition data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.022,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Emerging smart transportation applications are calling for publishing and sharing individual-based mobility trace data sets to researchers and practitioners; in the meanwhile, however, privacy issues have become a major concern given that true identities of individuals can be easily revealed from these data sets. Data synthesis In this paper, we quantitatively measure the risk of privacy disclosure in mobility trace data set caused by re-identification attacks based on the concept of k-anonymity. Using a one-month license plate recognition (LPR) data set collected in Guangzhou, China, we examine a variety of factors determining the degree of anonymity of an individual, including the temporal granularity and the size of the published data, local v.s. non-local vehicles, and continuous v.s. non-continuous observations. We find that five spatiotemporal records are enough to uniquely identify about 90% of individuals, even when the temporal granularity is set to be half a day. To publish LPR data without compromising privacy, we propose a suppression solution and a generalization solution and quantify the privacy-and-utility trade-off of them. Our results show that the suppression solution, which removes sensitive records, have a notable performance on privacy protection. The average individual anonymity identified by three spatiotemporal records increases by more than 20% at the cost of losing less than 8% of the data. We also propose a bintree-based adaptive time interval cloaking algorithm as a generalization solution. To meet a specific anonymity constraint, this algorithm adjusts the temporal resolution adaptively based on traffic counts under the principle of minimal information loss. We find that the generalization algorithm performs extremely well in satisfying different user-specified anonymity constraints and it is more flexible and reliable than the traditional uniform time interval cloaking method. We also find a strong correlation between the resulting temporal accuracy of data anonymized by the algorithm and the traffic condition. This study serves as a reminder to relevant agencies and data owners about the privacy vulnerability in individual-based mobility trace data sets and provides methodological guidance when publishing and sharing such sensitive data set.",0968-090X,Not found
Missing traffic data imputation and pattern discovery with a Bayesian augmented tensor factorization model,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.003,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Spatiotemporal traffic data, which represent multidimensional time series on considering different spatial locations, are ubiquitous in real-world transportation systems. However, the inevitable missing data problem makes data-driven intelligent transportation systems suffer from an incorrect response. Therefore, imputing missing values is of great importance but challenging as it is not easy to capture spatiotemporal traffic patterns, including explicit and latent features. In this study, we propose an augmented tensor factorization model by incorporating generic forms of domain knowledge from transportation systems. Specifically, we present a fully Bayesian framework for automatically learning parameters of this model using variational Bayes (VB). Relying on the publicly available urban traffic speed data set collected in Guangzhou, China, experiments on two types of missing data scenarios (i.e., random and non-random) demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian augmented tensor factorization (BATF) model achieves best imputation accuracies and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Bayesian tensor factorization models). Besides, we discover interpretable patterns from the experimentally learned global parameter, biases, and latent factors that indeed conform to the dynamic of traffic states.",0968-090X,Not found

We model the traffic flow of 140 traffic links in a sub-network of the Minneapolis-St. Paul highway system for both rush hour and non-rush hour time intervals, and validate the extracted network weight matrix. The results of the modeling indicate: (1) the spatial weight matrix is unstable over time-of-day, while the network weight matrix is robust in all cases and (2) the performance of the network weight matrix in non-rush hour traffic regimes is significantly better than rush hour traffic regimes. The results of the validation show the network weight matrix outperforms the traditional way of capturing spatial dependency between traffic links. Averaging over all traffic links and time, this superiority is about 13.2% in rush hour and 15.3% in non-rush hour, when only the first-order neighboring links are embedded in modeling. In addition, this study proposes a two-step algorithm to search and identify the best look-back time window for upstream links.

Traffic parameters estimation for signalized intersections based on combined shockwave analysis and Bayesian Network,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.023,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper proposes a framework to combine shockwave analysis (SA) with Bayesian Network (BN) for traffic flow parameters estimation at signalized intersections using vehicle trajectory data. Traffic SA is applied as the basis to derive the analytical expression of individual vehicle trajectory given the fundamental diagram (FD) parameters (e.g., capacity, jam density, free flow speed) as well as the traffic volume. According to SA, the analytical probability distribution of each vehicle’s travel time (defined as the time of a vehicle travelling between an upstream and a downstream location at a signalized intersection) is derived. This probability distribution is parameterized by traffic volume and FD parameters. We then apply a three-layer BN model to construct the relationship between traffic volume, FD parameters, sampled vehicles’ arrival times and intersection travel times. Since traffic volume cannot be measured directly from sampled vehicle trajectories, an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced to perform learning for estimating the cycle-by-cycle volume (or arrivals) and FD parameters. Such estimated parameters are then used, via SA, to estimate vehicles’ intersection travel times. The proposed combined SA-BN model is evaluated using microscopic traffic simulation data and the NGSIM dataset. Sensitivity analysis of the estimation performance with respect to penetration rates is conducted. In general, the proposed method yields promising estimation accuracy, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the estimation bounded by 15%, generally around 5%, as compared with the true value, even under low penetration rates.",0968-090X,Not found
A real-time vehicle-specific eco-routing model for on-board navigation applications capturing transient vehicle behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.017,104,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The paper develops a real-time vehicle-specific eco-routing model for use in on-board navigation systems for both conventional fuel- and battery-powered electric vehicles. The model uses a novel link cost function that retains all microscopic transient behavior along a link by capturing within-link speed, acceleration, and road grade variations. Specifically, eight vehicle-agnostic link-specific variables are transmitted to the cloud and fused with information received from other connected vehicles. The fused data are then sent back to the connected vehicles and used to compute vehicle-specific eco-routes (edge computing). The solution produces an energy-efficient dynamic user-equilibrium traffic assignment that is solved incrementally. A numerical experiment is first designed to test the model, demonstrating the benefits associated with vehicle-specific eco-routes compared to those produced by traditional models. The model is then implemented in a micro-simulation framework to evaluate the network-wide impacts of the proposed energy-efficient user-optimum incremental traffic assignment for different traffic demand levels. Results demonstrate that the proposed model produces lower network-wide energy consumption levels compared to traditional energy-efficient and travel time user-optimum traffic assignment methods for both conventional fuel and electric vehicles. Conventional fuel savings relative to travel time routing decrease with increasing traffic demand levels, while electric power savings do not vary monotonically with congestion levels. Energy savings relative to traditional eco-routing are also demonstrated to not vary monotonically with demand levels. Results of the study also demonstrate that the transportation network layout significantly affects the eco-routing system performance. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model in real-world applications is discussed and presented.",0968-090X,Not found
Early warning of burst passenger flow in public transportation system,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.022,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Burst passenger flow in the public transportation system is serious to public safety. Existing works mainly focused on prediction and monitoring of regular passenger flow, which are not suitable for burst passenger flow. In this article, we first formulate the problem as early warning of burst passenger flow. Next, we design a novel framework to solve this problem by our observation that a burst passenger in-flow usually comes after an abnormal passenger out-flow for a subway station, especially when there is a large-scale social crowd event. Our framework consists of two models: (1) Abnormal out-flow detection (AOFD) which detects abnormal out-flows and warns the city administration of the burst in-flow fairly ahead of time. (2) Burst in-flow peak estimation (BIFPE) which estimates burst in-flow peak time and volume. We evaluate our framework with real-world smartcard data of the largest city in China and use large-scale social crowd event data to further explain our model. The result shows that: (1) AOFD can detect abnormal out-flows that would later result in bursts in-flows with better performance and can send warning signal ahead of the time of burst passenger in-flow. (2) BIFPE can effectively estimate the peak time of burst in-flow and can reduce peak volume estimation error compared with the traditional passenger flow prediction models.",0968-090X,Not found
Langevin method for a continuous stochastic car-following model and its stability conditions,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.005,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"In car-following models, the driver reacts according to his physical and psychological abilities which may change over time. However, most car-following models are deterministic and do not capture the stochastic nature of human perception. It is expected that purely deterministic traffic models may produce unrealistic results due to the stochastic driving behaviors of drivers. This paper is devoted to the development of a distinct car-following model where a stochastic process is adopted to describe the time-varying random acceleration which essentially reflects the random individual perception of driver behavior with respect to the leading vehicle over time. In particular, we apply coupled Langevin equations to model complex human driver behavior. In the proposed model, an extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) stochastic process will be used to describe the stochastic speed of the follower in response to the stimulus of the leader. An important property of the extended CIR process is to enhance the non-negative properties of the stochastic traffic variables (e.g. non-negative speed) for any arbitrary model parameters. Based on stochastic process theories, we derive stochastic linear stability conditions which, for the first time, theoretically capture the effect of the random parameter on traffic instabilities. Our stability results conform to the empirical results that the traffic instability is related to the stochastic nature of traffic flow at the low speed conditions, even when traffic is deemed to be stable from deterministic models.",0968-090X,Not found
Airway network management using Braess's Paradox,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.014,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The ever increasing demand for air travel is likely to induce air traffic congestion which will elicit great economic losses. In the presence of limited airspace capacity as well as the saturated airway network, it is no longer practicable to mitigate air traffic congestion by adding new airways/links. In this paper, we provide a “counter-intuitive” perspective towards air traffic congestion mitigation by removing airways/links from a given airway network. We draw inspiration from Braess’s Paradox which suggests that adding extra links to a congested traffic network could make the traffic more congested. The paper explores whether Braess’s Paradox occurs in airway networks, or more specifically, whether it is possible to better distribute the flow in an airway network by merely removing some of its airways/links. In this paper, We develop a method for Braess’s Paradox detection in any given airway network. To validate the efficacy of the method, a case study is conducted for the South-East Asia airspace covering Singapore airway network, by using 6 months of ADS-B data. The results show that Braess’s Paradox does occur in airway networks and the proposed method can successfully identify the airway network links that may cause it. The results also demonstrate that, upon removing such links, the total travel time for a given day traffic at a given flight level, was reduced from 8661.15 min to 8328.64 min, a reduction of 332.5 min.

This allows vehicles to engage in transactions where gaps in traffic are created in exchange for monetary compensation. The proposed approach is best suited to discretionary lane change maneuvers. We formulate gains in travel time, referred to as time differences, that result from achieving higher speeds. These time differences, coupled with value of time, are used to formulate a utility function, where utility is transferable. We also allow for games between connected vehicles that do not involve transfer of utility. We apply Nash bargaining theory to solve the latter. A cellular automaton is developed and utilized to perform simulation experiments that explore the impact of such transactions on traffic conditions (travel-time savings, resulting speed-density relations and shock wave formation) and the benefit to vehicles. The results show that lane changing with transferable utility between drivers can help achieve win-win results, improve both individual and social benefits without resulting in any adverse effects on traffic characteristics in general and, in fact, result in slight improvement at traffic densities outside of free-flow and (bumper-to-bumper) jammed traffic.",0968-090X,Not found

Knowing arrival times of public vehicles in advance can reduce waiting times of passengers and attract more people to take public transport. Existing approaches have two main limitations in the field of bus travel time prediction. First, influenced by increasingly complex real-time traffic factors and sparsity of real-time data, bus travel times can be difficult to predict accurately in modern cities. Second, bus dwelling and transit times are predominantly affected by different factors and hence have different patterns, but little research focuses on how to divide dwelling and transit areas and to build independent models for them. Consequently, we propose a novel segment-based approach to predict bus travel times using a combination of real-time taxi and bus datasets, that can automatically divide bus routes into dwelling and transit segments. Two models are built to predict them separately by incorporating different impact traffic factors.

Understanding the benefits and limitations of occupancy information systems for couriers,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.013,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Couriers undertaking deliveries in Central Business Districts (CBDs) often have difficulty conducting efficient routes due to the uncertainty associated with the availability of loading zones. Delivery routes for courier vehicles operating in central city areas involve a combination of driving and walking paths for delivering goods to multiple receivers. Sensor technologies are becoming available that can provide real time information regarding the availability and occupancy of loading zones. Utilization of occupancy information can reduce transport costs for couriers as well as emissions and congestion levels within CBDs. Booking systems allow loading zones to be reserved for delivery vehicles. This paper describes an agent-based simulation model combined with optimization procedures developed to predict the behavior of courier drivers in CBDs. The model, which allows couriers routes to be optimized based on minimizing both driving and walking costs, was applied to study the effects for introducing a loading zone occupancy information as well as estimate the potential limitations compared to a reservation system. The consequences of permitting waiting at loading zones as well as duration limits are predicted. Lower driving times were estimated when real time availability and average occupancy information of loading zones were provided when no waiting was permitted. This was found to be more pronounced when there were no duration limits at loading zones. However, when waiting at loading zones was permitted, only marginal driving time savings were predicted when real time availability and average occupancy information were provided. Despite that, compared to the case when an ideal reservation system was employed for couriers to conduct the best possible delivery plan, the information systems still had opportunities for further enhancements in driving times in periods of high demand, although only marginal savings in driving times could be made when waiting at loading zones was allowed.",0968-090X,Not found
Analysis of train derailment severity using vine copula quantile regression modeling,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.015,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Although there is a low frequency of train derailments, they have been a major concern due to their high consequences justifying the need to critically examine the severity of train derailments. Derailments may result in injury, loss of life and property, interruption of services and damage of the environment. Most derailment severity models have utilized point estimation approaches which focus on the central tendency of derailment severity outcomes. However, this approach is not reliable given the high variation in derailment severity. Thus, it is imperative to take into consideration the entire severity distribution by examining other statistics including conditional quantiles. Furthermore, derailment data has been found to exhibit tail dependence, skewness and non-normality of the marginal distributions and joint distribution of the variables. Therefore, it is not appropriate to examine their interrelationships using conventional correlation analysis. For these reasons, this paper employs vine copula quantile regression model, an interval estimation approach, to predict conditional mean and quantiles of derailment severity outcomes. This novel methodology automatically tackles prominent issues in classical quantile regression including quantile crossing at various levels and interactions between covariates. Vine copulas, which are multivariate copulas constructed hierarchically from bivariate copulas as building blocks, permit the modeling of the complex dependences between the variables. The vine copula quantile regression model was found to offer better accuracy for analyzing derailment severity at various confidence levels compared to the classical quantile regression approach.

Contrary to expectations, perceived risk positively moderates the effect of perceived value on consumers’ ride-sharing intention. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of consumers’ value perception and risk perception on their acceptance of internet-based ride-sharing services.

We propose a novel two-layer framework, where each layer captures the tasks of one of the processes within the operational level. Discrete choice theory is proposed to model each layer.

Optimization-based operations control for public transportation service with transfers,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.011,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This research develops a real-time simulation-based control framework that attempts to coordinate the operations of public transportation services to allow smoother transfers and to maintain service regularity. The control actions, which include holding and change speed, are set as the solution of an optimization problem with the objective to minimize total passengers’ time in the system within a prediction horizon. The prediction horizon is defined by a number of downstream stops and subsequent buses. The predictions made include the arrival and departure times of vehicles at downstream stops and the passenger demands they are expected to serve. The model is demonstrated with a case study of three lines of the BRT system in Haifa, Israel. The results show that the model outperforms headway control and no-control alternatives in terms of total passengers’ time and on-time performance. It is only slightly worst then the headway control in terms of waiting times and denied boarding at stops. The combination of holding and change speed actions provides substantially better results than each of them individually.",0968-090X,Not found
Heterogeneity aware urban traffic control in a connected vehicle environment: A joint framework for congestion pricing and perimeter control,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.007,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Real-time control of large-scale urban networks has been attracting significant research attention. This paper, using the information provided by connected vehicles, proposes a novel control approach based on the concept of perimeter control to maximize the social welfare of all vehicles. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we consider vehicle heterogeneity (i.e. corresponding to different transportation modes, or with different occupancies, values of time, priority levels, etc.) and integrate a priority scheme into perimeter control to improve both the traffic performance and the social welfare. This is achieved by installing priority lanes at some of the perimeter intersections. Unlike the existing research works that provide priority to certain traffic modes, we dynamically identify the groups of vehicles that we should prioritize, in order to maximize the social welfare. Second, we develop a model predictive control approach to simultaneously optimize the toll for using the priority lanes and the traffic signal timings at the perimeter intersections. This approach can explicitly handle the constraint of the storage capacity of each intersection link. Third, we propose a recursive estimation algorithm to update our knowledge on the distribution of the value of times (VOTs), using the lane choice information of connected vehicles. The proposed approach is tested in a simulated network which resembles the main features of the city center of Zurich, Switzerland. By using the proposed strategy, the traffic accumulation inside the network is still stabilized, and the monetary costs due to delay are significantly reduced at the entire network (up to 25.8%) compared to the strategy without priority. The distribution of the combined cost (including cost due to delay and tolls) is more uniform across VOT groups than that resulting from the strategy without priority. It is also shown that the proposed recursive estimation algorithm quickly converges and further improves the social welfare.",0968-090X,Not found
Surrogate-based simulation optimization approach for day-to-day dynamics model calibration with real data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.009,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper investigates the day-to-day dynamics model from the perspective of travelers’ actual route choice behaviors, and calibrates and validates the route-based day-to-day dynamics model with the real-world license plate recognition (LPR) data. Due to the highly nonlinear and multi-modal response function in the calibration of the optimization problem, traditional gradient-based nonlinear regression algorithms or other analytical optimization approaches are inapplicable to deal with the calibration work. In this paper, a surrogate-based simulation optimization approach is proposed to deal with the expensive-to-evaluate response function in the day-to-day dynamics calibration work. More specifically, the kriging metamodel is adopted to surrogate the optimization function of the calibration process. With this meta-modeling approach, a sound solution can be achieved with only a few sampling points in a comfortably afforded computation burden, thus giving a valid estimation of the parameters in the day-to-day dynamics model. Finally, a case study based on the real-world LPR data is conducted to validate the proposed model and calibration method.",0968-090X,Not found
Corridor level cooperative trajectory optimization with connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.002,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Trajectory planning for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has been studied at both isolated intersections and multiple intersections under the fully CAV environment in the literature. However, most of the existing studies only model limited interactions of vehicle trajectories at the microscopic level, without considering the coordination between vehicle trajectories. This study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to cooperatively optimize the trajectories of CAVs along a corridor for system optimality. The car-following and lane-changing behaviors of each vehicle along the entire path are optimized together. The trajectories of all vehicles along the corridor are coordinated for system optimality in terms of total vehicle delay. All vehicle movements (i.e., left-turning, through, and right-turning) are considered at each intersection. The ingress lanes are not associated with any specific movement and can be used for all vehicle movements, which provides much more flexibility. Vehicles are controlled to pass through intersections without traffic signals. Due to varying traffic conditions, the planning horizon is adaptively adjusted in the implementation procedure of the proposed model to find a balance between solution feasibility and computational burden. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed CAV-based control over the coordinated fixed-time control at different demand levels in terms of vehicle delay and throughput. The analyses of the safety time gaps for collision avoidance within intersection areas show the promising benefits of traffic management under the fully CAV environment.",0968-090X,Not found
Electrifying urban ridesourcing fleets at no added cost through efficient use of charging infrastructure,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.041,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Ridesourcing fleets present an opportunity for rapid uptake of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) but adoption has largely been limited to small pilot projects. Lack of charging infrastructure presents a major barrier to scaling up, but little public information exists on the infrastructure needed to support ridesourcing electrification. With data on ridesourcing trips for New York City and San Francisco, and using agent-based simulations of BEV fleets, we show that given a sparse network of three to four 50 kW chargers per square mile, BEVs can provide the same level of service as internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) at lower cost. This suggests that the cost of charging infrastructure is not a significant barrier to ridesourcing electrification. With coordinated use of charging infrastructure across vehicles, we also find that fleet performance becomes robust to variation in battery range and placement of chargers. Our analysis suggests that mandates on ridesourcing such as the California Clean Miles Standard could achieve electrification without significantly increasing the cost of ridesourcing services.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated condition-based track maintenance planning and crew scheduling of railway networks,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.045,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"We develop a multi-level decision making approach for optimal condition-based maintenance planning of a railway network divided into a large number of sections with independent stochastic deterioration dynamics. At higher level, a chance-constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller determines the long-term section-wise maintenance plan, minimizing condition deterioration and maintenance costs for a finite planning horizon, while ensuring that the deterioration level of each section stays below the maintenance threshold with a given probabilistic guarantee in the presence of parameter uncertainty. The resulting large MPC optimization problem containing both continuous and discrete decision variables is solved using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to improve the scalability of the proposed approach. At a lower level, the optimal short-term scheduling of the maintenance interventions suggested by the high-level controller and the optimal routing of the corresponding maintenance crew is formulated as a capacitated arc routing problem, which is solved exactly by transforming it into a node routing problem. The proposed approach is illustrated by a numerical case study on the optimal treatment of squats of a regional Dutch railway network.

Estimating the impacts of transit signal priority on intersection operations: A moving bottleneck approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.003,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is a commonly used strategy to improve bus operations at signalized intersections. However, the impacts of TSP in mixed traffic environments has not been analytically studied. This is a challenging problem since car queues can slow down buses, while slow-moving buses can create bottlenecks for cars in mixed traffic. Furthermore, it is typically assumed that TSP is activated using bus information obtained from a fixed detector. The benefits of TSP to buses could be improved by using information from connected buses or even connected cars. To tackle these challenges, this paper models buses as moving bottlenecks, incorporating it into a kinematic wave theory (KWT) model. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is developed to evaluate the changes in delays to buses and cars caused by TSP using KWT and queuing theories considering the bus as a moving bottleneck. The proposed algorithm is utilized for sensitivity tests to determine the changes to car and bus delays as a result of TSP implementation as a function of the bus detector location, bus stop location and dwell duration, the existence of a downstream bottleneck, and bus detection technology. The detector location sensitivity analysis reveals that there exists an optimal (and different) bus detector location associated with each demand. The bus stop location and bus dwell duration sensitivity tests show that TSP implementation can reduce system-wide (i.e., total car and bus) delays. However, in general, it is found that the presence of a downstream bottleneck can diminish the benefits of providing TSP. Finally, different bus detection technologies are tested to quantify the benefits of using connected buses or connected cars for TSP provision in terms of car and bus delay savings. As a result of this test, it is found that connected cars can significantly improve both car and bus delays if used for TSP provision.",0968-090X,Not found
Multistep speed prediction on traffic networks: A deep learning approach considering spatio-temporal dependencies,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.039,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Multistep traffic forecasting on road networks is a crucial task in successful intelligent transportation system applications. To capture the complex non-stationary temporal dynamics and spatial correlations in multistep traffic-condition prediction, we propose a novel deep learning framework named attention graph convolutional sequence-to-sequence model (AGC-Seq2Seq). In the proposed deep learning framework, spatial and temporal dependencies are modeled through the Seq2Seq model and graph convolution network separately, and the attention mechanism along with a newly designed training method based on the Seq2Seq architecture is proposed to overcome the difficulty in multistep prediction and further capture the temporal heterogeneity of traffic pattern. We conduct numerical tests to compare AGC-Seq2Seq with other benchmark models using two real-world datasets. The results indicate that our model yields the best prediction performance in terms of various prediction error measures. Furthermore, the variations of spatio-temporal correlations of traffic conditions under different perdition steps and road segments are revealed.",0968-090X,Not found
More efficient formulations and valid inequalities for the Green Vehicle Routing Problem,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.040,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The Green Vehicle Routing Problem (G-VRP) aims to efficiently route a fleet of Alternative Fuel Vehicles, based at a common depot, in order to serve a set of customers, minimizing the total travel distance. Because of the limited driving range of these vehicles, intermediate stops at the Alternative Fuel Stations must also be considered. For the G-VRP, we propose two Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulations allowing multiple visits to the stations without introducing dummy copies of them. In the first model, only one visit to a station between two customers or between a customer and the depot is allowed. While, in the second model, two consecutive visits to stations are also permitted. In addition, the two formulations are strengthened through both dominance criteria to a priori identify the stations that are more efficient to use in each route and valid inequalities, specifically tailored for the G-VRP. Computational results, carried out on benchmark instances, show that our formulations strongly outperform the exact solution approaches presented in the literature. Finally, in order to better investigate the issue of the consecutive refueling stops, a new set of instances is properly generated and significant transport insights are also provided.",0968-090X,Not found
Review of maritime traffic models from vessel behavior modeling perspective,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.004,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The importance of maritime transport keeps increasing with the trade globalization. With the growing demand for waterborne transport, vessel traffic flows are also expected to increase. This paper reviews maritime traffic models from the vessel behavior modeling perspective. The maritime traffic models include the models for vessel traffic both at sea and in confined water area. The aim of this paper is to analyze the underlying modeling paradigms and to assess the extent in which maritime traffic models can represent vessel behavior. Focusing on vessel behavior modeling, this paper provides a broad overview of the current literature on maritime traffic models of the last decades. The commercial models are not included due to the limit of information. To compare the capabilities of models in capturing the vessel behavior characteristics, the considered models are assessed from different aspects of vessel behavior representation, external impact modeling, and model applicability. The assessment shows that none of the existing models describe all dynamic kinetic information in detail for different vessels and consider the impacts from a full range of external factors, which is possibly due to the specific purpose when the models were developed. The models developed for specific vessels in specific situations ignore the irrespective behavioral details in other possible scenarios. Models without proper calibration and validation limit the applicability in other cases. It also indicates that few models can accurately simulate the different vessel behavior at a microscopic level. To investigate the possible potential and limitations, the models have been assessed and discussed to indicate the underlying modeling paradigms based on the modeling characteristics. Future developments can focus on the behavior of different vessels in different types of water areas and the corresponding impacts from external conditions (e.g. visibility, wind, current), vessel encounters and traffic rules. Through calibration and validation, future models should be able to fit the vessel behavior in real-life situations.",0968-090X,Not found
A machine learning based personalized system for driving state recognition,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.042,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Reliable driving state recognition (e.g. normal, drowsy, and aggressive) plays a significant role in improving road safety, driving experience and fuel efficiency. It lays the foundation for a number of advanced functions such as driver safety monitoring systems and adaptive driving assistance systems. In these applications, state recognition accuracy is of paramount importance to guarantee user acceptance. This paper is mainly focused on developing a personalized driving state recognition system by learning from non-intrusive, easily accessible vehicle related measurements and its validation using real-world driving data. Compared to conventional approaches, this paper first highlights the necessities of adopting a personalized system by analysing feature distribution of individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data via advanced data visualization and statistical analysis. If significant differences are identified, a dedicated personalized model is learnt to predict the driver’s driving state. Spearman distance is also drawn to evaluate the differences between individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data in a quantitative manner. In addition, five categories of classifiers are tested and compared to identify a suitable one for classification, where random forest with Bayesian parameter optimization outperforms others and therefore is adopted in this paper. A recently collected dataset from real-world driving experiments is adopted to evaluate the proposed system. Comparative experimental results indicate that the personalized learning system with road information significantly outperforms conventional approaches without considering personalized characteristics or road information, where the overall accuracy increases from 81.3% to 91.6%. It is believed that the newly developed personalized learning system can find a wide range of applications where diverse behaviours exist.",0968-090X,Not found
Driven by change: Commercial drivers' acceptance and efficiency perceptions of light-duty electric vehicle usage in Germany,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.017,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"By conducting a cross-sectional survey at Deutsche Post, a major German postal delivery service provider, we examine to what extent commercial drivers accept the substitution of conventional cars with light-duty e-vehicles (LDEVs). Specifically, we explore drivers’ acceptance from two perspectives. First, we investigate drivers’ perceived satisfaction with LDEVs compared to conventional vehicles. Second, we question whether electric cars in general increase drivers’ perceived efficiency of them. Combining these two perspectives, we show that the greater the drivers’ overall perceived satisfaction with LDEVs is, the higher is the drivers’ perceived efficiency of LDEVs. We prove this by means of perceived usefulness (perceived relative advantage) and perceived ease of use (the opposite of perceived complexity) of LDEVs, using adaptations of Davis’ Technology Acceptance Model and Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory to form our Unified Technology Acceptance Model (UTAM). Our findings suggest that, on average, drivers are slightly more satisfied with the LDEVs than with the available conventional cars (n = 66). If drivers were able to choose their preferred vehicles, the majority of them would favor LDEVs. We detect statistically significant patterns of latent measures affecting perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of LDEVs. Although this paper focuses on German delivery service employees, the methodology presented here could easily be applied to any other enterprise in the growing logistics segment which plans to electrify its car fleet. Hence, our contributions are valuable for transportation research and, more specifically, to all potential commercial EV drivers, e.g., our insights might be relevant for the approx. 500,400 drivers employed in the German logistics sector alone.",0968-090X,Not found

The basic idea is to predict the traffic state in the merging area regularly and find the feasible merging time window. Proper advice can be presented to freight train drivers and help them to merge smoothly, by comparing the freight train movement to the feasible merging window.

Investigating secondary pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections using vision-based trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.001,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Vision-based trajectory data provides great details for investigating microscopic behavior and road safety at the level of interactions. Most studies investigating pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections have focused on interactions at the crosswalk on the same approach where the vehicle is coming from, which are referred to as primary interactions in this study. However, secondary interactions, defined as interactions between vehicles exiting the intersection and crossing pedestrians, have not been adequately studied. Second interactions can pose more dangers to pedestrians due to the driver’s unclear knowledge of right-of-way, acceleration attempts to recover the speed, and the complex situation the driver faces in the intersection. This paper aims at studying the safety issue of secondary pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections. For that purpose, a methodology is proposed based on surrogate measures of safety and behavioral measures derived from vision-based trajectories. This methodology is implemented through a case study involving ten all-way stop intersections from Montreal, Canada. Road user trajectory data are automatically extracted from the videos. Different measures are used in the study: from the interaction analysis that determines vehicle-pedestrian interactions based on a Distance-Velocity (DV) model, average crossing speeds and vehicle approaching behaviors in terms of speed and acceleration. Computer tools are developed to extract these measures from the trajectory data. Based on these measures, a comparative analysis is carried out between primary and secondary interactions. Results show that secondary interactions are more dangerous than primary interactions. Among the three secondary interaction types, secondary through interactions are the most dangerous.",0968-090X,Not found
A dual model/artificial neural network framework for privacy analysis in traffic monitoring systems,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.031,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Most large scale traffic information systems rely on a combination of fixed sensors (e.g. loop detectors, cameras) and user generated data, the latter in the form of probe traces sent by smartphones or GPS devices onboard vehicles. While this type of data is relatively inexpensive to gather, it can pose multiple privacy risks, even if the location tracks are anonymous. In particular, an issue could be the possibility for an attacker to infer user location tracks from anonymous location data, which affects users privacy. In this article, we propose a new framework for analyzing a variety of privacy problems arising in transportation systems. The state of traffic is modeled by the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards traffic flow model, which is a first order scalar conservation law with a concave flux function. Given a set of traffic flow data, we show that the constraints resulting from this partial differential equation are mixed integer linear inequalities for some decision variable. These constraints allow us to determine the likelihood of two distinct location tracks being generated by the same vehicle. We then use these model-based reidentification metrics to train an artificial neural network classifier. Numerical implementations are performed on experimental data from the Mobile Century experiment, and show that this framework significantly outperforms naive reidentification techniques.",0968-090X,Not found

This paper is devoted to proposing robust scheduling strategies of electric buses to tackle the challenge brought by the stochasticity of urban traffic conditions. To avoid en-route breakdown of electric buses, reduce delay costs, and achieve robustness, we propose both static and dynamic scheduling models. The static model introduces a buffer-distance strategy to tackle the adverse impacts caused by trip time stochasticity, whereas the dynamic model takes advantage of continuously-updated road traffic conditions and periodically reschedules an electric bus fleet during a day’s operations. A branch-and-price framework is extended to effectively solve both models. Using the realistic operations data of bus lines in Beijing, we conduct numerical examples to simulate the performances of the proposed models and derive some important insights.

Since their primary purposes are often non-transportation related, passively-generated data need to be processed to extract trips. Most existing trip extraction methods rely on data that are generated via a single positioning technology such as GPS or triangulation through cellular towers (thereby called single-sourced data). Methods to extract trips from data generated via multiple positioning technologies (called “multi-sourced data”) are absent. And yet, multi-sourced data are increasingly common. Generated using multiple technologies (e.g., GPS, cellular network- and WiFi-based), multi-sourced data contain high variances in their temporal and spatial properties. In this study, we propose a “Divide, Conquer and Integrate” (DCI) framework to extract trips from multi-sourced data. We evaluate the proposed framework by applying it to an app-based data, which is multi-sourced and has high variances in both location accuracy and observation interval (i.e. time interval between two consecutive observations). On a manually labeled sample of the app-based data, the framework outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM model that is designed for GPS data.

Particle filter for aircraft mass estimation and uncertainty modeling,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.030,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This article investigates the estimation of aircraft mass and thrust settings of departing aircraft using a recursive Bayesian method called particle filtering. The method is based on a nonlinear state-space system derived from aircraft point-mass performance models. Using only aircraft surveillance data, flight states such as position, velocity, wind speed, and air temperature are collected and used for the estimations. With the regularized Sample Importance Re-sampling particle filter, we are able to estimate the aircraft mass within 30 seconds once an aircraft is airborne. Using this short flight segment allows the assumption of constant mass and thrust setting. The segment at the start of the climb also represents the time when maximum thrust setting is most likely to occur. This study emphasizes an important aspect of the estimation problem, the observation noise modeling. Four observation noise models are proposed, which are all based on the native navigation accuracy parameters that have been obtained automatically from the surveillance data. Simulations and experiments are conducted to test the theoretical model. The results show that the particle filter is able to quantify uncertainties, as well as determine the noise limit for an accurate estimation.

Ride-hailing adoption and usage are modeled as functions of unobserved lifestyle stochastic latent constructs, observed transportation-related choices, and sociodemographic variables. The results point to low residential location density and people’s privacy concerns as the main deterrents to pooled ride-hailing adoption, with non-Hispanic Whites being more privacy sensitive than individuals of other ethnicities.

First, we estimate a robust univariate speed threshold using historical traffic information from individual sensors. This step can be parallelized using MapReduce framework thereby making it feasible to implement the framework over large networks. Our study shows that such robust thresholds can improve incident detection performance significantly compared to traditional threshold determination.

The ACTM offers a more realistic simulation of densities on each lane in case of blockages or spillbacks from short turning lanes and models the interaction among movements in shared lanes including gap acceptance behaviour of permitted turns from shared lanes that are opposed by through traffic.

A mixed-integer convex cost-minimization model is developed for the determination of optimal vessel speeds and fleet size, in which the vessel speeds are continuous decision variables and the fleet size is an integer decision variable. The analytical optimal solution of the developed model is identified by relaxing the integer restriction of the fleet size variable. It is shown that how the in-transit cargo inventory cost can play a role in changing the way that the optimal vessel speed is identified. We also demonstrate that the minimal annual fleet cost could be attained by simply comparing two candidate analytical solutions. Numerical studies are carried out to investigate the economic and environmental impacts of the ECA regulation on several representative industrial shipping services.

Simultaneously, complex geometric and other environmental conditions of the highway system are also considered realistically, not only during the safety assessment process, but also in quantifying the wind loads applied on the vehicles. Finally, with the safety information of each individual vehicle, an overall safety performance index of the whole traffic flow on the highway system is further introduced, which serves as a potential traffic safety performance measure and resilience indicator of transportation infrastructure systems under various hazards.

The effects of truck platooning were tested for the influence of traffic states, truck gap settings, platoon sizes, and the share of equipped trucks. This resulted in outcomes regarding the total traffic performance, the performance of traffic at ramps, and the ability of a platoon to remain platooning as part of a case experiment performed on a part of the Trans-European ITS Corridor. The results showed that truck platooning may have a small negative effect on the total non-saturated traffic flow, however with a much larger negative effect on saturated traffic flow. However, drivers may be reluctant to platoon in saturated traffic in any case. The ability of inflowing traffic to merge at on-ramps was found to be affected by truck platoons, with platoon disengagements occurring under various conditions. The applied gap settings for platooning trucks did not significantly affect the merge time, while a higher gap did lead to a higher number of disengagements. The ability of trucks to platoon was positively affected by a greater percentage of equipped trucks and by larger platoon sizes. Shorter gap times also slightly improved the ability of trucks to remain in platooning formation. Finally, recommendations are given to improve platoon strategies and for policymakers to only allow truck platooning outside of busy (near-) saturated traffic, even though drivers may be reluctant to use the system in these conditions. Also, recommendations are made to investigate potential differences in the effects between the European and American contexts for truck-platooning.",0968-090X,Not found
The effect of social influence and social interactions on the adoption of a new technology: The use of bike sharing in a student population,10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.010,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The present study investigates how social influence and social interactions can affect the adoption of new technologies, using stated preference (SP) survey data combined with an “accelerated reality” experience of social interaction among the respondents. Specifically, the intention to use a pro-environmental transport mode (the bike sharing) during a public transport strike within a cohort of students has been analysed. Previous studies have modelled social influence effects using SP data by providing a hypothetical scenario with simulated interactions or information about social conformity processes (i.e. social adoption) during the survey. In our paper, in addition to the impact of assumed social norms, the effect of live/real social interactions is included in the survey. SP survey is developed to investigate the effect of Level-of-Service attributes on the hypothetical choices in the scenario of a public transport strike. Besides the pre-defined attributes characterising the alternatives in the SP design, the survey includes techniques to acquire information on conformity and social interactions. Specifically, the interviewees undertake a before and after stated preference experiment (SP1 and SP2), with a period of group discussion in between the two parts. This SP experiment involves different cognitive and interpersonal mechanisms, such as the functional information exchange on benefits and drawbacks of cycling and bike sharing. The aim is to establish whether hypothetical scenarios of social conformity are different from real/live social interactions and whether these social influence processes actually affect the individuals' mode choice. A joint SP1/SP2 mixed logit (ML) model has been estimated to explore the choice behaviour of individuals and allows us to incorporate the inertia/propensity to change behaviour between SP1 and SP2. Moreover, considering the “Reflexive Layers of Influence” (RLI) framework, the processes generated by social interactions (diffusion, translation and reflexivity) are measured and incorporated in the model. We finally show the effect of these social influence variables on the goodness-of-fit of the models and choice simulation for prediction. We also draw conclusions about the value of such enhanced choice models in understanding and predicting the impacts of social interactions on choice behaviour in the context of new transport technologies.",0968-090X,Not found
Morning commute problem with supply management considering parking and ride-sourcing,10.1016/j.trc.2018.12.015,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Managing morning commute traffic through parking provision management has been well studied in the literature. One conventional assumption made in most previous studies is that all commuters require parking spaces at CBD area. However, in recent years, due to technological advancements and low market entry barrier, more and more e-dispatch FHVs (eFHVs) are provided in service. The rapidly growing eFHVs, on one hand, supply substantial trip services and complete the trips requiring no parking demand; on the other hand, imposes congestion effects on all commuters. In this study, we investigate the morning commute problem with bottleneck congestion and parking space constraints in the presence of ride-sourcing service. The within-day dynamic equilibrium and its travel pattern are examined. Meanwhile, we explore the optimal supply of parking spaces and ride-sourcing services to best manage the commute traffic. To minimize system total travel costs, the optimal quantity control of parking spaces and eFHVs is determined, which indeed addresses a critical issue on how to regulate the supply of eFHVs.",0968-090X,Not found
A framework to integrate mode choice in the design of mobility-on-demand systems,10.1016/j.trc.2018.09.022,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems are generally designed and analyzed for a fixed and exogenous demand, but such frameworks fail to answer questions about the impact of these services on the urban transportation system, such as the effect of induced demand and the implications for transit ridership. In this study, we propose a unified framework to design, optimize and analyze MoD operations within a multimodal transportation system where the demand for a travel mode is a function of its level of service. An application of Bayesian optimization (BO) to derive the optimal supply-side MoD parameters (e.g., fleet size and fare) is also illustrated. The proposed framework is calibrated using the taxi demand data in Manhattan, New York. Travel demand is served by public transit and MoD services of varying passenger capacities (1, 4 and 10), and passengers are predicted to choose travel modes according to a mode choice model. This choice model is estimated using stated preference data collected in New York City. The convergence of the multimodal supply-demand system and the superiority of the BO-based optimization method over earlier approaches are established through numerical experiments. We finally consider a policy intervention where the government imposes a tax on the ride-hailing service and illustrate how the proposed framework can quantify the pros and cons of such policies for different stakeholders.",0968-090X,Not found
Allocation method for transit lines considering the user equilibrium for operators,10.1016/j.trc.2018.09.019,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,The purpose of this study is to address the allocation of transit lines problem in operation-sharing. An allocation method for urban transit lines is proposed to guide public authorities to pursue an optimal plan considering the User Equilibrium for operators (UE-O). The method utilizes the concepts from mathematical programming and game theory to present the UE-O and proposes a set partitioning formulation considering the benefits of both passengers and operators. A branch-and-price algorithm employing both column generation and branch-and-bound is used to tackle the problem. The proposed method is validated through a case study using data from the Development District of Dalian. Results show that the proposed line allocation method considering the UE-O can reduce the potential competitions among operators. This method and findings can provide a guidance to the problems in operation-sharing regarding allocation of transit lines.,0968-090X,Not found
Integrating ridesourcing services with public transit: An evaluation of traveler responses combining revealed and stated preference data,10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.029,105,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Inspired by the success of private ridesourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft, transit agencies have started to consider integrating ridesourcing services (i.e. on-demand, app-driven ridesharing services) with public transit. Ridesourcing services may enhance the transit system in two major ways: replacing underutilized routes to improve operational efficiency, and providing last-mile connectivity to extend transit’s catchment area. While an integrated system of ridesourcing services and public transit is conceptually appealing, little is known regarding whether and how consumers might use a system like this and what key service attributes matter the most to them. This article investigates traveler responses to a proposed integrated transit system, named MTransit, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. We conducted a large-sample survey to collect both revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data and fit a RP-SP mixed logit model to examine the main determinants of commuting mode choice. The model results show that transfers and additional pickups are major deterrents for MTransit use. We further applied the model outputs to forecast the demand for MTransit under different deployment scenarios. We find that replacing low-ridership bus lines with ridesourcing services could slightly increase transit ridership while reducing operations costs. The service improvements offered by ridesourcing mainly come from reductions in wait time. Though relatively small in our study, another source of improvement is the decrease of in-vehicle travel time. Moreover, we find that when used to provide convenient last-mile connections, ridesourcing could provide a significant boost to transit. This finding verifies a popular notion among transit professionals that ridesourcing services can serve as a complement to public transit by enhancing last-mile transit access.",0968-090X,Not found

Methods for quantitative assessment of passenger flow influence on train dwell time in dense traffic areas,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.008,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Railway operations in dense traffic areas are very sensitive even to small disturbances, and thus require careful planning and real-time management. Dwell times in stations are in particular subject to a high variability and are hard to predict; this is mostly due to the interactions between passengers and the railway system during the dwelling process. This paper presents a data-driven approach for assessing the influence of the numbers of alighting, boarding and on board passengers on the dwell time. We propose to split the dwell time into a deterministic component depending on the passenger flow, called the Minimum Dwell Time, and a random component. A method for estimating the minimum dwell time is provided. Based on the knowledge of this value, observations can be classified according to the main determinant of dwell time, namely timetable constraints or passenger exchange. The latter observations are used for estimating the conditional distribution of dwell time given passenger flows. Numerical experiments are carried out on stations located inside the dense traffic area of Paris suburban network. The obtained results indicate that the presented method can be used for a variety of applications, such as capacity assessment or stochastic simulation.",0968-090X,Not found
Strategic planning of dedicated autonomous vehicle lanes and autonomous vehicle/toll lanes in transportation networks,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.022,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Employing vehicle communication and automated control technologies, autonomous vehicles (AVs) can safely drive closer together than human-driven vehicles (HVs), thereby potentially improving traffic efficiency. Separation between AV and HV traffic through the deployment of dedicated AV lanes is foreseen as an effective method of amplifying the benefits of AVs and promoting their adoption. However, it is important to consider mixed AV and HV traffic in a transportation network. On the one hand, it may be impractical to deploy dedicated AV lanes throughout the network, while on the other hand, dedicated AV lanes may even reduce the total traffic efficiency of a road segment when the AV flow rate is low. In this study, we considered a new form of managed lanes for AVs, designated as autonomous vehicle/toll (AVT) lanes, which grant free access to AVs while allowing HVs to access the lanes by paying a toll. We investigated the optimal deployment of dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes in transportation networks with mixed AV and HV flows. The user equilibrium (UE) problem in a transportation network with mixed flows of AVs and HVs is first explored. We formulated the UE problem as a link-based variational inequality (VI) and identified that, with different impacts of AVs on road capacity, the UE problem can have unique or non-unique flow patterns. Considering that the UE problem may have non-unique flow distributions, we proposed a robust optimal deployment model, which is a generalized semi-infinite min-max program, to deploy the dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes so that the system performance under the worst-case flow distributions is optimized. We proposed effective solution algorithms to solve these models and presented numerical studies to demonstrate the models and the solution algorithms. The results show that the system performance can be significantly improved through the deployment of dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes.",0968-090X,Not found
A convolutional neural network method to improve efficiency and visualization in modeling driver's visual field on roads using MLS data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.018,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"This paper aims to introduce the convolutional neural network (CNN) into modeling driver’s visual field (VF) using mobile laser scanning (MLS) data. A new solution that incorporates CNN is proposed to tackle the issues of inefficiency and inadequate manners of visualization in existing methods. The method operates along vehicle trajectory recorded in MLS data. For any driver position, the initial VF is defined as a fan-shaped area originating at the driver’s viewpoint. Within the initial VF, numerous virtual line-of-sights (LOS) are emitted from the viewpoint. Given an object point in any LOS, three-dimensional (3D) MLS points that may affect its visibility are converted to two-dimensional (2D) points using the cylindrical perspective projection. 2D points on the projective surface are then transformed into a binary image via the Pixelation procedure. Fed with the generated image, the CNN which is trained based on 789,500 data will classify the visibility as: 0-visible or 1-invisible. The location of the obstacle that blocks the driver’s view along each LOS is detected with a combination of the trained CNN and the bisection method. With all positions of obstacles determined, the final VF is established. Through comparisons with a state-of-the-art method, the CNN-based method shows remarkable efficiency, which facilitates either VF modeling at a single position or successive VF analyses along the vehicle path. A case study is also presented to show the improved manners of data visualization implemented in the developed method: (1) 3D viewshed, (2) sight distance curve, and (3) the driver’s perspective image with obstacles spotlighted.",0968-090X,Not found
Monte Carlo Tree Search-based intersection signal optimization model with channelized section spillover,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.017,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Signal optimization has received significant attentions from the research community. However, during peak hours, the performances of existing models still have room for improvements, especially when channelized section spillover (CSS) occurs. The evolution of CSS is dynamic in nature, not only due to the interactions between traffic flow of different movements, but also because existing CSS influences the queuing process in a channelized section and contributes to new CSS formation at the next cycle. Neglecting such spatial-temporal interaction in current traffic signal optimization procedures may lead to suboptimal results. A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based model is proposed to solve the intersection optimization problem (named MCTS-IO) with explicit modeling of CSS dynamic evolution. The model works in a rolling horizon way. At each decision point, MCTS-IO simulates the intersection by selecting a sequence of phases, and progressively updates the relative preferences of the phases. After all simulations are performed, the phase with the best policy PI is selected. Both the PI and decision space can be customized, which ensures algorithm flexibility. The method is tested against Synchro results with both stable and variable demand, which demonstrates the proposed model is always able to find a solution better than Synchro.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimisation of lane-changing advisory at the motorway lane drop bottleneck,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.016,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Reduction in the number of lanes (lane drop) is common on motorways due to road design, incidents, or road maintenance, and it can be an active bottleneck if the traffic demand is high. If congestion occurs, the lane drop capacity will decrease 10–20%. In order to avoid capacity drop, this study analysed the reason and proposed lane-changing advisory control on the merge lane to distribute lane-changing using Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) technology. Further, this study used hyper-heuristic optimisation to obtain the lane-changing advisory proportion of each segment upstream of lane drop. Conditions of different traffic demands were analysed using the microscopic traffic simulation software AIMSUN and its Application Program Interface (API) function. Results indicated that the proposed lane-changing advisory strategy could reduce traffic congestion and obviously improve traffic efficiency. This study also analysed the effects with different proportions of connected vehicles and found that if the connected vehicle ratio is less than 20%, the lane-changing advisory has little impact on the lane drop performance, and that if the penetration rate is more than 50%, the gain in performance is marginal.",0968-090X,Not found
Exploratory data analysis for the cancellation of slot booking in intercontinental container liner shipping: A case study of Asia to US West Coast Service,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.009,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"In an intercontinental container liner service, container shipping operators reserve container slots for the customers who book capacity for their cargoes a few weeks before the ship depart from a particular port. In practice, some of these bookings are finally cancelled without loading any containers onto the ships, which leads to a low loading rate and revenue loss. However, deep analyses of container slot booking cancellation in container liner services rarely appear in the literature due to the lack of real data. The characteristics and patterns of the container slot booking cancellation are unclear from both academic and managerial perspectives. To fill this gap, this study first proposes a conceptual model for the container slot booking cancellation analysis in intercontinental shipping services. A case study on a container liner service between Asia and US west coast is then conducted based on the proposed model.

A matheuristic for the vehicle routing problem with drones and its variants,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.016,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"In this work, we are interested in studying the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRPD). Given a fleet of trucks, where each truck carries a given number of drones, the objective consists in designing feasible routes and drone operations such that all customers are served and minimal makespan is achieved. We formulate the VRPD as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), which can be solved by any standard MILP solver. Moreover, with the aim of improving the performance of solvers, we introduce several sets of valid inequalities (VIEQ). Due to limited performance of the solvers in addressing large instances, we propose a matheuristic approach that effectively exploits the problem structure of the VRPD. Integral to this approach, we propose the Drone Assignment and Scheduling Problem (DASP) that, given an existing routing of trucks, looks for an optimal assignment and schedule of drones such that the makespan is minimized. In this context, we propose two MILP formulations for the DASP. In order to evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art solver in tackling the MILP formulation of the VRPD, the benefit of the proposed VIEQs, and the performance of the matheuristic, we carried out extensive computational experiments. According to the numerical results, the use of drones can significantly reduce the makespan and the proposed VIEQ as well as the matheuristic approach have a significant contribution in solving the VRPD effectively.",0968-090X,Not found
"Learning routing policies in a disrupted, congestible network with real-time information: An experimental approach",10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.014,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The roles of learning, inertia and real-time travel information on route choices in a highly disrupted network are investigated, based on data from a laboratory competitive route choice game. Routing policies instead of simple paths are treated as the subject of learning when real-time travel information is available, where a routing policy is defined as a contingency plan that maps realized traffic conditions to path choices. A learning model based on the power law of forgetting and reinforcement is applied to calculate the perceived travel times of alternative routing policies, based on which choices are made. A deterministic correction to the Logit choice model in a learning context is developed to account for overlapping routing policies. Model parameter estimates are obtained from maximizing the likelihood of making the observed choices on the current day based on choices from all previous days. Prediction performance is measured in terms of both one-step and full-trajectory predictions, based on observed choices up to today, in which one-step prediction entails predicting the next day’s choice, while full-trajectory prediction entails predicting the next K days’ choices. Three major conclusions are drawn. First, the routing policy learning model can capture travelers’ learning and choice behavior better than a path-based model under real-time travel information, as it accounts for travelers’ forward-looking capabilities. Secondly, inertia exists where travelers stick to previously chosen routes and do not necessarily minimize travel time. Inertia plays a dominant role in one-step prediction, and a less important role in full-trajectory prediction, suggesting that learning is more important in longer term prediction. Thirdly, relative importance of learning compared with inertia is more prominent in a less uncertain, but not close to deterministic, environment. Therefore, decreasing uncertainty by providing real-time information could encourage learning and potentially more optimal decisions for individuals and the system.",0968-090X,Not found
A fuzzy inference approach to analysis of LPV-200 procedures influence on air traffic safety,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.001,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Introducing new technical and organizational solutions in air transport requires demonstrating that the level of safety will not be reduced. The LPV-200 (Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance) approach for landing procedures represent a great opportunity for development of small, poorly equipped airports, as they permit precise landing without costly investment in the ILS (Instrument Landing System). The aim of this paper is to assess the effects of the introduction of LPV-200 procedures for air traffic safety which was determined by the probability of a CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) accident – PoC. Factors affecting PoC are of a diverse nature, some of which are subjective and cannot be expressed precisely. Therefore, PoC assessment uses fuzzy logic methods, and more specifically hierarchical fuzzy inference systems, with a knowledge base obtained from experts. As a result of simulation experiments, PoC was determined for airports with various levels of navigational equipment. It was also found that the introduction of LPV-200 procedures allows the reduction of PoC, with the highest effect being achieved for the least equipped airports. Also, in the event of failure of the main approach assistance system ILS, the use of LPV-200 procedures allows maintaining PoC at the same or close to the basic value level. The results of our research indicate that the introduction of LPV-200 procedures is clearly positive for the commercial use of small, less equipped aerodromes. We have shown that thanks to employing LPV-200 procedures it is possible to keep the PoC at a level similar to typical commercial airports.",0968-090X,Not found

A two-stage optimization problem is introduced into the design of flex-route transit operations. Mixed integer programming (MIP) is employed to formulate the problem with a twofold objective: to serve as many requests as possible and to minimize the total trip time of the accepted passengers. A memetic algorithm is adopted to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time. Simulation experiments based on a real-life flex-route transit service are conducted to assess the benefits of introducing meeting points. The results demonstrate that meeting points can significantly reduce the rejection rate by up to 24% at the cost of walking an acceptable distance. We also find that reducing the passenger fare to compensate for the inconvenience of walking to meeting points constitutes a win–win strategy that benefits both passengers and transit operators.",0968-090X,Not found
Spatial-temporal inference of urban traffic emissions based on taxi trajectories and multi-source urban data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.005,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Vehicle trajectory data collected via GPS-enabled devices have played increasingly important roles in estimating network-wide traffic, given their broad spatial-temporal coverage and representativeness of traffic dynamics.

Vehicle emission factor models are employed to estimate emissions based on taxi trajectories. The estimated emissions are then mapped to spatial grids of urban areas to account for spatial heterogeneity. To extrapolate emissions from the taxi fleet to the whole vehicle population, we use Gaussian process regression (GPR) models supported by geographical features to estimate the spatially heterogeneous traffic volume and fleet composition. Unlike previous studies, this paper utilizes the taxi GPS data and LPR data to disaggregate vehicle and emission characteristics through space and time in a large-scale urban network.

A hazard-based duration model to quantify the impact of connected driving environment on safety during mandatory lane-changing,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.015,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Lane-changing is among the more risky of manoeuvres required of drivers, as it requires matching the speed of nearby vehicles, identifying a suitable gap in traffic, ensuring that a driver’s own movements are recognised by others, and a capable execution. The highly anticipated, future connected vehicle environment (CVE) is expected to reduce associated crash risk of lane-changing by providing driving aids, which utilise surrounding traffic information. The impact of CVE driving on safety during mandatory lane-changing, however, is unknown due to the novelty of the CVE and consequent scarcity of the data. As such, this study examines the effects of the CVE on safety during mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres. Seventy-eight participants performed mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres in a driving simulator experiment in the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. The randomised driving conditions included baseline driving (without driving aids), CVE driving with perfect communication (on-time supply of driving aids), and CVE driving with communication delay (delayed supply of driving aids). The minimum gap time, which is a surrogate measure of safety representing time-to-collision, between the interacting vehicles during the mandatory lane-changing was modelled using a parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) hazard-based duration model. A gamma frailty specification was used to capture structured heterogeneity arising from the repeated measures design of the experiment. The AFT model reveals that the gap time during mandatory lane-changing manoeuvres is longer during CVE driving with perfect communication compared to both the baseline and CVE driving with communication delay scenarios. The gap times for young (18–26 years) and male drivers are shorter in the traditional driving environment, but longer during CVE driving with perfect communication. Overall, CVE driving assists drivers by increasing the safety and efficiency of mandatory lane-changing tasks.",0968-090X,Not found

A game theory-based approach for modelling mandatory lane-changing behaviour in a connected environment,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.011,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The connected environment provides real-time information about surrounding traffic; such information can be helpful in complex driving manoeuvres, such as lane-changing, that require information about surrounding vehicles. Lane-changing modelling in the connected environment has so far received little attention. This is due to the novelty of connected environment, and the consequent scarcity of data. A behaviourally sound lane-changing model is not even available for the traditional environment; that is, an environment without driving aids. To address this need, this study develops a game theory-based mandatory lane-changing model (AZHW model) for the traditional environment and extends it for the connected environment. The CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator is used to collect high-quality vehicle trajectory data for the connected environment.

These include the true positive, false positive, detection rate, false alarm rate, time prediction error, and location prediction error. Results consistently show that the developed game theory-based models can effectively capture mandatory lane-changing decisions with a high degree of accuracy.

It is a fundamental problem in the modeling of transportation where the synthetic populations of micro-agents represent a key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological framework for how to ‘grow’ pools of micro-agents is presented. The model framework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population synthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs sampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden Markov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution for high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional Gibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary. It is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the low-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number of modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler essentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required conditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the VAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that are virtually different from those in the original data but have similar statistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling at all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and more detailed individual characteristics.",0968-090X,Not found

Modeling an LC process is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty of driving behavior. To address this issue, this paper proposes a data-driven LC model based on deep learning models. Deep belief network (DBN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network are employed to model the LC process that is composed of LC decisions (LCD) and LC implementation (LCI). The empirical LC data provided by Next Generation Simulation project (NGSIM) is utilized to train and test the proposed DBN-based LCD model and LSTM-based LCI model. The results indicate that the proposed data-driven model is able to accurately predict the LC process of a vehicle. The sensitivity analysis shows that the most important factor associated with LCD is the relative position of the preceding vehicle in the target lane. This may be the first work that comprehensively models LC using deep learning approaches.",0968-090X,Not found
Mining automatically extracted vehicle trajectory data for proactive safety analytics,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.004,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Proactive safety management has gained increasing attention for its potential to mitigate crash risk. This study aims to leverage massive vehicle trajectory data for proactive safety analytics. State-of-the-art computer vision techniques are employed to automatically extract massive vehicle trajectories from 70-hour traffic video data at two intersections in Brooklyn, New York City. The novelty of our trajectory extraction algorithm includes the inclusion of high-level information from foreground/background separation to cluster feature points that belong to the same vehicle and the use of non-parametric clustering method Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) that does not require specification of the cluster number. The amount of video data used in this case study is substantially greater than what was previously used in most of literature. Surrogate safety measures in terms of time to collision are introduced to identify rear-end conflict risk for adjacent vehicles. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are then proposed to model the rear-end conflicts at five-minute intervals. The proposed HMMs are found to have better performance in terms of representing the conflict occurrence and their predictive abilities are comparable to the classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. HMMs are then used to infer the hidden states of traffic safety. As a result, frequent switches between different states and a clustering of high-risk states are observed. The modeling results imply that HMMs can help monitor the prevailing traffic conditions and facilitate proactive safety management.",0968-090X,Not found
Quantifying regional heterogeneity effect on drivers’ speeding behavior using SHRP2 naturalistic driving data: A multilevel modeling approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.017,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Disparities in traffic safety among different regions and driver populations have been investigated in previous studies. These studies found significant differences in crashes between population groups and geographical locations with various socio-economic characteristics. However, driver-behavioral factors, specifically speeding behavior, which is a critical aspect of traffic safety, have received less attention in case of analyzing the impact of local characteristics on driver-behavioral choices that might increase the risk of crashes. The impact of local characteristics on various driver behaviors is getting even more important as the data from the connected and automated vehicles as well as similar second-by-second trajectory level data from naturalistic driving studies are becoming more available. In fact, neglecting mentioned impact might lead to erroneous inferences due to the disparities in socioeconomic characteristics in different regions. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, utilized multilevel logistic regression modeling approach to evaluate the effect of driver's locality-related factors on driver speeding behavior using naturalistic driving data collected from the SHRP2 project in six US states. The results showed that the geographical location of drivers accounted for about 7.7% of the variability in the likelihood of a driver driving over the posted speed, regardless of other explanatory variables. The methodology and the results from this study can pave the road for future human factor studies utilizing trajectory-level data from different geographical locations to reduce the heterogeneity and increase the transferability of the results without introducing a bias in inferences.",0968-090X,Not found
Examination and prediction of drivers’ reaction when provided with V2I communication-based intersection maneuver strategies,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.007,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Connected vehicle technology provides promising opportunities to improve road safety, enhance traffic efficiency, and reduce fuel consumption and emissions. It has been suggested that if drivers comply with suggested recommendations, connected vehicle technology can introduce huge benefits. However, whether drivers will accept suggestions and what factors will influence their likelihood of accepting the suggestions in a connected environment have not been studied. In addition, few models have been developed to predict drivers’ reactions under such conditions. This paper aims to fill the research gap by examining and modeling drivers’ acceptance and behavior when receiving energy- and safety-related speed recommendations through vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. A mixed-subject-design experiment was conducted in a closed-loop test track, Mcity, with seven intersection maneuver scenarios. A generally high compliance rate to the recommended speed strategies was observed that during 72% of the events, drivers changed their intersection-approaching behavior to follow the recommendations. Mixed models were conducted to explore the impacting factors while Principal Component Analysis was used to classify subjective (i.e., self-reported) data into four categories. To predict drivers’ reactions when offered a speed suggestion, Random Forests were built with 13 independent variables, derived from four categories: vehicle kinematic features, device information, driver characteristics, and subjective data. Using this model, drivers’ reactions during each intersection maneuver could be predicted with a reasonably high accuracy about 87.4 m away from the intersection, where the vehicle started to receive signal phase and timing information. Findings in this study can contribute to the optimization of energy-saving algorithms and the improvement of driving safety by using connected vehicle technologies.",0968-090X,Not found
Short-term prediction of lane-level traffic speeds: A fusion deep learning model,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.003,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Accurate and robust short-term traffic prediction is an important part of advanced traveler information systems. With the development of intelligent navigation and autonomous driving, it is necessary to explore the lane-level predictions of traffic speeds. However, most existing traffic prediction models concentrate on forecasting the traffic flow characteristics of the entire road sections rather than those of certain lanes. This paper proposes a fusion deep learning (FDL) model to predict lane-level traffic speed. First, the entropy-based grey relation analysis is introduced to choose lane sections that are strongly correlated with the lane section to be predicted. Second, a two-layer deep learning framework is established by combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network. Third, the ground-truth data of several lane sections captured by remote traffic microwave sensors (RTMS) on the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing are utilized to examine the FDL model and compare it with several benchmark models. The experimental result indicates that in addition to capturing the fluctuations of traffic speed at the lane level, the FDL model has better performance than the benchmark models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated deep learning and stochastic car-following model for traffic dynamics on multi-lane freeways,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.023,106,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The current paper proposes a novel stochastic procedure for modelling car-following behaviours on a multi-lane motorway. We develop an integrated multi-lane stochastic continuous car-following model where a deep learning architecture is used to estimate a probability of lane-changing (LC) manoeuvres. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the very few papers which exploit deep learning to model driving behaviour on a multi-lane road. The objective of this study is to establish a coupled stochastic continuous multi-lane car-following model using Langevin equations to cope with probabilistic characteristics of LC manoeuvres. In particular, a stochastic volatility, derived from LC manoeuvres is introduced in a multi-lane stochastic optimal velocity model (SOVM). In additions, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to estimate a probability of LC manoeuvres in the integrated multi-lane car-following model. Furthermore, imaged second-based trajectories of the lane-changer and surrounding vehicles are used to identify whether LC manoeuvres occur by using the CNN. Finally, the proposed method is validated using a real-world high-resolution vehicle trajectory dataset. The results indicate that the prediction of the integrated SOVM is almost identical to the observed trajectories of the lane-changers and the following vehicles in the initial and the target lane. It has been found that the proposed multi-lane SOVM can tackle the unpredictable fluctuations in the velocity of the vehicles in the acceleration/deceleration zone.",0968-090X,Not found
Diffusion behavior in a docked bike-sharing system,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.018,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This paper examines bike diffusion behavior in a docked bike-sharing system in Chicago. The analysis is based on an analogy between the movement of shared bikes and the transmission of certain information on internet or the spreading of epidemics among humans. By mining a bike trip data set collected in the city, we find that (1) the distribution of bike trip distance peaks between 0.8 and 2 km, and beyond 6.3 km, it follows a strong power law; (2) the diffusion intensity of a community is affected positively by the number of incoming bike trips and rebalancing actions, and negatively by the percentage of inner-community trips. The effect of the rebalancing actions is roughly twice as strong as that of the incoming bike trips; (3) both the diffusion range of a bike and the number of rebalancing actions it receives are strong predictors of its use. Reaching one more community will produce about 14 more trips and an additional rebalancing action contributes about 8.6; and (4) even the most active bikes could only reach about 75% of all communities in Chicago. The last finding helps identify a cluster of communities poorly connected with the rest of the city by bike travel. Interestingly, these isolated communities are strongly correlated with the areas of the city that have high concentration of African American population, low-income households and homicide crimes.",0968-090X,Not found
Managing traffic with raffles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.002,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Raffles have been widely used in commercial markets to influence consumers’ behaviors. Instead of charging users a fee or issuing a credit to users as incentives, the raffle-based scheme incentivizes users to change their choices by giving out credits that are used to enter a lottery. Comparing to tolls or credits, raffles may be less controversial since it is based on voluntary participation. The promises of a raffle-based scheme is that users are more risk-seeking, thus willing to participate in the lottery, when stakes are low. This would particularly fit the traffic management where the cost for a user to change his/her choices may be relatively insignificant comparing to the reward of a raffle. This paper examines the effect of raffle or lotteries for travel demand management, particularly in the morning commute. We establish the utility-based user equilibrium by incorporating risks and uncertainties in users’ choices. A class of Flat Raffle schemes is proposed where a constant lottery winning chance is set for a period of time during the morning commute. We show that a marginal user who is indifferent from participating the lottery or not would exist for arbitrary utility functions. Furthermore, we analytically derive and solve for the equilibrium using exponential utility functions, and subsequently the optimal travel profiles under four potential system management objectives. We find that minimizing the total generalized travel cost (TTC) seems a reasonable goal for an optimal Flat Raffle possibly resulting in approximately minimum commuting duration and minimum total queuing delay at the same time. Under the minimum TTC, there is no queuing delay for the user who is indifferent from participating the lottery or not. Most interestingly, a Flat Raffle scheme works the best and outperforms the optimal one-step toll, when the population is overall slightly risk-seeking. This is particularly appealing since the raffle reward is relatively significant comparing with a not-so-significant cost increase associated with users’ behavioral change.",0968-090X,Not found

Different from the existing lane departure warning system, speed limit warning system or collision warning system, the warning system proposed in this work focuses on the safety regarding vehicle's dynamics states. Many road accidents are caused by losing control of vehicle dynamics, such as the rollover, car drift and brake failure. First of all, the importance of monitoring vehicle dynamics states, especially the tire forces, is explained. Then the driving risk assessment criteria based on tire forces are developed in this work. The main contribution of this paper is the development of vehicle dynamics models and observers to estimate and predict individual tire forces using only low-cost sensors and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) map. The major new techniques developed in this study can be summarized in three aspects: (1) development of new vehicle dynamics models to estimate vertical, longitudinal, and lateral tire forces, (2) development of new nonlinear observers to minimize the estimation errors caused by sensor noises and model uncertainty, and (3) development of the tire forces prediction algorithm by taking advantage of digital map.

Predicting real-time surge pricing of ride-sourcing companies,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.019,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Ride-sourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft represent a popular and growing mode of transit in cites worldwide. These companies employ surge pricing in real time to balance the needs of both drivers and riders. The prediction of surge prices in the next few minutes to hours encapsulates the complex evolution of service fleets and service demand in the short term. Surge pricing, if effectively predicted and disseminated to both drivers and riders, can be used to more efficiently allocate vehicles, save users money and time, and provide profitable insight to drivers, which ultimately helps the efficiency and reliability of transportation networks. This paper explores the spatio-temporal correlations between the urban environment, traffic flow characteristics, and surge multipliers. We propose a general framework for predicting the short-term evolution of surge multipliers in real-time using a log-linear model with L 1 regularization, coupled with pattern clustering. This model is able to predict Uber surge multipliers in Pittsburgh up to two hours in advance using data from the previous hour out-performing the overall mean and the historical average in all but 3 of the 49 locations in Pittsburgh and outperforming three non-linear methods in 28 of the 49 locations.

The framework depicts a powerful combination of a data-driven control method that is used to imitate the control behaviour of dispatchers and a mathematical optimization method. Three components comprise the DDHC framework: a data-driven control module, a performance module, and an optimization module. The data-driven control module contains a random forest model which is adopted to justify whether to intervene in the operation of a bus line, and if so, which vehicles should be controlled and what type of control strategy should be taken – an acceleration strategy or deceleration strategy. The performance module including vehicle operation state models is used to describe the system evolution. The last component optimizes the specific control actions – which type of acceleration or deceleration strategy should be adopted – by minimizing total passenger travel time. The effectiveness of the proposed DDHC framework is evaluated with the data of a transit route in Urumqi, China.

Our results show that self-efficacy positively affects the perceived ease of use and intention to use, while the relative advantage affects perceived usefulness. Psychological ownership affects the intention to use but not the perceived usefulness. This implies that encouraging a consumer to form a psychological bond (i.e., psychological ownership) with an autonomous vehicle may be an effective strategy for promoting the use of autonomous vehicles.",0968-090X,Not found
Missing data detection and imputation for urban ANPR system using an iterative tensor decomposition approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.013,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system has been widely implemented as an important part of intelligent transportation system (ITS). However, similar to other traffic monitoring devices, missing data is a common and critical problem in the ANPR system. To solve the missing data problem, numerous tensor-based methods have been proposed in previous studies. Most of them, however, assume that where and when missing data occur in the dataset are known. This would be impractical, because missing data may occur randomly. In this study, we propose a novel tensor-based algorithm, specifically, an iterative tensor decomposition (ITD) approach, that utilizes multidimensional inherent correlation of traffic data to detect and impute missing data in the ANPR system. The proposed algorithm is tested with a real-world ANPR system dataset. The experimental results show that missing data from the ANPR system can be classified into three cases, i.e., no missing, random elements missing, and extreme missing.

A machine learning approach to air traffic interdependency modelling and its application to trajectory prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.015,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Air Traffic Management is evolving towards a Trajectory-Based Operations paradigm. Trajectory prediction will hold a key role supporting its deployment, but it is limited by a lack of understanding of air traffic associated uncertainties, specifically contextual factors. Trajectory predictors are usually based on modelling aircraft dynamics based on intrinsic aircraft features. These aircraft operate within a known air route structure and under given meteorological conditions. However, actual aircraft trajectories are modified by the air traffic control depending on potential conflicts with other traffics. This paper introduces surrounding air traffic as a feature for ground-based trajectory prediction. The introduction of air traffic as a contextual factor is addressed by identifying aircraft which are likely to lose the horizontal separation. For doing so, this paper develops a probabilistic horizontal interdependency measure between aircraft supported by machine learning algorithms, addressing time separations at crossing points. Then, vertical profiles of flight trajectories are characterised depending on this factor and other intrinsic features. The paper has focused on the descent phase of the trajectories, using datasets corresponding to an en-route Spanish airspace volume. The proposed interdependency measure demonstrates to identify in advance conflicting situations between pairs of aircraft for this use case. This is validated by identifying associated air traffic control actions upon them and their impact on the vertical profile of the trajectories. Finally, a trajectory predictor for the vertical profile of the trajectory is developed, considering the interdependency measure and other operational factors. The paper concludes that the air traffic can be included as a factor for the trajectory prediction, impacting on the location of the top of descent for the specific case which has been studied.",0968-090X,Not found

A sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism forms the backbone of this framework. The sequence to sequence model consists of an encoder network and a decoder network, making it good at modeling sequential data with varying lengths and the attention mechanism further enhances its ability to capture long-range dependencies. We use the proposed framework to predict the number of passengers alighting at each station in the near future, given the number of passengers boarding at each station in the last few short-term periods. The large quantities of real-world data collected from Singapore’s metro system are used to validate the proposed model.

A decomposition-based heuristic is adopted to find a near-optimal solution to the MILP in a real-size network. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted using the VISSIM simulator to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by comparing it with some existing approaches. Simulation results show that the timing plan derived from NMBSC can improve the network-level performance under both uniform and non-uniform demand patterns in terms of average delay and average number of stops.

By collecting data from 25 in-depth laddering interviews in Germany and applying means-end chain analysis, we qualitatively explore the overarching motivational structures underlying consumers’ perception of autonomous driving with Level 5 automation. The results show three overarching motives: self-fulfillment, security and responsibility. Self-fulfillment relates to the meaningful utilization of disposable driving time for enhancing career success, nurturing social connections, and enhancing one’s quality of life. Security includes the desire for improvements in personal integrity and the fear of insufficient safety while driving fully autonomously. Responsibility expresses the longing to behave in a responsible manner and the fear of accountability for the actions of autonomous vehicles.

Traffic control which maximises network throughput: Some simple examples,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.025,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This paper seeks traffic signal control policies which maximise long-run network throughput when demand is within network capacity and also when demand is beyond network capacity. The paper considers smooth versions of two well-known responsive traffic signal control policies: the P 0 policy (see Smith, 1979b, 1980 or Smith et al., 2015) and the maxpressure or MP policy (see Varaiya, 2013a). The paper gives two simple example networks where both of these smooth responsive traffic control policies give rise to decreasing throughput for increasing demands; when these demands are beyond the network capacity. The paper then suggests a simple modification of the two responsive traffic control policies and shows that the two modified policies do maximise the long run throughput of the two signal-controlled networks; both when a steady input demand D is within network capacity and also when a steady demand exceeds network capacity. The modified version of P 0 is as follows: for a certain positive number K, for D ⩽ K use responsive policy P 0 , and for D > K use the green-times generated by P 0 when D = K . Thus in this modification the green-time proportions generated by responsive P 0 are frozen as demand passes through K; and remain fixed for all demands D which exceed K. The paper shows that the above modification when applied to a continuous version of MP also maximises throughput in both networks for all values of the steady demand D. Finally the paper considers a signal controlled network with route choice. It is shown that if routes are chosen by travellers in their own best interests then the continuous version of MP does not always maximise throughput, even if the constant input demand D is within the network capacity, but P 0 does always maximise throughput, even when the constant input demand D is beyond the network capacity.",0968-090X,Not found

Then the basic microscopic behavior, car-following (CF), is trained within this framework. In addition, theoretical analysis and experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed reward functions for accelerating training using DRL. The results show that on the premise of driving comfort, the efficiency of the trained AV increases 7.9% and 3.8% respectively compared to the classical adaptive cruise control models, intelligent driver model and constant-time headway policy. Moreover, on a more complex three-lane section, we trained an integrated model combining both CF and lane-changing behavior, with the average speed further growing 2.4%.

Providing public transport priority in the perimeter of urban networks: A bimodal strategy,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.004,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Bimodal urban networks are complex systems operating within multiple constraints. This paper develops an integrated and systematic framework for the optimization of bimodal urban networks using 3D-MFDs, considering the complexities of bimodality. With the proposed framework, effective strategies can be designed for the planning, management, and control of bimodal networks. In particular, strategies to provide public transport priority on the network level can be holistically evaluated. We apply this methodological framework to propose, model, and analyze one such strategy to provide public transport priority in the perimeter of urban networks. The proposed strategy addresses a pressing problem of the existing perimeter control (i.e. gating) schemes: public transport vehicles will be queuing with the cars in the perimeter and hence blocked from entering the network. This impairs the service quality of public transport. Adopting our proposed strategy, the inflows of public transport and cars can be regulated independently (i.e. both inflows are controllable), the network traffic can be managed more efficiently, and public transport priority can be provided. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated both analytically and with simulations. Results show that the proposed strategy always performs better than existing perimeter control schemes in terms of passenger mobility. Most importantly, it differentiates the public transport mode and the car mode, with much smaller queueing time outside the network for public transport. This can shift the transportation system to a more sustainable state in the long run. Policy recommendations are provided for a large range of traffic scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found
Comparing the route-choice behavior of pedestrians around obstacles in a virtual experiment and a field study,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.012,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Pedestrians often need to decide between different routes they can use to reach their intended destinations, both during emergencies and in their daily lives. This route-choice behavior is important in determining traffic management, evacuation efficiency and building design. Here, we use field observations and a virtual experiment to study the route choice behavior of pedestrians around obstacles delimiting exit routes and examine the influence of three factors, namely the local distance to route starting points and the pedestrian density and walking speeds along routes. Crucially, both field study and virtual experiment consider the same scenario which allows us to directly assess the validity of testing pedestrian behavior in virtual environments. We find that in both data sets the proportion of people who choose a closer exit route increases as the difference in distance between exit route starting points increases. Pedestrians’ choices in our data also depend on pedestrian density along routes, with people preferring less used routes. Our results thus confirm previously established route choice mechanisms and we can predict over 74% of choices based on these factors. The qualitative agreement in results between the field study and the virtual experiment suggests that in simple route-choice scenarios, such as the one we investigate here, virtual experiments can be a valid experimental technique for studying pedestrian behavior. We therefore provide much-needed empirical support for the emerging paradigm of experiments in virtual environments.",0968-090X,Not found
Data-driven predictive maintenance scheduling policies for railways,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.020,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Inspection and maintenance activities are essential to preserving safety and cost-effectiveness in railways. However, the stochastic nature of railway defect occurrence is usually ignored in literature; instead, defect stochasticity is considered independently of maintenance scheduling. This study presents a new approach to predict rail and geometry defects that relies on easy-to-obtain data and integrates prediction with inspection and maintenance scheduling activities. In the proposed approach, a novel use of risk-averse and hybrid prediction methodology controls the underestimation of defects. Then, a discounted Markov decision process model utilizes these predictions to determine optimal inspection and maintenance scheduling policies. Furthermore, in the presence of capacity constraints, Whittle indices via the multi-armed restless bandit formulation dynamically provide the optimal policies using the updated transition kernels. Results indicate a high accuracy rate in prediction and effective long-term scheduling policies that are adaptable to changing conditions.",0968-090X,Not found
DSRC-based rear-end collision warning system – An error-component safety distance model and field test,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.002,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology can provide drivers with information about other vehicles that are beyond the normal range of vision and enables the development of driving support systems such as the rear-end collision warning system (ReCWS). However, technology constraints such as communication delays and GPS error affect the accuracy of a DSRC-based ReCWS. This paper proposes a ReCWS design that explicitly represents functional specifications of DSRC technology, including transmission delay specifications that describe the information transmission process and an error-component safety distance specification used to represent the effect of GPS error and the information propagation delay. We propose three collision warning strategies each with different deceleration requirements. The system is assembled with off-the-shelf DSRC and mobile technology that can be readily installed into test vehicles. To test the effectiveness of the proposed ReCWS, we ran a variety of controlled scenarios on a test track. The results show a high degree of warning accuracy. These field test results also provide calibrated system parameter values for future studies and designs of DSRC-based ReCWSs.",0968-090X,Not found
Quantifying what goes unseen in instrumented and autonomous vehicle perception sensor data – A case study,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.024,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"It is becoming common to use instrumented probe vehicles (IPV) equipped with perception sensors (e.g., LIDAR or radar) to monitor ambient traffic for empirical studies of traffic dynamics and driver behavior, while the rapidly advancing field of autonomous vehicles (AV) uses perception sensors to identify and mitigate hazards. Yet the perception sensors are far from perfect, so targets of interest go undetected. The “unseen” targets might lead to inaccurate theories of traffic flow or worse, autonomous vehicle crashes. The challenge with the unseen targets is that it is difficult to detect the absence. There is little study of how vehicle-mounted perception sensors perform “in the wild” because often the perception sensors themselves usually provide the best measurements available. The focus of this work is IPV data for offline study, but the general findings are also relevant for perception sensors used in AV applications. While there is a growing number of IPV data sets, to date most suffer from the lack of independent validation of the perception sensors. This paper fuses individual vehicle actuations from loop detectors and concurrent ambient vehicle trajectories collected from an IPV to provide a rare opportunity to assess the perception sensor performance in situ, using the loop detector data to “see” what is missed by the perception sensors. While the specific results are unique to the IPV, one should expect similar biases from other perception sensor data; though without an independent measure like the loop detectors in this study, it will be difficult to quantify what goes unseen in those data sets. These findings also highlight the need to develop means to actively calibrate mobile perception sensors for AV's. It is important to capture the behavior of these systems in situ, as maintained by private owners, though we envision in the case of an AV the role of the loop detectors might be replaced with localization information from other AV's. The data fusion has added benefits for the study of traffic dynamics, with the loop detectors providing continuous monitoring at the detector locations and the IPV providing spatially rich information about the ambient traffic as it travels between detector stations. This fused data set will be available upon publication.",0968-090X,Not found
Various methods for queue length and traffic volume estimation using probe vehicle trajectories,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.008,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The rapid development of connected vehicle technology and the emergence of ride-hailing services have enabled the collection of a tremendous amount of probe vehicle trajectory data. Due to the large scale, the trajectory data have become a potential substitute for the widely used fixed-location sensors in terms of the performance measures of transportation networks. Specifically, for traffic volume and queue length estimation, most of the trajectory data based methods in the existing literature either require high market penetration of the probe vehicles to identify the shockwave or require the prior information about the queue length distribution and the penetration rate, which may not be feasible in the real world. To overcome the limitations of the existing methods, this paper proposes a series of novel methods based on probability theory. By exploiting the stopping positions of the probe vehicles in the queues, the proposed methods try to establish and solve a single-variable equation for the penetration rate of the probe vehicles. Once the penetration rate is obtained, it can be used to project the total queue length and the total traffic volume. The validation results using both simulation data and real-world data show that the methods would be accurate enough for assistance in performance measures and traffic signal control at intersections, even when the penetration rate of the probe vehicles is very low.",0968-090X,Not found
An approach to improve the operational stability of a bus line by adjusting bus speeds on the dedicated bus lanes,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.001,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Bus bunching and the unevenly dispersed buses along a bus line commonly appear in an unstable high-frequency bus line system. They will lead to unreliable transit service and long waiting times for many passengers. To resist bus bunching and improve the stability of a bus line, researchers proposed some methods of adjusting the cruising speeds of buses. But their methods generally need to adjust the speeds in all road segments included in the bus line and sometimes need to coordinate the speeds of successively cruising buses. These requirements impede their implementations in practice. This paper presents a new strategy to overcome the above obstacles by adjusting the speeds of buses in the dedicated bus lanes. The regulating speed will be determined by looking multiple critical time points ahead to estimate the influence of the chosen speed. Numerical experiments show that the new strategy can not only stabilize a strongly unstable bus line but also shorten the waiting and riding times of passengers. Several insights have also been uncovered during numerical analyses. a. The set of regulating speeds used by an effective speed adjustment strategy should include refined elements and has a wide range for the values of its elements. b. Only with nonnegative elements in the above set, the strategy will be out of work. c. The more dedicated bus lanes in a bus line, the more effective the strategy becomes. The negligible computational time to supply the proper regulating speed makes the implementation of our strategy practical.",0968-090X,Not found
Shared autonomous vehicle simulation and service design,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.006,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Today, driverless cars, as a new technology that allows a more accessible, dynamic and intelligent form of Shared Mobility, are expected to revolutionize urban transportation. One of the conceivable mobility services based on driverless cars is shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). This service could merge cabs, carsharing, and ridesharing systems into a singular transportation mode. However, the success and competitiveness of future SAV services depend on their operational models, which are linked intrinsically to the service configuration and fleet specification. In addition, any change in operational models will result in a different demand. Using a comprehensive framework of SAV simulation in a multimodal dynamic demand system with integrated SAV user taste variation, this study evaluates the performance of various SAV fleets and vehicle capacities serving travelers across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. Also, the impact of ridesharing and rebalancing strategies on service performance is investigated. Research results suggest that the performance of SAV is strongly correlated with the fleet size and the strategy of individual or shared rides. Further analysis indicates that for the pricing scheme proposed in this study (i.e., 20% lower for ridesharing scenario), the standard 4-seats car with shared ride remains the best option among all scenarios. The results also underline that enabling vehicle-rebalancing strategies may have an important effect on both user and service-related metrics.

Energy-oriented cruising strategy design of vehicle platoon considering communication delay and disturbance,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.019,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This paper presents a discrete control framework for a homogeneous vehicle platoon, which can minimize the energy consumption of each vehicle while ensuring the platoon string stability under external interference and communication delay. First, a novel variable spacing strategy named as the energy-oriented spacing policy is proposed by comparing the geometry relationship of each vehicle which drives at energy-optimal speed and the ideal speed under the constant spacing policy. Then, based on the energy-oriented spacing policy, the dynamics of a homogeneous discrete vehicle platoon composed of several pure electric vehicles are built, including the communication delay and external disturbance. Second, a discrete robust platoon controller that can reduce the conservatism of the control system is designed based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem and H ∞ method, which drives each vehicle at their energy-optimal speed while ensuring the string stability of platoon under communication delays and interferences. Third, the L 2 -based string stability of the discrete platoon is defined, and its string-stable criterion is given under communication delays and external disturbances. Simulation results indicate that the proposed energy-oriented spacing policy and the discrete controller can enable efficient driving of each vehicle while ensuring the platoon string stability. The energy consumption of the whole platoon is, respectively, reduced by 7.3% and 5.7% compared to the vehicle platoon controllers with constant spacing policy and constant time headway policy.",0968-090X,Not found
Risk-based autonomous vehicle motion control with considering human driver's behaviour,10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.003,107,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The selected motions of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are subject to the constraints from the surrounding traffic environment, infrastructure and the vehicle’s dynamic capabilities. Normally, the motion control of the vehicle is composed of trajectory planning and trajectory following according to the surrounding risk factors, the vehicles’ capabilities as well as tyre/road interaction situations. However, pure trajectory following with a unique path may make the motion control of the vehicle be too careful and cautious with a large amount of steering effort. To follow a planned trajectory, the AVs with the traditional path-following control algorithms will correct their states even if the vehicles have only a slight deviation from the desired path or the vehicle detects static infrastructure like roadside trees. In this case, the safety of the AVs can be guaranteed to some degree, but the comfort and sense of hazards for the drivers are ignored, and sometimes the AVs have unusual motion behaviours which may not be acceptable to other road users. To solve this problem, this study aims to develop a safety corridor-based vehicle motion control approach by investigating human-driven vehicle behaviour and the vehicle’s dynamic capabilities. The safety corridor is derived by the manoeuvring action feedback of actual drivers as collected in a driving simulator when presented with surrounding risk elements and enables the AVs to have safe trajectories within it. A corridor-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has been developed which controls the vehicle state to achieve a smooth and comfortable trajectory while applying trajectory constraints using the safety corridor. The safety corridor and motion controller are assessed using four typical scenarios to show that the vehicle has a human-like or human-oriented behaviour which is expected to be more acceptable for both drivers and other road users.",0968-090X,Not found

Parallel shuttle bus service design for planned mass rapid transit shutdown: The Singapore experience,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.022,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"19 MRT stations in Singapore experienced a two full-day shutdown as planned in order to upgrade the infrastructure of aging mass rapid transit (MRT) lines. A large bus fleet, running entirely parallel to MRT lines, was deployed to ferry passengers between affected stations, which however results in prolonged congestion and queue of buses near terminals. Rail transit systems in many metropolitan areas are threatened because of aging infrastructure. This study, motivated by the Singapore case, proposes a novel parallel shuttle bus service design (PSBSD) problem that addresses route design, terminal selection, berth allocation, and bus deployment to minimize inconvenience caused to passengers, which is seldom addressed in previous studies. We further develop a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the PSBSD problem. In order to solve the non-convex MINLP model optimally, we put forward an effective decomposition method, which comprises (i) the generation of candidate shuttle bus routes through a brute-force search for semi-route and a terminal selection procedure and (ii) the deployment of buses and assignment of terminal berths for selected shuttle bus routes by using an optimization-based approach. Numerical experiments were conducted using data sets from the MRT closure incident in Singapore. The results demonstrate that the decomposition method is capable of finding optimal solutions.

Therefore, this paper proposes a low-frequency probe vehicle data (PVD)-based method to identify turn-level intersection traffic congestion in an urban road network. This method initially divides an urban area into meter-scale square cells and maps PVD into those cells and then identifies the cells that correspond to road intersections by taking advantage of the fixed-location stop-and-go characteristics of traffic passing through intersections. With those rasterized road intersections, the proposed method recognizes probe vehicles’ turning directions and provides preliminary analysis of traffic conditions at all turning directions. The proposed method is map-independent (i.e., no digital map is needed) and computationally efficient and is able to rapidly screen most of the intersections for turn-level congestion in a road network. Thereby, this method is expected to greatly decrease traffic engineers’ workloads by providing information regarding where and when to investigate and solve traffic congestion problems.",0968-090X,Not found

Modeling effects of travel time reliability on mode choice using cumulative prospect theory,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.014,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"This paper utilizes the well-known Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) to study how travel mode choice is affected by travel time reliability. Prospect Theory (PT) was originally developed to model decision making under risk, and later extended to CPT, which is also applicable to decision making under uncertainty. Travel time reliability is related to uncertainties in travel time, and its effect on travel behavior can be properly modeled using CPT. PT and CPT applications in transportation are mainly limited to experimental studies. This paper introduces a CPT-based framework for mode choice modeling using observational data. The framework can help travel demand modelers utilize CPT for modeling reliability in their trip-based or activity-based models, which are typically estimated from observational data (household travel surveys). To showcase model applications, the model parameters are estimated using a combination of revealed preference household travel survey data and empirically observed travel time data for a mode choice scenario in the Washington, D.C. area. We estimated the parameters of the utility function, the parameters of the CPT value function, and the parameters of the CPT weighting function and discussed how they imply diminishing sensitivity, risk-aversion in small probability losses, and risk-seeking in high-probability losses.

A novel generative adversarial network for estimation of trip travel time distribution with trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.019,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Knowledge of trip travel times serves an important role in transportation management and control. Existing travel time estimation approaches generally cover empirical ones, statistical ones and hybrid ones. Despite strong tractability, the empirical approaches cannot sufficiently capture diverse travel time distributions (TTDs) and often encounter some issues (e.g., assumption of a predefined distribution, failure of significance tests). Statistical and hybrid methods possess better generalization in estimating heterogeneous TTDs, but fail to model the network-wide spatiotemporal correlations, which have been found useful in the TTD estimation. To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep learning based Trip Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (T-InfoGAN). In this method, the trip TTD is estimated by modeling the joint distribution of travel times of two successive links with the consideration of network-wide spatiotemporal correlations. Meanwhile, a dynamic clustering with Wasserstein distance (DCWD) algorithm is used to explore the traffic state transitions for link pairs and cluster the link pairs with similar TTDs into one group, which benefits the training and estimation processes of T-InfoGAN. Then, based on GPS trajectory data from Didi Chuxing in Chengdu city, China, numerical results show that the T-InfoGAN with DCWD can well estimate three mini trip TTDs with various features, and performs better than three other counterparts (i.e., Convolution method, MC-Grid method, and MC-GMMS method) in estimating the TTDs of two longer trips. In summary, this study is the first successful try to estimate trip TTDs within the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and the deep learning based T-InfoGAN is a promising approach to estimate heterogeneous trip TTDs with the better generalization and flexibility in the big data era.",0968-090X,Not found
Autonomous driving and residential location preferences: Evidence from a stated choice survey,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.018,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The literature suggests that autonomous vehicles (AVs) may drastically change the user experience of private automobile travel by allowing users to engage in productive or relaxing activities while travelling. As a consequence, the generalised cost of car travel may decrease, and car users may become less sensitive to travel time.

This paper seeks to advance the understanding of the potential impacts of AVs on travel behaviour and land use by investigating stated preferences for combinations of residential locations and travel options for the commute in the context of autonomous automobile travel. Our analysis draws from a stated preference survey, which was completed by 512 commuters from the Sydney metropolitan area in Australia and provides insights into travel time valuations in a long-term decision-making context.

On the needs for MaaS platforms to handle competition in ridesharing mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.021,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Ridesharing has been emerging as a new type of mobility. However, the early promises of ridesharing for alleviating congestion in cities may be undermined by a number of challenges, including the growing number of proposed services and the subsequent increasing number of vehicles, as a natural consequence of competition. In this work, we present optimization-based approaches to model cooperation and competition between multiple ridesharing companies, in a real-time on-demand setting. A recent trend relies on solving the integrated combination of Dial-A-Ride Problems (DARP), which compute the cost of assigning incoming requests to vehicle routes, plus Linear Assignment Problems (LAP), which assign vehicles to requests. While the DARPs, are solved at the level of the vehicles of each company, we introduce cooperative and competitive approaches to solve the LAP. The cooperative model, which could make use of Mobility as a Service platforms, is shown to solve the LAP to optimality following closely results from the literature, and limiting the amount of information the companies are required to share. We investigate how a realistic model of competition deviates from this optimality and provide worst case bounds. We evaluate these models with respect to a centralized model on one-week instances of the New York City taxi dataset. Model variants coping with noise in the travel time estimations, bias in the assignment costs, and preferences in the competitive case are also presented and validated. The computational results suggest that cooperation among ridesharing companies can be conducted in such a way to limit the degradation of the level of service with respect to a centralized model.

To understand how UAS operations near roadways influence the visual attention of drivers, an experiment was designed and conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Thirty participants completed the experiment in the driving simulator and their visual attention was recorded. Analysis of the visual attention results showed that UAS operations draw more visual attention from drivers when they are directly adjacent to the roadside or in a rural environment. Based on the results, a recommended policy to improve safety of UASs for operators and drivers would be to, at a minimum, restrict UAS operations within 7.6 m (25 ft) of the edge of a lane.

A generalized Bayesian traffic model,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.011,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The rapid growth of transportation data offers new opportunities to analyze the interaction between travel behavior and transportation system performance, and particularly when issues such as uncertainty and reliability are considered. Many previous studies in this area described the stationary behavior of stochastic transportation systems using user equilibrium (UE) conditions. In contrast, this paper develops a generalized Bayesian model to analyze the dynamic behavior of stochastic transportation systems. In the proposed model, the variability of link volume and travel time stems from the stochasticity in travel demand, transportation supply (e.g. link capacity, free flow travel time, etc.) and route choice. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first work that considers the three sources of stochasticity simultaneously. In addition, we propose a Bayesian updating approach based on the Dirichlet model to describe the route choice behavior. This approach allows researchers to consider a wide range of route choice behavior of bounded rationality in day-to-day traffic dynamics, including a knowledge updating mechanism based on different memory lengths and weighting factors. This framework is particularly suitable for data-driven studies supported by emerging transportation data due to the computing efficiency of the Dirichlet-based Bayesian updating mechanism and the sound behavioral foundation. This paper shows that the proposed Bayesian model with infinite memory leads to UE conditions under stochastic demand and supply. Subsequently, a numerical case study is conducted to illustrate different day-to-day route choice dynamics with different memory lengths of system performance. This paper also discusses the influence of the three sources of stochasticity towards the aggregated variance of link volumes and travel time. With enough longitudinal travel choice and transportation system performance data, the proposed Bayesian framework could be empirically calibrated and tested, which offers an attractive descriptive alternative to the conventional UE-based transportation system models.",0968-090X,Not found

Then, an unsupervised clustering method is developed to gather these driving primitives into groups (called driving patterns) by integrating with dynamic time warping. In addition, the extracted driving primitives are used to quantitatively analyze the similarities between behaviors at different intersections using a relative entropy metric, i.e., KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence. Finally, 706 naturalistic V2V events from eight typical urban signalized intersections are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed primitive-based framework.

What contributes to driving behavior prediction at unsignalized intersections?,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.010,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Safely passing through unsignalized intersections (USI) in urban area is challenging for autonomous vehicles due to high uncertainties of surrounding engaged human-driven vehicles. In order to achieve this, various variables have been selected to estimate and predict the surrounding human driver's behavior. However, it is still not fully clear what variables mostly contribute to driving behavior prediction at USI. This paper investigates the contribution levels of 13 features of human driver's decision-making at USI using a random forest approach. Thirty skilled driver participants are tested in a real-time driving simulator where the traffic scenarios with merging vehicles were designed in different motion styles to mimic real traffic. The experiment results indicate that the relative distance and velocity between merging vehicles have a wider contribution range (i.e., −0.4 −0.4) than the absolute velocity and distance features (i.e., −0.2 −0.2) to predict driver behavior. The contribution also varies over the selected feature values and driving conditions. This contribution research gains insight in the influence of different variables on driver behavior prediction at USI, thereby assisting researchers in selecting representative features in self-driving applications.",0968-090X,Not found
Generating pedestrian walking behavior considering detour and pause in the path under space-time constraints,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.005,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Recently, the demand for public open spaces in cities including pedestrian-oriented streets, squares, and plazas has been growing, for better social and psychological health of modern communities. To create lively public spaces, understanding various pedestrian behaviors has been increasing in importance. For example, we need to consider pedestrians’ behavior taking a detour to see beautiful scenery or stopping a walk to watch a street performance, in addition to usual goal-oriented behavior. Recent massive trajectory data from location-aware technologies, such as GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technology, makes data-driven approaches promising. Inverse reinforcement learning, one of the data-driven approaches, is a powerful tool to infer the utility function with respect to points of interest (POI) from observed pedestrian trajectories. This approach can generate trajectories based on attractiveness of the open space with any POI distributions because the attractiveness is represented by the utility functions of the POIs. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach to generate the various trajectories. The first step infers the utility functions of the POIs and stochastic policy by inverse reinforcement learning, and the second step generates trajectories under the constraints on given destinations and arrival time. We numerically demonstrated that our approach generated not only goal-oriented but also detour-and-pause behaviors under given destination and time constraints in two types of environments representing an open public space.",0968-090X,Not found
Trajectory analysis for on-demand services: A survey focusing on spatial-temporal demand and supply patterns,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.007,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"With the development of information technique and wireless communication, a vast number of taxis' and ride-sharing cars' trajectory data that provide a rich and detailed source to study on-demand services have been collected. The increasing available trajectory data bring benefits and new challenges to the studies of on-demand services. To provide an overview of the benefits and challenges brought by the trajectory data, we provide a survey on recent studies of trajectory analysis (refer to analyzing trajectory datasets) for on-demand services in this paper. Our purposes are at least trifold. First, we highlight the value of trajectory data in understanding on-demand services and discuss the procedures of retrieving information for the demand part and the supply part from raw trajectory data. Second, we categorize related studies into three parts (the demand part, the supply part, and the mixed part) and review the significant findings. For the demand part, we focus on the models proposed for describing and explaining the spatial-temporal characteristics of observed trips. Methods or models proposed for describing trip statistics, scaling laws of trips, and dynamics of ridership are reviewed. We summarize four types of factors that influence the spatial-temporal patterns of demands. For the supply part, we focus on the models proposed for describing the spatial-temporal characteristics of available taxis/ride-sharing cars and modeling the behavior of drivers (i.e., passenger-search behavior and route choice behavior) to explain the spatial-temporal patterns of taxi/ride-sharing supplies.

Optimization of traffic count locations for estimation of travel demands with covariance between origin-destination flows,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.004,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Vehicular traffic between different Origin-Destination (OD) pairs for a typical hourly period may statistically correlate with each other. The covariance mainly generated from the daily variation of travel patterns, network topology, and trip chaining activities of household members can be particularly high during the morning peak hour.

The mathematical properties of this proposed criterion are analyzed to better understand the relationship between the estimation errors of mean and covariance of OD demands. This paper aims to investigate how to optimize the traffic count locations for minimizing the weighted maximum deviation of estimated mean and covariance of OD demands from the “true” values. To consider the effects of stochastic OD demands on the traffic count location problem in the proposed model, link choice proportions are regarded as stochastic variables and updated by an adapted traffic flow simulator in this study. Both the weighted-sum approach and bi-objective approach are examined with the adaption of the firefly algorithm (FA) to solve the single-objective and bi-objective problems.

An effective spatial-temporal attention based neural network for traffic flow prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.008,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Due to its importance in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), traffic flow prediction has been the focus of many studies in the last few decades. Existing traffic flow prediction models mainly extract static spatial-temporal correlations, although these correlations are known to be dynamic in traffic networks. Attention-based models have emerged in recent years, mostly in the field of natural language processing, and have resulted in major progresses in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. This inspires us to introduce the application of attentions for traffic flow prediction. In this study, a deep learning based traffic flow predictor with spatial and temporal attentions (STANN) is proposed. The spatial and temporal attentions are used to exploit the spatial dependencies between road segments and temporal dependencies between time steps respectively.

Examining the case for long-range battery electric vehicles with a generalized description of driving patterns,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.003,108,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Usage data from fleets of instrumented vehicles in several US cities have been used in numerous studies of the prospective costs, benefits and customer acceptance of battery-electric vehicles (BEV). In turn, the results of these studies can be used to design policies and strategies that promote electrification of personal transportation. Any broader application of the results of these regional studies carries the implicit assumption that vehicle usage in the affected population is similar to that of population selected for the underlying usage study. Given this projection of behavior from one population onto others, replacement of the raw usage data with a statistical representation of the heterogeneity of vehicle usage should be equally valid while reducing elaborate studies of large data sets to just a few equations and spreadsheet calculations. We demonstrate this analytic approach in a study of the trade-off between increasing cost and convenience of incremental all-electric range (AER), and the cost of fast chargers needed whenever range is insufficient for a given day of travel. Three scenarios are considered: (1) A single range was assigned to all vehicles regardless of individual usage, (2) a common tolerance for the frequency of charging away from home was ascribed to all users and the range computed accordingly, and (3) the range that minimized the combined cost of batteries and electricity was computed for each vehicle. All three methods suggest optimal fleet-average range of approximately 175 km. However, both the frequency of visits to fast-charging stations and the energy drawn from those chargers is reduced by allowing users to choose the range that best matches their needs. For example, allowing a choice of range that results in a fleet average range of 200 km in place of a common fixed range of 200 km, the frequency of visits to fast chargers is reduced by 25% and the energy drawn from those chargers is reduced by over 50%.

The analysis considers each driver as a Decision Making Unit (DMU) and aims to provide a relative safety efficiency measure to compare different drivers based on their driving performance. The last is defined based on a set of driving analytics (e.g. distance travelled, speed, accelerations, braking, cornering and smartphone usage) collected using an innovative data collection scheme, which is based on the continuous recording of driving behavior analytics in real time, using smartphone device sensors. Safety efficiency is examined in terms of speed limit violation, driving distraction, aggressiveness and safety on urban, rural and highway road and in an overall model. DEA models are identifying the most efficient drivers that lie on the efficiency frontier and act as peers for the rest of the non-efficient drivers. The proposed methodological framework is tested on data from fifty-six (56) drivers during a 7-months period. Findings help distinguish the most efficient drivers from those that are less efficient. Moreover, the efficient level of inputs and outputs to switch from non-efficiency to the efficiency frontier is identified. Results also provide a potential for classification of the driving sample based on drivers’ comparative safety efficiency. The main characteristics of the most and less efficient drivers are consequently analyzed and presented.

A state-constrained optimal control based trajectory planning strategy for cooperative freeway mainline facilitating and on-ramp merging maneuvers under congested traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.017,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper presents a trajectory planning strategy for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to cooperatively carry out mainline facilitating (i.e. gap development) and on-ramp merging maneuvers. The trajectory planning tasks of the mainline facilitating vehicle and the merging vehicle are formulated as two related optimal control problems. The motivation behind the proposed strategy is to restrain a facilitating maneuver’s impact on following traffic. To this end, the proposed strategy bounds the speed of the facilitating maneuver from below and meanwhile ensures that the task of gap development can still be fulfilled. Because of the existence of the speed bound, the optimal control problem of the facilitating vehicle becomes constrained in state, in addition to the control constraints. A Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) with state constraints is applied to rigorously derive the analytical solution. The main difficulty of the analytical procedure exists in the fact that the first-order necessary condition on the extremality of the Hamiltonian cannot yield useful information on the property of the optimal control history with regard to making the optimal speed trajectory to satisfy the speed constraint. As a result, additional conditions have to be explored, notably the so-called “jump conditions”, among others. Taking advantage of the analytical solution, the proposed strategy is then implemented under a model predictive control framework. Simulation assessments of the proposed strategy are conducted at two levels – individual vehicle level and traffic flow level. At the individual vehicle level, the proposed strategy shows potential to reduce the risk of rear-end collision between the facilitating vehicle and the following vehicle, the most vulnerable pair of vehicles under the influence of gap development. At the traffic flow level, coupled with Aimsun, the proposed strategy is assessed under mixed traffic flow conditions, with various penetration rates of CAVs. The results show that it has potential to generate lower speed variations of traffic flow, a critical factor in traffic flow safety. Meanwhile it does not show negative impact on traffic efficiency in the simulation, and is likely to improve traffic efficiency in the real world. A sensitivity analysis of the effect of the facilitating maneuver’s lower speed bound is also conducted. Although there exist several limitations with this study, it sheds some light on future research.",0968-090X,Not found
Evaluation of machine learning methodologies to predict stop delivery times from GPS data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.018,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"In last mile distribution, logistics companies typically arrange and plan their routes based on broad estimates of stop delivery times (i.e., the time spent at each stop to deliver goods to final receivers). If these estimates are not accurate, the level of service is degraded, as the promised time window may not be satisfied. The purpose of this work is to assess the feasibility of machine learning techniques to predict stop delivery times. This is done by testing a wide range of machine learning techniques (including different types of ensembles) to (1) predict the stop delivery time and (2) to determine whether the total stop delivery time will exceed a predefined time threshold (classification approach). For the assessment, all models are trained using information generated from GPS data collected in Medellín, Colombia and compared to hazard duration models. The results are threefold. First, the assessment shows that regression-based machine learning approaches are not better than conventional hazard duration models concerning absolute errors of the prediction of the stop delivery times. Second, when the problem is addressed by a classification scheme in which the prediction is aimed to guide whether a stop time will exceed a predefined time, a basic K-nearest-neighbor model outperforms hazard duration models and other machine learning techniques both in accuracy and F 1 score (harmonic mean between precision and recall). Third, the prediction of the exact duration can be improved by combining the classifiers and prediction models or hazard duration models in a two level scheme (first classification then prediction). However, the improvement depends largely on the correct classification (first level).",0968-090X,Not found

The proposed model considers the arrangement (order) of AVs and NVs in the mixed stream and the expected, the lowest, and the highest achievable headways and their variability are analytically derived. Moreover, the total delay of a two-lane road with interrupted traffic flow is analytically modeled for various possible lane allocation policies: (a) dedicated lanes, (b) mixed-mixed lanes, (c) mixed-NV lanes, and (d) mixed-AV lanes.

A bi-partitioning approach to congestion pattern recognition in a congested monocentric city,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.016,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper proposes a bi-partitioning approach using link density data to identify an optimal restricted zone (RZ) in a congested monocentric city to assist with the implementation of area-wide congestion management strategies. A composite similarity measure is developed for each link in the network as a weighted average of a density similarity measure (ensuring homogeneity) and a distance similarity measure (ensuring connectivity and compactness). The resulting similarity matrix is fed into a graph clustering method termed symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to bi-partition the network. To determine the optimal weight as a hyperparameter, we propose a hierarchical search algorithm (HSA) based on the concept of “knee” that is used to find the most significant solution from the Pareto front. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Melbourne network using a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model. Results show that the methodology (i) can effectively capture the spatial variations of the congestion pattern in the network; (ii) is robust to moderate parameter changes; (iii) can be extended to the time-dependent case and hence inform when to activate the area control; and (iv) can perform relatively well in the presence of missing data. When varying the distance threshold as a design parameter, we can observe how the optimal RZ evolves in space, a feature that is critical to devising a double- or multi-layered RZ for hierarchical control purposes.",0968-090X,Not found
A linear program for optimal integration of shared autonomous vehicles with public transit,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.007,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Use of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) for last-mile transportation can improve transit use and reduce road congestion. We investigate the problem of optimal integration of SAVs with transit. By optimal, we mean that transit should be used instead of or to complement SAVs only when it reduces the total system travel time. Although greater use of transit reduces congestion, transit often increases travel time due to frequent stops and transfers. By using a continuous approximation to passenger and vehicle movements, we formulate the problem as a linear program using the link transmission model for traffic flow. One of the main challenges is associating passenger movement with vehicles that can have different destinations (e.g. a transit stop). Although the mathematical program is linear, it nevertheless has a large number of variables. We find a suboptimal solution using a rolling horizon method, which greatly reduces the required computation time. We also demonstrate an example of a possibly unfair passenger-to-vehicle ordering, and propose a first-come-first-served greedy algorithm to match passengers. A suite of experimental results on the Sioux Falls network show that using transit decreases total system travel time, especially when SAV fleet sizes are small. Transit also decreases the time travelers spend waiting, but tends to increase in-vehicle travel time. The methodology could be useful both for future SAV operators and for planners seeking to predict the effects of SAVs on traffic congestion.",0968-090X,Not found

Four features are selected to generate an image for each taxi, namely, the cruising speed, the cruising ratio, the difference in demand-supply ratios and the next passenger trip distance. These features can be easily computed for each taxi search trip using widely available data sources. Sparse subspace clustering (SSC), an unsupervised learning algorithm, is introduced to identify search strategies embedded in the hunting images. The proposed methodology is experimented on a large-scale taxi trajectory dataset collected in Shenzhen, China across five months in 2016. Twenty four clusters corresponding to different search strategies are identified from 885 taxis. The differences in search strategies are linked to the operational efficiency and profitability of individual taxis. The results also reveal common search patterns in the taxi market of Shenzhen. Specifically, we find most taxis: (1) prefer to cruise in the same region after dropping off the last passenger; (2) have trouble finding passenger at midnight and early in the morning; and (3) tend to gather at the ports between Shenzhen and Hong Kong during peak periods to serve short-distance trips.",0968-090X,Not found

With the population of connected vehicles and intelligent mobility, high-resolution trajectory data provide new possibilities for signal control evaluation and optimization. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a new arterial coordination control model for two-way arterial progression solely using sampled trajectories. Sampled trajectories are first used to extract prior arrival information and queuing states. Then, vehicle arrival time at the stop-line at each intersection is estimated as the function of signal timing parameters and prior arrival rates based on the shockwave theory, considering different sampled trajectory statuses. The delay of each sample vehicle is thus obtained as the difference between the actual arrival time and the projected arrival time. Sum of the delays of all the sampled trajectories ever travelling on the mainline of the arterial is selected to be the optimization objective, and the optimization problem is solved through a multi-sub-swarm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. A simulation model is built to test the performance of the proposed model compared with the Synchro model and the MULTIBAND model under various demand scenarios.

Optimal design of promotion based demand management strategies in urban rail systems,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.008,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Travel demand management (TDM) is used for managing congestion in urban areas. While TDM is well studied for car traffic, its application in transit is still emerging. Well-structured transit TDM approaches can help agencies better manage the available system capacity when the opportunity and investment to expand are limited. However, transit systems are complex and the design of a TDM scheme, deciding when, where, and how much discount or surcharge is implemented, is not trivial. The paper proposes a general framework for the optimal design of promotion based TDM strategies in urban rail systems. The framework consists of two major components: network performance and optimization. The network performance model updates the origin-destination (OD) demand based on the response to the promotion strategy, assigns it to the network, and estimates performance metrics. The optimization model allocates resources to maximize promotion performance in a cost effective way by better targeting users whose behavioral response to the promotion improves system performance. The optimal design of promotion strategies is facilitated by the availability of smart card (automated fare collection, AFC) data. The proposed approach is demonstrated with data from a busy urban rail system.

In particular, we define a new variable of a vehicle’s order as its corresponding cumulative flows at different times and locations. The new kinematic wave model is consistent at the aggregate level with Newell’s simplified kinematic wave model, but allows for FIFO violation among individual vehicles. Based on the new model, we then present two algorithms to estimate vehicles’ trajectories from Eulerian data (cumulative flows provided by loop detectors) and Lagrangian data (the vehicle’s entry and exit times provided by reidentification technologies) at two boundaries of a road segment. In the first algorithm, we assume that vehicles follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle on a multi-lane road, and their orders are constant and equal the average of the entry and exit orders; in the second algorithm, we introduce a linear order-changing model to interpolate a vehicle’s orders at different times according to its entry and exit times. With Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) datasets, we demonstrate that both algorithms are effective, but the second one, with an estimation error of around 10%, greatly outperforms the first one, with an estimation error of around 13%.

This approach not only outperforms the recently developed real-time estimation of lane-based queue lengths but also captures the spatiotemporal attributes of traffic. There are three primary challenges to design a deep learning based queue estimation model. First, the CNN and the LSTM are integrated to estimate lane-based queue lengths minimizing accumulative counting errors. Furthermore, short-term arrival patterns and long-term traffic demand trends are captured by the LSTM to improve the accuracy of estimates of cycle-based proportional lane-uses.

The misconception that secondary incidents are not common has resulted in overlooking a look-ahead concept. This study is the pioneer in relaxing the structural assumptions of independency during the assignment of servers and approaching the challenge from an operational perspective, online optimization.

For the wide-track experiment, we examined global densities as high as 9 ped/m2. Our main findings were as follows. (i) The middle section of our unidirectional fundamental diagram exhibited a clear similarity to that of a single-file pedestrian flow, which enabled us to distinguish two different kinds of congested pedestrian flow. (ii) The unidirectional fundamental diagram for a high-density situation was quantitatively nearly the same as that observed in the empirical data. (iii) In the absence of a bottleneck, typical stop-and-go patterns did not emerge in the unidirectional flow on the 1.5-m track. Instead, some high-density clusters propagating downstream can be observed. (iv) In the bidirectional flow experiments, three different lane formation processes were observed. The processes were quite quick, even under very dense conditions. (v) When three lanes formed, the bidirectional flow rate was much larger than the unidirectional flow rate due to the inhomogeneous distribution of pedestrians across different lanes. (vi) At high densities, the unidirectional and bidirectional flow rates were nearly the same.

Collision risk management for non-cooperative UAS traffic in airport-restricted airspace with alert zones based on probabilistic conflict map,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.017,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Recent years have seen an increase in reported unmanned aerial systems (UAS) incursion into terminal airspace, likely due to the ease of access to recreational UAS to the general public with minimal understanding of aviation regulations. Such incursions often lead to extensive airport shutdowns due to safety concern and could cause a cascading disruption to airline operations throughout the region. A better assessment tool for the collision risk between the existing air traffic and such non-cooperative intruder could help reduce unnecessary disruption while maintaining safety to air traffic operations. While advancements have been made in the past decade in detection and avoidance of UAS traffics, the systems depend on either having fully cooperative traffic or sensor capability beyond what is currently available. This paper seeks to assess the collision risk posed by an intruding UAS within the airport-restricted “terminal airspace,” in the Singapore context, with minimal information on the UAS. This was done through probabilistic conflict prediction with Monte-Carlo simulations under the assumption of a worst-case scenario involving a non-cooperative intruder traveling directly towards the flight corridor. Alert Zones within the existing 5 km terminal airspace could be constructed using the collision prediction models to help air traffic controllers quickly identifying UAS that poses a threat under most circumstances, with the information passed on to the pilot for mitigation actions. Simulations were conducted for a number of conflict-pairs to investigate how the resulting Alert Zones differ. Finally, this paper also investigates how the incorporation of UAS tracking information, under the current reliability level, could be used to augment the collision prediction algorithm and its effect on the management of collision risks in terminal airspace. The result suggested that the method that utilizes the most available information for UAS path modeling could be used with the currently available sensors to produce acceptable collision prediction results.",0968-090X,Not found
Application of merging optimization to an arrival manager algorithm considering trajectory-based operations,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.015,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"An arrival manager (AMAN) is a support system for air traffic controllers in the airspace near an airport. The AMAN assists the air traffic controller in facilitating efficient arrival sequences and arrival times to ensure smooth arrival traffic. Although the aircraft sequencing problem that optimizes the arrival sequence has already been studied for the AMAN algorithm, the AMAN algorithm must also optimize aircraft trajectories to accommodate trajectory-based operations. This study proposes a novel AMAN algorithm based on the merging optimization method. Although the merging optimization method can simultaneously optimize the arrival sequence and trajectory, it cannot be easily applied to a realistic AMAN algorithm. Thus, the receding horizon approach is employed here to apply the merging optimization method to the AMAN algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed AMAN algorithm, numerical simulations are conducted. Actual radar data are used to conduct realistic air traffic simulations and evaluate the AMAN algorithm. A conventional AMAN algorithm is also simulated for comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed AMAN algorithm reduces both the total flight time and fuel consumption of all aircraft compared with the conventional AMAN algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed AMAN algorithm reveals the trade-off relationship between the minimization of flight time and fuel consumption.",0968-090X,Not found
Real-time schedule adjustments for autonomous public transport vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.004,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"New advanced technologies have made it possible to deal with real-time schedule adjustments of public transport (PT) service. Indeed, using autonomous public transport vehicles (APTVs) prudently can result in significant improvements in the reliability, efficiency, and attractiveness of PT. The lack of human drivers and the feasible control strategies of the APTVs make it possible to offer a reliable, efficient and attractive service that can handle, in real time, the fluctuations in passenger demand. This work assumes that the APTVs of a single line are controlled centrally and are responsive to real-time requests from passengers. As the result, a real-time schedule can be constructed and communicated to the passengers. However, during the actual operations, the real-time demand will be fluctuated entailing schedule adjustments. These adjustments are optimized in this work using two operational strategies for the APTVs: holding and speed changing. The solution methodology proposed is based on time-space graphical techniques using multi-criteria decision analysis to minimize schedule changes as the primary objective, as well as to reduce travel time and active energy consumption. Two multi-objective models are developed for not-considered and considered vehicle capacity and then examined using a simulation framework. A case study from Auckland, New Zealand, is selected, which assumes that ordinary buses are replaced with APTVs. The results indicate that the strategy-based optimal schedule adjustments achieve a 100% elimination of schedule deviations compared with 33-minute and 13-minute deviations for the low-demand and high-demand scenarios of the ordinary PT service, respectively. The results of the simulated case study indicate that the incorporation of APTVs, along with prudent control, can result in a more attractive PT service.",0968-090X,Not found
Cycle-based queue length estimation considering spillover conditions based on low-resolution point detector data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.003,109,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Queue length is vitally important for signal control optimization and congestion management of urban arterials. Due to the existence of mutual influence of neighboring intersections, cycle-by-cycle estimation of queue length under spillover conditions remains a challenging problem given low-resolution detector data. On most urban arterials in China, point detectors are commonly installed at the intersection approaches and the upstream segments, providing volume, occupancy and speed data at a time interval of 1 min, i.e., a double-section low-resolution detection environment. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose a method to estimate the cycle-based queue length at signalized intersections considering spillover in the context of the above detection environment. Considering dense traffic conditions, uniform distribution is used to transform the low-resolution volume data into vehicle arrivals in 1 s. To deal with spillover conditions, mutual effects of neighboring intersections are classified into four different cases, based on the offsets between the neighboring intersections. Detector data at the upstream intersection approach are used to modify the volume data of the downstream intersection when long queue occurs, and the effect of spillover can thus be formulated analytically using the shockwave theory. Finally, the queue length can be calculated by accumulating queue lengths of all offset conditions within a cycle. Evaluation is done through an empirical case of two intersections, and a simulation case of seven intersections. Results show that the accuracy can reach 85.1% and 82.4% respectively. In both cases, spillover cycles can be recognized with stable and reliable performance.",0968-090X,Not found
Measuring and reducing the disequilibrium levels of dynamic networks with ride-sourcing vehicle data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.001,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Transportation systems are being reshaped by ride sourcing and shared mobility services in recent years. The transportation network companies (TNCs) have been collecting high-granular ride-sourcing vehicle (RV) trajectory data over the past decade, while it is still unclear how the RV data can improve current dynamic network modeling for network traffic management. This paper proposes to statistically estimate network disequilibrium level (NDL), namely to what extent the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) conditions are deviated in real-world networks. Using the data based on RV trajectories, we present a novel method to estimate the real-world NDL measure. More importantly, we present a method to compute zone-to-zone travel time data from trajectory-level RV data. This would become a data sharing scheme for TNCs such that, while being used to effectively estimate and reduce NDL, the zone-to-zone data reveals neither personally identifiable information nor trip-level business information if shared with the public. In addition, we present an NDL based traffic management method to perform user optimal routing on a small fraction of vehicles in the network. The NDL measures and NDL-based routing are examined on two real-world large-scale networks: the City of Chengdu with trajectory-level RV data and the City of Pittsburgh with zone-to-zone travel time data. We found that, on weekdays in each city, NDLs are likely high when travel demand is high (thus when congestion is mild or heavy). Generally, a weekend midnight exhibits higher NDLs than a weekday midnight. Many NDL patterns are different between Chengdu and Pittsburgh, which are attributed to unique characteristics of both demand and supply in each city. For instance, NDL in Pittsburgh is much more stable from day to day and from hour to hour, comparing to Chengdu. In addition, we observe that origin-destination pairs with high NDLs are spatially and temporally sparse for both cities. For the Pittsburgh network, we evaluate the effectiveness of NDL-based traffic routing, which shows great potential to reduce total travel time with routing a small fraction of vehicles (1% in the experiments), even using dated NDL that is estimated in the prior hour.",0968-090X,Not found
A bi-partite generative model framework for analyzing and simulating large scale multiple discrete-continuous travel behaviour data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.022,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The emergence of data-driven demand analysis has led to the increased use of generative modelling to learn the probabilistic dependencies between random variables. Although their apparent use has mostly been limited to image recognition and classification in recent years, generative machine learning algorithms can be a powerful tool for travel behaviour research by replicating travel behaviour by the underlying properties of data structures. In this paper, we examine the use of generative machine learning approach for analyzing multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) travel behaviour data. We provide a plausible perspective of how we can exploit the use of machine learning techniques to interpret the underlying heterogeneities in the data. We show that generative models are conceptually similar to the choice selection behaviour process through information entropy and variational Bayesian inference. Without loss of generality, we consider a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) based algorithm with multiple discrete-continuous layers, formulated as a variational Bayesian inference optimization problem. We systematically describe the proposed machine learning algorithm and develop a process of analyzing travel behaviour data from a generative learning perspective. We show parameter stability from model analysis and simulation tests on an open dataset with multiple discrete-continuous dimensions from a data size of 293,330 observations. For interpretability, we derive the conditional probabilities, elasticities and perform statistical analysis on the latent variables. We show that our model can generate statistically similar data distributions for travel forecasting and prediction and performs better than purely discriminative methods in validation. Our results indicate that latent constructs in generative models can accurately represent the joint distribution consistently on MDC data.",0968-090X,Not found
The multiple flying sidekicks traveling salesman problem: Parcel delivery with multiple drones,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.003,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This paper considers a last-mile delivery system in which a delivery truck operates in coordination with a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones). Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers located further from the depot to receive drone-based deliveries. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of these models on UAV assignments. The model and heuristic also support anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and retrieval.",0968-090X,Not found
Evaluation of ride-sourcing search frictions and driver productivity: A spatial denoising approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.021,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This paper considers the problem of measuring spatial and temporal variation in driver productivity on ride-sourcing trips. This variation is especially important from a driver’s perspective: if a platform’s drivers experience systematic disparities in earnings because of variation in their riders’ destinations, they may perceive the pricing model as inequitable. This perception can exacerbate search frictions if it leads drivers to avoid locations where they believe they may be assigned “unlucky” fares. To characterize any such systematic disparities in productivity, we develop an analytic framework with three key components. First, we propose a productivity metric that looks two consecutive trips ahead, thus capturing the effect on expected earnings of market conditions at drivers’ drop-off locations. Second, we develop a natural experiment by analyzing trips with a common origin but varying destinations, thus isolating purely spatial effects on productivity. Third, we apply a spatial denoising method that allows us to work with raw spatial information exhibiting high levels of noise and sparsity, without having to aggregate data into large, low-resolution spatial zones. By applying our framework to data on more than 1.4 million rides in Austin, Texas, we find significant spatial variation in ride-sourcing driver productivity and search frictions. Drivers at the same location experienced disparities in productivity after being dispatched on trips with different destinations, with origin-based surge pricing increasing these earnings disparities. Our results show that trip distance is the dominant factor in driver productivity: short trips yielded lower productivity, even when ending in areas with high demand. These findings suggest that new pricing strategies are required to minimize random disparities in driver earnings.",0968-090X,Not found
Max-pressure traffic controller based on travel times: An experimental analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.002,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The traffic control of an arbitrary network of signalized intersections is considered. This work presents a new version of the recently proposed max-pressure controller, also known as back-pressure. The most remarkable features of the max-pressure algorithm for traffic signal control are: scalability, stability, and distribution. The modified version presented in this paper improves the practical applicability of the max-pressure controller by considering as input travel times instead of queue lengths. The two main practical advantages of this new version are: (i) travel times are easier to estimate than queue lengths, and (ii) max-pressure controller based on travel times has an inherent capacity-aware property, i.e., it takes into account the finite capacity of each link. Travel time tends to diverge when the queue length is close to its capacity. It should be noted that previous max-pressure algorithms rely exclusively on queue length measurements, which may be difficult to accomplish in practice. Moreover, these previous algorithms generally assume queues with unbounded capacity. This may be problematic because a model with unbounded capacity links is not able to reproduce spillbacks, which are one of the most critical phenomena that a traffic signal controller should avoid. After presenting the new version of the max-pressure controller, it is analyzed and compared with existing control policies in a microscopic traffic simulator. Moreover, results of a real implementation of the developed algorithm to a signalized intersection, located at an urban arterial in Jerusalem, are shown and analyzed. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this experiment is the first real implementation of a max-pressure controller at a signalized intersection.",0968-090X,Not found
A generic multi-level framework for microscopic traffic simulation with automated vehicles in mixed traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.019,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"With an increasing number of automated vehicles (AV) appearing on roads and interacting with conventional traffic, there is a need for improved simulation approaches to replicate and forecast the resulting effects. Interactions between AVs and their drivers, and interaction with other human drivers involve new types of complex behavioural processes. There is an increasing necessity to explicitly incorporate these human factor processes in simulation, which cannot be properly accounted for with most current models. In this paper, we present an extended conceptual simulation framework based on human factors processes and applicable for automated driving that does this. The framework makes use of previously constructed constructs to include the effects of driver task demand, situation awareness and fundamental diagrams of task demand to extend to automated driving. This is especially considered for the case of transition of control (ToC), as an important aspect of vehicle-driver interaction. The framework is demonstrated in two experimental cases that consider different ToC situations and is found to be face valid within the applied assumptions. Challenges remain in regard to a lack of quantitative evidence from traffic psychology, automated vehicle dynamics & control and human-vehicle interaction. With increasing amounts of research on-going in these areas, the extended framework will act as a valuable approach to further study and quantify the effects of AVs in mixed traffic in the future.",0968-090X,Not found

This paper develops a path-control scheme to achieve the system optimum (SO) of the network by controlling a portion of cooperative AVs (CAVs) as per the SO routing principle. A linear program is formulated to delineate the scheme and determine the minimum control ratio (MCR) of CAVs to achieve SO. The properties of the MCR are mathematically and numerically investigated. Numerical examples based on real-world networks reveal that the SO of most of the tested networks can be achieved with an MCR below 23%. Considering the low market penetration of AVs at early stages of their deployment, we further investigate a joint path-based control and pricing scheme to replicate SO. Numerical examples demonstrate the remarkable synergy of these combined instruments on reducing the MCR with little collected tolling revenue.",0968-090X,Not found
Route and speed optimization for liner ships under emission control policies,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.004,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Pollutants such as nitrogen oxides ( NO x ), sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ), and particulate matters (PM) generated by shipping industry are increasing in recent years. In order to control the ship emission pollution, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has established the Emission Control Areas (ECAs). In the fierce competition of the shipping market, liner shipping companies are looking for strategies to maintain their core competencies under the emission control policy. To achieve this goal, this paper first proposes a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model, aiming to optimize sailing routes and speeds within and outside the ECA while minimizing the total fuel cost and SO 2 emissions. Then, a new algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model by combining the two-stage iterative algorithm and fuzzy logic method based on ∊ -constraint. Finally, this paper compares and analyzes the navigation plan of a real sailing route considering and not considering the effects of ECA. Some experiments are conducted to analyze the effects of fuel cost, decision makers, and ECA boundaries on the total fuel cost and SO 2 emissions.

Travel speeds are measured from trajectory information on probe vehicles from a fleet of vehicles for a large sub-area of the city. After experimenting with several deep learning methods, we settle on a simple non-parametric kernel regression approach. The method, borrowed from previous work in fixed route transit predictions, formalizes the intuition that in urban systems most failure patterns are recurrent. Our choice is supported by test results where the method outperformed all evaluated neural architectures.

Drivers’ response to speed warnings provided by a smart phone app,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.020,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The distractive effects of mobile phones are well documented, but the recent development of mobile phone apps that provide speed advisory warnings raises the possibility that this technology may be used to improve driver safety in older vehicles. We examined the effects of an intelligent speed advisory (ISA) app on driving performance in a simulator. One hundred and four participants (mean age = 35.52 years; 52 male) were allocated to complete the drive with the ISA app in one of five modes: active audio visual (n = 22), active visual (n = 22), passive audio visual (n = 21), passive visual (n = 21) or control (n = 18). Another 19 participants (mean age = 27.53 years; 8 male) completed the study wearing eye-tracking glasses. Participants drove a simulated 26.4 km section of rural road which incorporated typical hazards and three speed compliance zones (100 km/h, 80 km/h and 60 km/h speed limits). The app led to good compliance with the posted speed limits, particularly during the 60 km/h road segment, where the control group drove at significantly higher speeds than the groups with the ISA app. No significant differences between the four versions of the ISA app were observed, either for speed compliance or the number of speeding alerts received. Across the entire simulated drive there were relatively few glances at the app with an average glance duration of 190 ms. The ISA app did not lead to any negative effects on driving performance; lane keeping was maintained and it did not impede participants’ ability to overtake vehicles. These findings suggest that when properly configured ISA apps have a demonstrable safety benefit and do not produce adverse distractive effects. The greatest challenge may be encouraging drivers’ to use them appropriately and consistently.",0968-090X,Not found
STAM-based methodology to prevent concurrence events in a Multi-Airport System (MAS),10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.012,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Pre-tactically managing the imbalances of the network and organizing the resources of the airspace is one of the main objectives of Dynamic Demand & Capacity Balancing (dDCB).

On investigating the potential effects of private autonomous vehicle use on home/work relocations and commute times,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.013,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The current study is motivated by the need to better understand the potential impacts that vehicular automation may have on individual decisions of residential and work relocation in a future autonomous vehicle (AV) scenario. The study employs a multivariate approach to model five behavioral dimensions simultaneously: (1) technology-savviness (TS) propensity, (2) interest in productive use of travel time (IPTT) propensity, (3) interest in work relocation, (4) interest in residential relocation, and (5) tolerance to an increase in commute travel time. Data from a web-based survey of commuters in 2017 in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area (DFW) is employed. The results show that both TS and IPTT, as well as demographic variables, impact relocation decisions when individuals have a private AV available for their commute. Importantly, there is considerable heterogeneity across individuals in the willingness to relocate and/or accept longer commute times in an AV future. As such, our model results may be used to inform inputs to land use and travel demand models in an AV future. Also, our results suggest that the magnitude of value of travel time savings (VTTS) decrease considered in many earlier AV impact simulation studies may be much higher than reality. Relative to 50% and even 100% VTTS decreases assumed in many studies, our results suggest a much more modest 30% or so overall decrease in VTTS because of the ability to commute in a privately-owned AV. Finally, our results do predict a rather substantial extent of urban sprawl due to AVs, potentially up to a 68% increase in the horizontal spread of cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, unless proactive planning and policies are implemented to avert such consequences of AVs.",0968-090X,Not found
An equitable traffic signal control scheme at isolated signalized intersections using Connected Vehicle technology,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.005,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This paper extends a real-time, Connected Vehicle-based traffic signal control algorithm at isolated intersections to balance between two competing intersection objectives: efficiency and equity. In this approach, a central controller is used to collect real-time locations of connected vehicles at regular intervals, which can then be used to also identify the existence of some of the non-connected vehicles. The control algorithm then aims to optimize the discharge sequence of naturally occurring platoons of vehicles based on their proximity. Specifically, the strategy selects the platoon discharge sequence—and associated signal phase and timing plan—that minimizes average vehicle delay (measure of efficiency) while limiting the maximum delay any individual vehicle may experience (measure of equity). The latter objective is only possible with detailed vehicle-level information available from connected vehicles. The results show that without the threshold on maximum individual vehicle delay, average delay is often minimized at the expense of very large delays imposed onto some vehicles. By implementing a threshold, both the maximum vehicle delay and the distribution of individual vehicle delays—as measured by the standard deviation and a common measure of population inequity, the Gini coefficient—can be improved, often with only negligible impacts to intersection efficiency. However, the tradeoff between equity and efficiency becomes more significant as the maximum vehicle delay threshold decreases. Sensitivity tests show that this control algorithm works well for different total traffic demands and different demand patterns. The proposed algorithm is also effective under imperfect connected vehicle penetration rates when the connected vehicles make up more than 40% of the traffic stream. The results suggest that the proposed strategy can help significantly reduce long delays and inequitable treatment of vehicles at an intersection when vehicle-level information is available to a signal controller.",0968-090X,Not found

By including a forward synchronization, feature selection, and mini-batch training process, this model overcomes challenges introduced by the large size and high dimensionality of flight datasets. This framework also addresses the re-sampling issue in existing literature causing difficulties in handling time-series signals with different lengths. For demonstration and validation, the developed model is applied to analyze performance anomalies associated with the mechanical system and pilot operation in a historical flight dataset.

Three case studies are presented to illustrate the application and benefits of this new model. Results of the first two cases show that the risk-aversion coefficient in the model influences segment-level treatment selections and pavement network performance. The third case shows that the PTPD model performs better than a benefit-cost ratio model due to the incorporation of uncertainties and treatment path dependence. To obtain a similar performance level, the conventional model requires a 10.4% higher annual budget for the given case study.

Hierarchical ramp metering in freeways: An aggregated modeling and control approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.023,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This paper develops a model-based hierarchical control method for coordinated ramp metering on freeway networks with multiple bottlenecks and on- and off-ramps.

However, the MFD of freeway networks typically exhibits high scatter and hysteresis loops that challenge the control performance of MFD-based controllers for freeways. This paper addresses these challenges by modelling the effect of density heterogeneity along the freeway and capacity drop on characteristics of freeway MFD using field traffic data. In addition, we introduce a model to predict the evolution of density heterogeneity that is essential to reproduce the dynamics of freeway MFD accurately. The proposed model is integrated as the prediction model of the MPC in the hierarchical control method. The proposed coordinated ramp metering method shows desirable performance to reduce the vehicles total time spent and eliminate congestion. The control approach is compared with other coordinated ramp metering controllers based on the MPC framework with different traffic prediction models (e.g.CTM and METANET). The outcomes of numerical experiments highlight that the MFD-based hierarchical controller (i) is better able to overcome the modeling mismatch between the prediction model and the plant (process model) in the MPC framework and (ii) requires less computation effort than other nonlinear controllers.",0968-090X,Not found
An exact method for the bus dispatching problem in rolling horizons,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.009,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"In this work, we adapt the rolling-horizon approach of Eberlein et al. (2001) for adjusting the dispatching times of buses at each rolling horizon. The industry practice is to adjust the dispatching time of a bus once it departs from the first stop while considering that future trips will operate as planned. In contrast, a rolling-horizon approach adjusts simultaneously the dispatching times of all trips that operate during a pre-determined time interval resulting in a coordinated effort to maintain the target headways. Due to the increased number of dispatching time decisions, this coordinated effort increases the computational burden. To reduce the computational cost, we introduce a nonlinear program and we propose a novel reformulation that limits the recursive relations of the optimization problem. Our program is proved to be convex and can be solved to global optimality under a limited computational cost. In addition, it outperforms myopic methods that adjust the dispatching time of each bus trip in isolation. The sensitivity of our method to travel time and passenger demand fluctuations is investigated on a simulation scenario of bus line 15L in Denver.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-aircraft optimal 4D online trajectory planning in the presence of a multi-cell storm in development,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.014,110,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This paper studies the trajectory planning problem for multiple aircraft in converging arrival routes in the presence of a multi-cell storm in development. Storm avoidance constraints are enforced by approximating each cell of the storm as a moving and size-changing ellipsoid. Besides storm avoidance constraints, operational constraints, such as, following an arrival procedure or time-based separation between aircraft, are also considered. The problem is solved using nonlinear model predictive control based on hybrid optimal control with logical constraints in disjunctive form. Logical constraints in disjunctive form arise in modelling of both storm avoidance and operational constraints and also in modelling general decision making processes during flight, such as, establishing which among two or more actions should be taken to solve a contingency. The evolution of the storms is tackled using the nonlinear model predictive control scheme, which iteratively re-plans the trajectories as a new estimation of the state of the storms is available. The presence of this feedback mechanism in the trajectory planning scheme makes it substantially different from open-loop trajectory planning methods. Since it is intended for trajectory planning with very short time horizon before the departure or during the flight, it has been herein called online trajectory planning. An embedding approach is employed to transform logical constraints in disjunctive form into inequality and equality constraints which involve only continuous auxiliary variables. In this way, the hybrid optimal control problem is converted into a smooth optimal control problem, thereby reducing the computational complexity of finding the solution. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through several numerical experiments.",0968-090X,Not found
Battery electric bus infrastructure planning under demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.009,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The electrification of city bus systems is an increasing trend, with many cities replacing their diesel buses with battery electric buses (BEBs). Due to limited battery capacities, and to random battery discharge rates—which are affected by weather, road and traffic conditions—BEBs often need daytime charging to support their operation for a whole day. The deployment of charging infrastructures, as well as the number of stand-by buses available, has a significant effect on the operational efficiency of electric bus systems. In this work, a stochastic integer program has been developed to jointly optimise charging station locations and bus fleet size under random bus charging demand, considering time-of-use electricity tariffs. The stochastic program is first approximated by its sample average and is solved by a customised Lagrangian relaxation approach. The applicability of the model and solution algorithm is demonstrated by applications to a series of hypothetical grid networks and to a real-world Melbourne City bus network.

A multi-layered blockchain framework for smart mobility data-markets,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.002,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Blockchain has the potential to render the transaction of information more secure and transparent. Nowadays, transportation data are shared across multiple entities using heterogeneous mediums, from paper collected data to smartphone. Most of this data are stored in central servers that are susceptible to hacks. In some cases shady actors who may have access to such sources, share the mobility data with unwanted third parties. A multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-market (BSMD) is presented for addressing the associated privacy, security, management, and scalability challenges. Each participant shares their encrypted data to the blockchain network and can transact information with other participants as long as both parties agree to the transaction rules issued by the owner of the data.

Scalable traffic stability analysis in mixed-autonomy using continuum models,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.007,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper presents scalable traffic stability analysis for both pure connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) traffic and mixed traffic based on continuum traffic flow models. Human-drive vehicles (HDVs) are modeled by a non-equilibrium traffic flow model, i.e., Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) to capture HDV traffic's unstable nature. CAVs are modeled by a mean field game describing their non-cooperative behaviors as rational utility-optimizing agents. Working with continuum models helps avoiding scalability issues in microscopic multi-class traffic models. We demonstrate from linear stability analysis that the mean field game traffic flow model behaves differently from traditional traffic flow models and stability can only be proved when the total density is in a certain regime. We also show from numerical experiments that CAVs help stabilize mixed traffic. Further, we quantify the impact of CAV's penetration rate and controller design on traffic stability. The results may provide qualitative insights on traffic stability in mixed-autonomy for human drivers and city planners. The results also provide suggestions on CAV controller design for CAV manufacturers.",0968-090X,Not found
Cyber-physical system architecture for automating the mapping of truck loads to bridge behavior using computer vision in connected highway corridors,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.024,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Bridges are critical components of highways ensuring traffic can efficiently travel over obstructions such as bodies of water, valleys, and other roads. Ensuring bridges are in sound structural condition is essential for safe and efficient highway operations. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems designed to measure bridge responses have been developed to quantitatively track the health of bridges. More recently, SHM systems have also begun to integrate measurement of vehicular loads that create the responses measured. However, precise correlation of traffic loads to bridge responses remains a costly and technically difficult strategy. To address existing technical limitations, a cyber-physical system (CPS) framework is proposed to track truck loads in a highway corridor, to trigger SHM systems to record bridge responses, and to automate the linking of bridge response data with truck weights collected by weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations installed along the corridor but not collocated with the bridges. To link truck weights to bridge responses, computer vision methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to automate the detection and reidentification of trucks using traffic cameras. The single-stage CNN object detector YOLO is trained using a customized dataset to identify trucks from camera images at each instrumentation site; high precision is obtained with the YOLO detector exceeding 95% average precision (AP) for an intersection over union (IOU) threshold of 0.75. To reidentify the same truck at different locations in the corridor, this study adopts a CNN-based encoder trained via a triplet network and a mutual nearest neighbor strategy using feature vectors extracted from images at each measurement location. The proposed reidentification method is implemented in the CPS cloud environment and obtains a F1-score of 0.97. The study also explores the triggering of bridge monitoring systems based on visual detection of trucks by a traffic camera installed upstream to the bridges. The triggering strategy proves to be highly efficient with 99% of the triggered data collection cycles capturing truck events at each bridge. To validate, the CPS architecture is implemented on a 20-mile highway corridor that has a WIM station already installed; four traffic cameras and two bridge SHM systems are installed along the corridor and integrated with a CPS architecture hosted on the cloud. In total, over 10,000 trucks are observed at all measurement locations over one year allowing peak bridge responses to be correlated to both measured truck weights and to one another.",0968-090X,Not found
Lower cost departures for airlines: Optimal policies under departure metering,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.023,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Departure metering is an airport surface management procedure that limits the number of aircraft in the runway queue by holding aircraft either at a predesigned metering area or at gates. Field tests of the procedure have shown significant fuel savings, implying that the procedure can play an important role in the Next Generation Air Transportation System being implemented in the U.S. In this paper we study optimal departure operations at airports in the context of departure metering. More specifically, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming framework for tactical management of pushback operations at gates and for determining the optimal number of aircraft to be directed to the runway queue from the metering areas. We introduce four easy-to-implement departure metering policies, and perform comparative analyses between these practical policies and the numerical-optimization based policies. In addition, from a strategic perspective, we identify optimal capacities for metering areas to be used as part of departure metering implementations. Overall, we find that the annual fuel and operating savings for airlines could be around $1.7 million if our proposed policies are implemented at the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Such policies can also be adapted by other airports to improve the overall efficiency of surface traffic management and departure operations.",0968-090X,Not found
A novel approach for the structural comparison of origin-destination matrices: Levenshtein distance,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.005,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Origin-Destination (OD) matrix is a tableau of travel demand distributed between different zonal pairs. Essentially, OD matrix provides two types of information: (a) the individual cell value represents travel demand between a specific OD pair; and (b) group of OD pairs provides insights into structural information in terms of distribution pattern of OD flows. Comparison of OD matrices should account both types of information. Limited studies in the past developed structural similarity measures, and most studies still depend on traditional measures for OD matrices comparison. Traditional performance measures are based on cell by cell comparison, and often neglect OD matrix structural information within their formulations. We propose a methodology that adopts the fundamentals of Levenshtein distance, traditionally used to compare sequences of strings, and extends it to quantify the structural comparison of OD matrices. The novel performance measure is named as normalised Levenshtein distance for OD matrices (NLOD). The results of sensitivity analysis support NLOD to be a robust statistical measure for holistic comparison of OD matrices.

Deployment of roadside units to overcome connectivity gap in transportation networks with mixed traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.001,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In the foreseeable future, the traffic stream will be likely mixed with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles (RVs). In the mixed traffic environment, when following a RV, due to the lack of vehicle-to-vehicle communications, it may take longer time for a CAV to sense and react than a human driver, which results in longer time headway and the loss of highway throughput. To address such a connectivity gap, this paper investigates an infrastructure-based solution, i.e., the deployment of roadside units to help CAVs in the heterogeneous traffic stream. Specifically, it is envisioned that these roadside units can sense vehicles in their coverage areas and provide the beyond-line-of-sight motion information to CAVs to empower them to react proactively, as they would do when following other CAVs. This paper is devoted to the analysis of the impacts of this type of roadside units at a strategic planning stage. In doing so, we first derive an analytical link performance function to capture their impact on the link capacity and travel time, and then develop a network equilibrium model to gauge their effect on travelers’ route choices and thus the flow distribution of both RVs and CAVs across the whole network. This modeling development will allow us to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for a given deployment plan of roadside units. For fair analyses, we further develop an optimization model to determine the optimal deployment plan for a given budget, while focusing on the worst case of its impact, because the flow distribution resulting from our network equilibrium model is not unique. Such a model provides a conservative estimate of the benefit brought by roadside units. Lastly, we offer case studies to demonstrate the models and unveil the potential of such an infrastructure-based solution.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperative autonomous traffic organization method for connected automated vehicles in multi-intersection road networks,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.018,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have been currently considered as promising solutions for realization of envisioned autonomous traffic management systems in the future. CAVs can achieve high desired traffic efficiency and provide safe, energy-saving, and comfortable ride experience for passengers. However, in order to practically implement such autonomous systems based on CAVs, there exist several significant challenges to be dealt with, such as coupled spatiotemporal constraints on CAVs’ trajectories at unsignalized intersections, multiple objectives for trajectory optimization in road segments, and heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs in road networks with highly dynamic traffic demand. In this paper, we propose a cooperative autonomous traffic organization method for CAVs in multi-intersection road networks. The methodological framework consists of threefold components: an autonomous crossing strategy based on a conflict resolution approach at unsignalized intersections, multi-objective trajectory optimization in road segments, and a composite strategy for route planning considering heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs based on social and individual benefit, respectively. Specifically, we first identify a set of potential conflict points of different CAVs’ spatial trajectories at the intersection, and then design different minimum safe time headways to resolve conflicts. Under the constraints of entry and exit conditions at adjacent intersections, we propose a multi-objective optimal control model by jointly considering vehicle safety, energy conservation, and ride comfort, and then analytically derive a closed-form solution for optimizing the CAVs’ trajectories. Furthermore, with the purpose to adapt dynamic traffic demand, we propose a composite strategy for route planning by coordinating heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs in road networks. Finally, extensive simulation experiments have been performed to validate our proposed method and to demonstrate its advantage over conventional baseline schemes in terms of global traffic efficiency. Additional numerical results are also provided to shed light on the impact of the proportion of CAVs with heterogeneous decision-making behaviors on the global system performance.",0968-090X,Not found

Single-day data results tend to overestimate travelers’ BEV feasibility assuming that multi-day sample data provides accurate estimations. Facility utilization can be improved without affecting travelers’ charging demand under correct pricing scheme for most cost-sensitive users. Smart grid charging strategy can greatly reduce the total number of operating chargers during the same time in a day, and BEV users’ charging behaviors have minor impact on this improvement.

Optimal escort dispatch for airport travelers with reduced mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.010,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"An important component of airport landside operations involves providing assistance to passengers with reduced mobility. These operations are typically managed by third-party contractors, which leverage a team of escorts and a set of wheelchairs to provide mobility assistance services. The performance of these systems relies critically on the dispatch of escorts and wheelchairs to serve each traveler request. Sub-optimal dispatch can lead to negative individual and system-wide implications, such as long passenger wait times, customer dissatisfaction or added delays in flight departures. This paper reports the outcomes of a collaboration with the Pittsburgh International Airport that involved three steps. First, the collection and digitization of data provided visibility into demand for mobility assistance services and historical performance of the system. Second, we propose an original integer programming model to optimize and support the assignment of escorts to traveler requests, and we develop an efficient solution approach based on a rolling algorithm to enable the implementation of the model with realistic problem sizes. We verify that the model’s outputs are consistent with insights obtained from the historical records of operations, and identify opportunities to enhance the level of service without increasing system capacity. In particular, the results suggest that improvements in information flows and in communication between airlines, the central dispatcher and passenger escorts can result in significant dispatch improvements. Third, we leveraged these insights by developing a tablet application to provide real-time visibility into traveler requests, dispatch recommendations, and data visualizations for continued performance assessment and enhancement.",0968-090X,Not found
Centralized and decentralized autonomous dispatching strategy for dynamic autonomous taxi operation in hybrid request mode,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.020,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The combination of self-driving technology and taxis has a considerable potential in improving service quality and economic efficiency that can completely change traditional taxi operation. This study accordingly focuses on the autonomous taxi (aTaxi) dispatching problem in hybrid request mode where travelers can either request immediate rides or reserve taxi services ahead of time. In this study, a centralized dispatcher and decentralized autonomous dispatchers are designed to plan short-term and long-term routes for aTaxis in real time, respectively. The centralized dispatcher integrates vehicle-to-passenger assignment with empty vehicle rebalance to guarantee solution quality. Decentralized autonomous dispatchers distribute a portion of the calculation to aTaxis, thus reducing the centralized dispatcher’s workload. The dispatching strategy ensures that the response to traveler requests can be made immediately, and if such requests are accepted, the travelers will receive the expected services. Finally, experiments are conducted based on the actual road network and the trip data of Manhattan to investigate the dispatching strategy. The results confirm the high performance of the proposed dispatching strategies in terms of service quality and economic efficiency.

Neural Network MLP is employed to capture network-scale co-movement pattern of all traffic flows, and ARIMA is used to further extract location-specific traffic features in the residual time series out of Neural Network. The experiment results show that the postprocessing the residuals of Neural Network by the ARIMA analysis helps to significantly improve accuracy of traffic state prediction by 8.9–13.4% in term of mean squared error reduction. In order to verify the efficiency of the ARIMA analysis in the postprocessing, Multidimensional Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model is also employed to replace the role of Neural Network in the comparative experiment. Two streams of comparisons, (1) NN vs. NN-ARIMA and (2) MSVR vs. MSVR-ARIMA, are performed and show consistent results.

Microscopic modelling of area-based heterogeneous traffic flow: Area selection and vehicle movement,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.013,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The area-based (i.e., non-lane based) heterogeneous traffic (as in developing countries) has significant differences from the lane-based homogeneous traffic (as in developed countries). In area-based traffic, drivers generally ignore the lane markings and perceive the entire road space while progressing longitudinally. The traditional car-following and lane changing models are not directly applicable to model such driving behaviour. This research aims to microscopically model the dynamics of the subject vehicle in area-based traffic flow. The modelling is conducted in two steps: area selection, and vehicle movement. In step-1, a multinomial logit (MNL) model is considered for selecting the area-based movement direction of the subject vehicle. The choice space of the subject vehicle is divided into numbers of realistic radial cones considering the possible moving directions of the subject vehicle in the next simulation time step. These radial cones form the alternatives for the decision of the subject vehicle. The attributes of the alternatives are defined in terms of angular deviation from the direction of the flow, spacing and relative speed. This model is calibrated and validated for both cars and motorcycles using real trajectory data, and the results demonstrate the good performance of the model. In step-2, a modified intelligent driving model (MIDM) is proposed to simulate the next position of the subject vehicle (along the selected direction as the outcome of the model in step-1). The parameters of the MIDM model are calibrated using real data for cars and motorcycles. The deterministic parameters for MNL model and the empirical distribution of the MIDM model parameters are utilized to stochastically simulate vehicle trajectories with the initial and boundary conditions determined by the real dataset.

Macroscopic pedestrian flow simulation using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH),10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.017,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Macroscopic pedestrian models are theoretically simpler than microscopic models, and they can potentially be solved faster while producing reasonable predictions of crowd dynamics. Therefore, they can be very useful for applications such as large-scale simulation, real-time state estimation and crowd management. However, the numerical methods presently used to solve macroscopic pedestrian models, which are mostly grid-based, have some shortcomings that limit their applicability. More specifically, they usually include complex procedures for grid generation and remeshing, and they produce simulation results that may not be sufficiently accurate (for example, because of unclear boundaries between flow states). Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) constitutes an alternative numerical method that could potentially overcome these limitations. SPH is a meshfree method where a crowd is represented by a set of particles that possess material properties and move according to macroscopic laws. Relevant state variables at each particle are approximated using information about the material properties of the neighboring particles and a smoothing function. This paper puts forward for the first time a generic SPH framework for solving macroscopic pedestrian models; in addition, it demonstrates that an SPH-based simulation model can produce meaningful and accurate results by means of three case studies. The first case study shows that the proposed numerical method can approximate well the analytical solution of a simple macroscopic model applied to a queue-discharge scenario. The second case study demonstrates that the proposed numerical method can potentially reproduce density dispersion (a phenomenon observed in real crowds) more accurately than grid-based methods, due to its meshfree, Lagrangian, and particle-based nature. The third case study highlights the need to reformulate the acceleration equation of the basic macroscopic model in order to reproduce lane formation in bi-directional flows (also an observed phenomenon) using the proposed SPH framework, and this paper presents a solution to do so.",0968-090X,Not found

To investigate these effects, driving data were collected from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. Five data-collecting vehicles were equipped with Mobileye® systems, which included an FCW function with headway display and warning system. Participants drove the vehicles for two months, with the Mobileye® system activated the second month only.

Results showed that (1) drivers tended to maintain shorter headway with FCW enabled, while the proportion of time in short headways did not increase; (2) FCW reduced car-following reaction time when the lead vehicle was accelerating and when the relative speed between the lead and following vehicle was large; and (3) a reduction in the space headway exponent of the GHR was observed when FCW was enabled, indicating that drivers follow more closely with FCW because the system increases drivers’ sensitivity to changes in following gaps. Results of this study suggest that an FCW system with a headway monitoring function may increase traffic efficiency and stability without degrading safety.",0968-090X,Not found
Acceptance of autonomous delivery vehicles for last-mile delivery in Germany – Extending UTAUT2 with risk perceptions,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.016,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The inevitable need to develop new delivery practices in last-mile logistics arises from the enormously growing business to consumer (B2C) e-commerce and the associated challenges for logistics service providers. Autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are believed to have the potential to revolutionise last-mile delivery in a way that is more sustainable and customer focused. However, if not widely accepted, the introduction of ADVs as a delivery option can be a substantial waste of resources. At present, the research on consumers’ receptivity of innovations in last-mile delivery, such as ADVs, is limited. This study is the first that investigates the users’ acceptance of ADVs in Germany by utilising an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and adapted it to the context of ADVs in last-mile delivery. Quantitative data was collected through an online survey approach (n = 501) and structural equation modelling was undertaken. The results indicate that price sensitivity is the strongest predictor of behavioural intention (i.e., user acceptance), followed by performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, perceived risk, social influence and facilitating conditions, whereas no effect could be found for effort expectancy. These findings have important theoretical and practical contributions in the areas of technology acceptance and last-mile delivery.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal passenger-seeking policies on E-hailing platforms using Markov decision process and imitation learning,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.005,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Vacant taxi drivers’ passenger seeking process in a road network generates additional vehicle miles traveled, adding congestion and pollution into the road network and the environment. This paper aims to employ a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model idle e-hailing drivers’ optimal sequential decisions in passenger-seeking. Transportation network companies (TNC) or e-hailing (e.g., Didi, Uber) drivers exhibit different behaviors from traditional taxi drivers because e-hailing drivers do not need to actually search for passengers. Instead, they reposition themselves so that the matching platform can match a passenger. Accordingly, we incorporate e-hailing drivers’ new features into our MDP model. The reward function used in the MDP model is uncovered by leveraging an inverse reinforcement learning technique. We then use 44,160 Didi drivers’ 3-day trajectories to train the model. To validate the effectiveness of the model, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to simulate the performance of drivers under the guidance of the optimal policy, which is then compared with the performance of drivers following one baseline heuristic, namely, the local hotspot strategy. The results show that our model is able to achieve a 17.5% improvement over the local hotspot strategy in terms of the rate of return. The proposed MDP model captures the supply-demand ratio considering the fact that the number of drivers in this study is sufficiently large and thus the number of unmatched orders is assumed to be negligible. To better incorporate the competition among multiple drivers into the model, we have also devised and calibrated a dynamic adjustment strategy of the order matching probability.",0968-090X,Not found
Short-term traffic state prediction from latent structures: Accuracy vs. efficiency,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.007,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Recently, deep learning models have shown promising performances in many research areas, including traffic states prediction, due to their ability to model complex nonlinear relationships. However, deep learning models also have drawbacks that make them less preferable for certain short-term traffic prediction applications. For example, they require a large amount of data for model training, which is also computationally expensive. Moreover, deep learning models lack interpretability of the results. This paper develops a short-term traffic states forecasting algorithm based on partial least square (PLS) to help enhance real-time decision-making and build better insights into traffic data. The proposed model is capable of predicting short-term traffic states accurately and efficiently by capturing dominant spatiotemporal features and day-to-day variations from collinear and correlated traffic data.

Trajectory reconstruction for freeway traffic mixed with human-driven vehicles and connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.002,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The development of technologies related to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) allows for a new approach to collect vehicle trajectory. However, trajectory data collected in this way represent only sampled traffic flow owing to low penetration rates (PRs) of CAVs and privacy concerns, and fail to provide a comprehensive picture of traffic flow. This study proposes a method to reconstruct vehicle trajectories in fully sampled traffic flow on freeways that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and CAVs by using the mobile sensing data acquired from CAVs. The expected behavior of vehicles within the detection range of CAVs is determined based on the driving state classified by the Wiedemann model, i.e., free driving, emergency, closing, and following. If the actual behavior is different from the expected, it is deemed to be influenced by the undetected HVs. Then, new HVs are inserted based on the estimated local traffic density and speed of the freeway. The trajectories of the inserted HVs are further reconstructed by using the established update rules of cellular automation, i.e., uniform motion, acceleration, deceleration, randomization and position update. Last, the proposed method was examined by simulation experiments under different traffic densities and PRs of CAVs. The results show that the trajectories of fully sampled mixed traffic flow can be reconstructed reasonably well, not only under traffic conditions without explicit congestion but in congested environments.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal deployment of wireless charging lanes considering their adverse effect on road capacity,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.012,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"With the development of wireless charging technology, charging-while-driving now becomes possible.

The model is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem and solved by a linearization method. A new method is developed to reduce the maximum error in the linearization process. The model and solution method are tested on Nguyen-Dupuis and Sioux Falls networks. The numerical results show that relatively high charging power and reasonable budget are necessary to recover the investment when charging lanes are deployed on road network. It is also demonstrated that the impacts of WCL on road capacity drop and travelers’ route choice are not negligible, and should be considered in the determination of WCL location.",0968-090X,Not found
A heuristic method to optimize generic signal phasing and timing plans at signalized intersections using Connected Vehicle technology,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.008,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper develops a flexible, real-time traffic signal control algorithm to optimize both phase durations and phase sequences at four-approach intersections with conflicting left-turns, based on information obtained from connected vehicles. Vehicle-to-infrastructure communications are assumed to provide the location of all connected vehicles near the signalized intersection at regular time intervals and this information is used to identify the presence of non-connected vehicles that are stopped at the intersection. All detected and identified vehicles are used to identify naturally occurring platoons in the traffic stream. The signal control algorithm then selects the optimal sequence that these platoons should discharge through the intersection to minimize average delay of all identified vehicles. Since all possible departure sequences for platoons of vehicles are considered, the problem is computationally difficult. Hence, several heuristic methods are proposed to determine optimal platoon departure sequences. These heuristics include an intelligent tree search and multiple types of genetic algorithms, including a newly developed genetic algorithm that perserves phase order sequence that is vital to this problem. Comparisons between these heuristics and the global optimal solution suggest that the heuristics are able to provide similar operational performance with significant reductions in total computation time required, such that the algorithm can be applied in real-time. In general, the intelligent tree search appears to outperform the genetic algorithm approaches in terms of operational performance but has computational requirements that increase exponentially with the number of platoons identified at the intersection. Meanwhile, the genetic algorithm methods tend to be more scalable but slightly less efficient. Overall, the results are promising for the application of the proposed flexible signal control algorithm at real intersections.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated headway and bus priority control in transit corridors with bidirectional lane segments,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.001,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The problem of operating exclusive bus corridors that have segments with bidirectional lanes is treated. On these lanes, only one direction of movement is allowed when a bus is present. Such construct requires less road space, which is a scarce resource in dense urban areas, and thus may be the only feasible alternative for the installation of exclusive bus corridors. The system model includes limits on bus passenger capacity. The control method for real-time operation integrates bus headway corrections and bus priority through signalized intersections, while enforcing mutual exclusion of opposing buses on the bidirectional lanes. Effectively, the control avoids bus bunching over the entire corridor and coordinates the passage of opposing buses on bidirectional lanes. The objective is to minimize the total waiting time of passengers, both onboard and at stops. Simulation results indicate the applicability of the integrated holding and priority bidirectional lane control method.",0968-090X,Not found
Perimeter gating control and citywide dynamic user equilibrium: A macroscopic modeling framework,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.016,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In recent years, several perimeter control strategies have been proposed for traffic management in cities. The common factor found in these works is the use of Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) models to describe the dynamics of the network and optimize traffic inside the perimeter by manipulating perimeter inflows. Perimeter gating control strategies are attractive for traffic management inside the inner city. However, it inevitably creates a negative impact on the traffic outside. Most of the works in this research area have neglected vehicle re-routing outside the controlled perimeter, i.e., they do not consider demand elasticity to the central region resulting from gating and the related queues. In this paper, we propose a global modeling framework capable of assessing the effect of perimeter gating control (in terms of queue, emission, and total time spent) on the full network, considering demand elasticity resulting from Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE). Classical Proportional-Integral (PI) control scheme is used to control traffic congestion inside a central region (reservoir). The modeling framework is comprised of: (i) an accumulation-based MFD model to reproduce traffic dynamics inside the reservoir, (ii) point-queue model to represent queuing vehicles on inbound links to the gating points, and (iii) a time-dependent travel time profile based on a steady-state approximation of MFD dynamics to characterize the alternative road network (bypass). DUE is then implemented, considering instantaneous predicted travel time. This determines how the demand to the inner region is affected by the gating. The functioning of the global system is assessed by total time spent and NOx and CO2 emissions inside the reservoir and for the full network. The presented simulation results show that the perimeter gating control helps to maintain congestion at the desired level with significant improvements in the total time spent and the mean speed in the network. However, it shows a slight increase in the queues. As expected, deviation to the bypass alternative is significant and should not be neglected when carrying out a global assessment of gating system performance.",0968-090X,Not found
On the new era of urban traffic monitoring with massive drone data: The pNEUMA large-scale field experiment,10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.023,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The new era of sharing information and “big data” has raised our expectations to make mobility more predictable and controllable through a better utilization of data and existing resources. The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion.

The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors.

"Traffic automation and lane management for communicant, autonomous, and human-driven vehicles",10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.009,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The advent of autonomous driving technologies has created a crucial need for upgrading conventional traffic control and lane management strategies in large cities. In this research, we design an optimal lane management strategy for corridors with a heterogeneous demand of human-driven, autonomous, and communicant autonomous vehicles (HVs, AVs, and CAVs). In a monocentric city setting, we dynamically control the inflow of the network by optimizing the size of CAV platoons in the corridors based on the instantaneous condition of the integrated system. These corridors can potentially have three types of lanes for vehicles with different levels of automation technology. We model the multiple lane type corridors as sets of parallel bottlenecks with general distributions of multiclass demand. The dynamics of the congestion in the network is also modeled using the macroscopic network fundamental diagram (MNFD). To study the impacts of the rise in the penetration rate of AVs and CAVs on the performance of the system, we derive a closed-form representation of the model. We show that the increase of the delay in the network with the rise in the penetration rate of AVs and CAVs can have a stable, an unstable, or a hybrid pattern. To optimize the system, we minimize a weighted summation of the experienced delay in the corridors and the total travel time in the urban network by optimizing the number of lanes of each type and the dynamic size of the CAV platoons. The results of the San Francisco case study show that implementing an optimal lane management strategy can reduce the experienced delay in the corridors up to 78% with a rise in the AV/CAV penetration rate. By dynamically controlling the size of the CAV platoons in the automated highway of the Bay Bridge, we limit the increase of the travel time in the downtown network as low as 5%.",0968-090X,Not found
A two-phase optimization model for the demand-responsive customized bus network design,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.004,111,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper proposes a new optimization model for the network design problem of the demand-responsive customized bus (CB).

In the dynamic phase, we propose a hierarchical decision-making model to describe the interactive manner between operator and passengers. The CB network design problem is formulated in a mixed-integer program with the objective of maximizing operator’s revenue. The CB passenger’s travel behavior is measured by a discrete choice model given the trip plan provided by the operator. A dynamic insertion method is developed to address the proposed model in the dynamic phase. For the network design problem in the static phase, the service network is re-optimized based on the confirmed passengers with strict time deviation constraints embedded in the static multi-vehicle pickup and delivery problem. An exact solution method is developed based on the branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm. Numerical examples are conducted to verify the proposed models and solution algorithms.",0968-090X,Not found
Deep neural networks for choice analysis: Architecture design with alternative-specific utility functions,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.012,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Whereas deep neural network (DNN) is increasingly applied to choice analysis, it is challenging to reconcile domain-specific behavioral knowledge with generic-purpose DNN, to improve DNN’s interpretability and predictive power, and to identify effective regularization methods for specific tasks. To address these challenges, this study demonstrates the use of behavioral knowledge for designing a particular DNN architecture with alternative-specific utility functions (ASU-DNN) and thereby improving both the predictive power and interpretability. Unlike a fully connected DNN (F-DNN), which computes the utility value of an alternative k by using the attributes of all the alternatives, ASU-DNN computes it by using only k’s own attributes. Theoretically, ASU-DNN can substantially reduce the estimation error of F-DNN because of its lighter architecture and sparser connectivity, although the constraint of alternative-specific utility can cause ASU-DNN to exhibit a larger approximation error. Empirically, ASU-DNN has 2–3% higher prediction accuracy than F-DNN over the whole hyperparameter space in a private dataset collected in Singapore and a public dataset available in the R mlogit package. The alternative-specific connectivity is associated with the independence of irrelevant alternative (IIA) constraint, which as a domain-knowledge-based regularization method is more effective than the most popular generic-purpose explicit and implicit regularization methods and architectural hyperparameters. ASU-DNN provides a more regular substitution pattern of travel mode choices than F-DNN does, rendering ASU-DNN more interpretable. The comparison between ASU-DNN and F-DNN also aids in testing behavioral knowledge. Our results reveal that individuals are more likely to compute utility by using an alternative’s own attributes, supporting the long-standing practice in choice modeling. Overall, this study demonstrates that behavioral knowledge can guide the architecture design of DNN, function as an effective domain-knowledge-based regularization method, and improve both the interpretability and predictive power of DNN in choice analysis. Future studies can explore the generalizability of ASU-DNN and other possibilities of using utility theory to design DNN architectures.",0968-090X,Not found
Automated taxis’ dial-a-ride problem with ride-sharing considering congestion-based dynamic travel times,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.024,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"In this paper, we study the dial-a-ride problem of ride-sharing automated taxis (ATs) in an urban road network, considering the traffic congestion caused by the ATs. This shared automated mobility system is expected to provide a seamless door-to-door service for urban travellers, much like what the existing transportation network companies (TNC) do, but with decreased labour cost and more flexible relocation operations due to the vehicles’ automation. We propose an integer non-linear programming (INLP) model that optimizes the routing of the ATs to maximize the system profit, depending on dynamic travel times, which are a non-linear function of the ATs’ flows. It is important to involve traffic congestion in such a routing problem since for a growing number of ATs circulating in the city their number will lead to delays. The model is embedded within a rolling horizon framework, which divides a typical day into several horizons to deal with the real-time travel demand. In each horizon, the routing model is solved with the demand at that interval and assuring the continuity of the trips between horizons. Nevertheless, each horizon model is hard to solve given its number of constraints and decision variables. Therefore, we propose a solution approach based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, which allows identifying a near-optimal solution for this difficult problem. Numerical experiments for the city of Delft, The Netherlands, are used to demonstrate the solution quality of the proposed algorithm as well as obtaining insights about the AT system performance. Results show that the solution algorithm can solve the proposed model for hard instances. Ride-sharing makes the AT system more capable to provide better service regarding delay time and the number of requests that can be attended by the system. The delay penalty on the profit objective function is an effective control parameter on guaranteeing the service quality while maintaining system profitability.",0968-090X,Not found
Modelling lane changing behaviour in approaches to roadworks: Contrasting and combining driving simulator data with stated choice data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.003,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Drivers approaching lane closures due to roadworks tend to choose a target lane (plan) and seek suitable gaps to execute the plan (action). The plan is however latent or unobserved as the driver may or may not be able to move to the target lane due to the constraints imposed by the surrounding traffic. Hence, only the actions of the driver (as manifested by their final lane occupancies) are observed in the trajectory data. This paper analyses such mandatory lane changing behaviour in a roadworks environment in detail with data from a controlled driving simulator experiment and a simple stated preference survey with the same group of participants. While in the former drivers face similar constraints in implementing the plans as in the real world, in the simple stated choice survey the same drivers elicit their preferred target lanes without a need to put the plan into action. We contrast the findings from the two sources and also show correlations between the latent plan and stated target components in a latent class model. The results provide new insights into lane changing behaviour that may be useful for example for traffic management purposes.

Automated vehicle acceptance in China: Social influence and initial trust are key determinants,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.027,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Although automated vehicles (AVs) could offer a potentially effective solution to improving road safety, the benefit associated with AVs can be realized only when the public intend to use them. While some efforts have been made to understand why people would use AVs, few of them have investigated the role of social and personal factors in AV acceptance. The present study aimed to fill in this research gap. An AV acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with social and personal factors, i.e., initial trust, social influence, and the Big Five personality and sensation seeking traits. The validity of the proposed model was confirmed with a questionnaire survey administrated to 647 drivers in China. Results revealed that at the very beginning of AV commercialization, perception factors (i.e., perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) from the original TAM showed significant influence on users’ intention to use AVs. But more importantly, it was social influence and initial trust that contributed most to explain whether users would accept AVs or not. Some personality traits also played certain roles in AV usage intention. In particular, sensation seekers and those with a higher openness to experience were more likely to trust AVs and had a higher intention to adopt them. In contrast, neurotic people showed a lower level of trust and were less likely to accept AVs. Practically, these findings suggest that promotion of AVs to influential individuals that could help form good social opinions would have significant downstream effects on AV acceptance at the early state of its marketization.",0968-090X,Not found

The proposed model allows us to explicitly investigate the interaction between AVs and HVs considering the uncertainty of human driving behavior. Six performance metrics are proposed to measure the impact of AVs on the uncertainty of HVs’ behavior, as well as on the stability of the system. The numerical experiment results show that AVs have significant impact on the uncertainty and stability of the mixed traffic flow system. Larger AV penetration rates can reduce the uncertainty inherent in HV behavior and improve the stability of the mixed flow substantially.

Mixed Integer Programming models for planning maintenance at offshore wind farms under uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2019.12.014,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"We introduce the Stochastic Maintenance Fleet Transportation Problem for Offshore wind farms (SMFTPO), in which a maintenance provider determines an optimal, medium-term planning for maintaining multiple wind farms while controlling for uncertainty in the maintenance tasks and weather conditions. Since the maintenance provider is typically not the owner of a wind farm, it needs to adhere minimum service requirements that specify the required service. We consider three of such settings: (1) perform all maintenance tasks, (2) allow for a fraction of unscheduled tasks, and (3) incentivize to perform maintenance rather quickly. We provide a two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming model for the three SMFTPO settings, and solve it by means of Sample Average Approximation. In addition, we provide an overview of the, what we discovered, non-aligned modeling assumptions in the literature regarding operational decisions. By providing a series of special cases of the second-stage problem resembling the different modeling assumptions, we aim to establish a common consensus regarding the key modeling decisions to be taken in maintenance planning problems for offshore wind farms. We provide newly constructed, and publicly available, benchmark sets. We extensively compare the different SMFTPO settings and its special cases on those benchmark sets, and we show that the special case reformulations are very effective for solving the second-stage problems.

First, we revisit the parking pricing scheme at P + R parking facility with parking restraint and find that it fails to eliminate extra costs arising from competition for inadequate parking spots. Fortunately, competition for inadequate parking spots can be eliminated by a strategy of parking permits distribution. Then we investigate the optimal number of parking permits distributed to each OD pair in a many-to-one park and ride network. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). However, parking permit management is less efficient than parking pricing at P + R facility when parking provision is sufficient. Therefore, we propose two hybrid management schemes with parking pricing and parking permit to reduce system travel cost. Joint implementation of parking pricing and parking permit not only alleviates the traffic congestion but also eliminates the competition for inadequate parking space. Next, the bi-level programming models are proposed to determine the optimal parking fees at P + R parking facilities in the hybrid management schemes. In the bi-level programming models, the number of parking permits assigned or held by each OD pair is an implicit function with respect to parking fee. A global optimum oriented solution algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm are used to solve the MILP and bi-level programming models respectively.

Specifically, at critical or congested densities, any over-input traffic flow may cause degradation, local traffic jams, and even hysteresis of the road network. Existing macroscopic traffic control methods usually target the maximum capacity or minimum delay to improve the road network efficiency and do not consider the negative effect of perimeter control on the state transfer of the road network. This study provides a method to prevent the transfer of the network state when implementing boundary control. First, according to the data detected for the road network, the concept of a conditional value at risk is used to establish a risk decision model that considers the influence of the boundary input flow rate on sub-region state degradation. Then, based on the risk decision model, we propose a state transfer risk decision (STRD) perimeter control method for a large-scale traffic network with multiple sub-regions. This perimeter control method predicts the traffic demand of every sub-region, selects an acceptable traffic flow range at the sub-region boundary by risk interval, regards the maximum trip completion flow and the minimum total travel time as the decision-making objectives, and controls multiple sub-region boundaries. The simulation results show that compared with proportional integral (PI) control and no STRD (NSTRD) control, the STRD control scheme can effectively prevent the state transfer of all sub-regions, improve the trip completion flow, and decrease the travel delay of the network.",0968-090X,Not found
The rebalancing of bike-sharing system under flow-type task window,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.015,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"With the growing importance of bike-sharing systems, this paper designs a new framework to solve rebalancing problem. It contains two aspects: dynamic rebalancing within each station and static rebalancing among stations. Firstly, we give a new flow-type task window (F-window) by defining the consistency index of travelers. It is more suitable as a task window for rebalancing than time-type task window (T-window) based on three aspects analysis. Through three assumptions, the temporal-distribution learning model including task window and station storage configuration, are built to realize new dynamic rebalancing. The spatial-distribution learning method is introduced to divide management areas for static rebalancing. The empirical results show that F-window can better match the strong time-sensitive of demand fluctuation. Compared with traditional rebalancing needs hours, each rebalancing within a station can be completed within average 4 min. By setting the station storage configuration, it makes rebalancing in this paper meets the demand of 28.3 times the hourly rebalancing within one week. And the number of vehicles visiting stations has dropped below 20%.",0968-090X,Not found
An integrated micro-macro approach for high-speed railway energy-efficient timetabling problem,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.008,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Energy efficiency of train operations is influenced largely by the speed control and the scheduled running time in the train timetable. In practice, the running time of a train is often determined in the train timetabling process at the macroscopic level while the energy-efficient speed control of a train on a segment is often determined at the microscopic level with the given timetable. They are usually optimized separately due to limited computational resources, which however may result in sub-optimal solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel integrated micro-macro approach for better incorporating train energy-efficient speed control into the railway timetabling process. Firstly, we formulated the integrated train timetabling and speed control optimization problem as a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model. Due to its complexity, we reformulate it on the basis of flow conservation theory in a space–time-speed (STS) network and solve the problem in two steps. In the first step, a set of pre-solved energy-efficient train trajectory templates is generated by a segment-level optimization approach with consideration of train travel time, entry speed and exit speed to save computation time. In the second step, a near-optimum train energy-efficient timetable solution is found by a fast algorithm, which consists of the shortest generalized cost path algorithm, conflict detection and resolution algorithm, and calculation of dynamic headways between two successive trains. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed approach provides better outcomes than the benchmark case in terms of both train journey time and energy consumption.",0968-090X,Not found
A graph CNN-LSTM neural network for short and long-term traffic forecasting based on trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.010,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Traffic forecasting is an important research area in Intelligent Transportation Systems that is focused on anticipating traffic in order to mitigate congestion.

The model is trained and tested using sparse trajectory (GPS) data coming from the ride-hailing service of DiDi in the cities of Xi'an and Chengdu in China. Besides, presenting the deep neural network, we also propose a data-reduction technique based on temporal correlation to select the most relevant road links to be used as input. Combining the suggested approaches, our model obtains better results compared to high-performance algorithms for traffic forecasting, such as LSTM or the algorithms presented in the TRANSFOR19 forecasting competition.

Estimating network travel time reliability with network partitioning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.013,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Network travel time reliability can be represented by a relationship between network space-mean travel time and the standard deviation of network travel time. The primary objective of this paper is to improve estimation of the network travel time reliability with network partitioning. We partition a heterogeneous large-scale network into homogeneous regions (clusters) with well-defined Network Fundamental Diagrams (NFD) using directional and non-directional partitioning approaches. To estimate the network travel time reliability, a linear relationship is estimated that relates the mean travel time with the standard deviation of travel time per unit of distance at the network level. The impact of different partitioning approaches, as well as the number of clusters, on the network travel time reliability relationship are also explored. To estimate individual vehicle travel times, we use two distinct approaches to allocate vehicle trajectories to different time intervals, namely trajectory and sub-trajectory methods. We apply the proposed framework to a large-scale network of Chicago using a 24-h dynamic traffic simulation. Partitioning and travel time reliability estimation are conducted for both morning and afternoon peak periods to demonstrate the impacts of travel demand pattern variations. The numerical results show that the sub-trajectory method for the network travel time reliability estimation and the directional partitioning with three clusters have the highest performance among other tested methods. The analyses also demonstrate that partitioning a heterogeneous network into homogeneous clusters may improve network travel reliability estimation by estimating an independent relationship for each cluster. Also, comparing morning and afternoon peak periods suggests that the estimated parameter for the linear network travel time reliability relationship is directly related to the coefficient of variation of density as a measure of spatial distribution of congestion across the network.",0968-090X,Not found
Examining the effects of emotional valence and arousal on takeover performance in conditionally automated driving,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.006,112,2020-03-01,2020,3,"In conditionally automated driving, drivers have difficulty in takeover transitions as they become increasingly decoupled from the operational level of driving. Factors influencing takeover performance, such as takeover lead time and the engagement of non-driving-related tasks, have been studied in the past. However, despite the important role emotions play in human-machine interaction and in manual driving, little is known about how emotions influence drivers’ takeover performance. This study, therefore, examined the effects of emotional valence and arousal on drivers’ takeover timeliness and quality in conditionally automated driving. We conducted a driving simulation experiment with 32 participants. Movie clips were played for emotion induction. Participants with different levels of emotional valence and arousal were required to take over control from automated driving, and their takeover time and quality were analyzed. Results indicate that positive valence led to better takeover quality in the form of a smaller maximum resulting acceleration and a smaller maximum resulting jerk. However, high arousal did not yield an advantage in takeover time. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how emotional valence and arousal affect takeover performance. The benefits of positive emotions carry over from manual driving to conditionally automated driving while the benefits of arousal do not.",0968-090X,Not found

Reservoir-based surrogate modeling of dynamic user equilibrium,10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.010,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper proposes a new dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) traffic assignment model using reservoir-based network reduction techniques and surrogate dynamic network loading models. A traffic network is decomposed into a reservoir structure, and the DUE problem is formulated as a variational inequality, with an embedded surrogate model for the path delay operator to describe traffic dynamics at the reservoir level. The surrogate model is further enhanced by the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and adaptive sampling to reduce approximation error and improve computational efficiency. To solve the proposed surrogate-based DUE problem on reduced networks, we develop a customized algorithm that integrates the kernel trick with the generalized projection framework. A pre-computation scheme is proposed, which calculates and stores the of kernel matrices and vectors, could further reduce the computational burden.

Optimal privacy control for transport network data sharing,10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.010,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"In the era of smart cities, Internet of Things, and Mobility-as-a-Service, private operators need to share data with public agencies to support data exchanges for “living lab” ecosystems more than ever before. However, it is still problematic for private operators to share data with the public due to risks to competitive advantages. A privacy control algorithm is proposed to overcome this key obstacle for private operators sharing complex network-oriented data objects. The algorithm is based on information-theoretic k-anonymity and, using tour data as an example, where an operator’s data is used in conjunction with performance measure accuracy controls to synthesize a set of alternative tours with diffused probabilities for sampling during a query. The algorithm is proven to converge sublinearly toward a constrained maximum entropy under certain asymptotic conditions with measurable gap. Computational experiments verify the applicability to multi-vehicle fleet tour data; they confirm that reverse engineered parameters from the diffused data result in controllable sampling error; and tests conducted on a set of realistic routing records from travel data in Long Island, NY, demonstrate the use of the methodology from both the adversary and user perspectives.",0968-090X,Not found
On the modeling of passenger mobility for stochastic bi-modal urban corridors,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.018,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the passenger macroscopic fundamental diagram for bi-modal urban corridors while accounting for the stochastic nature of bus operations. The proposed framework extends the existing variational theory (VT) approaches by: (i) introducing a probabilistic VT graph, where the costs are computed using an efficient stochastic shortest path algorithm; (ii) capturing the effects of stochastic moving bus bottlenecks and the correlation of bus arrival times; (iii) incorporating a macroscopic passenger model that reflects the passenger dynamics for the different modes; and (iv) accounting for the effects that the traffic conditions might have on bus operations. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation and empirical data from a bi-modal corridor in Zurich, Switzerland, we not only successfully validate the results yielded by our stochastic VT approach, but also show its applicability on a real corridor. A comparison with a deterministic VT approach reveals the value of the proposed framework, especially for corridors with a high bus frequency and considerable stochasticity. The results demonstrate that incorporating stochasticity and the traffic conditions is essential if buses run with relatively short and variable headways. Moreover, we introduce an innovative application example for the evaluation of different bus lane layouts, aiming to maximize the passenger throughput along a bi-modal urban corridor. The application example shows that the proposed framework can be used as an efficient modeling tool for practitioners. In particular, it can be used to identify a proper lane allocation strategy by computing the critical density of cars when a mixed lane should be switched to a dedicated bus lane or vice versa. It is important to note that such application would not have been possible without our proposed VT extensions, which account for both passenger dynamics and the impact of traffic conditions. Finally, given that the proposed methodology is generic, it can be easily extended to various traffic problems involving stochasticity.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic trucking equilibrium through a freight exchange,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.026,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper proposes a new hyperpath-based dynamic trucking equilibrium (DTE) assignment model. Unlike existing freight assignment models, we focus on the interactions between individual truck operators that solely compete for loads advertised on an online freight exchange. The competitors are assumed to follow optimal bidding and routing strategies – represented using a hyperpath – to maximize their expected profit. The proposed DTE model (1) predicts system-wide truck flows (including empty truck flows), (2) identifies efficiency improvements gained by network-wide visibility, and (3) lays the foundation for building a system optimal model. We rewrite the DTE conditions as a variational inequality problem (VIP) and discuss the analytical properties of the formulation, including solution existence. A heuristic solution algorithm is developed to solve the VIP, which consists of three modules: a dynamic network loading procedure for mapping hyperpath flows onto the freight network, a column generation scheme for creating hyperpaths as needed, and a method of successive average for equilibrating profits on existing hyperpaths. The model and the solution algorithm are validated by numerical experiments constructed from empirical data collected in China. The results show that the DTE solutions outperform with wide margin the benchmark solutions that either ignore inter-truck interactions or operate trucks according to suboptimal routing and bidding decisions.",0968-090X,Not found
Joint design of multimodal transit networks and shared autonomous mobility fleets,10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.010,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Providing quality transit service to travelers in low-density areas, particularly travelers without personal vehicles, is a constant challenge for transit agencies. The advent of fully-autonomous vehicles (AVs) and their inclusion in mobility service fleets may allow transit agencies to offer better service and/or reduce their own capital and operational costs. This study focuses on the problem of allocating resources between transit patterns and operating (or subsidizing) shared-use AV mobility services (SAMSs) in a large metropolitan area. To address this question, a joint transit network redesign and SAMS fleet size determination problem (JTNR-SFSDP) is introduced, and a bi-level mathematical programming formulation and solution approach are presented. The upper-level problem modifies a transit network frequency setting problem (TNFSP) formulation via incorporating SAMS fleet size as a decision variable and allowing the removal of bus routes. The lower-level problem consists of a dynamic combined mode choice-traveler assignment problem (DCMC-TAP) formulation. The heuristic solution procedure involves solving the upper-level problem using a nonlinear programming solver and solving the lower-level problem using an iterative agent-based assignment-simulation approach. To illustrate the effectiveness of the modeling framework, this study uses traveler demand from Chicago along with the region’s existing multimodal transit network. The computational results indicate significant traveler benefits, in terms of improved average traveler wait times, associated with optimizing the joint design of multimodal transit networks and SAMS fleets compared with the initial transit network design.",0968-090X,Not found
Personalized incentives for promoting sustainable travel behaviors,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.015,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"We develop a personalized system to modify individual travel behaviors by offering personalized incentives. Individual preferences are learned to provide personalized incentives so that the promoted alternative is likely accepted. Using knowledge from control theories and state estimation, we model travelers’ choice-making behaviors with the random utility theory and responses from the individuals are mined by a particle filter for learning individual preferences to promote sustainable behaviors. The discrete nature of travel behavior naturally leads to limited observability. We overcome this problem by designing a measurement function from which additional information can be solicited. Additionally, the inherent trade-offs between factors that affect travel choices result in an infinite set of solutions. We thus propose two solutions: (1) the divide and conquer strategy in which a multi-dimensional conditional probability function is proposed; and (2) use of domain knowledge to restrict that preference values fall in certain ranges and are consistent with certain distributions. The performance of preference learning with these two solutions applied is shown via simulation tests and an online experiment involving human participants. For departure time choices, we show an average acceptance ratio of 0.68 for all participants when being promoted with alternatives with personalized incentives. We also show that changes in individual departure time choices will lead to 48% reduction in total travel time on a simple transportation network.",0968-090X,Not found
A stochastic model for bus injection in an unscheduled public transport service,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.029,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Randomness affecting the operation of public transport systems generates significant increments in waiting times. A strategy to deal with this randomness is bus injection, in which buses are kept in specific points along the route ready to be dispatched when an event such as an extremely long headway occurs. In this work, a stochastic model based on the second moment of the headways distribution is developed to determine if one or more buses are worth reserving for injection in a public transport service. A single stop approach is initially used to determine an expression for the optimal headway threshold triggering the injection. Then, a model for the complete service is developed and used to determine when the empty bus should be injected within the headway once the decision to inject it has been taken. We show that the bus should be injected approximately when 57% of the headway has passed. Simulations with real data are used to test the proposed model, proving its accuracy in terms of measuring the impact on waiting times. The results show that reserving a bus to be injected can be better than operating the entire fleet continuously.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling urban taxi services with e-hailings: A queueing network approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.036,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The rise of e-hailing taxis has significantly altered urban transportation system and led to a competitive taxi market with both traditional street-hailing and e-hailing taxis. The various taxi services provide similar door-to-door rides, thus compete with each other. Meanwhile, the expanding fleet size of e-hailing taxis, together with considerable number of traditional taxicabs, influence the urban road network performance, which can also in turn affect taxi mode choice and operation. In this study, we propose an innovative modeling structure for the competitive taxi market and capture the interactions not only within the taxi market but also between the taxi market and urban road system. The model is built on a network linking a certain number of queues, derived from both the taxi and urban road system. Considering both the passenger and vehicle arrivals, we utilize an assembly-like queue SM / M / 1 for passenger-vehicle matching within the taxi system, which controls how many and how frequently vehicles drive from the taxi system to the urban road system. A common multi-server M / M / c queue that can account for road capacity is proposed for the urban road system and a feedback of network states is sent back to the taxi system. Then the stationary state distributions, as well as asymptotic properties, of the queueing network are discussed. An example is designed based on data from New York City. Numerical results show that the proposed modeling structure, together with the corresponding approximation method, can capture dynamics within high demand areas and, in particular, a spatially balanced system. Overall, this study shows how the queueing network approach can measure aggregated performance of various taxi services, for instance, not only the waiting/searching time during passenger-vehicle matching but also the delays in the urban road network. Furthermore, the model can be generalized to study the control and management of taxi markets.",0968-090X,Not found
A Pareto-improving and revenue-neutral scheme to manage mass transit congestion with heterogeneous commuters,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.016,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"A hybrid fare scheme (HFS) is proposed in this paper that combines a fare-reward scheme (H-FRS) and a non-rewarding uniform fare scheme (H-UFS) by considering the heterogeneity in transit commuters’ scheduling flexibility. It aims at reducing peak-hour congestion in the urban transit system with alternative options catering for various commuters. In the H-FRS, a commuter will be rewarded with a free ride during the periods preceding or following a given shoulder period after taking a certain number of paid rides during the central period in peak hours. In the H-UFS, a commuter needs to pay a different but uniform fare during peak hours. Commuters will have the opportunity to join either of the sub-schemes according to their scheduling flexibility of departure time choice. The hybrid fare scheme determines the free fare intervals, the rewarding ratio, and the new fares for the sub-schemes. Our results demonstrate that the proposed HFS is not only revenue-preserving but also Pareto-improving.

Continuum car-following model of capacity drop at sag and tunnel bottlenecks,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.012,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Sags and tunnels are major bottlenecks, where the road capacity is reduced, and the “capacity drop” phenomenon occurs; however, there is no simple model or theory that can explain the formation and other characteristics of capacity drop. This paper presents a car-following model, which is equivalent to a continuum model in the Lagrangian coordinates. The model is built on two main assumptions: (i) inhomogeneous fundamental diagrams with location-dependent time gaps, and (ii) bounded acceleration. We first demonstrate that the stationary speed profiles, the low acceleration rates, the dropped capacity, and the approximate time duration of the capacity drop formation in the model are consistent with empirical observations. Then the impacts on the stationary states and dropped capacity of the numerical viscosity caused by the discretization method are investigated, and it is shown that the dropped capacity converges to the theoretical value. Further, a one-dimensional iterated function system is proposed to model the formation mechanism of the capacity drop, which is derived by investigating the spatial pattern of equilibrium and bounded acceleration traffic states that arises in a lead-vehicle problem. Utilizing this model, we uncover a set of properties of the capacity drop such as existence, uniqueness, global convergence, and convergence speed. Finally, the model is applied to analyze the impacts of heterogeneous drivers.

On the value of relative flow data,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.001,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Traffic flow can be described using three dimensions, i.e., space x, time t and cumulative flow N. This study considers estimating the cumulative flow over space and time, i.e., N ( x , t ) , using relative flow data collected by stationary and moving observers. Stationary observers, e.g., loop-detectors, can observe flow at fixed position over time. Furthermore, automated or other equipped and connected vehicles can serve as moving observers that observe flow relative to their position over time. To present the value of relative flow data, in this paper, we take the perspective of a model-based estimation approach. In this approach, the data is used in two processes: (1) information assimilation of real-time data and models and (2) learning of the models used in information assimilation based on historical data. This paper focuses on traffic state estimation on links. However, we explain that, in absence of stationary observer that are positioned at the link boundaries, it is valuable to consider the information propagation over nodes. Throughout this study a LWR-model with a triangular fundamental diagram (FD) is used to develop the principles that can be used for the two processes. These principles are tested in a simulation (VISSIM) study. This study shows that we can find the traffic flow model parameters and can partially estimate the link boundary conditions based on relative flow data collected by moving observers alone. It also shows that the traffic flow behavior differs partially from the LWR-model with triangular FD, and therefore, we recommend the option to learn and use other traffic flow models in future research. Overall, relative flow data is considered valuable to obtain model learning datasets and to estimate the traffic state.",0968-090X,Not found
The danger zone of express services: When increasing frequencies can deteriorate the level of service,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.013,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Express bus services are services that skip some of the stops along their routes to provide a faster ride for particularly demanded trips on a corridor. There is a growing literature on express services that focuses on route design and performance evaluation. In this work, we study a simplified transit corridor where a regular service operates in tandem with an end-to-end express service. Assuming that passengers minimize their expected travel and waiting times, we show that, even if the system has enough aggregate capacity, it may present a specific range of frequencies for the express service where it attracts more demand than it can actually fulfill. We call this range the “danger zone” of express services. When frequencies fall within the danger zone, a queue of passengers will form at the station. Applying queuing theory, we obtain expressions to estimate these queues and the associated waiting times, expected travel times and social costs of the system. We show that even when the station has unlimited passenger capacity, the performance of the system can be greatly affected in the danger zone. If the station has indeed limited capacity, the scenario can be much worse: if the queue grows to the point of saturating the station, a vicious circle ensues that amplifies the negative effects of the danger zone.",0968-090X,Not found
A data driven method for OD matrix estimation,10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.014,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The fundamental challenge of the origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation problem is that it is severely under-determined. In this paper we propose a new data driven OD estimation method for cases where a supply pattern in the form of speeds and flows is available. We show that with these input data, we do not require an iterative dynamic network loading procedure that results in an equilibrium assignment, nor do we need an assumption on the kind of equilibrium that emerges from this process. The minimal number of ingredients which are needed are (a) a method to estimate/predict production and attraction time series; (b) a method to compute the N shortest paths from each OD zone to the next; and (c) two—possibly OD-specific—assumptions on the magnitude of N; and on the proportionality of path flows between these origins and destinations, respectively. The latter constitutes the most important behavioral assumption in our method, which relates to how we assume travelers have chosen their routes between OD pairs. We choose a proportionality factor that is inversely proportional to realized travel time, where we incorporate a penalty for path overlap. For large networks, these ingredients may be insufficient to solve the resulting system of equations. We show how additional constraints can be derived directly from the data by using principal component analysis, with which we exploit the fact that temporal patterns of production and attraction are similar across the network. Experimental results on a toy network and a large city network (Santander, Spain) show that our OD estimation method works satisfactorily, given a reasonable choice of N, and the use of so-called 3D supply patterns, which provide a compact representation of the supply dynamics over the entire network. Inclusion of topological information makes the method scalable both in terms of network size and for different topologies. Although we use a neural network to predict production and attraction in our experiments (which implies ground-truth OD data were needed), there are straight-forward paths to improve the method using additional data, such as demographic data, household survey data, social media and or movement traces, which could support estimating such ground-truth baseline production and attraction patterns.

City-wide traffic control: Modeling impacts of cordon queues,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.024,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Optimal cordon-metering rates are obtained using Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams in combination with flow conservation laws. A model-predictive control algorithm is also used so that time-varying metering rates are generated based on their forecasted impacts. Our scalable algorithm can do this for an arbitrary number of cordoned neighborhoods within a city. Unlike its predecessors, the proposed model accounts for the time-varying constraining effects that cordon queues impose on a neighborhood’s circulating traffic, as those queues expand and recede over time. The model does so at every time step by approximating a neighborhood’s street space occupied by cordon queues, and re-scaling the MFD to describe the state of circulating traffic that results. The model also differentiates between saturated and under-saturated cordon-metering operations. Computer simulations of an idealized network show that these enhancements can substantially improve the predictions of both, the trip completion rates in a neighborhood and the rates that vehicles cross metered cordons. Optimal metering policies generated as a result are similarly shown to do a better job in reducing the Vehicle Hours Traveled on the network.

Cooperative adaptive cruise control for connected autonomous vehicles by factoring communication-related constraints,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.010,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Emergent cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategies being proposed for platoon formation in the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) context mostly assume idealized fixed information flow topologies (IFTs) for the platoon, implying guaranteed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications for the IFT assumed. In reality, V2V communications are unreliable due to failures resulting from communication-related constraints such as interference and information congestion. Since CACC strategies entail continuous information broadcasting, communication failures can occur in congested CAV traffic networks, leading to a platoon’s IFT varying dynamically. To explicitly factor IFT dynamics and to leverage it to enhance the performance of CACC strategies, this study proposes the idea of dynamically optimizing the IFT for CACC, labeled the CACC-OIFT strategy. Under CACC-OIFT, the vehicles in the platoon cooperatively determine in real-time which vehicles will dynamically deactivate or activate the “send” functionality of their V2V communication devices to generate IFTs that optimize the platoon performance in terms of string stability under the ambient traffic conditions. The CACC-OIFT consists of an IFT optimization model and an adaptive Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. Given the adaptive PD controller with a two-predecessor-following scheme, and the ambient traffic conditions and the platoon size just before the start of a time period, the IFT optimization model determines the optimal IFT that maximizes the expected string stability in terms of the energy of speed oscillations. This expectation is because each IFT has specific degeneration scenarios whose probabilities are determined by the communication failure probabilities for that time period based on the ambient traffic conditions. The optimal IFT is deployed for that time period, and the adaptive PD controller continuously determines the car-following behaviors of the vehicles based on the unfolding degeneration scenario for each time instant within that period. The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-OIFT is validated through numerical experiments in NS-3 based on NGSIM field data. The results indicate that the proposed CACC-OIFT can significantly enhance the string stability of platoon control in an unreliable V2V communication context, outperforming CACCs with fixed IFTs or with passive adaptive schemes for IFT dynamics.",0968-090X,Not found
A behavioral microeconomic foundation for car-following models,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.004,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The objective of this paper is to develop a micro-economic modeling approach for car-following behaviors that may capture different risk-taking tendencies when dealing with different traffic conditions. The proposed framework allows for the consideration of perception subjectivity and judgement errors that may lead to unsafe acceleration driving maneuvers with the possibility of real-end collisions. The modeling approach relies on a generalized utility-based formulation with three specific types of subjective utility functions (SUFs): Prospect Utility (PT) subjective utility function, Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) subjective utility function, and an Exponential Constant Relative Risk Aversion (ECRA) subjective utility function. The formulation is assessed in terms of its homogeneous macroscopic properties (thus leading to a triangular fundamental diagram) and its non-homogeneous microscopic properties (thus leading to realistic following behavior facing different traffic scenarios). Once tested in terms of feasibility, the modeling approach is calibrated against real-life trajectory data. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) method is adopted to minimize a spacing-mixed-error term while considering inter-driving heterogeneity. The three models (i.e. PT, CRRA and ECRA) produce acceptable error values with the PT model showing the best fit, followed by the ECRA model, followed by the CRRA model. Even though the CRRA and the PT models show similar intensity in the acceleration response to the behavior of a lead vehicle with more disturbance (stochasticity/randomness) seen with the CRRA SUF, the PT and the ECRA models show more realistic wave formation despite their difference in terms of individual acceleration distribution functions. The ECRA model results in an amplified sensitivity to the behavior of the lead vehicle with the acceleration probability distribution function skewed to the left (i.e. towards decelerating rather than accelerating). The calibration exercise is followed by a simulation exercise. The three suggested models produce a homogeneous congestion phase, but a clear transient single/multiple wave formation is seen with the PT and the ECRA models. These latter models are able to reproduce all the congestion regimes observed on real-world surface transportation networks. The ECRA is characterized by a decreased capacity and increased traffic disturbances with additional shockwave formation. Finally, the different models allow the possibility of perception or judgement errors with the explicit incorporation of a collision probability and a collision weight in the suggested formulation approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Responsive bus dispatching strategy in a multi-modal and multi-directional transportation system: A doubly dynamical approach,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.005,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper examines the time-dependent bus dispatching problem in a multi-modal context. Traditional studies along this line often optimize the bus frequency or schedule. However, they may fail as the realized bus frequency or schedule is constrained by the time-varying traffic congestion on the road. Adding more buses to service does not necessarily increase the service frequency. Given this, we look into the time-dependent bus dispatching (number of buses in service on road) when taking into account complex multi-modal and multi-directional flow interactions on the road. In particular, the traffic dynamics over clock time is modeled through an aggregate traffic representation with flow interactions between cars and buses, and interactions between traffic in opposite moving directions. Instead of explicitly optimizing the size of dispatched bus fleet, we propose an adaptive fleet size adjustment mechanism where we have a target level of bus loading factor. This adaptive or responsive approach, by taking advantage of the doubly dynamical system proposed in Liu and Geroliminis (2017), adjusts the size of dispatched bus fleet over calendar time and accommodates day-to-day variations of mode choices and traffic patterns. Numerical studies show that the proposed approach can help bus operator to reduce operating cost and improve net benefit while maintaining comparable user costs for passengers. This study offers a new perspective for dynamic bus dispatching strategy and improves our understanding of multi-modal traffic dynamics.",0968-090X,Not found
Adaptive railway traffic control using approximate dynamic programming,10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.002,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This study presents an adaptive railway traffic controller for real-time operations based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP). By assessing requirements and opportunities, the controller aims to limit consecutive delays resulting from trains that entered a control area behind schedule by sequencing them at a critical location in a timely manner, thus representing the practical requirements of railway operations. This approach depends on an approximation to the value function of dynamic programming after optimisation from a specified state, which is estimated dynamically from operational experience using reinforcement learning techniques. By using this approximation, the ADP avoids extensive explicit evaluation of performance and so reduces the computational burden substantially. In this investigation, we explore formulations of the approximation function and variants of the learning techniques used to estimate it. Evaluation of the ADP methods in a stochastic simulation environment shows considerable improvements in consecutive delays by comparison with the current industry practice of First-Come-First-Served sequencing. We also found that estimates of parameters of the approximate value function are similar across a range of test scenarios with different mean train entry delays.",0968-090X,Not found
Traffic dynamics under speed disturbance in mixed traffic with automated and non-automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.017,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper elucidates the impacts of vehicle heterogeneity on traffic dynamics and throughput of mixed traffic consisting of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles (RVs). The main premise is that the heterogeneity in preferred acceleration rate, desired speed, and car-following (CF) behavior (e.g., reaction pattern and sensitivity to a traffic disturbance) will change traffic properties in ways that can undermine traffic flow throughput. This paper first decomposes the mechanism into two elements – one driven by acceleration and one by time-varying CF response to disturbances – and then investigates their compounded effect. This paper also provides unifying frameworks to analyze the behavior of RVs and CAVs to facilitate analytical investigations. The results reveal how heterogeneous acceleration and CF behavior may create persistent voids and diminish traffic throughput. Integrating all the elements, throughput reduction is quantified via numerical simulations.",0968-090X,Not found
Traffic state estimation on a two-dimensional network by a state-space model,10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.016,113,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This study proposes a state-space model that estimates traffic states over a two-dimensional network with alternative routes available by a data assimilation technique that fuses probe vehicle data with a traffic flow model. Although a number of studies propose traffic monitoring methods based on physical flow dynamics using sensing data such as probe vehicle and traffic detector data, they are basically limited to traffic monitoring along a simple road section. This study extends the analysis to a two-dimensional network, in which several alternative routes exist for each OD, with consideration of the route choice behaviours of users. Our proposed method employs sequential Bayesian filtering with a cell transmission model (CTM) for the flow model and probe vehicle data. From the probe vehicle data, not only cell densities but also diverging ratios are assumed to be measured and these measurements are assimilated into the flow model. The model validation in a hypothetical network reveals the potential of the model and discloses future issues.",0968-090X,Not found
Next-generation quay crane scheduling,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.015,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Quay crane scheduling is considered one of the most complex seaside operations in container terminals, and is directly correlated with vessel service and waiting times. Traditionally, quay cranes can handle one container at a time. However, this is expected to change with the recently patented next-generation quay crane: The Ship to Shore Multi-trolley Portal Gantry Container Crane. These next-generation cranes can access two bays simultaneously and can operate on four containers at a time. In this work, we introduce a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and an exact solution approach to solve the next-generation quay crane scheduling problem. The solution technique breaks the main problem into two sequential stages. The first stage uses a fast set-partitioning formulation to solve the general case and a closed form analytic approach to solve specific cases, while the second stage uses a partitioning heuristic combined with a branch-and-price algorithm. A real-workload case study and simulated-workload case studies are used to assess the performance of the next-generation cranes versus traditional ones. Results show that the use of two to three next-generation cranes can generally reduce the service time beyond the best possible service time achieved by traditional cranes. Moreover, average service times can be reduced by up to 65%. Finally, results of a computational study and sensitivity analyses show that the proposed solution approach has low sensitivity to the different parameters and clearly outperforms CPLEX in that it can solve real-sized cases rapidly; in the computational study all cases were solved in less than 20 s.",0968-090X,Not found
Route choice behaviour and travel information in a congested network: Static and dynamic recursive models,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.014,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Travel information has the potential to influence travellers choices, in order to steer travellers to less congested routes and alleviate congestion. This paper investigates, on the one hand, how travel information affects route choice behaviour, and on the other hand, the impact of the travel time representation on the interpretation of parameter estimates and prediction accuracy. To this end, we estimate recursive models using data from an innovative data collection effort consisting of route choice observation data from GPS trackers, travel diaries and link travel times on the overall network. Though such combined data sets exist, these have not yet been used to investigate route choice behaviour. A dynamic network in which travel times change over time has been used for the estimation of both recursive logit and nested models. Prediction and estimation results are compared to those obtained for a static network. The interpretation of parameter estimates and prediction accuracy differ substantially between dynamic and static networks as well as between models with correlated and uncorrelated utilities. Contrary to the static results, for the dynamic, where travel times are modelled more accurately, travel information does not have a significant impact on route choice behaviour. However, having travel information increases the travel comfort, as interviews with participants have shown.",0968-090X,Not found
Truck-drone team logistics: A heuristic approach to multi-drop route planning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.030,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Recently there have been significant developments and applications in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In a few years, these applications will be fully integrated into our lives. The practical application and use of UAVs presents several problems that are of a different nature to the specific technology of the components involved. Among them, the most relevant problem deriving from the use of UAVs in logistics distribution tasks is the so-called “last mile” delivery. In the present work, we focus on the resolution of the truck-drone team logistics problem. The problems of tandem routing have a complex structure and have only been partially addressed in the scientific literature. The use of UAVs raises a series of restrictions and considerations that did not appear previously in routing problems; most notably, aspects such as the limited power-life of batteries used by the UAVs and the determination of rendezvous points where they are replaced by fully-charged new batteries. These difficulties have until now limited the mathematical formulation of truck-drone routing problems and their resolution to mainly small-size cases. To overcome these limitations we propose an iterated greedy heuristic based on the iterative process of destruction and reconstruction of solutions. This process is orchestrated by a global optimization scheme using a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. We test our approach in a large set of instances of different sizes taken from literature. The obtained results are quite promising, even for large-size scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found
A comparison of online and in-person activity engagement: The case of shopping and eating meals,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.023,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The virtual (online) and physical (in-person) worlds are increasingly inter-connected. Although there is considerable research into the effects of information and communication technologies (ICT) on activity-travel choices, there is little understanding of the inter-relationships between online and in-person activity participation and the extent to which the two worlds complement one another or substitute for one another. Shopping is one of the activity realms in which the virtual and physical spaces are increasingly interacting. This paper aims to unravel the relationships between online and in-person activity engagement in the shopping domain, while explicitly distinguishing between shopping for non-grocery goods, grocery products, and ready-to-eat meals. Data from the 2017 Puget Sound household travel survey is used to estimate a multivariate ordered probit model of the number of days in a week that a sample of households engages in in-person activity engagement and online activity engagement for each of these shopping activity types – leading to a model of six endogenous outcomes. Model results show that there are intricate complementary and substitution effects between in-person and online shopping activities, that these activities are considered as a single packaged bundle, and that the frequencies of these activities are significantly affected by income, built environment attributes, and household structure. The findings suggest that travel forecasting models should incorporate model components that capture the interplay between in-person and online shopping engagement and explicitly distinguish between non-grocery and grocery shopping activities. Policies that help bridge the digital divide so that households of all socio-economic strata can access goods and services in the virtual world would help improve quality of life for all.

Joint optimization of customer location clustering and drone-based routing for last-mile deliveries,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.019,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"With growing consumer demand and expectations, companies are attempting to achieve cost-efficient and faster delivery operations. The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach. Finally, several key insights are obtained to aid the logistics practitioners in decision making.",0968-090X,Not found
Joint optimization of scheduling and capacity for mixed traffic with autonomous and human-driven buses: A dynamic programming approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.03.001,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"It is a common practice for transit lines with fluctuating passenger demands to use demand-driven bus scheduling to reduce passenger waiting time and avoid bus overcrowding. However, current literature on the demand-driven bus scheduling generally assumes fixed bus capacity and exclusively optimizes bus dispatch headways. With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicle technology and the introduction of autonomous minibus/shuttle, the joint design of bus capacity and dispatch headway holds promises to further improving the system efficiency while reducing operating and passenger costs. This paper formulates this problem as an integer nonlinear programming model for transit systems operating with mixed human-driven and autonomous buses. In such mixed operating environment, the model simultaneously considers: (1) dynamic capacity design of autonomous bus, i.e., autonomous buses with varying capacity can be obtained by assembling and/or dissembling multiple autonomous minibuses; (2) trajectory control of autonomous bus, i.e., autonomous bus can dynamically adjust its running time as a function of its forward and backward headways; and (3) stop-level passenger boarding and alighting behavior. The objective of the model is designed to balance the trade-off between the operating costs of dispatching different types of bus and the costs of increased passenger waiting time due to inadequate bus dispatching. The model is solved using a dynamic programming approach. We show that the proposed model is effective in reducing passenger waiting time and total operating cost. Sensitivity analysis is further conducted to explore the impact of miscellaneous factors on optimal dispatching decisions, such as penetration rate of autonomous bus, bus running time variation, and passenger demand level.",0968-090X,Not found
Trip-based graph partitioning in dynamic ridesharing,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.008,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"A dynamic ridesharing system is a platform that connects drivers who use their personal vehicles to travel with riders who are in need of transportation, on a short notice. Since each driver/rider may have several potential matches, to achieve a high performance level, the ridesharing operator needs to make the matching decisions based on a global view of the system that includes all active riders and drivers. Consequently, the ride-matching problem that needs to be solved can become computationally expensive, especially when the system is operating over a large region, or when it faces high demand levels during certain hours of the day. This paper develops a graph partitioning methodology based on the bipartite graph that arises in the one-to-one ride-matching problem. The proposed method decomposes the original graph into multiple sub-graphs with the goal of reducing the overall computational complexity of the problem as well as providing high quality solutions. We further show that this methodology can be extended to more complex ride-matching problems in a dynamic ride-sharing system. Using numerical experiments, we showcase the advantages of the new partitioning method for different forms of ride-matching problems.

On-line aggressive driving identification based on in-vehicle kinematic parameters under naturalistic driving conditions,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.028,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Aggressive driving, amongst all driving behaviors, is largely responsible for leading to traffic accidents. With the objective to improve road safety, this paper develops an on-line approach for vehicle running state monitoring and aggressive driving identification, using kinematic parameters captured by the in-vehicle recorder under naturalistic driving conditions. To characterize the roads in reality, a novel road conceptual model is proposed. It accounts for not only the curve on the horizontal plane but also the slope on the vertical plane, as well as the cross slope. For each position where the vehicle is driving, the vehicle motion is decomposed into two circular motions on the horizontal and vertical planes. On each plane, the vehicle maneuver is first identified. Then, aggressive driving is identified according to the limit equilibrium of driving safety or comfortability. Based on the proposed method called “three-elements”, the vehicle maneuver, radius and slope angle on the vertical plane can be solved in an on-line manner. The novel approach is an elaborate analytical model with clear physical meaning but small computation load, and therefore is potential to be implemented in the mobile devices to assist in real-time aggressive driving identification and labeling. The developed approach is applied to a real case on the curved and sloped route in Nanjing, China. Empirical results of extensive experiments, based on the kinematic parameters collected from the in-vehicle data recorder under naturalistic driving conditions, demonstrate that aggressive driving behaviors are mostly found on the pavements with curve and slope, and can be identified by the developed approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal switching policy between driving entities in semi-autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.011,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"In the future, autonomous vehicles are expected to safely move people and cargo around. However, as of now, automated entities do not necessarily outperform human drivers under all circumstances, particularly under certain road and environmental factors such as bright light, heavy rain, poor quality of road and traffic signs, etc. Therefore, in certain conditions it is safer for the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. However, switching control back and forth between the human driver and the automated driving entity may itself pose a short-term, elevated risk, particularly because of the out of the loop (OOTL) issue for humans. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework to determine the optimal driving-entity switching policy between the automated driving entity and the human driver. Specifically, we develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model to prescribe the entity in charge to minimize the expected safety cost of a trip, considering the dynamic changes of the road/environment during the trip. In addition, we develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to accommodate the fact that the risk posed by the immediate road/environment may only be partially observed. We conduct extensive numerical experiments and thorough sensitivity and robustness analyses, where we also compare the expected safety cost of trips under the optimal and single driving entity policies. In addition, we quantify the risks associated with the policies, as well as the impact of miss-estimating road/environment condition risk level by the driving entities, and provide insights.

Since spatial price differentiation raises the issue of privacy infringement, two hybrid pricing schemes are proposed to internalize travelers’ privacy cost. Under these schemes, a traveler is given the options to maintain her anonymity and pay a “regular” toll, or compromise her privacy and receive a discount. One of the hybrid schemes allows the traveler’s privacy cost to be dependent on the link composition of the traveler’s path. In other words, she can choose to disclose none, part, or all of her path information. We prove that the minimum toll burden—with or without the privacy cost—required to decentralize a system optimum gradually decreases as the toll becomes more spatially differentiated.

In addition, two side constraints are introduced to deal with inter-robot constraints to reflect the complex interactions among terminal agents accurately. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method is adopted in this study as a market-driven approach to dualize the hard side constraints; therefore, the original problem is decomposed into a set of crane-specific and vehicle-specific subtasks. The cost-effective solutions can be obtained by iteratively adjusting both the primal and dual costs of each subtask. We also compare the computational performance of the proposed solution framework with that of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) model using commercial solvers. Comparison results indicate that our proposed approach could efficiently find solutions within 2% optimality gaps.

Participants selectively received information allowing them to know the nature of each exit. The conditions under which nobody/everybody knew a priori the configuration of the room were tested alongside the condition where only wheelchair users had access to this information. The results show that evacuation time was greatly reduced when the three wheelchair users (out of 52 participants) were informed of exit location and nature. A further but more limited improvement was seen when all participants received the same information. A more detailed analysis indicates that the smooth motion of wheelchair users has benefits in relation to the surrounding crowd dynamics, highlighting the importance of improving accessibility for disabled people and making available to them information on exit route characteristics. The same results were obtained using the simulation model developed to account for the presence of wheelchair users and employed to investigate more detailed scenarios. More generally, this study suggests that information provision to specific groups of pedestrians could be more efficient and achieve similar results in comparison with trying to reach the largest possible number of pedestrians.

A two-dimensional car-following model for two-dimensional traffic flow problems,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.025,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"This paper proposes a two-dimensional car-following model to tackle traffic flow problems where considering continuum lateral distances enables a simpler or more natural mathematical formulation compared to traditional car-following models. These problems include (i) the effects of lateral friction often observed in HOV lanes and diverge bottlenecks, (ii) the relaxation phenomenon at merge bottlenecks, (iii) the occurrence of accidents due to lane changing, and (iv) traffic models for autonomous vehicles (AVs). We conjecture that traditional car-following models, where the lateral dimension is discretized into lanes, struggle with these problems and one has to resort to ad-hoc rules conceived to directly achieve the desired effect, and that are difficult to validate. We argue that the distance maintained by drivers in order to avoid collisions in all directions plays a fundamental role in all these problems. To test this hypothesis, we propose a simple two-dimensional microscopic car-following model based on the social force paradigm, and build simulation experiments that reproduce these phenomena. These phenomena are reproduced as an indirect consequence of the model’s formulation, as opposed to ad-hoc rules, thus shedding light on their causes. A better understanding of the behavior of human drivers in the lateral dimension can be translated to improving autonomous driving algorithms so that they are human-friendly. In addition, since AV technology is proprietary, we argue that the proposed model should provide a good starting point for building AV traffic flow models when real data becomes available, as these data come from sensors that cover two-dimensional regions.",0968-090X,Not found

Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. In the present study, we devised a novel graph-based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads, unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road. A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution. The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture. The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states. The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model, and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation.",0968-090X,Not found
From compound word to metropolitan station: Semantic similarity analysis using smart card data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.017,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Rapid urbanization and modern civilization require sound integration with public transportation systems. In the same time, the volume and complexity of public transportation network are increasing, making it harder to understand the public transportation dynamics. As a first step, understanding the similarity among subway stations is imperative. In this paper, we proposed a semantic framework inspired from natural language processing (NLP) to interpret subway stations as compound words. Specifically, we transplanted context and literal meaning of compound words into mobility and location attributes of stations. Using smart card data, we trained stacked autoencoders (SAE) with designed flow matrices as an embedding method to learn the mobility attributes. Subsequently, to discover the location attributes, we have applied affinity propagation clustering to classify 9 point of interest (POI) categories. Combined with urban planning knowledge, we manage to comprehend the land use meanings of 9 POI clusters. The location semantics is chosen from those categories reflecting its urban land use pattern. By choose meaningful combination of mobility and location semantics for stations’ similarity case studies, we summarized potential applications of this semantic framework.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic feedback control of day-to-day traffic disequilibrium process,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.005,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"In the literature, networks are usually assumed to operate at their steady states in static traffic assignment models. Given a set of demand management and supply regulation strategies, whether the vehicular traffic on a network would approach or not to a steady state under certain assumptions of behavioral realism is of importance and great interest in practice. Moreover, one primary reason for understanding the long-term traffic evolution dynamics is to control or influence the system trajectory in an efficient manner. To address these problems, we focus on a dynamic feedback control design and its subsequent steady-state analysis for a class of day-to-day (DTD) disequilibrium process so that the network traffic would evolve towards the desired stable traffic equilibrium. We propose an interconnected dynamic system framework for the stability and convergence analysis of DTD traffic adjustment process under the dynamic feedback control. Distinguished from the existing studies, we introduce a notion of output stability as well as the Lyapunov-like conditions to carry out the investigation noting that the steady states of the dynamic tolls that correspond to the Lagrange multipliers of the traffic equilibrium problem can be non-unique. The proposed method gives rise to a new approach to selecting pricing strategy. The proposed method involves only two adjustment parameters with well-identified physical meanings while the requirement on adjustment parameters for convergence and stability is mild. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the insightful findings. It is found that, with dynamic feedback control, the network traffic state can converge to the desired equilibrium in a much faster manner than the case without control. The dynamic feedback controller can be implemented as demand management and supply regulation strategies such as road pricing and signal control.",0968-090X,Not found
Urban arterial traffic status detection using cellular data without cellphone GPS information,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.006,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Traffic status detection on arterial roads is challenging because of the complexity of urban traffic and the limited coverage and high deployment cost of traffic detectors. Ubiquitous mobile phones and data generated from the events of these mobile devices provide a promising approach for traffic status detection. This paper proposes a novel approach solely using cellular event data without the cellphone GPS information to detect traffic status on arterial roads. Different from the conventional methods, the proposed approach uses features derived only from cellular data to estimate traffic status, not requiring any cellphone location information. Both handoff (HO) and location update (LU) events generated at each cellular station were extracted from the original data to form a candidate feature set. A feature selection method based on joint mutual information (JMI) was used to select features to cover the maximum information, which can resolve issues such as loss of useful information caused by conventional feature selection techniques. A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was then employed to model the relationship between the selected features and traffic status (low, medium, and high-traffic). Finally, the proposed method was validated by both a field experiment in Taicang, China with 1-hour-time-interval samples and a simulation experiment on VISSIM with 5-minute-time-interval samples. This study provides a new perspective for traffic status detection which may help design strategies for traffic management and route navigation to improve traveling efficiency, especially for the cities lack of traffic surveillance devices.",0968-090X,Not found
Field experiments on longitudinal characteristics of human driver behavior following an autonomous vehicle,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.018,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Although mixed traffic, including both autonomous vehicles (AV) and human-driven vehicles (HV), is expected to prevail in the foreseeable future, our current understanding of the longitudinal characteristics of mixed traffic is limited and, in particular, lacks evidence from field experiments. To bridge this gap, we designed and conducted a set of field experiments to reveal differences in car-following behaviors between a human driver following-AV and following-HV on both constant speed traffic characteristics with discrete speeds ({10,20,…,60}km/h) and dynamic car-following behaviors with continuous speeds (within 0–60 km/h) in both the indifferentiable and differentiable appearance settings of the AV. We recruited 10 drivers for the experiment (14 runs for each driver and collected position and speed data of the tested vehicles along their complete trajectories based on vehicle gaps, headways, and standard deviations of vehicle speed. A K-means clustering algorithm was applied to classify drivers based on their responses in following-AV vs. following-HV with both constant speed and dynamic speed characteristics. The analyses of the differentiable appearance setting show that different drivers exhibit different behaviors in following-AV vs. following-HV: some are AV-believers, some are AV-skeptics, and the others are insensitive. Yet in the indifferentiable appearance setting, there is no significant difference between following a lead AV and following a lead HV. This reveals that drivers’ response to the lead vehicle depends on their subjective trusts on AV technologies rather than the actual driving behavior. The results suggest that, depending on the characteristics and composition of the drivers, classic car-following behavior in pure HV traffic may need to be updated for modeling mixed traffic in the near future.",0968-090X,Not found

To obtain an effective BN structure, we first analyze the dependencies of the involved factors on each station and among adjacent stations, given domain knowledge and expertise about operational characteristics. We then put forward four candidate BN structures, integrating expert knowledge, the interdependencies learned from real-world data, and real-time prediction and operational requirements. Next, we train the candidate structures based on a 5-fold cross-validation method, using the operational data from Wuhan-Guangzhou (W-G) and Xiamen-Shenzhen (X-S) high-speed railway (HSR) lines in China. The best performing structure is nominated to predict the consequences of disruptions and disturbances in the two HSR lines. Comparisons results show that the proposed model outperforms three other commonly used predictive models, reaching an average prediction accuracy of 96.6%, 74.8%, and 91.0% on the W-G HSR line, and 94.8%, 91.1%, and 87.9% on the X-S HSR line for variables L, N, and T, respectively.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimating aircraft drag polar using open flight surveillance data and a stochastic total energy model,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.026,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"In air traffic management research, aircraft performance models are often used to generate and analyze aircraft trajectories. Although a crucial part of the aircraft performance model, the aerodynamic property of aircraft is rarely available for public research purposes, as it is protected by aircraft manufacturers for commercial reasons. In many studies, a simplified quadratic drag polar model is assumed to compute the drag of an aircraft based on the required lift. In this paper, using surveillance data, we take on the challenge of estimating the drag polar coefficients based on a novel stochastic total energy model that employs Bayesian computing. The method is based on a stochastic hierarchical modeling approach, which is made possible given accurate open aircraft surveillance data and additional analytical models from the literature. Using this proposed method, the drag polar models for 20 of the most common aircraft types are estimated and summarized. By combining additional data from the literature, we propose additional methods allowing aircraft total drag to be calculated under other configurations, such as when flaps and landing gears are deployed. We also include additional models allowing the calculation of wave drag caused by compressibility at high Mach number. Though uncertainties exist, it has been found that the estimated drag polars agree with existing models, as well as CFD simulation results.

Harnessing ambient sensing &amp; naturalistic driving systems to understand links between driving volatility and crash propensity in school zones – A generalized hierarchical mixed logit framework,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.028,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"With the advent of seemingly unstructured big data, and through seamless integration of computation and physical components, cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide an innovative way to enhance safety and resiliency of transport infrastructure. This study focuses on real-world microscopic driving behavior and its relevance to school zone safety – expanding the capability, usability, and safety of dynamic physical systems through data analytics. Driving behavior and school zone safety is a public health concern. The sequence of instantaneous driving decisions and its variations prior to involvement in safety critical events, defined as driving volatility, can be a leading indicator of safety. By harnessing unique naturalistic data on more than 41,000 normal, crash, and near-crash events featuring over 9.4 million temporal samples of real-world driving, a characterization of volatility in microscopic driving decisions is sought at school and non-school zone locations. A big data analytic methodology is proposed for quantifying driving volatility in microscopic real-world driving decisions. Eight different volatility measures are then linked with detailed event-specific characteristics, health history, driving history/experience, and other factors to examine crash propensity at school zones. A comprehensive yet fully flexible state-of-the-art generalized mixed logit framework is employed to fully account for distinct yet related methodological issues of scale and random heterogeneity, containing multinomial logit, random parameter logit, scaled logit, hierarchical scaled logit, and hierarchical generalized mixed logit as special cases. The results reveal that both for school and non-school locations, drivers exhibited greater intentional volatility prior to safety-critical events. Volatility in positive and negative vehicular jerk in longitudinal and lateral directions associates with increases the probability of unsafe outcomes (crashes or near-crashes) at school zones. A one-unit increase in intentional volatility measured by positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction associates with a 0.0528 increase in the probability of crash outcome. Importantly, the effect of negative vehicular jerk (braking) in longitudinal direction on the likelihood of crash outcome is almost double. Methodologically, Hierarchical Generalized Mixed Logit model resulted in best-fit, simultaneously accounting for scale and random heterogeneity. When accounted for separately, more parsimonious models accounting for scale heterogeneity performed comparably to the less parsimonious counterparts accounting for random heterogeneity. Importantly, even after accounting for random heterogeneity, substantial heterogeneity due to a “pure scale-effect” is still observed, underscoring the importance of scale effects in influencing the overall contours of variations in the modeled relationships. The study demonstrates the value of observational study design and big data analytics for understanding extreme driving behaviors in safe vs. unsafe driving outcomes. Implications for designing personalized school zone behavioral countermeasures are discussed.",0968-090X,Not found

Existing literature tends to focus more on the prediction of demand for traffic, classical public transport, and urban On-Demand Transport service such as taxi, Uber or Lyft, in areas with higher and less variable demand, in which popular time-series prediction methods can be employed. This paper proposes an ensemble learning framework to predict the customer booking behaviour and demand using the observed data of a suburban On-Demand Transport service where data scarcity is a challenge.

Airspace reconfiguration involves, on the other side, adjusting the opening schemes of predefined configurations, or creating new ones (if needed) through dynamic sectorisation. Results suggest that, using the proposed approach, the required system delay can be reduced remarkably, whereas the number of opened sectors (and thus operating cost) and the total capacity provision (supplied by the Air Navigation Service Providers) decrease at the same time, due to the increased capacity utilisation per operating sector.",0968-090X,Not found

However, there remains limited understanding of the causes of journey time variance and how journey time performance can be improved. In this paper, we present a semiparametric regression modelling framework to determine the underlying drivers of journey time variance in urban metro systems, using the London Underground as a case study. We merge train location and passenger trip data to decompose total journey times into three constituent parts: access times as passengers enter the system, on-train times, and egress times as passengers exit at their destinations. For each journey time component, we estimate non-linear functional relationships which we then use to derive elasticity estimates of journey times with respect to service supply and demand factors, including operational and physical characteristics of metros as well as passenger demand and passenger-specific travel characteristics. We find that the static fixed physical characteristics of stations and routes have the greatest influence on journey time, followed by train speeds, and headways, for which the average elasticities of total journey time are −0.54 and 0.05, respectively. The results of our analysis could inform operators about where potential interventions should be targeted in order to improve journey time performance.",0968-090X,Not found

After examining the convexity of the model, we propose an efficient outer-approximation method to obtain the ε-optimal solution to the model. The model is then extended to incorporate the charging impedance, e.g., the charging time and cost.

Battery-electric transit vehicle scheduling with optimal number of stationary chargers,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.009,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Because of zero emissions and other social and economic benefits, electric vehicles (EVs) are currently being introduced in more and more transit agencies around the world. One of the most challenging tasks involves efficiently scheduling a set of EVs considering the limited driving range and charging requirement constraints. This study examines the battery-electric transit vehicle scheduling problem (BET-VSP) with stationary battery chargers installed at transit terminal stations. Two equivalent versions of mathematical formulations of the problem are provided. The first formulation is based on the deficit function theory, and the second formulation is an equivalent bi-objective integer programming model. The first objective of the math-programming optimization is to minimize the total number of EVs required, while the second objective is to minimize the total number of battery chargers required. To solve this bi-objective BET-VSP, two solution methods are developed. First, a lexicographic method-based two-stage construction-and-optimization solution procedure is proposed. Second, an adjusted max-flow solution method is developed. Three numerical examples are used as an expository device to illustrate the solution methods, together with a real-life case study in Singapore.

All for one: Centralized optimization of truck platoons to improve roadway infrastructure sustainability,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.002,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"With the introduction of connected and autonomous trucks (CATs), truck platooning is expected to be more feasible and prevalent. The reported benefits of the truck platooning include regularizing traffic, reducing congestion, increasing highway safety, and decreasing fuel consumption and emission. Truck platooning may, however, decrease pavement longevity because it would cause channelized load application and hinder the healing properties of asphalt concrete. This study proposes a centralized control strategy that converts the pavement-related challenges of truck platooning into opportunities. This strategy leverages the auto-pilot technologies in CATs by optimizing the lateral position of each platoon or group of platoons.

Results showed that pavement life-cycle costs could be reduced up to 50% by controlling the lateral position of the platoons for each day.",0968-090X,Not found
On the requirements on spatial accuracy and sampling rate for transport mode detection in view of a shift to passive signalling data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.021,114,2020-05-01,2020,5,"GPS based campaigns have been hailed as an alternative to transportation surveys that promise relatively high accuracy at a relatively low burden on the participants and fewer forgotten trips. However they still necessitate the recruitment of participants and are thus potentially biased and certainly not encompassing significant parts of the population. Given the high penetration of mobile phones, passive tracking by telephone providers would alleviate those two shortcomings at the cost of reduced sampling frequency and positional accuracy. The trade-off in quality has not yet been quantified and therefore recommendations on sensible thresholds are not yet available. In this study therefore, instead of presenting yet another method for mode of transport classification, we therefore compare the performance of existing mode detection schemes under deteriorating sampling rates and positional accuracies. As a possibility to compensate for the deteriorating signal we also calculate features from users’ positional histories that could be beneficial if their behaviour is repetitive. The evaluation is not only based on pointwise accuracy, but includes quality measures that pertain to trips as a whole. We find that the necessary accuracy and sampling rate for applications will depend on whether the information of whole trajectories can be used, or whether only the current information is available. The former being relevant to ex-post analyses while the latter situation appears more frequently in near-time analyses. For segmentwise classification, there is no major impact on the quality of the classification by the tested levels of spatial accuracies as long as the sampling intervals can be kept at or below a minute, whereas for point based classification the sampling interval should be between 30 s and a minute and increasing spatial accuracy always improves the classification.",0968-090X,Not found

Two SRDT choice models are proposed to incorporate imperfect travel information: One based on multinomial Logit (MNL) model and the other on sequential, mixed multinomial/nested Logit model. These two variants, serving as base models, are further extended with two features: bounded rationality (BR) and information sharing. BR is considered by incorporating the indifference band into the random utility component of the MNL model, forming a BR-based DTD stochastic model. A macroscopic model of travel information sharing is integrated into the DTD dynamics to account for the impact of incomplete information on travelers’ SRDT choices.

Based on these models, realistic scenarios are built, for which potential conflicts are detected using an efficient GPU-based algorithm. The resulting instances of the conflict resolution problem are provided to the community as a public benchmark. To efficiently solve this problem, we also introduce a generic framework for the cooperation of optimization algorithms. The framework benefits from the various optimization algorithms plugged to it by sharing relevant information among them, and is implemented as a distributed application for better performance. We illustrate its behavior on the conflict resolution problem with the cooperation between a Memetic Algorithm and an Integer Linear Program which consistently outperforms previous approaches by orders of magnitude. Instances with up to 60 aircraft are optimally solved within a few minutes using this framework, while each algorithm taken individually only provides sub-optimal solutions.

Several automated sensor solutions are commercially available that have been evaluated in the literature including traditional point-based sensors, such as inductive loop detectors for bicycles and infrared sensors for pedestrians. More recently, image-based systems, based on video cameras or thermal video cameras, have been developed. Despite the various options, some key limitations of existing solutions exist, in particular, the lack of low-cost solutions using embedded systems capable of performing in real-time under high volume (flow) conditions. This work aims at developing and evaluating the performance of a novel, real-time counting system, developed for environments with high pedestrian flows. The proposed system is based on emerging LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology. As an input, the system uses the distance measurements from a two-dimensional LiDAR sensor with a set of distinct laser channels and a given angular resolution between each channel. The developed system processes those measurements using a clustering algorithm to detect, count, and identify the direction of travel of each pedestrian. The system’s performance is evaluated by comparing its directional counting outputs with manual counts (ground truth) using disaggregate and aggregate (15-minutes interval) counts at two different monitoring locations. The results demonstrate that the system accurately counts more than 97% of the pedestrians at the disaggregate level, with a false direction detection rate of 1.1%. The over-counting error is 0.7% and the under-counting errors are 1.3% and 2.7% for the two selected sites.

Two main analytical approximation methods to derive the MFD for arterial roads and urban networks exist at the moment. These are the method of cuts (MoC) and related approaches, as well as the stochastic approximation (SA). This paper systematically evaluates these methods including their most recent advancements for the case of an urban arterial MFD. Both approaches are evaluated based on a traffic data set for a segment of an arterial in the city of Munich, Germany. This data set includes loop detector and signal data for a typical working day. It is found that the deterministic MoC finds a more accurate upper bound for the MFD for the studied case. The estimation error of the stochastic method is about three times higher than the one of the deterministic method. However, the SA outperforms the MoC in approximating the free-flow branch of the MFD. The analysis of the discrepancies between the empirical and the analytical MFDs includes an investigation of the measurement bias and an in-depth sensitivity study of signal control and public transport operation related input parameters. This study is conducted as a Monte-Carlo-Simulation based on a Latin Hypercube sampling.

Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data.

In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices.

Power optimized battery swap and recharge strategies for electric aircraft operations,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.027,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Electric propulsion for commuter air transportation is a promising technology because of significant strides in battery specific energy and motor specific power. Energy storage and rapid battery recharge remain nonetheless challenging owing to the significant energy and power requirements of even small aircraft. By modifying algorithms developed in the field of scheduling theory, we propose power optimized and power-investment optimized strategies for electric aircraft battery swaps and recharges. Several aspects are considered: electric energy expenditures, capital expenditures, and flight schedule integrity. The first strategy optimizes the swaps and recharges to minimize the peak-power draw from the grid and reduce electric energy expenditures. The second strategy optimizes the swaps and recharges to minimize electricity expenditures and capital expenditures associated with battery and charger procurement. In both cases, the optimization is decomposed into two steps. The first step determines the combinations of numbers of chargers and batteries that yield a feasible recharge schedule. It is based on a network flow representation of the battery swap and recharge. The second step builds a recharge schedule for the previously determined numbers of chargers and batteries. Together, they enable the estimation of peak power demand, electric expenditures, and capital expenditures used to implement the power optimized and power-investment optimized strategies.

An ensemble deep learning approach for driver lane change intention inference,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102615,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles, drivers are increasingly likely to share their control authorities with the intelligent control unit. For building an efficient Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and shared-control systems, the vehicle needs to understand the drivers’ intent and their activities to generate assistant and collaborative control strategies. In this study, a driver intention inference system that focuses on the highway lane change maneuvers is proposed. First, a high-level driver intention mechanism and framework are introduced. Then, a vision-based intention inference system is proposed, which captures the multi-modal signals based on multiple low-cost cameras and the VBOX vehicle data acquisition system. A novel ensemble bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units is proposed to deal with the time-series driving sequence and the temporal behavioral patterns. Naturalistic highway driving data that consists of lane-keeping, left and right lane change maneuvers are collected and used for model construction and evaluation. Furthermore, the driver's pre-maneuver activities are statistically analyzed. It is found that for situation-aware, drivers usually check the mirrors for more than six seconds before they initiate the lane change maneuver, and the time interval between steering the handwheel and crossing the lane is about 2 s on average. Finally, hypothesis testing is conducted to show the significant improvement of the proposed algorithm over existing ones. With five-fold cross-validation, the EBiLSTM model achieves an average accuracy of 96.1% for the intention that is inferred 0.5 s before the maneuver starts.",0968-090X,Not found
A residual spatio-temporal architecture for travel demand forecasting,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102639,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"This paper proposes a deep architecture called residual spatio-temporal network (RSTN) for short-term travel demand forecasting. It comprises fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) and a hybrid module consisting of an extended Conv-LSTM (CE-LSTM) that can achieve trade-off of convolutional operation and LSTM cells by tuning the hyperparameters of Conv-LSTM, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and traditional LSTM. These modules are combined via residual connections to capture the spatial, temporal and extraneous dependencies of travel demand. The end-to-end trainable RSTN redefines the traditional prediction problem as a learning residual function with regard to the travel density in each time interval. Further more, a dynamic request vector (DRV)-based data representation scheme is presented, which catches the intrinsic characteristics and variation of the trend, to improve the performance of forecasting. Simulations with two real-word data sets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing forecasting algorithms, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by up to 17.87%.",0968-090X,Not found
Applying Markov decision process to understand driving decisions using basic safety messages data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102642,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"While a number of studies have investigated driving behaviors, detailed microscopic driving data has only recently become available for analysis. Through Basic Safety Message (BSM) data from the Michigan Safety Pilot Program, this study applies a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to understand driving behavior in terms of acceleration, deceleration and maintaining speed decisions. Personally Revealed Choices (PRC) that maximize the expected sum of rewards for individual drivers are obtained by analyzing detailed data from 120 trips and the application of MDP. Specifically, this paper defines states based on the number of objects around the host vehicle and the distance to the front object. Given the states, individual drivers’ reward functions are estimated using the multinomial logit model and used in the MDP framework. Optimal policies (i.e. PRC) are obtained through a value iteration algorithm. The results show that as the number of objects increases around a host vehicle, the driver prefer to accelerate in order to escape the crowdedness around them. In addition, when trips are segmented based on the level of crowdedness, increased levels of trip crowdedness results in a fewer number of drivers accelerating because the traffic conditions constrain them to maintaining constant speed or deceleration. One potential application of this study is to generate short-term predictive driver decision information through historical driving performance, which can be used to warn a host vehicle driver when the person substantially deviates from their own historical PRC. This information could also be disseminated to surrounding vehicles as well, enabling them to foresee the states and actions of other drivers and potentially avoid collisions.",0968-090X,Not found

This creates the need for novel data sources, tools, and methods that allow us to identify and prioritize locations where to intervene via properly planned cycling infrastructure. Here, we define potential demand as the total trips of the population that could be supported by bicycle paths. To that end, we use information from a phone-based travel demand and the trip distance distribution from bike apps. Next, we use percolation theory to prioritize paths with high potential demand that benefit overall connectivity if a bike path would be added.

"Mobility-on-demand: An empirical study of internet-based ride-hailing adoption factors, travel characteristics and mode substitution effects",10.1016/j.trc.2020.102638,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Ride-hailing services are shaping travel behaviours and emergent urban mobility patterns. From their initial diffusion centres in North America and Europe, these on-demand mobility services are increasingly becoming available in developing countries. Yet, empirical research from these contexts on the impact of ride-hailing services is lacking. To address this gap, this paper examines the factors driving the adoption of ride-hailing and the associated travel characteristics and mode substitution effects in Ghana, Sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from a large sample survey (N = 1188) of commuters in a multi-variable structural equation model, the paper shows that socio-demographic factors, perceived benefits and ease of use of ride-hailing, perceived safety risks and car-dependent lifestyles influence adoption and use of ride-hailing services. Similar to other contexts, individuals’ reference ride-hailing trips were mainly for ‘special occasion’ purposes (51%), but work and school journeys were also high (41%). Shorter travel times (≤30 min) and single passenger journeys within inner-suburban and outer-suburban localities typify ride-hailing trips. This contrasts with other contexts where ride-hailing is used frequently by urban dwellers and less so by those in the suburbs. Ride-hailing use replaced conventional taxis (51%), public transport (36%), private car (10%) and walking (1%), suggesting mode substitution effects for individuals’ reference trips. Further exploration of a full day’s travel mode choices also revealed that individuals use other available modes of transport in addition to ride-hailing services. However, multi-modal integration is weak, suggesting that ride-hailing tends to be used alone for full door-to-door journeys, instead of complementing other existing modes in serving first/last mile access for example. The implications of the findings for sustainable mobility are discussed.",0968-090X,Not found
Data driven model free adaptive iterative learning perimeter control for large-scale urban road networks,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102618,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Most perimeter control methods in literature are the model-based schemes designing the controller based on the available accurate macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) function with well known techniques of modern control methods. However, accurate modeling of the traffic flow system is hard and time-consuming. On the other hand, macroscopic traffic flow patterns show heavily similarity between days, and data from past days might enable improving the performance of the perimeter controller. Motivated by this observation, a model free adaptive iterative learning perimeter control (MFAILPC) scheme is proposed in this paper. The three features of this method are: (1) No dynamical model is required in the controller design by virtue of dynamic linearization data modeling technique, i.e., it is a data-driven method, (2) the perimeter controller performance will improve iteratively with the help of the repetitive operation pattern of the traffic system, (3) the learning gain is tuned adaptively along the iterative axis. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested comparing with various control methods for a multi-region traffic network considering modeling errors, measurement noise, demand variations, and time-changing MFDs. Simulation results show that the proposed MFAILPC presents a great potential and is more resilient against errors than the standard perimeter control methods such as model predictive control, proportional-integral control, etc.",0968-090X,Not found
A differential privacy-based privacy-preserving data publishing algorithm for transit smart card data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102634,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"This manuscript is focused on transit smart card data and finds that the release of such trajectory information after simple anonymization creates high concern about breaching privacy.

This paper describes the investigation of the publication of non-interactive sanitized trajectory data under a Differential Privacy (DP) definition. To this end, a new prefix tree structure, an incremental privacy budget allocation model, and a spatial-temporal dimensionality reduction model are proposed to enhance the sanitized data utility as well as to improve runtime efficiency. The developed algorithm is implemented and applied to real-life metro smart card data from Shenzhen, China, which includes a total of 2.8 million individual travelers and over 220 million records.

Value of time and reliability for urban pooled on-demand services,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102621,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"The uptake of on-demand services is increasing rapidly all over the world. However, the market share of their pooled version (ridesharing, e.g., UberPOOL or LyftLine) is still low, despite its potential in addressing the mobility challenges that dense urban cities are facing. In this research, we analyse user preferences towards pooled on-demand services regarding their time-reliability-cost trade-offs. We study, via stated preference experiments, the value of time (VOT) and value of reliability (VOR) of the different trip stages (waiting stage, in-vehicle stage, and transfer stage when combined with line-based public transport). We target urban Dutch individuals (N = 1006), and address commuting and leisure trips. Results show in-vehicle VOT for pooled on-demand services to amount to 7.88–10.80 €/h. These values are somewhat higher than known values of traditional public transport. We also find waiting VOT (both before the trip and during the transfer stage) to be lower than values previously reported in literature. In general, we find VOR to be lower than VOT: the reliability ratio (VOR/VOT ratio) for both the waiting stage and the in-vehicle stage being around 0.5. In order to understand different preferences, we also estimate latent class choice models. The analysis shows that the main difference between classes pertains to the overall time-cost and reliability-cost trade-offs (VOT and VOR values) rather than in different valuations of the reliability ratio. In addition to serving as input for demand forecasting models such as macroscopic static assignment and agent-based simulation models, our findings can support service providers in developing their strategy when designing pooled on-demand services.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated route choice and assignment model for fixed and flexible public transport systems,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102631,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"The recent technological innovations in various ICT platforms have given rise to innovative mobility solutions. Such systems could potentially address some of the inherent shortcomings of a line/schedule based public transport system. Previous studies either assumed that flexible on-demand services are used as an exclusive door-to-door service or offered as a feeder connection to high-capacity public transport services. However, users may combine line/schedule based public transport systems (Fixed PT) and on-demand services (Flexible PT) so that their travel impedance is minimized. To this end, we propose a multimodal route choice and assignment model that allows users combining Fixed and Flexible PT or use them as individual modes while demand for these services is endogenously determined. The model takes into account the dynamic demand–supply interaction using an iterative learning framework. Flexible public transport can be used to perform any part of the trip, ranging from a first/last mile service to an exclusive direct door-to-door connection. The developed model is implemented in an agent based simulation framework. The model is applied to a network centered around the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Scenarios where Fixed PT and Flexible PT are offered as mutually exclusive modes or can be combined into a single journey, are analysed. Results indicate that Flexible PT is predominantly used for covering < 30% of the trip length, indicating that it is mainly used as an access or egress mode to Fixed PT. This results with an overall increase in the share of public transport trips. Also, the average waiting time of Flexible PT users when used in combination with Fixed PT are lower than the scenario where each of them is used as an exclusive mode.",0968-090X,Not found
Dispatch of autonomous vehicles for taxi services: A deep reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102626,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"In this paper, we define and investigate a novel model-free deep reinforcement learning framework to solve the taxi dispatch problem. The framework can be used to redistribute vehicles when the travel demand and taxi supply is either spatially or temporally imbalanced in a transportation network. While previous works mostly focus on using model-based methods, the goal of this paper is to explore the policy-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm as a model-free method to optimize the rebalancing strategy. In particular, we propose an actor-critic algorithm with feed-forward neural networks as approximations of both policy and value functions, where the policy function provides the optimal dispatch strategy and the value function estimates the expected costs at each time stamp. Our numerical studies show that the algorithm converges to the theoretical upper bound with less than 4% optimality gap, whether the system dynamics are deterministic or stochastic. We also investigate the scenario where we consider user priority and fairness, and the results indicate that our learned policy is capable of producing a superior strategy that balances equity, cancellation, and level of service when user priority is considered.",0968-090X,Not found
Learning traffic as a graph: A gated graph wavelet recurrent neural network for network-scale traffic prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102620,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Network-wide traffic forecasting is a critical component of modern intelligent transportation systems for urban traffic management and control. With the rise of artificial intelligence, many recent studies attempted to use deep neural networks to extract comprehensive features from traffic networks to enhance prediction performance, given the volume and variety of traffic data has been greatly increased. Considering that traffic status on a road segment is highly influenced by the upstream/downstream segments and nearby bottlenecks in the traffic network, extracting well-localized features from these neighboring segments is essential for a traffic prediction model. Although the convolution neural network or graph convolution neural network has been adopted to learn localized features from the complex geometric or topological structure of traffic networks, the lack of flexibility in the local-feature extraction process is still a big issue. Classical wavelet transform can detect sudden changes and peaks in temporal signals. Analogously, when extending to the graph/spectral domain, graph wavelet can concentrate more on key vertices in the graph and discriminatively extract localized features. In this study, to capture the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in network-wide traffic data, we learn the traffic network as a graph and propose a graph wavelet gated recurrent (GWGR) neural network. The graph wavelet is incorporated as a key component for extracting spatial features in the proposed model. A gated recurrent structure is employed to learn temporal dependencies in the sequence data. Comparing to baseline models, the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance and training efficiency on two real-world datasets. In addition, experiments show that the sparsity of graph wavelet weight matrices greatly increases the interpretability of GWGR.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling and analyzing cyberattack effects on connected automated vehicular platoons,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102625,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Vehicular platooning requires an open-access environment of vehicle communications to enable cooperating connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to share their travel information. However, the open-access environment makes the cooperating platoon CAVs vulnerable to cyberattacks, causing concerns on traffic safety and mobility. So far, due to the lack of analytical models integrating malicious effects of manipulated information into CAV dynamics, we have limited knowledge on CAV platoon performance under cyberattack. It necessities a modeling framework to support a comprehensive analysis of the CAV platoon performance in a capricious travel environment. This study seeks to bridge this critical gap from the following three aspects. First, we review potential safety-related cyberattacks faced by CAVs, related to manipulation of vehicle position, speed, and acceleration. Based on the review, these cyberattacks are categorized into three types: bogus messages, replay/delay, and collusion attack. Second, we develop a generalized vehicle dynamics model that accounts for the cyberattack effects on CAV dynamics. The proposed model, labeled cooperative intelligent driver model (CIDM), integrates the dynamic communication topological structure to enable the analysis of effects of manipulated information on CAV dynamics. The dynamic communication structure is a time-varying function which is determined by the communication range and the distance between two vehicles. Upon the proposed CIDM, the third aspect focuses on simulation analysis of CAV platoon safety and efficiency under cyberattacks, which demonstrate the cyberattack effects at the platoon level. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding of CAV platoon dynamics under cyberattacks and lays a foundation to enhance the cybersecurity of CAV systems.",0968-090X,Not found
Right-of-way reallocation for mixed flow of autonomous vehicles and human driven vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102630,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are bringing challenges and opportunities to urban traffic systems. One of the crucial challenges for traffic managers and local authorities is to understand the nonlinear change in road capacity with increasing AV penetration rate, and to efficiently reallocate the Right-of-Way (RoW) for the mixed flow of AVs and Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs). Most of the existing research suggests that road capacity will significantly increase at high AV penetration rates or an all-AV scenario, when AVs are able to drive with smaller headways to the leading vehicle. However, this increase in road capacity might not be significant at a lower AV penetration rate due to the heterogeneity between AVs and HDVs. In order to investigate the impacts of mixed flow conditions (AVs and HDVs), this paper firstly proposes a theoretical model to demonstrate that road capacity can be increased with proper RoW reallocation. Secondly, four different RoW reallocation strategies are compared using a SUMO simulation to cross-validate the results in a numerical analysis. A range of scenarios with different AV penetration rates and traffic demands are used. The results show that road capacity on a two-lane road can be significantly improved with appropriate RoW reallocation strategies at low or medium AV penetration rates, compared with the do-nothing RoW strategy.",0968-090X,Not found
Achieving higher taxi outflows from a drop-off lane: A simulation-based study,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102623,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Lanes used by taxis and other shared-ride vehicles at airports and rail terminals are often congested. The present paper examines congestion-mitigating strategies for a special type of lane inside of which taxis are prohibited from overtaking each other while dropping-off patrons. Taxis must therefore often wait in first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues that form in the lane during busy periods. Patrons may be discharged from taxis upon reaching a desired area near the terminal entrance. When wait times grow long, however, some taxis discharge their patrons in advance of that desired area. The Nanjing South Railway Station in China is selected as a case study. Its FIFO drop-off lane is presently managed by police officers who allow taxis to enter the lane in batched fashion. Inefficiencies are observed because curb space near the upstream and downstream ends of the lane often goes unused. A microscopic simulation model is developed in-house, and is painstakingly calibrated to data measured in the study site’s FIFO lane. Simulation experiments indicate that rescinding the lane’s present batching strategy can increase taxi outflow by more than 25%. Further experiments show that even greater gains can be achieved by requiring taxis to discharge patrons when forced by downstream queues to stop a prescribed distance in advance of a desired drop-off area. Further gains were predicted by requiring the lead taxi in each batch to discharge its patron(s) only after travelling a prescribed distance beyond a desired location. The above findings are confirmed for scenarios calibrated with field data collected on two different days, and for hypothetical scenarios with varying input parameters. Roles that technology can play in implementing these new lane-management strategies are discussed. So are their practical implications in light of the present boom in shared-ride services.",0968-090X,Not found
From free-route air traffic to an adapted dynamic main-flow system,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102633,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"At present, en-route flight traffic is carried out on a system of predefined routes with a low number of intersections between aircraft trajectories. This enables the air traffic controllers to control and supervise the traffic, especially around these intersections. Consequently, the route system leads to a low ratio of used to unused airspace, where not necessarily the shortest route is used for each flight. To reduce trajectory length, the idea of free routing has been developed, whereby each aircraft uses the direct connection between origin and destination airport, generating a traffic distribution which uses nearly the entire available airspace. As a consequence, many intersections between flight trajectories occur, making it more difficult for controllers to handle. We use these intersections as the basis of a so-called main-flow system with trajectories consisting of intersection points instead of waypoints. The intersections of all trajectories of a traffic sample are clustered and the resulting cluster centres are used as nodes in a route system. Additional processing is applied to identify a system of main flows and reduce the number of intersections to an acceptable amount. Our approach is able to identify major traffic flows within unstructured great-circle traffic and to create a main-flow system which is a compromise between the flexibility of free routing and the easier surveillance by controllers in the case of a predefined route network. To prove the ability of the proposed method to identify main flows, it was applied to a scenario of planned flights following the standard route structure. Subsequent tests with two different free-routing scenarios led to new route systems where the median adapted trajectory length for flights of the traffic sample is merely 0.9% (respectively 4.1%) higher than the direct connections. Furthermore, structural complexity is lower for intersections (cluster centres) of the new main-flow system compared to those of direct or great-circle scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found

This study fills the research gap through an empirical study in Dalian, China. Three different survival models are developed to investigate the mechanism of subscription behaviors, among which the shared frailty model considering the unobserved heterogeneity is demonstrated to be the most appropriate. The results indicate that the historical purchase characteristics are the most important to CB user loyalty modeling and forecasting. Males are more sensitive than females to the number of intermediate stations because of the potentially increased uncertainty in waiting time related to the intermediate stations.

Passenger comfort and trust on first-time use of a shared autonomous shuttle vehicle,10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.026,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Autonomous Vehicles (AV) may become widely diffused as a road transport technology around the world. However, two conditions of successful adoption of AVs are that they must be synchronously shared, to avoid negative transport network and environmental consequences, and that high levels of public acceptance of the technology must exist. The implications of these two conditions are that travellers must accept sharing rides with unfamiliar others in Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV). Two factors that have been identified as being positive influencers of acceptance are comfort and trust. The present paper undertakes a novel examination as to how comfort and trust ratings are affected by specific attributes of the ride experience of travelling in a fully-automated real-world, shared vehicle. To this end, 55 participants experienced riding in an SAV shuttle under experimental conditions at a test facility. Each experimental run involved two unrelated participants, accompanied by a safety operative and a researcher, undertaking four trips in the SAV, during which two conditions were presented for each of the independent variables of ‘direction of face’ (forwards/backwards) and ‘maximum vehicle speed’ (8/16 km/h). Order of presentation was varied between pairs of participants. After each run, participants rated the dependent variables ‘trust’ and ‘comfort’ (the latter variable comprised by six comfort factors). Expected and evaluative ratings were also obtained during pre-experimental orientation and debriefing sessions. Statistically significant relationships (p < .001) were found between trust and each of the independent variables, but for neither variable in the case of perceived comfort.

State estimation in urban traffic networks: A two-layer approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102616,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Modern traffic control and management systems in urban networks require real-time estimation of the traffic states. In this paper, a novel approach for modeling traffic flow in urban networks that is especially suitable for state estimation is proposed. The complexity of the urban traffic model is reduced by assuming availability of connected vehicle data. We first investigate the observability issue in urban traffic networks using a graphical approach. Then, the proposed model for the evolution of the traffic flow in urban traffic networks is developed and used in two layers, i.e., link layer and network layer, to estimate, in high-resolution (second-by-second), the traffic states in the whole network. Traffic states in the link layer include queue tail location and the number of vehicles in the queue, while in the network layer, estimation of the total number of vehicles per link and turning rates at the intersections is carried out. In a first step, it is shown that the estimation approach only requires the detectors at the borders of the network.

Real time adaptive cruise control strategy for motorways,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102617,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"An ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control)-based traffic control strategy is presented, which improves the motorway traffic flow efficiency by changing in real time the driving behaviour (specifically the employed time-gap and the acceleration strength) of ACC-equipped vehicles in motorway sections according to the corresponding traffic conditions. The control strategy comprises three distinct actions: (i) gradual decrease of ACC time-gaps at near-capacity traffic in order to increase capacity; (ii) minimum time-gaps and (iii) acceleration increase, both at the very vicinity of active bottlenecks in order to increase the discharge flow. The behaviour and impact of the control strategy, and of each of its parts separately, are demonstrated for different ACC penetration rates via microscopic simulation applied to a real motorway stretch. The simulation results show that, even for low penetration rates of ACC-vehicles, the proposed strategy leads to sensible improvements regarding the average vehicle delay and fuel consumption by delaying the onset of congestion (thanks to increased capacity); and by speeding up its dissolution (thanks to the mitigation of capacity drop).",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling the fundamental diagram of mixed human-driven and connected automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102614,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Traffic flow fundamental diagram (FD) is viewed as the basis of traffic flow theory and has various applications in transportation. However, the fundamental diagram of mixed human-driven vehicles (HVs) and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) traffic has not been well-studied. This paper derives the FD for mixed HV and CAV traffic considering the stochastic headway. Firstly, the deterministic FD of pure CAV traffic and pure HV traffic are built. Then the FD of mixed HV and CAV traffic is developed with CAV penetration and platooning intensity taken into consideration. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to model the stochastic headway, based on which the stochastic FD is derived. Impact of CAV penetration and platooning intensity on the stochasticity of FD is studied. Results from theoretical analysis and case study show that increasing CAV penetration can reduce the scattering of FD, while higher platooning intensity may result in more scattering of FD.",0968-090X,Not found
"A variational autoencoder solution for road traffic forecasting systems: Missing data imputation, dimension reduction, model selection and anomaly detection",10.1016/j.trc.2020.102622,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Efforts devoted to mitigate the effects of road traffic congestion have been conducted since 1970s. Nowadays, there is a need for prominent solutions capable of mining information from messy and multidimensional road traffic data sets with few modeling constraints. In that sense, we propose a unique and versatile model to address different major challenges of traffic forecasting in an unsupervised manner. We formulate the road traffic forecasting problem as a latent variable model, assuming that traffic data is not generated randomly but from a latent space with fewer dimensions containing the underlying characteristics of traffic. We solve the problem by proposing a variational autoencoder (VAE) model to learn how traffic data are generated and inferred, while validating it against three different real-world traffic data sets. Under this framework, we propose an online unsupervised imputation method for unobserved traffic data with missing values. Additionally, taking advantage of the low dimension latent space learned, we compress the traffic data before applying a prediction model obtaining improvements in the forecasting accuracy. Finally, given that the model not only learns useful forecasting features but also meaningful characteristics, we explore the latent space as a tool for model and data selection and traffic anomaly detection from the point of view of traffic modelers.",0968-090X,Not found
Influence of CAV clustering strategies on mixed traffic flow characteristics: An analysis of vehicle trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102611,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Being one of the most promising applications enabled by connected and automated vehicles (CAV) technology, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is expected to be deployed in the near term on public roads. Thus far, the majority of the CACC studies have been focusing on the overall network performance with limited insights on the potential impacts of CAVs on human-driven vehicles (HVs). This paper aims to quantify such impacts by studying the high-resolution vehicle trajectory data that are obtained from microscopic simulation. Two platoon clustering strategies for CACC- an ad hoc coordination strategy and a local coordination strategy-are implemented. Results show that the local coordination outperforms the ad hoc coordination across all tested market penetration rates (MPRs) in terms of network throughput and productivity. According to the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, however, the distributions of the hard braking events (as a potential safety impact) for HVs change significantly under local coordination strategy. For both of the clustering strategy, CAVs increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. The break-even point for average lane change frequency between the two strategies is observed at 30% MPR, which decreases from 5.42 to 5.38 per vehicle. The average lane change frequency following a monotonically increasing pattern in response to MPR, and it reaches the highest 5.48 per vehicle at 40% MPR. Lastly, the interaction state of the car-following model for HVs is analyzed. It is revealed that the composition of the interaction state could be influenced by CAVs as well. One of the apparent trends is that the time spent on approaching state declines with the increasing presence of CAVs.",0968-090X,Not found
MPC-based switched driving model for human vehicle co-piloting considering human factors,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102612,115,2020-06-01,2020,6,"In vehicle longitudinal control, improved comfort and reduced operation workload for human drivers are achieved with the ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control), which still requires the driver to maintain full attention on monitoring, meanwhile, the risk of distraction and fatigue rises resulting from the long-term supervising task, which has a strong impact on the successful takeover. The key point to make full use of ACC advantages and make up human’s weakness on supervising task is the reasonable arrangement of control time of ACC and human driver. In this paper, an MPC (Model Predictive Control) based optimized switching strategy of longitudinal driving authority transition is proposed, which aims to provide proper advice for human drivers to handover and takeover control authority, through minimizing the overall index consisted of the operation workload, fuel consumption, takeover risk and tracking errors. In addition, a new driver longitudinal model considering actual reaction time delay and insensitive distance perception of human drivers is proposed as well, which combines with ACC to constitute a typical switched control system called the switched driving model as the predictive model for MPC. The stable condition of the new driver longitudinal model is derived by using describing function method and a sufficient condition to ensure steady switched system is given by using the Lyapunov method and LMI approach. The results of simulator experiments show that the new driver model describes the car-following behavior of real human driver better.

Cooperative merging control via trajectory optimization in mixed vehicular traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102663,116,2020-07-01,2020,7,"A major challenging issue related to the emerging mixed traffic vehicular system, composed of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) together with human-driven vehicles, is the lack of adequate modeling and control framework, especially at traffic bottlenecks such as highway merging areas. A hierarchical control framework for merging areas is first outlined, where we assume that the merging sequence is decided by a higher control level. The focus of this paper is the lower level of the control framework that establishes a set of control algorithms for cooperative CAV trajectory optimization, defined for different merging scenarios in the presence of mixed traffic. To exploit complete cooperation flexibility of the vehicles, we identify six scenarios, consisting of triplets of vehicles, defined based on the different combinations of CAVs and conventional vehicles. For each triplet, different consecutive movement phases along with corresponding desired distance and speed set-points are designed. Through the movement phases, the CAVs engaged in the triplet cooperate to determine their optimal trajectories aiming at facilitating an efficient merging maneuver, while complying with realistic constraints related to safety and comfort of vehicle occupants. Distinct models are considered for each triplet, and a Model Predictive Control scheme is employed to compute the cooperative optimal control inputs, in terms of acceleration of CAVs, accounting also for human-driven vehicles’ uncertainties, such as drivers’ reaction time and desired speed tracing error.

Dynamic holding control to avoid bus bunching: A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102661,116,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Bus bunching has been a long-standing problem that undermines the efficiency and reliability of public transport services. The most popular countermeasure in practice is to introduce static and dynamic holding control. However, most previous holding control strategies mainly consider local information with a pre-specified headway/schedule, while the global coordination of the whole bus fleet and its long-term effect are often overlooked. To efficiently incorporate global coordination and long-term operation in bus holding, in this paper we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) framework to develop dynamic and flexible holding control strategies for a bus route. Specifically, we model each bus as an agent that interacts with not only its leader/follower but also all other vehicles in the fleet. To better explore potential strategies, we develop an effective headway-based reward function in the proposed framework. In the learning framework, we model fleet coordination by using a basic actor-critic scheme along with a joint action tracker to better characterize the complex interactions among agents in policy learning, and we apply proximal policy optimization to improve learning performance. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed MDRL framework against multiple baseline models that only rely on local information. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework and show the promise of applying MDRL in the coordinative control of public transport vehicle fleets in real-world operations.",0968-090X,Not found

The movement of CHVs is incorporated in the optimization framework utilizing a customized linear car-following model. During the white phase, CAVs lead groups of CHVs through an intersection. The proposed formulation determines the optimal signal indication for each lane-group in each time step. We have developed a receding horizon control framework to solve the problem. The case study results indicate that the proposed methodology successfully controls the mixed CAV-CHV traffic under various CAV market penetration rates and different demand levels. The results reveal that a higher CAV market penetration rate induces more frequent white phase indication compared to green-red signals.

A deep convolutional neural network based approach for vehicle classification using large-scale GPS trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102644,116,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Transportation agencies are starting to leverage increasingly-available GPS trajectory data to support their analyses and decision making. While this type of mobility data adds significant value to various analyses, one challenge that persists is lack of information about the types of vehicles that performed the recorded trips, which clearly limits the value of trajectory data in transportation system analysis. To overcome this limitation of trajectory data, a deep Convolutional Neural Network for Vehicle Classification (CNN-VC) is proposed to identify the vehicle’s class from its trajectory. This paper proposes a novel representation of GPS trajectories, which is not only compatible with deep learning models, but also captures both vehicle-motion characteristics and roadway features. To this end, an open source navigation system is also exploited to obtain more accurate information on travel time and distance between GPS coordinates. Before delving into training the CNN-VC model, an efficient programmatic strategy is also designed to label large-scale GPS trajectories by means of vehicle information obtained through Virtual Weigh Station records. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed CNN-VC model consistently outperforms both classical machine learning algorithms and other deep learning baseline methods.

Predicting lane-changing risk level based on vehicles’ space-series features: A pre-emptive learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102646,116,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Vehicles’ risky lane-changing (LC) maneuver has significant impact on road traffic safety. As an innovation compared with the posterior LC risk prediction methods proposed in previous studies, this study develops a pre-emptive LC risk level prediction (P-LRLP) method, which is able to estimate the crash risk level of an LC event in advance before the LC car completes the LC maneuver. The basic concept of this method is to apply a machine learning classifier to predict the LC risk level based on cars’ key space-series features at the beginning of the LC event. To boost the prediction performance, an innovative resampling method, namely ENN-SMOTE-Tomek Link (EST), and an advanced machine learning classifier, namely LightGBM, are proposed and employed in the development of the P-LRLP method. Meanwhile, an algorithm which can measure the stability of the selected key features in terms of the randomness and size of training samples is developed to evaluate the feature selection methods. A digitalized vehicles’ trajectory dataset, the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) is used for method validation. The validation results manifest that the EST can achieve satisfactory resampling performance while Random Forest (RF), as an embedded FS method, achieves remarkable performance on both stability of selected features and prediction of risk level. The results also show that the LC risk level can be most accurately predicted when the LC car moves to the position where the distance between the longitudinal center line of the LC car and the marking line separating the two lanes equals 1.5ft. As an innovative LC risk level prediction technique, the P-LRLP method could be integrated with advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to remedy potential risky LC maneuver in the future.",0968-090X,Not found

Inputs include congestion scores measured at earlier times in neighborhoods within a region, and three other real-time measures of regional traffic. The ideas are tested using Newell’s simplified theory of kinematic waves. Simplified street networks are featured first. Initial tests demonstrate the suitability of the congestion score for characterizing neighborhood traffic conditions, and that the score can be predicted using the four inputs.

This work proposes a probabilistic topic model, adapted from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to discover representative and interpretable activity categorization from individual-level spatiotemporal data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the activity-travel episodes of an individual user are treated as words in a document, and each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to certain type of activity. The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes—the location, start time of day, start day of week, and duration of each activity episode. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using pseudonymized transit smart card data from London, U.K. The results show that the model can successfully distinguish the three most basic types of activities—home, work, and other. As the specified number of activity categories increases, more specific subpatterns for home and work emerge, and both the goodness of fit and predictive performance for travel behavior improve. This work makes it possible to enrich human mobility data with representative and interpretable activity patterns without relying on predefined activity categories or heuristic rules.",0968-090X,Not found

However, this problem generally becomes intractable for possible discontinuities in the solution and the curse of dimensionality for systems with all but modest dimension. To address these challenges, a neural network is used to approximate the value function to obtain the optimal controls through policy iteration. Furthermore, a saturated operator is embedded in the neural network approximator to handle the difficulty caused by the control and state constraints. This policy iteration can be implemented as an iterative data-driven technique that integrates with the model-based optimal design based on real-time observations.

Graph Markov network for traffic forecasting with missing data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102671,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Traffic forecasting is a classical task for traffic management and it plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic data are mostly collected by traffic sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures and the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result in missing values in the collected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although missing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need long-term historical traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting, especially under edge computing and online prediction scenarios, traffic forecasting models with the capability of handling missing values are needed. In this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the transition between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a graph Markov process. In this way, missing traffic states can be inferred step by step and the spatial–temporal relationships among the roadway links can be incorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural network architecture for spatial–temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph Markov network (GMN). By incorporating the spectral graph convolution operation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov network (SGMN).

Modeling and managing ridesharing in a multi-modal network with an aggregate traffic representation: A doubly dynamical approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102670,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This study models a multi-modal network with ridesharing services. The developed model reproduces the scenario where travelers with their own cars may choose to be a solo-driver, a ridesharing driver, a ridesharing rider, or a public transit passenger while travelers without their own cars can only choose to be either a ridesharing rider or a public transit passenger. The developed model can capture the (clock) time-dependent choices of travelers and the evolution of traffic conditions, i.e., the within-day traffic dynamics. In particular, the within-day traffic dynamics in a city region is modeled through an aggregate traffic representation, i.e., the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). This paper further develops a doubly dynamical system that examines how the within-day time-dependent travelers’ choices and traffic conditions will evolve from day to day, i.e., the day-to-day dynamics. Based on the doubly dynamical framework, this paper proposes two different congestion pricing schemes that aim to reduce network congestion and improve traffic efficiency. One scheme is to price all vehicles including both solo-driving and ridesharing vehicles (for ridesharing trips, the price is shared by the driver and rider), while the other scheme prices the solo-driving vehicles only in order to encourage ridesharing. The pricing levels (under each scheme) can be determined either through an adaptive adjustment mechanism from period to period driven by observed traffic conditions, or through solving a bi-level optimization problem. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the models and effectiveness of the pricing schemes. The results indicate that the emerging ridesharing platform may not necessarily reduce traffic congestion, but the proposed congestion pricing schemes can effectively reduce congestion and improve system performance. While pricing solo-driving vehicles only may encourage ridesharing, it can be less effective in reducing the overall congestion when compared to pricing both solo-driving and ridesharing vehicles.",0968-090X,Not found

Estimation of metro network passenger delay from individual trajectories,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102704,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Smart card data enables the estimation of passenger delays throughout the public transit network.

To this end, we propose a novel method for attributing passenger delays to individual transit network elements from individual passenger trajectories. We decompose the delay along a passenger trajectory into its corresponding track segment delay, initial waiting time and transfer delay. Using these delay components, we construct a solvable system of equations, using which the delays on each network component can be computed. The estimation method is demonstrated on one year of data from the Washington DC metro network. Our approach produces promising results by compressing millions of individual trajectories into 3D networks, leading to a dimensionality reduction of 94%. Moreover, the mean slack variable value (that can be interpreted as proxies for estimation errors) is smaller than five seconds per passenger, and has the desired positive sign for almost 90% of all travelers. Applications using the estimation results include revealing network-wide recurrent delay patterns, modeling delay propagation and detecting disruptions.",0968-090X,Not found
The sustainability of shared mobility: Can a platform for shared rides reduce motorized traffic in cities?,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102707,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Studies in several cities indicate that ridesourcing (ride-hailing) may increase traffic and congestion, given the substitution of more sustainable modes and the addition of empty kilometers. On the other hand, there is little evidence if smartphone apps that target shared rides have any influence on reducing traffic levels. We study the effects of a shared-mobility service offered by a start-up in Mexico City, Jetty, which is used by travelers to book a shared ride in a car, van or bus. A large-scale user survey was conducted to study trip characteristics, reasons for using the platform and the general travel choices of Jetty users. We calculate travel distance per trip leg, for the current choices and for the modes that riders would have chosen if the platform was not available. We find that the effect of the platform on vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) depends on the rate of empty kilometers introduced by the fleet of vehicles, the substitution of public versus private transport modes, the occupancy rate of Jetty vehicles and assumptions on the occupancy rate of substituted modes. Following a sensitivity analysis approach for variables with unavailable data, we estimate that shared rides in cars increase VKT (in the range of 7 to 10 km/passenger), shared vans are able to decrease VKT (around −0.2 to −1.1 km/passenger), whereas buses are estimated to increase VKT (0.4 to 1.1 km/passenger), in our preferred scenarios. These results stem from the tradeoff between the effects of the occupancy rates per vehicle (larger vehicles are shared by more people) and the attractiveness of the service for car users (shared vans attract more car drivers than buses booked through Jetty). Our findings point to the relevance of shared rides in bigger vehicles such as vans as competitors to low occupancy car services for the future of mobility in cities, and to the improvement of public transportation services through the inclusion of quality attributes as provided by new shared-mobility services.",0968-090X,Not found
Transportation infrastructure restoration optimization considering mobility and accessibility in resilience measures,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102700,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Disruptive events lead to capacity degradation of transportation infrastructure, and a good restoration plan could minimize the aftermath impacts during the recovery period. This is considered one aspect of resiliency for transportation systems. Although unmet demand has been proposed as one measure of resilience for freight transportation, it has rarely been used for general transportation systems. This study takes unmet demand and total travel time as two measures in modeling the restoration plan problem and proposes a bi-objective bi-level optimization framework to determine an optimal transportation infrastructure restoration plan. The lower-level problem uses Elastic User Equilibrium to model the imbalance between demand and supply and measures the unmet demand for a given transportation network. The upper-level problem, formulated as bi-objective mathematical programming, determines optimal resource allocation for roadway restoration. The bi-level problems are solved by a modified active set algorithm and a network representation method derived from Network Design Problems. The Weighted Sum Method is adopted to solve the Pareto Frontier of this bi-objective optimization problem. The proposed restoration plan optimization method was applied to a typical road network in Sioux Falls, to verify the effectiveness of the methodology. For a given failure scenario, the Pareto Frontier of this bi-objective bi-level optimization problem with various budget levels, cross-referring to the travel efficiency of each solution, was illustrated to demonstrate how the proposed method can support decision-making for road network restoration. To further study the performance of the proposed method, different scenarios were generated with one to five links disrupted and the proposed methodology was applied with different budget levels. The statistical analysis of the optimized solutions for these scenarios demonstrates that a higher budget could help reduce unmet demand in the system by providing more restoration options.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimizing bike sharing systems from the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions perspective,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102705,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Bike sharing systems (BSSs), being viewed as providing green transportation modes, are growing rapidly in recent years. While BSS operators try to improve the system performance through bike rebalancing and launching more bikes, the current BSSs are facing several sustainability challenges. Bike oversupply could bring intensive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to manufacturing excessive bikes, while frequent bike rebalancing could significantly increase fuel consumption of rebalancing vehicles. Existing studies only optimized given BSS from the system operational perspective (i.e. rebalancing), with predetermined bike fleet size and rebalancing frequencies. However, the bike fleet size and rebalancing should also be optimized from the life cycle’s perspective. This study proposes a framework to obtain the optimal bike fleet size and rebalancing strategy to minimize the system’s life cycle GHG emissions, integrating a simulation model for fleet size estimation, an optimization model for bike rebalancing, and a life cycle assessment (LCA) model to quantify the system’s GHG emission rate. The framework is applied to a dock-less BSS in Xiamen, China as a case study to evaluate the tradeoff between having more bikes (requiring less rebalancing) and more frequent rebalancing (requiring fewer bikes). Our results show that (1) the current BSS in Xiamen is significantly oversupplied, with only 15% of current bikes needed to serve the same demands; (2) decreasing bike fleet size through more frequent rebalancing will increase the system’s life cycle GHG emissions; and (3) choosing appropriate rebalancing fleet size, loading capacity, and setting multiple depots can reduce a BSS’ rebalancing GHG emissions.",0968-090X,Not found
Parking sharing problem with spatially distributed parking supplies,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102676,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This study models and manages the parking sharing problem in urban cities, where private parking owners can share their vacant spaces to parking users via a parking sharing platform. The proposed model takes into account the spatial dimension of parking, where clusters of curbside spaces and private shareable ones are distributed over different locations. On the supply side, private parking owners can “sell the right-of-use” of their spaces to the platform based on the rent they can receive and the inconvenience they would experience due to sharing. On the demand side, travelers make their parking choices of space type (curbside or shared) and location under given parking capacities and prices. The resulting parking choice equilibrium is formulated as a minimization problem and several properties of the equilibrium are identified and discussed. The platform operator’s pricing strategy, i.e., rent paid to space owners and price charged on space users, can significantly affect the private parking owners’ sharing decisions and the choice equilibrium of parking users. In this context, we examine the platform operator’s optimal pricing strategies for revenue-maximization or social-cost-minimization.

Our analysis reveals that there is definitely a market for MaaS in Australia. Depending on the service offering, we find that up to 46 per cent of the Australian population would be willing to adopt MaaS. On average, consumers prefer pay-as-you-go schemes to bundled schemes that offer unlimited access to one or more transport modes and services at fixed monthly costs. Local public transport, taxis and long-distance public transport are the most popular transport services; bikeshare is the least popular. Willingness to use MaaS is strongly correlated with age and lifecycle stage: young individuals who are employed full-time are most likely to use MaaS; older adults who have retired from the workforce and whose children have left home are least likely to use MaaS.

Urban ride-hailing demand prediction with multiple spatio-temporal information fusion network,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102665,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Urban ride-hailing demand prediction is a long-term but challenging task for online car-hailing system decision, taxi scheduling and intelligent transportation construction. Accurate urban ride-hailing demand prediction can improve vehicle utilization and scheduling, reduce waiting time and traffic congestion. Existing traffic flow prediction approaches mainly utilize region-based situation awareness image or station-based graph representation to capture traffic spatial dynamic while we observe that combination of situation awareness image and graph representation are also critical for accurate forecasting. In this paper, we propose the Multiple Spatio-Temporal Information Fusion Networks (MSTIF-Net), a novel deep learning approach to better fuse multiple situation awareness information and graphs representation. MSTIF-Net model integrates structures of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Sequence to Sequence Learning (Seq2seq) model to obtain the joint latent representation of urban ride-hailing situation that contain both Euclidean spatial features and non-Euclidean structural features, and capture the spatio-temporal dynamics.

From cellular positioning data to trajectories: Steps towards a more accurate mobility exploration,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102666,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The recent years have witnessed a greater demand for understanding how people move in urban environments. Due to the widespread usage of mobile phones, there have been several trajectory-based studies focusing on extracting the characteristics of human mobility from georeferenced mobile phone data. Mobile positioning data is generally generated as scattered points in CDRs (Call Detail Records). Even though CDR data can be regarded as an inexpensive scalable source of information on human mobility, mobility studies in urban settings based on such data sources still prove to be a research challenge due to the coarseness of CDR spatial granularity. Motivated by the need for transforming large-scale CDRs to movement trajectories, the present study offers a new solution which is made of two principal building blocks: (1) Developing a Bayesian-based induction method through adopting a GIS-based wave propagation model to solve the GSM-based localization problem when methods such as triangulation are not applicable due to the lack of measurements from more than one base station; (2) Reconstruction of movement trajectories from cellular location information using overlapping relations existing between observed cells as well as detection of ping-pong phenomena as auxiliary information.

Integrated optimization of train stop planning and timetabling for commuter railways with an extended adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102681,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Train stop plans and timetables play key roles in railway operation. Previous research has demonstrated that their integration can significantly improve the quality of a train timetable, especially for commuter railways with flexible service frequencies and multiple stop plans. However, solving the dilemma of the mathematical tractability and practicality of the model is still an open challenge. To obtain a high-quality timetable and simultaneously consider more realistic conditions, an integrated combination optimization model of both train stop plans and timetables under time-dependent passenger demand is proposed in this article. More realistic conditions, such as no predefined schedule, a variable total number of trains and oversaturation, are taken into account. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) to optimize passenger travel efficiency and mainly consists of (1) the total waiting time at stations, (2) the delay time for trains due to a train stop, and (3) the minimization of the total train running time. An extended adaptive large-scale neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is developed to solve the problem. A numerical experiment is designed to test the validity of the model and the algorithm. Then, the integrated approach is applied in a real-world case. The results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously reduce the passenger total waiting time and delay time as well as the train running time within a short computation time and demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Personalized predictive public transport crowding information with automated data sources,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102647,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The paper proposes a methodology for providing personalized, predictive in-vehicle crowding information to public transport travellers via mobile applications or at-stop displays. Three crowding metrics are considered: (1) the probability of getting a seat on boarding, (2) the expected travel time standing, and (3) the excess perceived travel time compared to uncrowded conditions. The methodology combines prediction models of passenger loads and alighting counts based on lasso regularized regression and multivariate PLS regression, a probabilistic seat allocation model and a bias correction step in order to predict the crowding metrics. Depending on data availability, the prediction method can use a combination of historical passenger counts, real-time vehicle locations and real-time passenger counts. We evaluate the prediction methodology in a real-world case study for a bus line in Stockholm, Sweden.

An analytical model for controlling disruptions on a metro line,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102669,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"A control framework is developed that regulates a Metro-type rail line in the presence of disruptions while taking into account the tradeoff between user and operator (energy consumption) costs. Unlike approaches based solely on computational intensive optimization models, the proposed methodology is based on three eminently solvable analytical models. These formulations sequentially apply train holding and speed control strategies with the objective of reducing social cost. In the initial phase immediately following a disruption, one of the holding models determines the magnitude of the holds to be imposed on each train on the line. Once the trains are moving again and the recovery period begins, the other holding model and the speed control model take over, defining respectively the train holdings at each of the stations and the train speeds between them.

A multilevel optimization approach to route design and flight allocation taking aircraft sequence and separation constraints into account,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102684,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This paper presents the development of a multilevel optimization framework for the design and selection of departure routes, and the distribution of aircraft movements among these routes, while taking the sequence and separation requirements for aircraft on runways and along selected routes into account. The main aim of the framework is to minimize aircraft noise impact on communities around an airport, and the associated fuel consumption. The proposed framework features two consecutive steps. In the first step, for each given Standard Instrument Departure (SID), multi-objective trajectory optimization is utilized to generate a comprehensive set of possible alternative routes. The obtained set is subsequently used as input for the optimization problem in the second step. In this step, the selection of routes for each SID and the distribution of aircraft movements among these routes are optimized simultaneously. To ensure the feasibility of optimized solutions for an entire operational day, the sequence and separation requirements for aircraft on runways and along selected routes are included in this second phase. In order to address these issues, three novel techniques are developed and added to a previously developed multilevel optimization framework, viz., a runway assignment model, a conflict detection algorithm, and a rerouting technique. The proposed framework is applied to a realistic case study at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands, in which 599 departure flights and 13 different SIDs are considered.

Differential variable speed limits control for freeway recurrent bottlenecks via deep actor-critic algorithm,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102649,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Variable speed limit (VSL) control is a flexible way to improve traffic conditions, increase safety, and reduce emissions. There is an emerging trend of using reinforcement learning methods for VSL control. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to develop autonomous control agents for problems that were previously intractable. In this paper, a more effective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is developed for differential variable speed limit (DVSL) control, in which dynamic and distinct speed limits among lanes can be imposed. The proposed DRL model uses a novel actor-critic architecture to learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continuous action space. Different reward signals, such as total travel time, bottleneck speed, emergency braking, and vehicular emissions are used to train the DVSL controller, and a comparison between these reward signals is conducted. The proposed DRL-based DVSL controllers are tested on a freeway with a simulated recurrent bottleneck. The simulation results show that the DRL based DVSL control strategy is able to improve the safety, efficiency and environment-friendliness of the freeway.

A passenger-to-driver matching model for commuter carpooling: Case study and sensitivity analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102702,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"For the transport sector, promoting carpooling to private car users could be an effective strategy over reducing vehicle kilometers traveled. Theoretical studies have verified that carpooling is not only beneficial to drivers and passengers but also to the environment. Nevertheless, despite carpooling having a huge potential market in car commuters, it is not widely used in practice worldwide. In this paper, we develop a passenger-to-driver matching model based on the characteristics of a private-car based carpooling service, and propose an estimation method for time-based costs as well as the psychological costs of carpooling trips, taking into account the potential motivations and preferences of potential carpoolers. We test the model using commuting data for the Greater London from the UK Census 2011 and travel-time data from Uber. We investigate the service sensitivity to varying carpooling participant rates and fee-sharing ratios with the aim of improving matching performance at least cost. Finally, to illustrate how our matching model might be used, we test some practical carpooling promotion instruments. We found that higher participant role flexibility in the system can improve matching performance significantly. Encouraging commuters to walk helps form more carpooling trips and further reduces carbon emissions. Different fee-sharing ratios can influence matching performance, hence determination of optimal pricing should be based on the specific matching model and its cost parameters. Disincentives like parking charges and congestion charges seem to have a greater effect on carpooling choice than incentives like preferential parking and subsidies. The proposed model and associated findings provide valuable insights for designing an effective matching system and incentive scheme for carpooling services in practice.",0968-090X,Not found
New and emerging data forms in transportation planning and policy: Opportunities and challenges for “Track and Trace” data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102672,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"High quality, reliable data and robust models are central to the development and appraisal of transportation planning and policy. Although conventional data may offer good ‘content’, it is widely observed that it lacks context i.e. who and why people are travelling. Transportation modelling has developed within these boundaries, with implications for the planning, design and management of transportation systems and policy-making. This paper establishes the potential of passively collected GPS-based “Track & Trace” (T&T) datasets of individual mobility profiles towards enhancing transportation modelling and policy-making. T&T is a type of New and Emerging Data Form (NEDF), lying within the broader ‘Big Data’ paradigm, and is typically collected using mobile phone sensors and related technologies. These capture highly grained mobility content and can be linked to the phone owner/user behavioural choices and other individual context. Our meta-analysis of existing literature related to spatio-temporal mobile phone data demonstrates that NEDF’s, and in particular T&T data, have had little mention to date within an applied transportation planning and policy context. We thus establish there is an opportunity for policy-makers, transportation modellers, researchers and a wide range of stakeholders to collaborate in developing new analytic approaches, revise existing models and build the skills and related capacity needed to lever greatest value from the data, as well as to adopt new business models that could revolutionise citizen participation in policy-making.

A context identification layer to the reasoning subsystem of context-aware driver assistance systems based on proximity to intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102703,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This study proposes an addition to the architecture of the context-aware Driver Assistance Systems (DASs) by introducing a context identification layer to the reasoning subsystem. The proposed layer contains two algorithms that work in sequence: the infrastructure detection algorithm and the driver classification algorithm, respectively. The infrastructure detection algorithm aims to identify intersection-related driving when the driver adjusts his or her behavior due to the presence of an intersection ahead. Then, the driver classification algorithm categorizes drivers into cautious, normal, and aggressive at both locations. Data from 64 drivers in a Naturalistic Driving Study was used to prove the concept of the proposed layer. Several behavioral measures were extracted, including following distance, relative speed, headway, acceleration, time-to-collision, and jerk. These behavioral measures were then used to train the algorithms in the context identification layer. The results of both algorithms supported the concept of the proposed layer. These results have implications related to driver behaviors including i) the intersection-related driving behavior can be detected, ii) the drivers tend to be relatively aggressive at intersections when compared to segments, and iii) the driver classification, which ignores the driver’s relative location to intersections, were more likely to misclassify drivers as aggressive when they were in high intersection density areas such as downtown cores. The findings of this study emphasized the importance of context-aware DAS architecture that acknowledges and integrates the variation in driver behavior due to both a change in the surrounding environment and drivers’ individual needs.",0968-090X,Not found

To optimize driving performance, a reward function is developed by referencing human driving data and combining driving features related to safety, efficiency, and comfort. With the developed reward function, the RL agent learns to control vehicle speed in a fashion that maximizes cumulative rewards, through trials and errors in the simulation environment. To avoid potential unsafe actions, the proposed RL model is incorporated with a collision avoidance strategy for safety checks. The safety check strategy is used during both model training and testing phases, which results in faster convergence and zero collisions. A total of 1,341 car-following events extracted from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset are used to train and test the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by the comparison with empirical NGSIM data and with adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithm implemented through model predictive control (MPC). The experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrates the capability of safe, efficient, and comfortable velocity control and outperforms human drivers in that it 1) has larger TTC values than those of human drivers, 2) can maintain efficient and safe headways around 1.2s, and 3) can follow the lead vehicle comfortably with smooth acceleration (jerk value is only a third of that of human drivers). Compared with the MPC-based ACC algorithm, the proposed model has better performance in terms of safety, comfort, and especially running speed during testing (more than 200 times faster).

In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic long-term driving characteristics and its short-term changes after driver experiences an external stimulus. A long- and short-term driving (LSTD) model is proposed to incorporate such changes into car-following driving behavior modelling. The long-term driving characteristics are extracted through a cluster analysis, and the changes after an external stimulus are identified and measured as the indicator of the short-term driving characteristics. NGSIM data are used to demonstrate the existence of LSTD characteristics, and the soundness of the LSTD model.

Real-time crash prediction on expressways using deep generative models,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102697,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Real-time crash prediction is essential for proactive traffic safety management. However, developing an accurate prediction model is challenging as the traffic data of crash and non-crash cases are extremely imbalanced. Most of the previous studies undersampled non-crash cases to balance the data, which may not capture the heterogeneity of the full non-crash data. This study aims to use the emerging deep learning method called deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) model to fully understand the traffic data leading to crashes. With the full understanding of the traffic data of crashes, the DCGAN model could generate more synthetic data related to crashes to balance the dataset. All non-crash data could be used for developing the prediction models. To capture the correlations between different variables, the data are augmented to 2-D matrix as the input for the DCGAN model. The suggested model is evaluated based on data from expressways and compared to two counterparts: (1) synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE); (2) random undersampling technique. The results suggest that the DCGAN could better understand the crash data characteristics by generating data with better fit of the real data distribution. Four different crash prediction algorithms (i.e., logistic regression model, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network) are developed based on each balanced data and totally twelve models were estimated. The results indicate that the convolutional neural network model based on the DCGAN balanced data could provide the best prediction accuracy, validating that the proposed oversampling method could be used for the data balance. Besides, compared to other two models, only the DCGAN-based model could identify the significant effects of speed difference between the upstream and downstream locations which could help guide traffic management strategies. With the prediction model developed based on the balanced data by DCGAN, it is expected that more crashes could be predicted and prevented with more appropriate proactive traffic safety management strategies such as Variable Speed Limits (VSL) and Dynamic Message Signs (DMS).",0968-090X,Not found

Moreover, a Bayesian hierarchical structure is developed for the GEV model to combine conflict extremes of different intersections, and the aim is to further improve safety estimates through borrowing strength from different intersections and accounting for non-stationarity and unobserved heterogeneity in conflict extremes. The proposed approach was applied to four signalized intersections in City of Surrey, British Columbia. Traffic conflicts measured by modified time to collision and three cycle-level traffic parameters (traffic volume, shock wave area, and platoon ratio) were extracted from collected video data using computer vision techniques, and a best fitted model was then developed. Two safety indices, risk of crash (RC) and return level of a cycle (RLC), were derived from the GEV model to quantitatively measure the safety cycle-by-cycle. The results show that the non-negative RC can directly point out cycles with crash prone traffic conditions with RC > 0, and RLC is a more flexible safety index which can differentiate between safety levels even for “safe” cycles with RC = 0. The real time crash prediction results are validated at an aggregate level by comparing to observed crashes.",0968-090X,Not found
Spatiotemporal trajectory characteristic analysis for traffic state transition prediction near expressway merge bottleneck,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102682,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The theoretical analysis of traffic flow with empirical vehicle trajectory data contained within this study allows for the explanation, reconstruction, and prediction of spatiotemporal transition characteristics of traffic conditions. Using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during a morning rush hour on a working day, observations of congestion evolution near an on-ramp bottleneck of an expressway was captured. The empirical high-fidelity trajectory data of 621 vehicles were extracted. The major findings include: (1) Macroscopic perspective: Three traffic states (free flow, metastable traffic flow, and jam) were observed with different spatiotemporal physical structures and their critical characteristics in a continuous first-order phase transition. The spontaneous spatiotemporal traffic breakdown and capacity drop were also captured, the critical points of which were also recorded. The features of widening synchronized flow pattern, general pattern, and the nature of nucleation described in the three-phase traffic theory were identified, which provides a new observational cognition for congestion formation and development. (2) Microscopic perspective: The impact of lane changes on immediate vehicles were modeled and quantified with the fluctuation magnitude of speed and the theoretical lag distance, which provides a method to identify the source of perturbation and determine the microscopic critical threshold of vehicle between macroscopic phase transitions. The research shows a lane changer could cause a forced deceleration of an immediate vehicle on a target lane after inserting itself with critical spacing headway below approximately 15–20 m. The average deceleration duration of vehicles in different traffic states can be captured as crucial driving features from downstream to help predict traffic state transition in a real bottleneck.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated vehicle assignment and routing for system-optimal shared mobility planning with endogenous road congestion,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102675,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Ride-sharing services, that have been growing in recent years with the start of network service companies, will be further enhanced by the recently emerging trend of applications for autonomous vehicles for future traveler mobility. One fundamental question that transportation managers should address is how to capture the endogenous traffic patterns involving the new and uncertain elements facing future transportation planning and management. By concentrating on one ideal system optimal (SO) scenario, in which (i) all vehicles are autonomous, or can be centrally guided and (ii) all passengers’ pickup/drop-off trip requests can be given at the beginning, this paper aims to integrate travel demand, vehicle supply, and limited infrastructure. Available ride-shared and autonomous vehicles, from different (real/virtual) depots, can be optimally assigned to satisfy passengers’ trip requests, while considering the endogenous congestion in capacitated networks. A number of decomposition approaches are adopted in this research. Focusing on this primal problem, we propose an arc-based vehicle-based integer linear programming model in space-time-state (STS) networks, which is solved by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. From the perspective of dynamic traffic assignment, a space-time-state (STS) path-based flow-based linear programming model is also provided as an approximation according to the mapping information between vehicle and passenger, and between a vehicle and the space-time arc in each STS path in our priori-generated column pool. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate our decomposition approaches and their computation efficiency. From our preliminary experiments, we have a few interesting observations: (i) without considering road congestion, the network performance/efficiency could be overestimated; (ii) passengers’ required pickup and drop-off time windows could be a buffer to mitigate road congestion, without impacting system performance; (iii) the ride-sharing service could reduce the total transportation system cost under centralized control.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling speed profiles on mountainous freeways using high resolution data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102679,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Operating speed profiles represent drivers’ responses to roadway geometry and are widely used to evaluate safety performance of roadway design. To predict operating speed profile, the majority of early research followed a two-step modeling procedure: (1) estimate speeds at start, middle, and end points of road segments, and (2) fill the profile between the points with assumed driver behavior. This sparse-spot-based modeling strategy has been shown to be inadequate for capturing the complex speed changes resulting from the overlapping horizontal and vertical curves on mountainous roads. This paper proposes a high-resolution modeling approach for operating speeds measured in a dense series of equidistant spots along a road. This type of model is more conducive to analysis of mountainous freeway alignments as operating speeds are predicted along the entire roadway. The high-resolution data were obtained, using the Tongji University Driving Simulator, from a simulated section of mountainous freeway. The estimated linear mixed model includes geometric variables representing the road upstream and downstream of each data collection spot. To determine the suitable lengths of the upstream and downstream segments, the data were extracted from several alternative segment lengths, including fixed lengths and varying downstream length accordingly to sight distances. The model with a spherical structure of error covariance, using geometric data extracted from 300-meter upstream and downstream segments, performed the best. An out-of-sample evaluation of the model has the mean absolute error of 3.2 km/h and the root mean square error of 4.2 km/h, which indicates a promising prediction ability of the proposed model.",0968-090X,Not found
Design and operation of dedicated lanes for connected and automated vehicles on motorways: A conceptual framework and research agenda,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102664,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Dedicated Lanes (DLs) have been proposed as a potential scenario for the deployment of Automated and/or Connected Vehicles (C/AVs) on the road network. However, evidence-based knowledge regarding the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency is limited. In order to develop an adequate design for DLs, first, a conceptual framework describing the relations and interrelations between these factors and traffic safety and efficiency is needed. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework accounting for the factors that could affect the safety and efficiency of DLs. This conceptual framework is underpinned based on relevant literature on how the deployment of C/AVs, driver behaviour, and DL design and operation affect traffic safety and efficiency. Based on the conceptual framework, the knowledge gaps on DL design for C/AVs were identified and a research agenda, including prioritization of the research needs, is proposed. Following the developed conceptual framework, the necessary building blocks for investigating the impacts of different design configurations, utilization policies, and the design of their access/egress on traffic safety and efficiency are: (1) to specify the types of vehicles with certain capabilities allowed to drive on DLs; (2) to incorporate existing algorithms of C/AVs, which reflect more realistically their behaviour, in both driving simulator experiments and microscopic simulation; (3) to translate the empirical data regarding human behavioural adaptation collected from field tests and driving simulator studies to mathematical models and implement them in traffic flow simulation platform. It is also recommended to develop automated lane change algorithms, taking into account connectivity between C/AVs which can be also implemented in driving simulators and traffic flow simulation platforms. Finally, it is recommended that future research investigate the combined effects of traffic safety and efficiency in designing DLs while considering driver behaviour adaptation and control transitions between manual and automated operation.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamics of travelers’ modality style in the presence of mobility-on-demand services,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102668,117,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Modality style –defined as a set of frequent travel modes characterizing the travelers’ habits, routines, and predispositions– is a key player in forming dynamics of travelers’ mode choice behavior. This study aims to uncover the dynamics of modal preferences while the Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services operate in the market. Using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey data, a Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model is developed to analyze the dynamics of individuals’ modality style. This model enables us to take into consideration marginal rates of substitutions between different transportation modes. Variables of interest in this analysis include the frequency of use of mobility-on-demand (MoD) services as well as the frequency of walking, biking, transit, and auto trips over the course of a month. The results of this study offer city planners and policymakers an opportunity to better understand the factors underlying modality styles, and which priorities to focus on when designing a sustainable development plan for resident-centric Smart Cities. According to the results, age, work status, education, auto availability, and the built environments are among the significant contributors to the modality styles.

A methodological framework to incorporate psychophysiological indicators into transportation modeling,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102712,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Reporting and hypothetical biases are inherent to canonical methods of transportation data collection and had implied that analysis in this field has often neglected aspects that are strong behavioral drivers, such as uncertainty, physical effort or stress. Granular information on these aspects would allow measuring their valuation and/or addressing a pervasive source of endogeneity. Recent advances in miniaturization and data processing, as well as evidence that indicators from biosensors correlate with psychophysiological states and emotions, suggest that there is an opportunity to close this gap by collecting a new type of data from transportation users. This research works on leveraging this opportunity by putting forward, illustrating and testing a methodological framework to incorporate psychophysiological indicators gathered from biosensors into transportation choice behavioral modeling. The proposed framework adapts the integrated choice and latent variable approach by incorporating the psychophysiological responses as additional indicators of a latent psychophysiological state that covariates with utility. For the practical implementation of the proposed framework we also consider a specific form of aggregation of the indicators across time to avoid the curse of dimensionality arising from the unmanageably large number of folds for integration. The proposed framework is illustrated and validated using Monte Carlo simulations. Besides, a prototype field experiment was designed and performed to confirm the validity of three crucial components of the proposed framework: (i) the relation between transportation markers and emotions; (ii) the possibility of measuring those emotions through biosensors installed on travelers, (iii) and the validity of the proposed aggregation needed for practicality. In the experiment, a public transportation user travelled wearing a Printed Circuit Board that integrated tiny biosensors to capture electrodermal activity, heart rate variation, temperature and acceleration. Results provide positive evidence for the research questions, suggesting the convenience of developing larger data collection efforts in the future to take full advantage of the new framework.",0968-090X,Not found
Energy-aware trajectory optimization of CAV platoons through a signalized intersection,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102652,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Traffic signals, while serving an important function to coordinate vehicle movements through intersections, also cause frequent stops and delays, particularly when they are not properly timed. Such stops and delays contribute to significant amount of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The recent development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology provides new opportunities to enable better control of vehicles and intersections, that in turn reduces fuel consumption and emissions. In this paper, we propose a trajectory optimization method, PTO-GFC, to reduce the total fuel consumption of a CAV platoon through a signalized intersection. In this method, we first apply platoon-trajectory-optimization (PTO) to obtain the optimal trajectories of the platoon vehicles. In PTO, all CAVs in one platoon are considered as a whole, that is, all other CAVs follow the trajectory of the leading one with a time delay and minimum safety gap, which is enabled by vehicle to vehicle communication. Then, we apply gap-feedback-control (GFC) to control the vehicles with different speeds and headways merging into the optimal trajectories. We compare the PTO-GFC method with the other two methods, in which the leading vehicle adopts the optimal trajectory (LTO) or drive with maximum speed (AT), respectively, and the other vehicles follow the leading vehicle with a simplified Gipps’ car-following model. Furthermore, we extend the controls into multiple platoons by considering the interactions between the two platoons. The numerical results demonstrate that PTO-GFC has better performance than LTO and AT, particularly when CAVs have enough space and time to smooth their trajectories. The reduction of travel time and fuel consumption shows the great potential of CAV technology in reducing congestion and negative environmental impact of automobile transportation.",0968-090X,Not found
Hierarchical density-based clustering methods for tolling zone definition and their impact on distance-based toll optimization,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102685,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Real-time network control strategies such as congestion pricing have been used in a number of metropolitan areas around the world for traffic congestion mitigation. Recent advances in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology have led to increasing interest in distance- or usage-based road pricing as an effective alternative to traditional facility-, cordon- and area-based pricing that typically rely on fixed infrastructure. In this paper, we propose the use of feature-variant clustering methods, OPTICS and HDBSCAN*, as a systematic approach for tolling zone definition to operationalize distance-based tolling schemes. Subsequently, we develop a framework for predictive distance-based toll optimization to evaluate network performance for the various tolling zone definitions derived from the aforementioned feature-variant clustering methods. In this framework, for a specific tolling zone definition, tolling function parameters are optimized using a simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) model operating within a rolling horizon scheme. Predictive optimization is integrated with the guidance information generation. Behavioral models capture drivers’ responses to the tolls in terms of trip cancellation and choices of mode, route and departure time. Experiments on the real-world Expressway and Major Arterials network of Singapore demonstrate improved effectiveness of distance-based toll optimization given tolling zone definitions derived from feature-variant clustering, compared to fixed cordon-based pricing, adaptive cordon-based pricing, as well as distance-based pricing with ad hoc tolling zone definitions. Further, the results indicate that the use of the marginal link cost tolls as a clustering feature produces the most robust tolling zone definitions and yields significant improvements in social welfare over ad hoc zone definitions and cordon-pricing.

A tensor decomposition method for cycle-based traffic volume estimation using sampled vehicle trajectories,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102739,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Cycle-based traffic volume estimation is important for the dynamic evaluation and optimization of signal control schemes at intersections. With the development of intelligent mobility and connected vehicle technologies, massive high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have become available, which can provide a rich source of information for estimating traffic flow parameters at signalized intersections. Existing methods for traffic volume estimation using sampled vehicle trajectories are commonly driven by shockwave or probabilistic models, in which the traffic volume estimation is usually modelled as a parameter estimation problem. These methods commonly require certain assumptions for the vehicle arrival distribution and a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queuing rule. However, these model-driven methods have limitations when the vehicle arrival distribution is unknown or when there is more than one lane for the same movement at an intersection approach, as the FIFO rule is no longer true. In addition, the accuracy and stability of these models remain challenging under low penetration rates. In this paper, we propose a tensor decomposition method to estimate cycle-based traffic volume at signalized intersections using sampled vehicle trajectories. Unlike the existing model-driven methods, the proposed method is purely data-driven and does not rely on any prerequisite assumptions for the arrival distributions and queuing rules. In the proposed method, the traffic volume of each cycle is first divided into a known part and an unknown part, based on the queuing position of the last queued sample vehicle. Then, these two parts of the volume as a whole, along with two relevant traffic observations (i.e., the number of sampled vehicles and the observation duration), are then integrated into a three-dimensional tensor. This tensor can effectively preserve the temporal correlations between adjacent cycles and the interrelationships among the traffic observations. Finally, the problem of cycle-based traffic estimation is transformed into a tensor completion problem, and the Tucker decomposition method is adopted to solve the completion problem. The proposed method is evaluated using both empirical and simulation data. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of producing accurate and reliable estimates for cycle-based traffic volumes even under low penetration rates, i.e., less than 5%.",0968-090X,Not found
Probabilistic field approach for motorway driving risk assessment,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102716,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"We present an approach to assess the risk taken by on-road vehicles within the framework of artificial field theory, envisioned for safety analysis and design of driving support/automation applications. Here, any obstacle (neighboring entity on the road) to the subject vehicle is treated as a finite scalar risk field that is formulated in the predicted configuration space of the subject vehicle. The driving risk estimate is the strength of the risk field at the subject vehicle’s future location. This risk field is formulated as the product of two factors: collision probability and expected crash energy. The collision probability with neighboring vehicles is estimated based on probabilistic motion predictions. The risk can be assessed for a single time step or over multiple future time steps, depending on the required temporal resolution of the estimates. We verified the single step approach in three near-crash situations from a naturalistic dataset and in cut-in and hard-braking scenarios with simulation and showed the application of the multi-step approach in selecting the safest path in a lane-drop section. The risk descriptions from the proposed approach qualitatively reflect the narration of the situation and are in general consistent with Time To Collision. Compared to current surrogate measures of safety, the proposed risk estimate provides a better basis to assess the driving safety of an individual vehicle by considering the uncertainty over the future ambient traffic state and magnitude of expected crash consequences. The proposed driving risk model can be used as a component of intelligent vehicle safety applications and as a comprehensive surrogate measure for assessing traffic safety.",0968-090X,Not found
Impact of distraction on decision making at the onset of yellow signal,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102741,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The current study shows the impact of distraction in designing the intelligent in-vehicle systems for assisting the drivers to make stop/cross decision at the onset of yellow signal. In total, 83 participants drove through a simulated urban scenario with six signalised intersections. Firstly, the time taken to execute the stop/cross decision was statistically modelled by using Weibull AFT (Accelerated Failure Time) models. The results showed that compared to the baseline, eating and drinking tasks reduced the stopping time by 6% and 7% respectively. For the crossing encounters, the eating task caused 12% increment in crossing time compared to the baseline. This analysis was followed by modelling the success rates of the executed decisions with binary logistic models. The success rates of the stopping decision showed that reduction in the time lapsed in executing the decision led to failure in stopping the vehicle before the stop line. Similarly, an increment in the time taken to execute the crossing decision led to reduced probability of successfully crossing the stop line within the yellow duration. Hence, the results suggest that the design of the smart assistance system for decision making at the onset of yellow signal should be based on the success rate of the decision which is dependent on the time lapsed in executing the decision. Moreover, the presence of distracting activities should be considered as an input parameter while designing the assistance system.",0968-090X,Not found
Distributed model predictive control of multi-vehicle systems with switching communication topologies,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102717,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication-enabled cooperation of multiple connected vehicles improves the safety and efficiency of our transportation systems. However, the joining and leaving of vehicles and unreliability of wireless communication channels will cause the switching of communication topology among vehicles, thus affecting the performance of multi-vehicle systems. To address this issue, a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method is proposed for multi-vehicle system control under switching communication topologies. First, an open-loop optimization problem is formulated, within which neighbor-deviation and self-deviation penalties and constraints are incorporated to ensure stability. Then, a DMPC algorithm is designed for multi-vehicle systems subject to switching communication topologies. For the closed-loop system, the convergence of predicted terminal states is proved based on the neighbor-deviation constraint. After that, closed-loop system stability is analysed based on a common Lyapunov function (CLF) defined using a joint neighbor set. It is proved that asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system can be achieved through a sufficient condition on the weight matrices of the open-loop optimization problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DMPC controller.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimation of left behind subway passengers through archived data and video image processing,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102727,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Crowding is one of the most common problems for public transportation systems worldwide, and extreme crowding can lead to passengers being left behind when they are unable to board the first arriving bus or train.

The methodology proposed in this study has been developed and applied to the subway in Boston, Massachusetts. Trains are not currently equipped with automated passenger counters, and farecard data is only collected on entry to the system. An analysis of crowding from inferred origin–destination data was used to identify stations with high likelihood of passengers being left behind during peak hours. Results from North Station during afternoon peak hours are presented here. Image processing and object detection software was used to count the number of passengers that were left behind on station platforms from surveillance video feeds. Automatically counted passengers and train operations data were used to develop logistic regression models that were calibrated to manual counts of left behind passengers on a typical weekday with normal operating conditions.

However, AVs’ benefits also introduce a serious potential challenge, in the form of complex interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs). The emergence of AVs introduces uncertainty in the behavior of human actors and in the impact of the AV manufacturer on autonomous driving design. This paper thus aims to investigate how AVs affect road safety and to design socially optimal liability rules in comparative negligence for AVs and human drivers. A unified game is developed, including a Nash game between human drivers, a Stackelberg game between the AV manufacturer and HVs, and a Stackelberg game between the lawmaker and other users. We also establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the game. The game is then simulated with numerical examples to investigate the emergence of human drivers’ moral hazard, the AV manufacturer’s role in traffic safety, and the lawmaker’s role in liability design. Our findings demonstrate that human drivers could develop moral hazard if they perceive their road environment has become safer and an optimal liability rule design is crucial to improve social welfare with advanced transportation technologies.

AIS data driven general vessel destination prediction: A random forest based approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102729,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Shipping is one of the major transportation approaches around the world. With the growing demands for global shipping service, vessel destination prediction has shown its significant role in improving the efficiency of decision making in industry and ensuring a safe and efficient maritime traffic environment. Currently, most vessel destination prediction methods focus on regional destination prediction, which has restrictions on destinations and regions. Thus, this paper proposes a general AIS (Automatic Identification System) data-driven model for vessel destination prediction. In this random forest-based model, the similarity between the vessel’s traveling and historical trajectories are measured and utilized to predict the destination. The destination of the historical trajectory, which shares the highest similarity with the traveling trajectory, is predicted as the vessel’s destination. The method is different from previous work which used maritime records as input to predict the destination. In our method, a historical trajectory database was generated from more than 141 million AIS records, which covers 534,824 traveling patterns between ports and more than 5.9 million historical trajectories. Comparative studies were carried out to validate the performance of the proposed model, where eleven state-of-the-art trajectories similarity measurement methods combined with two different decision strategies were implemented and compared.

Route guidance ranking procedures with human perception consideration for personalized public transport service,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102667,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The use of smartphone applications (apps) to acquire real time and readily available journey planning information is becoming instinctive behavior by public transport (PT) users. Through the apps, a passenger not only seeks a path from origin to destination, but a satisfactory path that caters to the passenger’s preferences at the desired time of travel. Essentially, apps attempt to provide a means of personalized PT service. As the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic take form and infiltrate human and environmental interactions, passenger preference personalization will likely include avoiding risks of infection or contagious contact. The personal preferences are enabled by multiple attributes associated with alternative PT routes. For instance, preferences can be connected to attributes of time, cost, and convenience. This work establishes a personalized PT service, as an adjustment to current design frameworks, by integrating user app experience with operators’ data sources and operations modeling. The work proceeds to focus on its key component: the personalized route guidance methodology. In addition to using the existing shortest path or k-weighted shortest path method, this study develops a novel, lexicographical shortest path method, considering a just noticeable difference (JND). The method adopts lexicographical ordering to capture passenger preferences for different PT attributes following Ernst Weber’s law of human perception threshold. However, a direct application of Weber’s law violates the axiom of transitivity required for an implementable algorithm, and thus, a revised method is developed with proven algorithms for ranking different paths. The differences between the three route-guidance methods and the effects of the JND perception threshold on the order of the alternative PT routes are demonstrated with an example. The developments were examined in a case study by simulation on the Copenhagen PT network. The results show that using the JND method reduces the value/cost of the most important attributes. Identical robust results are attained when JND parameters are not specified and default values are used. The latter may apply for the future with a mixture of specified and default preference input values. Finally, the computation time indicates a favorable potential for real-life applications. It is believed that the consideration of human threshold perception will encourage decision makers to establish new criteria to comply with this.",0968-090X,Not found

Deep neural networks for choice analysis: Extracting complete economic information for interpretation,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102701,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied to choice analysis showing high predictive power, it is unclear to what extent researchers can interpret economic information from DNNs. This paper demonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as classical discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information from DNNs includes choice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns of alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities, marginal rates of substitution, and heterogeneous values of time. Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn utility functions and reveal behavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts, particularly when the sample size is large. However, the economic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable when the sample size is small, because of three challenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. The first challenge is related to the statistical challenge of balancing approximation and estimation errors of DNNs, the second to the optimization challenge of identifying the global optimum in the DNN training, and the third to the robustness challenge of mitigating locally irregular patterns of estimated functions. To demonstrate the strength and challenges, we estimated the DNNs using a stated preference survey from Singapore and a revealed preference data from London, extracted the full list of economic information from the DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the economic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or trainings, and that larger sample size, hyperparameter searching, model ensemble, and effective regularization can significantly improve the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs. Future studies should investigate the requirement of sample size, better ensemble mechanisms, other regularizations and DNN architectures, better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address DNNs three challenges to provide more reliable economic information for DNN-based choice models.",0968-090X,https://github.com/cjsyzwsh/dnn-for-economic-information
Stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network for forecasting network-wide traffic state with missing values,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102674,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Short-term traffic forecasting based on deep learning methods, especially recurrent neural networks (RNN), has received much attention in recent years. However, the potential of RNN-based models in traffic forecasting has not yet been fully exploited in terms of the predictive power of spatial–temporal data and the capability of handling missing data. In this paper, we focus on RNN-based models and attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its variants into traffic prediction models. A stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed to assist the design of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key component of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to capture the forward and backward temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data. To deal with missing values in spatial–temporal data, we also propose a data imputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an imputation unit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional version of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world network-wide traffic state datasets are used to conduct experiments and published to facilitate further traffic prediction research. The prediction performance of multiple types of multi-layer LSTM or BDLSTM models is evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM architecture, especially the two-layer BDLSTM network, can achieve superior performance for the network-wide traffic prediction in both accuracy and robustness. Further, comprehensive comparison results show that the proposed data imputation mechanism in the RNN-based models can achieve outstanding prediction performance when the model’s input data contains different patterns of missing values.",0968-090X,https://github.com/shriyanksomvanshi/TemporalMissing-Imputation2
A real-time crash prediction fusion framework: An imbalance-aware strategy for collision avoidance systems,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102708,118,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Real-time traffic crash prediction has been a major concern in the development of Collision Avoidance Systems (CASs) along with other intelligent and resilient transportation technologies. There has been a pronounced progress in the use of machine learning models for crash events assessment by the transportation safety research community in recent years. However, little attention has been paid so far to evaluating real-time crash occurrences within information fusion systems. The main aim of this paper is to design and validate an ensemble fusion framework founded on the use of various base classifiers that operate on fused features and a Meta classifier that learns from base classifiers’ results to acquire more performant crash predictions. A data-driven approach was adopted to investigate the potential of fusing four real-time and continuous categories of features namely physiological signals, driver maneuvering inputs, vehicle kinematics and weather covariates in order to systematically identify the crash strongest precursors through feature selection techniques. Moreover, a resampling-based scheme, including Bagging and Boosting, is conducted to generate diversity in learner combinations comprising Bayesian Learners (BL), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). To ensure that the proposed framework provide powerful and stable decisions, an imbalance-learning strategy was adopted using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance problem as crash events usually occur in rare instances. The findings show that Boosting depicted the highest performance within the fusion scheme and can accomplish a maximum of 93.66% F1 score and 94.81% G-mean with Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Networks, k-NN and SVM with MLP as the Meta-classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first attempt at establishing a fusing framework on the basis of data from the four aforementioned categories and fusion models while accounting for class imbalance. Overall, the method and findings provide new insights into crash prediction and can be harnessed as a promising tool to improve intervention efforts related to traffic intelligent transportation systems.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling determinants of ridesourcing usage: A census tract-level analysis of Chicago,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102769,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Ridesourcing services provided by companies like Uber, Lyft, and Didi have grown rapidly over the past decade and now serve a sizable portion of trips in many metropolitan areas. An understanding of these services (e.g. to whom, where, when, and for what purposes do they provide service?) is critical for regulating, planning, and managing urban multi-modal transportation systems effectively. Unfortunately, little is known about ridesourcing travel because private companies providing ridesourcing services were not previously subject to data sharing requirements. Fortunately, the city of Chicago recently collected and released spatially (census tract) and temporally (15-minute interval) aggregated data on ridesourcing trips collected from private companies. This study analyzes the Chicago ridesourcing data to examine factors influencing ridesourcing usage. The study employs a random-effects negative binomial (RENB) regression approach to model ridesourcing usage. Determinants considered in the model include weekend vs. weekday and weather variables as well as census tract socio-demographics and commute characteristics, land-use variables, places of interest, transit supply, parking features, and crime. The model results indicate ridesourcing demand is higher on days when temperatures are lower, there is less precipitation, and on the weekend, as well as in census tracts with (i) higher household incomes, (ii) a higher percentage of workers who carpool or take transit to work, (iii) a higher percentage of households with zero vehicles, (iv) higher population and employment density, (v) higher land-use diversity, (vi) fewer parking spots and higher parking rates, (vii) more restaurants, and (viii) more homicides. The results also demonstrate a non-linear (and insightful) relationship between ridesourcing demand and transit supply variables.

Forecast network-wide traffic states for multiple steps ahead: A deep learning approach considering dynamic non-local spatial correlation and non-stationary temporal dependency,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102763,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Obtaining accurate information about future traffic flows of all links in a traffic network is of great importance for traffic management and control applications. This research studies two particular problems in traffic forecasting: (1) capture the dynamic and non-local spatial correlation between traffic links and (2) model the dynamics of temporal dependency for accurate multiple steps ahead predictions. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning framework named Spatial-Temporal Sequence to Sequence model (STSeq2Seq). This model builds on sequence to sequence (seq2seq) architecture to capture temporal feature and relies on graph convolution for aggregating spatial information. Moreover, STSeq2Seq defines and constructs Pattern-aware Adjacency Matrix (PAM) based on pair-wise similarity of the recent traffic patterns on traffic links and integrates it into graph convolution operation. It also deploys a novel seq2sesq architecture which couples a convolutional encoder and a recurrent decoder with attention mechanism for dynamic modeling of long-range dependence between different time steps. We conduct extensive experiments using two publicly-available large-scale traffic datasets and compare STSeq2Seq with other baseline models. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in terms of various error measures. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of PAMs in capturing dynamic non-local spatial correlation and the superiority of proposed seq2seq architecture in modeling non-stationary temporal dependency for multiple steps ahead prediction.

A network-level sidewalk inventory method using mobile LiDAR and deep learning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102772,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Sidewalks are a critical infrastructure to facilitate essential daily trips for pedestrian and wheelchair users. The dependence on the infrastructure and the increasing demand from these users press public transportation agencies for cost-effective sidewalk maintenance and better Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance. Unfortunately, most of the agencies still rely on outdated sidewalk mapping data or manual survey results for their sidewalk management. In this study, a network-level sidewalk inventory method is proposed by efficiently segmenting the mobile light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data using a customized deep neural network, i.e., PointNet++, and followed by integrating a stripe-based sidewalk extraction algorithm. By extracting the sidewalk locations from the mobile LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding geometry features, e.g., width, grade, cross slope, etc., can be extracted for the ADA compliance and the overall condition assessment. The experimental test conducted on the entire State Route 9, Massachusetts has shown promising performance in terms of the accuracy for the sidewalk extraction (i.e., point-level intersect over union (IoU) value of 0.946) and the efficiency for network analysis of the ADA compliance (i.e., approximately 6.5 min/mile). A case study conducted in Columbus District in Boston, Massachusetts, demonstrates that the proposed method can not only successfully support transportation agencies with an accurate and efficient means for network-level sidewalk inventory, but also support wheelchair users with accurate and comprehensive sidewalk inventory information for better navigation and route planning.",0968-090X,Not found
Evacuating metro passengers via the urban bus system under uncertain disruption recovery time and heterogeneous risk-taking behaviour,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102761,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The bus-bridging service has always faced problems in severe emergencies or catastrophes that require the large-scale evacuation of passengers.

The uncertain recovery time of the service disruption and the heterogeneous risk-taking behavior of the affected metro passengers are incorporated in the scheme.

Estimating multi-class dynamic origin-destination demand through a forward-backward algorithm on computational graphs,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102747,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Transportation networks are unprecedentedly complex with heterogeneous vehicular flow. Conventionally, vehicles are classified by size, the number of axles or engine types, e.g., standard passenger cars versus trucks. However, vehicle flow heterogeneity stems from many other aspects in general, e.g., ride-sourcing vehicles versus personal vehicles, human driven vehicles versus connected and automated vehicles. Provided with some observations of vehicular flow for each class in a large-scale transportation network, how to estimate the multi-class spatio-temporal vehicular flow, in terms of time-varying Origin-Destination (OD) demand and path/link flow, remains a big challenge. This paper presents a solution framework for multi-class dynamic OD demand estimation (MCDODE) in large-scale networks that work for any vehicular data in general. The proposed framework cast the standard OD estimation methods into a computational graph with tensor representations of spatio-temporal flow and all intermediate features involved in the MCDODE formulation. A forward-backward algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the MCDODE formulation on computational graphs.

Determination of infrastructure capacity in railway networks without the need for a fixed timetable,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102751,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Railway capacity is a scarce and expensive resource that has to be utilised in the best way possible. Many methods exist for medium- and short-term planning and analysis of railway capacity. Yet, there is a lack of methods for long term (strategic) planning that provides high quality estimates of capacity in complex railway networks. In this paper, we define capacity of a railway network by a maximal set of trains that can be operated in a predefined period. This maximal set distinguish between different train types and the number of each type, and thus the heterogeneity of the operation. We formalise the capacity determination as an optimisation problem with the objective of finding the maximal set of trains that minimises the average waiting time between trains of the same type. We test for feasibility of sets of trains by computing the time a set of trains occupies the infrastructure. A fixed timetable is not needed for the feasibility tests as samples of train sequences are examined. Furthermore, it is possible to determine a span of capacity depending on service constraints by adjusting input parameters. We propose and test two different solution approaches to determine the capacity of railway infrastructure: an exact branch-and-bound algorithm and a tabu search heuristic. The applicability of the capacity determination framework is demonstrated on the railway network of Southwestern Denmark, with and without infrastructure upgrades. We analyse computation time, solution performance and sensitivity. The results illustrate the ability to obtain quality solutions for a real network within the order of minutes. As precise infrastructure characteristics are considered in junctions, the method is able to quantify the effect of the infrastructure upgrades, contrary to other assessment methods used in the long term (strategic) planning phase.",0968-090X,Not found

The other sub-algorithm works in the low or microscopic level and is supposed to work with any chosen microscopic crowd dynamics model. It is mainly used to model dynamic changes of pedestrians’ departure doors while they are walking inside rooms. Many mechanisms are introduced for considering practical factors affecting pedestrians’ routing behaviors, for example consideration of congestion of segments between pedestrians and doors, consideration of impact of re-selection of previous doors, etc. According to conducted numerical experiments, the proposed algorithm can well model crowd’s tactical decisions in a microscopic simulation under various scenarios, thus is a suitable method for study of crowd dynamics in a complicated environment.",0968-090X,Not found

Second, compared with a previous study in the US, we propose and discuss an expected social dilemma caused by the ethical problems that AVs will face, known as the Trolley Problems.

Multi-period line planning with resource transfers,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102726,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Urban transportation systems are subject to a high level of variation and fluctuation in demand over the day.

A multi-period line planning approach that considers a changing demand during the planning horizon is proposed. If such systems are also subject to limitations of resources, a dynamic transfer of resources from one line to another throughout the planning horizon should also be considered. A mathematical modelling framework is developed to solve the line planning problem with a cost-oriented approach considering transfer of resources during a finite length planning horizon of multiple periods. We use real-life public transportation network data for our computational results. We analyze whether or not multi-period solutions outperform single period solutions in terms of feasibility and relevant costs.

A methodology for identifying critical links and estimating macroscopic fundamental diagram in large-scale urban networks,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102743,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), which exhibits the relationship between average flow and average density of an urban network, is a promising framework for monitoring and controlling urban traffic networks. Given that monitoring resources (e.g. loop detectors, probe vehicle data, etc.) are limited in real-world networks, acquiring adequate data to estimate an MFD is of crucial importance. This study presents a novel, network-wide approach to identifying critical links and estimating average traffic flow and density. The proposed model estimates the MFD using flow and density measurements from those critical links, which constitute only a small subset of all the links in the network. To find the critical links, we rely on historical probe vehicle data, and propose a model that builds on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction and a feature selection method. Essentially, using PCA, a large number of possibly interrelated variables in a dataset can be reduced to a set of smaller uncorrelated variables, while maintaining as much information as possible in the dataset. The resulting uncorrelated variables, or the principal components, indicate the major patterns or the dominating features of the original dataset. Additionally, PCA enables the (approximate) reconstruction of the full-scale dataset from the selected features (or principal components). In this work, we apply PCA in order to identify the main traffic features from a probe vehicle dataset; then, we find the links that are associated with these features (i.e., critical links); then, we locate loop detectors on those links to collect flow and density data; and finally, we reconstruct the full-scale data, building on the PCA mechanism.

Analyzing network-wide patterns of rail transit delays using Bayesian network learning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102749,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Rail transit delays are generally discussed in terms of on-time performance or problems at individual stops. Such stop-scale approaches ignore the fact that delays are also caused and perpetuated by network-wide factors (e.g., bottlenecks caused by shared tracks by multiple transit lines). The objective of this paper is to develop a network model and metrics that can quantify the delay dependencies between transit network stops, and identify local sources of network-wide issues. For this purpose, Bayesian network learning (at the intersection of machine learning and network science) was utilized. Based on the calculated Bayesian networks (BNs), network metrics (inducer and susceptible) were formulated to quantify the network-wide impacts of the delays experienced at the stops. To implement the proposed framework, the delays at Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) were gathered through a crowdsourced real-time transit information app called onTime. The developed BN model was tested through cross-validation, yielded promising accuracy results, successfully identified the problematic stops based on LIRR reports, and provided further insights on network impacts. The BN model and the developed metrics were further tested using a natural experiment, i.e., a before and after study focusing on a recently completed track expansion project at LIRR. The findings imply that BN learning can successfully identify the network dependencies and indicate the rail links/corridors that are the best candidate for subsequent improvement investments.

Reward design for driver repositioning using multi-agent reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102738,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"A large portion of passenger requests is reportedly unserviced, partially due to vacant for-hire drivers’ cruising behavior during the passenger seeking process. This paper aims to model the multi-driver repositioning task through a mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that captures competition among multiple agents. Because the direct application of MARL to the multi-driver system under a given reward mechanism will likely yield a suboptimal equilibrium due to the selfishness of drivers, this study proposes a reward design scheme with which a more desired equilibrium can be reached. To effectively solve the bilevel optimization problem with upper level as the reward design and the lower level as a multi-agent system, a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is adopted to speed up the learning process. We then apply the bilevel optimization model to two case studies, namely, e-hailing driver repositioning under service charge and multiclass taxi driver repositioning under NYC congestion pricing. In the first case study, the model is validated by the agreement between the derived optimal control from BO and that from an analytical solution. With a simple piecewise linear service charge, the objective of the e-hailing platform can be increased by 8.4 % . In the second case study, an optimal toll charge of $ 5.1 is solved using BO, which improves the objective of city planners by 7.9 % , compared to that without any toll charge. Under this optimal toll charge, the number of taxis in the NYC central business district is decreased, indicating a better traffic condition, without substantially increasing the crowdedness of the subway system.",0968-090X,Not found
Formulation and solution approach for calibrating activity-based travel demand model-system via microsimulation,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102650,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This study addresses the problem of calibrating utility-maximizing nested logit activity-based travel demand model-systems. After estimation, it is common practice to use aggregate measurements to calibrate the estimated model-system’s parameters prior to their application in transportation planning, policy making, and operations. However, calibration of activity-based model-systems has received much less attention. Existing calibration approaches are myopic heuristics in the sense that they do not consider the fundamental inter-dependencies among choice-models and do not have a systematic way to adjust model parameters. Also, other purely simulation-based approaches do not perform well in large-scale applications. In this study, we focus on utility-maximizing nested logit activity-based model-systems and calibrating aggregate statistics such as activity shares, mode shares, time-dependent & mode-specific OD flows, and time-dependent & mode-specific sensor counts. We formulate the calibration problem as a simulation-based optimization problem and propose a stochastic gradient-based solution procedure to solve it. The solution procedure relies on microsimulation to calculate expectations of the aggregate statistics of interest to the calibration problem. Additionally, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the gradient of the objective function —that are evaluated through microsimulation on mini-batches of the population. The proposed solution procedure is sensitive to the fundamental structure of the activity-based model-system and is non-myopic in considering the dependencies across its model components. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, highly nonlinear, and potentially has multiple-minima. Finally, we show —through a real-world application— that the proposed solution procedure outperforms other state-of-the-art purely simulation-based optimization approaches in terms of computational efficiency, stability, and convergence. We also compare various gradient-based solution algorithms to determine the best algorithm to update the parameters.

A spatiotemporal approach for traffic data imputation with complicated missing patterns,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102730,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"With the advent of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), spatiotemporal traffic data has gained growing importance in real-time monitoring, prediction, and control of traffic. However, in practical implementations, data collection devices are often faced with malfunctions caused by various unpredictable disruptions, thereby resulting in the so-called “missing value problems.” In realistic cases, the disruptions to the data collection devices are often associated with some key events (e.g., power cut and natural disasters), in addition, along with other disruptions the missing value problem could be in a complicated manner with both randomly and completely missing patterns. To perform the imputation task with such complicated missing patterns, we propose a hybrid spatiotemporal method which utilizes the time series properties by “prophet” model and captures the spatial residuals information by iterative random forest model. The spatiotemporal method first applies the temporal part to fill the missing value and then adopts the spatial part to acquire the residual component of the missing values. The results of the two components are integrated into the final imputations. Based on the PeMS freeway dataset (PeMS, 2019) and an urban road dataset under extensive artificially designed scenarios like randomly, clustered non-completely and completely missing patterns, we test our proposed approach with some existing techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL), Bayesian tensor decomposition, Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE). The test results indicate that the hybrid method achieves the best imputation quality for most missing patterns, particularly for those with completely or hybrid missing patterns. Furthermore, the hybrid model still performs well under extreme missing rates as high as 0.9, which validates the robustness of the model in extreme situations.",0968-090X,Not found

The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier are utilized for the vehicle detection, while the Kalman Filter is employed for the derivation of vehicle trajectories.

Behavioural intention to use autonomous vehicles: Systematic review and empirical extension,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102732,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This study aims to enrich autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption research and practice by being the first study to systematically review empirical studies on behavioural intention to use AVs, a key element in the adoption process. This review of the extant literature provides a synthesized overview of the current state of knowledge, develops a meta-framework to reconcile past research, identifies inconsistencies in prior results, and suggests areas for future research. To address these future directions, this study empirically extends the proposed meta-framework by testing impactful new variables. Structural equation modelling of survey data from 992 respondents in Hungary shows that drivers of behavioural intention to use AVs significantly differ among users with high and with low personal information technology innovativeness. The behavioural intention of innovative users is influenced by utilitarian and hedonic motivations, whereas laggards are driven by hedonic motivation, and a utilitarian motivation does not play a role. Innovative users' behavioural intention to use AVs is affected by specific technological fears (i.e., data privacy concerns), whereas those lagging are not influenced by specific, only by general concerns (i.e., overall technological anxiety). The study also shows how individual-level behavioural intention to use AVs interacts with expected societal-level outcomes (e.g., equal opportunity for mobility). The results shed light on the need for more research on the role of moderating variables, which are relatively unexplored in the extant literature yet can contribute to a better understanding of the differences in patterns between various groups of future users, offering important managerial implications.",0968-090X,Not found
Impact of aircraft speed heterogeneity on contingent flow control in 4D en-route operation,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102746,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Understanding the impact of aircraft speed heterogeneity on air traffic operation is crucial for airspace design and air traffic flow management. Speed heterogeneity (or aircraft mix) is recognized as a causal factor for complexity in air traffic operations, through qualitative or statistical analysis. Quantitative metrics on how it affects current and future Trajectory-Based Operation (TBO) is lacking, however. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of the impact of speed heterogeneity, by defining air traffic robustness at microscopic (aircraft pair) and macroscopic (air traffic flow) levels in nominal situations, derived mathematically and validated through fast-time computer simulations. A human-in-the-loop study follows investigating six 4D en route operation scenarios, where operators were instructed to resolve a large disturbance in a sector, using a novel interface. Results confirm the negative impact of speed heterogeneity on air traffic controller performance in terms of flow efficiency and workload. The mechanism of such impact is substantiated through analyzing several speed-based robustness metrics. Although the simulated traffic scenarios have similar baseline robustness, those with mixed speeds lead to significantly lower robustness and operational performance. This emphasizes the need to incorporate speed heterogeneity in robustness evaluations of air traffic control in current and future TBO environments.",0968-090X,Not found
Detection and identification of significant events in historical aircraft trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102737,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"A large amount of data is produced every day by stakeholders of the Air Traffic Management (ATM) system, in particular airline operators, airports, and air navigation service providers (ANSP). Most data is kept private for many reasons, including commercial and security concerns. More than data, shared information is precious, as it leverages intelligent decision-making support tools designed to smoothen daily operations. We present a framework to detect, identify and characterise anomalies in past aircraft trajectory data. It is based on an open source of ADS-B based aircraft trajectories, and extracted information can benefit a wide range of stakeholders: Air Traffic Control (ATC) training centres could play more realistic simulations; ANSP may improve capacity indicators; academics improve safety models and risk estimations; and commercial stakeholders, like airlines and airports, may use such information to improve short-term predictions and optimise their operations. The technique is based on autoencoding artificial neural networks applied on flows of trajectories, which provide a useful reading grid associating cluster analysis with quantified level of abnormality. In particular, we find that the highest anomaly scores correspond to poor weather conditions, whereas anomalies with a lower score relate to ATC tactical actions.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-objective routing and scheduling for airport ground movement,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102734,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Recent research on airport ground movement introduced an Active Routing framework to support multi-objective trajectory-based operations. This results in edges in the airport taxiway graph having multiple costs such as taxi time, fuel consumption and emissions. In such a graph, multiple edges exist between two nodes reflecting different trade-offs among the multiple costs. Aircraft will have to choose the most efficient edge from multiple edges in order to traverse from one node to another respecting various operational constraints. In this paper, we introduce a multi-objective routing and scheduling algorithm based on the enumerative approach that can be used to solve such a multi-objective multi-graph problem. Results using the proposed algorithm for a range of international airports are presented. Compared with other routing and scheduling algorithms, the proposed algorithm can find a representative set of optimal or near optimal solutions in a single run when the sequence of aircraft is fixed. In order to accelerate the search, heuristic functions and a preference-based approach are introduced.

Stochastic terminal flight arrival and departure scheduling problem under performance-based navigation environment,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102735,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Flight arrival and departure scheduling (FAADS) problem, one of the critical tasks in terminal air traffic operation, faces new challenges as the terminal air traffic management has transformed to adapt to the performance-based navigation (PBN) environment; beside of that, the terminal system uncertainties which are usually due to the time-varying interference of the convective weather and flight arrival time will also exacerbate the difficulty to realize an efficient terminal air traffic operation. In order to effectively address the above issues, we propose the formulation and solution approach for a stochastic terminal FAADS problem under PBN environment. The proposed FAADS problem formulation combines the flexible 4-dimensional trajectory requirement under PBN environment and the stochastic quantifications both from the convective weather and flight arrival time uncertainties, which can finally make the FAADS results realize the avoidance of the convective weather and immunity of the flight arrival time variations within tolerable risk probabilities. We provide an efficient solution approach to tackle this problem with complex mixed integer and nonlinear programming basics and illustrate the capabilities of the solution approach by a test case on real terminal system in Shanghai Metroplex.

Probability estimation model for the cancellation of container slot booking in long-haul transports of intercontinental liner shipping services,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102731,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The intercontinental liner shipping services transport containers between two continents and they are crucial for the profitability of a global liner shipping company. In the daily operations of an intercontinental liner shipping service, however, container slot bookings from customers can be freely cancelled during a booking period, which causes loss of revenue and low utilization of ship capacity. Though a pain-point of the liner shipping industry, the container slot cancellation problem has not yet been well investigated in the literature. To fill this research gap, this study aims to estimate the probability for the cancellation of container slot booking in the long haul transports of the intercontinental liner shipping service by considering the primary influential factors of cancellation behavior. To achieve the objective, a container slot booking data-driven model is developed by means of a time-to-event modeling technique. To incorporate the effect of booking region on the cancellation probability, we introduce the frailty term in the model to capture the regionality of the container shipping market. Our case study with real slot booking data shows that the developed model performs well in forecasting the loaded containers of the slot booking requests. In addition, we shed light on how the internal factors of slot booking and external factors of shipping market influence the probability of cancellation.",0968-090X,Not found
Deep reinforcement learning algorithm for dynamic pricing of express lanes with multiple access locations,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102715,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This article develops a deep reinforcement learning (Deep-RL) framework for dynamic pricing on managed lanes with multiple access locations and heterogeneity in travelers’ value of time, origin, and destination. This framework relaxes assumptions in the literature by considering multiple origins and destinations, multiple access locations to the managed lane, en route diversion of travelers, partial observability of the sensor readings, and stochastic demand and observations. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and policy gradient methods are used to determine tolls as a function of real-time observations. Tolls are modeled as continuous and stochastic variables and are determined using a feedforward neural network. The method is compared against a feedback control method used for dynamic pricing. We show that Deep-RL is effective in learning toll policies for maximizing revenue, minimizing total system travel time, and other joint weighted objectives, when tested on real-world transportation networks. The Deep-RL toll policies outperform the feedback control heuristic for the revenue maximization objective by generating revenues up to 8.5% higher than the heuristic and for the objective minimizing total system travel time (TSTT) by generating TSTT up to 8.4% lower than the heuristic. We also propose reward shaping methods for the POMDP to overcome the undesired behavior of toll policies, like the jam-and-harvest behavior of revenue-maximizing policies. Additionally, we test transferability of the algorithm trained on one set of inputs for new input distributions and offer recommendations on real-time implementations of Deep-RL algorithms.

Convolutional neural networks with refined loss functions for the real-time crash risk analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102740,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The real-time crash risk analyses were proposed to establish the relationships between crash occurrence probability and pre-crash traffic operational conditions. Given its great application potentials that link with Active Traffic Management System (ATMS) for proactive safety management, it has become an important research area. Currently, researchers mainly developed the real-time crash risk analysis models with traffic flow descriptive statistics employed as explanatory variables and with re-sampled balanced dataset, which hold the limitations of insufficiently capturing the temporal-spatial traffic flow characteristics and failing to provide classification capabilities when deal with the imbalanced datasets. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modelling approach with refined loss functions has been first time introduced to the real-time crash risk analyses. The primary objectives of the proposed CNN models are: (1) utilizing the tensor-based data structure to explore the multi-dimensional, temporal-spatial correlated pre-crash operational features; and (2) optimizing the loss functions to overcome the low classification accuracy issue brought by the imbalanced data. Data from the Shanghai urban expressway system were utilized for the empirical analysis. And a total of three types of loss functions, including traditional binary cross entropy, the α-weighted cross entropy and the focal loss, were introduced and being tested with varying ratios of crash and non-crash datasets. The modeling results show that the CNN model has better classification performance compared to the traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) model with the tensor-based structure data. Besides, the developed CNN model with focal loss function has substantial classification enhancement under the imbalanced datasets.

Train trajectory optimization for improved on-time arrival under parametric uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102680,119,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In this paper we study the problem of computing train trajectories in an uncertain environment in which the values of some system parameters are difficult to determine. Specifically, we consider uncertainty in traction force and train resistance, and their impact on travel time and energy consumption. Our ultimate goal is to be able to control trains such that they will arrive on-time, i.e. within the planned running time, regardless of uncertain factors affecting their dynamic or kinematic performance. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using a novel numerical approach which combines: (i) an off-line approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method to learn the energy and time costs over iterations, and (ii) an on-line search process to determine energy-efficient driving strategies that respect the real-time time windows, more in general expressed as train path envelope constraints. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conducted a numerical study using real-life railway infrastructure and train data. Compared to a set of benchmark driving strategies, the trajectories from our ADP-based method reduce the probability of delayed arrival, and at the same time are able to better use the available running time for energy saving. Our results show that accounting for uncertainty is relevant when computing train trajectories and that our ADP-based method can handle this uncertainty effectively.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperate or not? Exploring drivers’ interactions and response times to a lane-changing request in a connected environment,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102816,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Lane-changing is one of the complex driving tasks that depends on the number of vehicles, objectives, and lanes. A driver often needs to respond to a lane-changing request of a lane-changer, which is a function of their personality traits and the current driving conditions. A connected environment is expected to assist during the lane-changing decision-making process by increasing situational awareness of surrounding traffic through vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Although the majority of lane-changing decision-making components (e.g., gap acceptance behaviour, lane-changing execution behaviour, and drivers’ response to a heavy vehicle) in a traditional environment (an environment without driving aids) has been frequently investigated, our understanding of drivers’ interactions during the lane-changing decision-making process in a connected environment remains elusive due to the novelty of a connected environment and the scarcity of relevant data. As such, this study examines drivers’ responses to lane-changing requests in a connected environment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Seventy-eight participants responded to the lane-changing request of a lane-changer under two randomised driving conditions: baseline (traditional environment without driving aids) and connected environment (with driving aids). A segmentation-based approach is employed to extract drivers’ responses to the lane-changing request and subsequently estimate their response time from trajectory data. Additionally, drivers’ response times are modelled using a random parameter accelerated failure time (AFT) hazard-based duration model. Results reveal that drivers tend to be more cooperative in response to a lane-changing request in the connected environment compared with the baseline condition whereby they tend to accelerate to avoid the lane-changing request. The AFT model suggests that on average drivers’ response times are shorter in the connected environment, implying that drivers respond to the lane-changing request faster in the presence of driving aids. However, at the individual level, connected environment’s impact on drivers’ response times is mixed as drivers’ response times may increase or decrease in the connected environment compared to the baseline condition, for instance, we find that female drivers have lower response times in the connected environment than that of male drivers. Overall, this study finds that drivers in connected environment, on average, take less time to respond and appear to be more cooperative, and thus, are less likely to be engaged in safety–critical events.",0968-090X,Not found
Vehicle path reconstruction using Recursively Ensembled Low-pass filter (RELP) and adaptive tri-cubic kernel smoother,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102847,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Accurate information of path followed by vehicles at several real-life scenarios is essential for modeling and testing the optimal path for autonomous vehicles, analyzing the lateral dynamics such as lane-changing and overtaking, vehicle dynamics at the horizontal curves, intersections, and roundabouts. Recently, the availability of such data is plenty, thanks to the advancements in drone and computer-vision technologies. Nevertheless, extracting useful information from the observed data requires certain pre-processing that can handle the noises added at several stages of the data collection. The adequacy of the existing off-the-shelf smoothing techniques (e.g., Moving average, Savitzky–Golay, Kalman filter) for denoising the trajectory data of the modern era is certainly a question. The motivation for the present study is twofold. Firstly, the challenges of contemporary trajectory data collection and associated error patterns are relatively unknown, and thus an appropriate denoising technique needs to be developed. Secondly, many of the existing smoothing techniques have chosen invariant parameters across all the vehicle paths, even though the error patterns are dissimilar across the vehicles and, in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Thus, an adaptive smoothing needs to be applied for each observed vehicle path and its components. The present study proposes an adaptive, and data-driven path smoothing technique that can be universally applied to the video-based path data obtained from any camera platform (either drone or fixed camera setup). The proposed reconstruction framework works in three-stages; in the first stage, the data is prepared by resampling any missing data. Also, any outlier in the observed path data is identified and removed at this stage. In the second stage, a Recursively Ensembled Low-Pass (RELP) filter is proposed to handle the ’heavily tailed’ noise found in the video-processing based trajectory data, particularly for drone videos. A robust adaptive Gaussian kernel smoothing is applied in the third stage to have a localized reconstruction. For Kernel smoothing, the smoothing parameters such as the optimal bandwidth and polynomial order are estimated using the proposed grid-search algorithm. The parameter estimation process ensures that the bias and variance are perfectly traded-off to achieve a smooth vehicle path. The performance evaluation of the proposed method shows an internally and physically consistent trajectory reconstruction.",0968-090X,Not found
Towards nline prediction of safety-critical landing metrics in aviation using supervised machine learning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102819,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"In recent years, due to the increased availability of data and improvements in computing power, application of machine learning techniques to various aviation safety problems for identifying, isolating, and reducing risk has gained momentum. Data collected from on-board recorders in commercial aircraft contain thousands of parameters in the form of multivariate time-series (continuous, discrete, categorical, etc.) which are used to train the machine learning models. Among the phases of flight, approach and landing phases result in the most accidents and incidents. The performance and trajectory of the aircraft during the approach phase is an indicator of its landing performance which, in turn, affects incident or accident probability such as runway excursions. Landing performance is commonly measured using metrics such as landing airspeed, vertical speed, location of touchdown point on runway, etc. While current applications of machine learning to aviation focus on retrospective insights to implement corrective measures, they offer limited value for real-time risk identification or decision-making as they are inherently reactive in nature. In this work, a novel offline-online framework is developed for building a global predictive model offline to predict landing performance metrics online. The framework leverages flight data from the approach phase between certain approach altitudes (also called gates) in order to train the offline model to predict the landing true airspeed and ground speed using a Random Forest regression algorithm. Permutation importance is used to identify and retain important features among those available and the training data is balanced with respect to flight safety events to ensure a good performing model. The developed global model is robust and can predict landing true airspeed and ground speed with root mean square errors of 2.62 and 2.98 knots respectively over six different airframes operating at over seventy airports. The model operates fast in prediction mode which, coupled with the ability to provide the prediction at an altitude where a go-around decision may be made, makes it particularly suitable for online application. The framework is demonstrated using data obtained from commercial airline operations that contains thousands of flight records and performs better than existing techniques in literature at predicting true airspeed and ground speed at touchdown.",0968-090X,Not found

We advance and analyze models that suggest LNG infrastructure development plans for refueling stations that support pipeline-to-ship and truck-to-ship bunkering, specifying locations, types, and capacities, and that take into account the characteristics of LNG, such as boil-off during storage and loading. We develop an effective primal heuristic, based on Lagrangian relaxation, for the solution of the models.

Max-pressure signal control with cyclical phase structure,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102828,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Max-pressure traffic signal control has many desirable properties. It is analytically proven to maximize network throughput if demand could be served by any signal control. Despite its network-level stability properties, the control itself is decentralized and therefore easily computed by individual intersection controllers. Discussions with city engineers have suggested that a major barrier to implementation in practice is the non-cyclical phase actuation of max-pressure control, which can actuate any phase, in arbitrary order, to serve the queue(s) with highest pressure. This arbitrary phase selection may be confusing to travelers expecting a signal cycle, and is therefore unacceptable to some city traffic engineers. This paper revises the original max-pressure control to include a signal cycle constraint. The max-pressure control must actuate an exogenous set of phases in order, with each phase actuated at least one time step per cycle. Each cycle has a maximum length, but the length can be reduced if desired. Within those constraints, we define a modified max-pressure control and prove its maximum stability property. The revised max-pressure control takes the form of a model predictive control with a one cycle lookahead, but we prove that the optimal solution can be easily found by enumerating over phases. The policy is still decentralized. Numerical results show that as expected, the cyclical max-pressure control performs slightly worse than the original max-pressure control due to the additional constraints, but with the advantage of greater palatability for implementation in practice.",0968-090X,Not found

Commuting, different types of transfer, and other travel behaviors have been identified. Besides, varying travel-activity chains like “Home → Work → Post-work activity (for dining or shopping) → Back home” and the corresponding travel motifs have been distinguished by incorporating the land use information in the GIS data.

Compound generalized extreme value distribution for modeling the effects of monthly and seasonal variation on the extreme travel delays for vulnerability analysis of road network,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102808,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper proposes a new class of extreme value distribution called compound generalized extreme value (CGEV) distribution for investigating the effects of monthly and seasonal variation on extreme travel delays in road networks. Since the frequency and severity of extreme events are highly correlated to the variation in weather conditions as an extrinsic cause of incidents and long delays, monthly and seasonal changes in weather contributes to extreme travel time variability. The change in driving behavior, which itself varies according to road/weather conditions, also contributes to the monthly and seasonal variation in observed extreme travel times. Therefore, it is critical to model the effect of monthly and seasonal changes on observed extreme travel delays on road networks. Based on the empirically revealed linear relationship between mean and standard deviation (SD) of extreme travel delays for both monthly and seasonal levels, two multiplicative error models are formulated. The CGEV distribution is then obtained by linking the two multiplicative error models and forming a compound distribution that characterizes the overall variation in extreme travel delay. The CGEV distribution parameters are calibrated and the underlying assumptions that are used to derive the CGEV distribution are validated using multi-year observed travel time data from the City of Calgary road network. The results indicate that accounting for the seasonality by identifying seasonal specific parameters provides a flexible and not too complex CGEV distribution that is shown to outperform the traditional GEV distribution. Finally, the application of the proposed CGEV distribution is evaluated in the context of road network vulnerability taking into account the observed probability of extreme event occurrences and the link importance. This derived data-driven vulnerability index incorporates a wealth of information related to both network topography in terms of connectivity and the dynamic interaction between travel demand and supply. This new data-driven vulnerability measure can thus be used as a decision support tool to inform decision-makers in prioritizing improvements to critical links to enhance overall network vulnerability, reliability, and resilience.",0968-090X,Not found
Parking infrastructure design for repositioning autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102838,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Fully automated vehicles (AVs) have the potential to drive empty (without a passenger). For privately-owned AVs, such empty repositioning has the potential benefit of avoiding parking costs at their destination. AV owners could have their vehicle drop them off at their destination, then drive elsewhere to park. Although previous studies have considered the congestion effects of AVs repositioning to park at their owner’s residence, this study models the choice of parking location when AVs reposition away from the traveler’s destination. We model this behavior through a modified static traffic assignment with a logit model for destination choice, in which AV passenger-carrying trips can create a second empty repositioning trip to an alternate parking zone. The traffic assignment is formulated as a variational inequality. Numerical results on the Chicago sketch network show the effects of AV market penetration, fuel costs, and parking fees on the number of repositioning trips, as well as the impacts of repositioning trips on network congestion. Next, we study the problem of adjusting zone-specific parking costs to influence the repositioning behavior. In particular, when zones have asymmetric parking infrastructure costs, optimized parking fees combined with empty repositioning can encourage AVs to park at cheaper locations, thus reducing the land used for parking at zones with high land value. This network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program. Since it is bi-level and non-convex, a genetic algorithm is used to find a good solution. Results on the Sioux Falls test network show that the adjusted parking costs are effective at reducing the congestion caused by empty repositioning and encouraging more optimal parking choices for repositioning AVs.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-objective optimization of traffic signals based on vehicle trajectory data at isolated intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102821,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Existing fixed-time traffic signal optimization methods mainly use traffic volumes collected by infrastructure-based detectors (e.g., loop detectors). These infrastructure-based detectors generally have high maintenance costs and low coverage. With the deployment of probe vehicles, vehicle trajectory data provide more information about traffic states and can be utilized for signal timing. However, most related studies assume high penetration rates of probe vehicles or short sampling intervals. This paper develops a hierarchical multi-objective optimization framework to optimize fixed-time traffic signals based on sampled vehicle trajectories at isolated signalized intersections, which is applicable to low-resolution trajectory data. Cycle length and green splits are optimized under both under- and slightly over-saturated traffic conditions. The number of over-saturated phases and average vehicle delays are adopted as the primary and the secondary objectives, respectively. Note that the queues of over-saturated phases cannot be discharged. The queue length and traffic delay of over-saturated phases will go infinite as time goes. The consideration of the over-saturated phase number helps increase vehicle throughput and reduce queue length and traffic delay. The aggregation of sampled trajectory data during the same period across multiple cycles and Same-ratio Principles (SRPs) are proposed to compensate for the limitations of low penetration rates of probe vehicles. The evolution of sampled trajectories with varying signal timings are formulated explicitly. A sampled-trajectory-density method is proposed to identify over-saturated phases. Then a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is formulated and transformed to a series of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models by linearization and enumerating cycle lengths. Simulation studies validate the advantages of the proposed model over the one in Synchro Studio. Sensitivity analysis shows that: (1) the proposed model is applicable to Poisson vehicle arrivals; (2) the proposed model can handle sampling intervals as long as 15 s when sufficient sampled vehicle trajectories are collected; (3) the number of sampled trajectories has impacts on the performance of the proposed model instead of probe vehicle penetration rates, especially with under-saturated traffic; (4) cycle lengths of initial signal timing plans have no noticeable impacts on the required number of sampled trajectories when a short sampling interval is applied; and (5) the proposed model is insensitive to the quality of initial signal timing plans with under- and slightly over-saturated traffic.

Using operational data from the reservation platform of the paratransit services in Toulouse, France, and enriching them with exogenous information, the study derives statistical and deep learning models for medium-term forecast. These models include a seasonal ARIMAX model with rolling forecast, a Random Forest Regressor, a LSTM neural network with exogenous information and a CNN neural network with independent variables. The seasonal ARIMAX model yields the best performance, suggesting that when linear relationships are considered, econometric models and deep learning models do not have significant differences in their performance.

Weather can be considered as one of the most relevant sources of uncertainty. Understanding and managing the impact of these uncertainties is necessary to increase the predictability of the ATM system. State-of-the-art probabilistic forecasts from Ensemble Prediction Systems are employed to characterize uncertainty in the wind and potential convective areas. A robust optimal control methodology to produce efficient and predictable aircraft trajectories in the presence of these uncertainties is presented. Aircraft motion is assumed to be at a constant altitude and variable speed, considering BADA4 as the aircraft performance model. A set of Pareto-optimal trajectories is obtained for different preferences among predictability, convective risk, and average cost index running a thorough parametric study on a North Atlantic crossing use case. Results show that the cost of reducing the arrival time window by 10 s. is between 100 and 200 kg or 3 and 6 min., depending on the cost-index.

Modeling and control of automated vehicle access on dedicated bus rapid transit lanes,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102795,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The establishment of dedicated automated vehicle (AV) lanes has been regarded as an effective approach for addressing heterogeneous traffic with both AVs and regular vehicles (RVs), promoting both traffic efficiency and safety. However, building new dedicated AV lanes in urban areas is not cost effective in the early stage of AV adoption. Fortunately, dedicated bus rapid transit (BRT) lanes can provide a separate right-of-way (ROW) for AVs, which is a practical and economical alternative for promoting AV development. In this paper, we propose an innovative idea of allowing AVs to use dedicated BRT lanes, and quantitatively analyze the stationary performance of mixed-use lanes. Specifically, the analysis is conducted through a cyclic space–time model for AVs on the mixed-use lane, and a sequential optimization method (SOM) is proposed to approximately solve the model. With the SOM providing a valid tool for performance evaluation, we then develop an assignment model for the routing of AVs on a traffic corridor with both mixed-use lane and general-purpose lanes to minimize the total travel time of both AVs and RVs. The model is formulated as a black-box nonlinear program without an explicit analytical form; a successive linear programming (SLP) algorithm with finite difference for gradient approximation is then utilized to solve the nonlinear program. Numerical experiments are conducted in different scenarios, which reveal that the establishment of the mixed-use lane can not only improve the efficiency of AVs but also alleviate the congestion on general-purpose lanes.",0968-090X,Not found
Quasi-real time estimation of turning movement spillover events based on partial connected vehicle data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102824,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Turning movement spillover (TMS) is the result of a turning bay section (TBS) not being able to accommodate all arriving vehicles, so that the turning-vehicle queue spills back and blocks other vehicles turning in different directions. We are not aware of any TMS estimation method that can remedy this situation or support relevant applications in real time. This research proposes a quasi-real time algorithm for estimating TMS, which includes triggering movement as well as duration estimation. The proposed method is based on data for connected vehicles (CVs), including their trajectories and their desired turning directions. In addition, a model that uses partial trajectory data is proposed. For each assumed TMS, a “simplified trajectory” is developed by the construction of a piece-wise linear curve. To minimize any deviation of the simplified trajectory from observation, a TMS estimation can be made. This proposed method is effective and computationally efficient when tested against dynamic demand in two mainstream signal phase settings, with varied sample sizes. Even though data for a higher number of vehicle samples is generally favorable, the proposed model still makes a good estimate when only one trajectory is available.",0968-090X,Not found

To minimize the interference of drones on normal operations in the airports, a collision probability evaluation scheme based on collision-course trajectories modeling is proposed in this work. Firstly, a trajectory planning model of drones intruding restricted airspace is derived based on a given trajectory of the commercial aircraft (CA) and the collision-course scenario of the drone. Subsequently, according to the trajectories of the drone and CA, a probabilistic model based on the stochastic kinematic model is developed to implement the collision risk evaluation. The proposed method is first comparatively demonstrated with the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation and several special cases with known drone’s trajectories. Subsequently, the cases covering different drone’s initial positions, positions updates, and different collision zones are simulated and analyzed using the proposed collision-course based model.

Utilization of battery-electric vehicles in two-car households: Empirical insights from Gothenburg Sweden,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102818,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Two-car households with one conventional and one battery electric vehicle (EV) have an opportunity to partially circumvent the range limitations of a modest-range battery-electric vehicle through flexible use. To investigate the extent to which real-world households utilize this flexibility, we used from 20 two-car households in the Gothenburg area in Sweden, GPS data from before and during an EV trial in which the households were asked to temporarily replace one of their two conventional cars with a short-range EV for the duration of the trial. The actual household electric drive fraction, i.e., the EV distance as a share of the total two-car household driving distance varied between 30 and 70%, with a household mean of 47%. On average, this corresponds to 80% of the estimated potential household electric drive fraction during the trial. We quantify the flexibility in choosing the EV as the difference in distance between the potential, and the minimum needed, EV driving. For below-range (≤120 km) home-to-home non-overlapping trips, the households used 69% of that flexibility. For household trips that did overlap in time, they used 56% of the flexibility. Thus, the EV is the preferred vehicle, but the preference is less obvious for overlapping trips. Our analysis implies an even more dominant role for the EV in weekend driving. Further, although the pre-trial data showed a large difference in the household shares of distances driven between a (later in the EV trial) replaced “first” car and a replaced “second” car, this difference disappears when an EV replaces either one.",0968-090X,Not found
One for all: Decentralized optimization of lateral position of autonomous trucks in a platoon to improve roadway infrastructure sustainability,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102783,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Introduction of autonomous and connected trucks (ACTs) is expected to result in drastic changes in operational characteristics of freight shipments, which may in turn have significant impacts on highway safety, vehicle fuel consumption, and infrastructure durability. One such important change is the formation of truck platoons which can be defined as the convoy of trucks travelling in a very close distance. Reducing congestion, regulating traffic, and improving fuel efficiency are some of reported and expected benefits of platooning. Yet such platooning operations may accelerate the damage accumulation within pavement structures because the lateral position of successive trucks within a lane is expected to be similar (i.e., channelized traffic) and the time between two consecutive axle loads (i.e., resting period) is expected to be reduced. Therefore, this study develops a platooning-control strategy for a fleet of ACTs such that the lateral position of trucks and spacing between them can be explicitly optimized to minimize damage to the pavement. Pavement damage is simulated using recently developed pavement performance models. On the other hand, fluid dynamics models were developed to compute fuel-cost due to aerodynamic drags. Three numerical optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and pattern search algorithm were used to solve the objective function. The proposed control strategy efficiency is demonstrated through a case study; relative costs to agencies and users could be reduced by 9%.",0968-090X,Not found
Combining shockwave analysis and Bayesian Network for traffic parameter estimation at signalized intersections considering queue spillback,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102807,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper focuses on traffic parameters estimation at signalized intersections based on a framework combining shockwave analysis (SA) and Bayesian Network (BN) using vehicle trajectory data. Detailed queuing evolution and spillback across adjacent intersections are considered. According to shockwave analysis, the analytical probability distribution of individual vehicle’s travel time is derived based on different initial conditions. This probability distribution is parameterized by the fundamental diagram (FD) parameters, traffic volume, and cycle state (queue length). A three-layer recursive BN model is then proposed to construct the state evolution process as well as the relationships between traffic volume, cycle state, FD parameters, sampled vehicles’ arrival times and intersection travel times. As traffic volume and initial queue cannot be measured directly from sampled trajectory data, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and particle filtering (PF) are introduced to solve this recursive BN model. By shockwave analysis, such estimated traffic parameters are then used to estimate the maximum queue length and traffic volume of each cycle. The proposed method is evaluated using microscopic traffic simulation data as well as empirical data. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves promising accuracy even under low penetration rates, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the estimation bounded by 15% and generally around 10%.",0968-090X,Not found
On the morning commute problem with distant parking options in the era of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102799,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Due to the confined span of parking location choice for human-driven vehicles (HVs), the spatiotemporal imbalance in parking space utilization has always been a challenging problem in many major cities, leading to a substantial waste of precious land resources. However, in the era of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with parking autonomy, there are more alternative parking options available as AV can park at more distant locations away from the trip maker’s destination. This paper aims to investigate the morning commute problem with consideration of AV commuters’ distant parking choices in a many-to-one network. Parking sharing scheme is explicitly considered, wherein AV travellers can choose to park at city centre at public parking facilities and then lease their own parking space out, park at home, or park at a shared parking space. We first examine how AV commuters in different residential clusters prioritize their parking location choices, as well as their willingness to share the vacant parking space. Then, we investigate the travellers’ trip timing decisions and determine the resultant equilibrium travel pattern. Without other dynamic managing schemes, the model results indicate that appropriate CBD parking supply, together with differentiated parking charges/subsidy, can reduce the total queueing congestion significantly, yet at the cost of higher total travel cost.",0968-090X,Not found
Prediction of rare feature combinations in population synthesis: Application of deep generative modelling,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102787,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Population synthesis is concerned with the generation of agents for agent-based modelling in many fields, such as economics, transportation, ecology and epidemiology. When the number of attributes describing the agents and/or their level of detail becomes large, survey data cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. It leads to a situation where many attribute combinations are missing from the sample data while such combinations exist in the real population. In this case, it becomes essential to consider methods that are able to impute such missing information effectively. In this paper, we propose to use deep generative latent models. These models are able to learn a compressed representation of the data space, which when projected back to the original space, leads to an effective way of imputing information in the observed data space. Specifically, we employ the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for a large-scale population synthesis application. The models are applied to a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more than 60 variables and trained and tested using cross-validation. A new metric that applies to the evaluation of generative models in an unsupervised setting is proposed. It is based on the ability to generate diverse yet valid synthetic attribute combinations by comparing if the models can recover missing combinations (sampling zeros) while keeping truly impossible combinations (structural zeros) models at a minimum. For a low-dimensional experiment, the VAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5%, 21% and 26% more structural zeros per sampling zero when compared to the WGAN. For a high dimensional case, these figures increase to 44%, 2217% and 170440% respectively.

The first portion of the analysis here applies a more traditional approach to identify unique network motifs, with 16 of them capturing 83.05% of the 2017 NHTS-California workday data. Multivariate analysis of grouped motifs data shows different preference of motifs for students, part-time workers, retirees, telecommuters, drivers, women, and younger adults. In the second portion of the analysis, motifs are grouped into categories based on the number of locations a person visits in a day and their correlation with time use and travel is explored. Time use and travel are analyzed based on minute-by-minute time allocation pattern identification using sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering. The correlation between motifs group and sequence analysis finds substantial heterogeneity within the motif groups. The within motif group clusters of activity-based sequences show typical commuting, going to school, and resting patterns.

However, when users interact with the apps, the real potential and also the real challenge for modeling user behavior is that the apps not merely are data collection tools, but also change users’ behaviors.

The multiple flying sidekicks traveling salesman problem with variable drone speeds,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102813,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This research considers unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that may travel at varying speeds in a last-mile delivery system involving a single truck and a fleet of UAVs. In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight; flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to rendezvous with the truck.",0968-090X,Not found
Space-time routing in dedicated automated vehicle zones,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102777,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"With the fast development of automated vehicle (AV) technologies, scholars have proposed various innovative local traffic control schemes for more effective management of AV traffic, especially at intersections. However, due to computational intractability, the investigation of network-level AV control is still at the initial stage. This study proposes a space-time routing framework applicable in dedicated AV zones. To relieve the computational load, we establish a node-based conflict point network to model realistic road networks, and at each conflict point, we record the space-time occupations of AVs in continuous timelines. Then, based on the conflict point network, we develop two space-time routing algorithms for each AV once it enters the dedicated AV zone to minimize its trip travel time while maintaining the non-collision insurances; these two algorithms can trade-off between solution quality and computational load. Furthermore, to enhance the network throughput for handling heavy traffic, we develop a ”platoon strategy” that forces AVs to pass through conflict points in platoons, and we adopt Deep Q-learning (DQN) to optimize the platoon sizes at different spots dynamically. Numerical tests show that both proposed algorithms perform well in that they can execute the routing tasks with very limited computational time, and the average vehicle delay approaches zero when the traffic is relatively mild. Meanwhile, compared with the FCFS policy and the optimization-based approach, the platoon strategy can greatly reduce the average vehicle delay under congested scenarios and give a better balance between the optimality and real-time performance.",0968-090X,Not found
Formalizing the heterogeneity of the vehicle-driver system to reproduce traffic oscillations,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102803,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Road traffic congestion is the result of various phenomena often of random nature and not directly observable with empirical experiments. This makes it difficult to clearly understand the empirically observed traffic instabilities. The vehicles’ acceleration/deceleration patterns are known to trigger instabilities in the traffic flow under congestion. It has been empirically observed that free-flow pockets or voids may arise when there is a difference in the speeds and the spacing between the follower and the leader increases. During these moments, the trajectory is dictated mainly by the characteristics of the vehicle and the behaviour of the driver and not by the interactions with the leader. Voids have been identified as triggers for instabilities in both macro and micro level, which influence traffic externalities such as fuel consumption and emissions. In the literature, such behaviour is usually reproduced by injecting noise to the results of car-following models in order to create fluctuations in the instantaneous vehicles’ acceleration. This paper proposes a novel car-following approach that takes as input the driver and the vehicle characteristics and explicitly reproduces the impact of the vehicle dynamics and the driver’s behaviour by adopting the Microsimulation Free-flow aCceleration (MFC) model. The congested part of the model corresponds to the Lagrangian discretization of the LWR model and guarantees a full consistency at the macroscopic scale with congested waves propagating accordingly to the first-order traffic flow theory. By introducing naturalistic variation in the driving styles (timid and aggressive drivers) and the vehicle characteristics (specification from different vehicle models), the proposed model can reproduce realistic traffic flow oscillations, similar to those observed empirically. An advantage of the proposed model is that it does not require the injection of any noise in the instantaneous vehicle accelerations. The proposed methodology has been tested by studying a) the traffic flow oscillations produced by the model in a one-lane road uphill simulation scenario, b) the ability of the model to reproduce car-following instabilities observed in three car-following trajectory datasets and c) the ability of the model to produce realistic fuel consumption estimates. The results prove the robustness of the proposed model and the ability to describe traffic flow oscillations as a consequence of the combination of driving style and vehicle’s technical specifications.",0968-090X,Not found

Scenarios diverged on the time to appointment and distance between the meeting place and parking lot locations. Participants played a series of 8 or 16 computer games on a Manhattan grid road network with high on-street parking occupancy and a nearby parking lot of unlimited capacity. Players’ parking choices were analyzed with accelerated-failure time (AFT) and multinomial logistic regression models. Results show that drivers are mostly myopic and risk-averse, and quit their on-street parking search long before the optimal moment. Spatially, drivers are attracted by the lot-destination axis, and their turn choices at junctions comply with a second-order biased random walk.

Microsimulation of energy and flow effects from optimal automated driving in mixed traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102806,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper studies the energy and traffic impact of a proposed Anticipative Cruise Controller in a PTV VISSIM microsimulation environment. We dissect our controller into two parts: 1. the unconnected mode, active when following a human-driven vehicle, and 2. the connected mode, active when following another automated vehicle equipped with connectivity. Probabilistic constraints balance safety considerations with inter-vehicle compactness, and vehicle constraints for acceleration capabilities are expressed through the use of powertrain maps. Emergent highway traffic scenarios are then modeled using time headway distributions from empirical traffic data. To study the impact of automation over a range of demands of free-flow to stop-and-go, we vary vehicle flux from low to high and vary automated vehicle penetration from low to high. When examining all-human driving scenarios, network capacity failed to meet demand in high-volume scenarios, such as rush-hour traffic. We further find that with connected automated vehicles introduced, network capacity was improved to support the high-volume scenarios. Finally, we examine energy efficiencies of the fleet for conventional, electric, and hybrid vehicles. We find that automated vehicles perform at a 10%–20% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering conventional powertrains, and find that automated vehicles perform at a 3%–9% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering electric and hybrid powertrains. Due to secondary effects of smoothing traffic flow and reducing unnecessary braking, energy benefits also apply to human-driven vehicles that interact with automated ones.

Estimating latent demand of shared mobility through censored Gaussian Processes,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102775,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Transport demand is highly dependent on supply, especially for shared transport services where availability is often limited. As observed demand cannot be higher than available supply, historical transport data typically represents a biased, or censored, version of the true underlying demand pattern. Without explicitly accounting for this inherent distinction, predictive models of demand would necessarily represent a biased version of true demand, thus less effectively predicting the needs of service users. To counter this problem, we propose a general method for censorship-aware demand modeling, for which we derive a censored likelihood function capable of handling time-varying supply. We apply this method to the task of shared mobility demand prediction by incorporating the censored likelihood within a Gaussian Process model, which can flexibly approximate arbitrary functional forms. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show how taking into account the limiting effect of supply on demand is essential in the process of obtaining an unbiased predictive model of user demand behavior.",0968-090X,Not found

Even with the recent development of battery technologies, a lack of charging stations and range anxiety are still significant concerns, specifically for intercity trips. This calls for more investments in building charging stations and advancing battery technologies to increase the market share of electric vehicles and improve sustainability. This study suggests a configuration for plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure to support long-distance intercity trips of electric vehicles at the network level. A model is proposed to minimize the total system cost including infrastructure investment (building charging stations/spots) and travel time delays (charging time, waiting time in the queue, and detour time to access charging stations). This study fills existing gaps in the literature by capturing realistic patterns of travel demand and considering flow-dependent charging delays at charging stations. Furthermore, the proposed model, which is formulated as a mixed-integer program with nonlinear constraints, solves the optimization problem at the network level. At the network level, impacts of charging station locations on the traffic assignment problem with a mixed fleet of electric and conventional vehicles need to be considered. To this end, a traffic assignment module is integrated with a simulated annealing algorithm. The numerical experiments show a satisfactory application of the model for a full-scale case study (intercity network in Michigan). The solution quality and efficiency of the proposed solution algorithm are evaluated against those of an enumeration approach for a small case study. The results suggest that even for the current market share and charging stations’ setting, a significant investment is needed to support intercity trips without range anxiety issues and with acceptable delays. Furthermore, through sensitivity analyses, the required infrastructure and battery investments to support intercity trips with acceptable delays are established for hypothetical increased market shares and battery size in the future.",0968-090X,Not found

Researchers and policymakers envision that AV deployment will change transportation, development patterns, and other urban systems. Researchers have examined AVs and their potential impacts with two methods: (1) survey-based studies of AV preferences and (2) simulation-based estimation of secondary impacts of varied AV deployment strategies, such as Shared AVs (SAVs) and Privately-owned AVs (PAVs). While the preference survey literature can inform AV simulation studies, preference study results have so far not been integrated into simulation-based research. This lack of integration stems from the absence of data that measure preferences towards PAVs and SAVs at the neighborhood level. Existing preference studies usually investigate adoption likelihood without collecting appropriate information to link preferences to precise locations or neighborhoods.

The assessment shows that viability is strongly influenced by the number of crew members removed from the FVs and the departure intervals of consecutive trains. It concludes that while economically viable cases can indeed be identified, the benefits created by this VT implementation are present but not very large. This is making it questionable if a successful application of the concept can be achieved given the risk and uncertainty surrounding the individual parameters.",0968-090X,Not found
Network-level synchronized pavement repair and work zone policies: Optimal solution and rule-based approximation,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102797,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"In pavement management systems, it is beneficial to consider the economies of scale stemming from the synchronization of repairs conducted on neighboring sections within a single work zone. However, finding the globally optimal solution of the repair and work zone policy for a large-scale pavement network along a long-term planning horizon can be computationally cumbersome. In this study, as a benchmark, we first propose an exact solution algorithm based on dynamic programming. Then we second propose a computationally feasible methodology, a time-invariant simplified rule, to determine desirable (near-optimal) policies. The proposed methodology is applied to two numerical studies: (i) Case 1 for a small-scale road pavement system to compare life cycle costs and computational times between the rule-based methodology and the exact solution algorithm, and (ii) Case 2 for a real-scale road pavement system to discuss the effectiveness of the rule-based methodology. In Case 1, the rule-based methodology derives a near-optimal solution with a significantly shorter computational time than the exact solution algorithm. Case 2 shows that the rule-based methodology can find a superior policy to the aggregation of the optimal solutions independently found for each of decomposed sub-systems in a feasible computational time. Through sensitivity analyses, we find that the repair and work zone policies should vary depending on the deterioration process, cost factors, and weight between agency and user costs for society’s view or available budget for the agency’s perspective.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperative decision-making for mixed traffic: A ramp merging example,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102764,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The rapid conceptual development and commercialization of connected automated vehicle (CAV) has led to the problem of mixed traffic, i.e., traffic mixed with CAVs and conventional human-operated vehicles (HVs). The paper studies cooperative decision-making for mixed traffic (CDMMT). Using discrete optimization, a CDMMT mechanism is developed to facilitate ramp merging, and to properly capture the cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors in mixed traffic. The CDMMT mechanism can be described as a bi-level optimization program in which state-constrained optimal control-based trajectory design problems are imbedded in a sequencing problem. A bi-level dynamic programming-based solution approach is developed to efficiently solve the problem. The proposed modeling mechanism and solution approach are generic to deterministic decisions and can guarantee system-efficient solutions. A micro-simulation environment is built for model validation and analysis of mixed traffic. The results show that compared to the scenario with 100% HVs, ramp-merging can be smoother in mixed traffic environment. At high CAV penetration, the section throughput increases about 18%. With the proposed CDMMT mechanism, traffic throughput can be further increased by 10–15%. The proposed methods form the basis of traffic analysis and cooperative control at ramp-merging sections under mixed traffic environment.",0968-090X,Not found
A stepwise interpretable machine learning framework using linear regression (LR) and long short-term memory (LSTM): City-wide demand-side prediction of yellow taxi and for-hire vehicle (FHV) service,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102786,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"As app-based ride-hailing services have been widely adopted within existing traditional taxi markets, researchers have been devoted to understand the important factors that influence the demand of the new mobility. Econometric models (EMs) are mainly utilized to interpret the significant factors of the demand, and deep neural networks (DNNs) have been recently used to improve the forecasting performance by capturing complex patterns in the large datasets. However, to mitigate possible (induced) traffic congestion and balance utilization rates for the current taxi drivers, an effective strategy of proactively managing a quota system for both emerging services and regular taxis is still critically needed. This paper aims to systematically design an explainable deep learning model capable of assessing the quota system balancing the demand volumes between two modes. A two-stage interpretable machine learning modeling framework was developed by a linear regression (LR) model, coupled with a neural network layered by long short-term memory (LSTM). The first stage investigates the correlation between the existing taxis and on-demand ride-hailing services while controlling for other explanatory variables. The second stage fulfills the long short-term memory (LSTM) network structure, capturing the residuals from the first estimation stage in order to enhance the forecasting performance. The proposed stepwise modeling approach (LR-LSTM) forecasts the demand of taxi rides, and it is implemented in the application of pick-up demand prediction using New York City (NYC) taxi data. The experiment result indicates that the integrated model can capture the inter-relationships between existing taxis and ride-hailing services as well as identify the influence of additional factors, namely, the day of the week, weather, and holidays. Overall, this modeling approach can be applied to construct an effective active demand management (ADM) for the short-term period as well as a quota control strategy between on-demand ride-hailing services and traditional taxis.",0968-090X,Not found
A bi-level cooperative driving strategy allowing lane changes,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102773,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper studies the cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at conflict areas (e.g., non-signalized intersections and ramping regions). Due to safety concerns, most existing studies prohibit lane change since this may cause lateral collisions when coordination is not appropriately performed. However, in many traffic scenarios (e.g., work zones), vehicles must change lanes. To solve this problem, we categorize the potential collision into two kinds and thus establish a bi-level planning problem. The right-of-way of vehicles for the critical conflict zone is considered in the upper-level, and the right-of-way of vehicles during lane changes is then resolved in the lower-level. The solutions of the upper-level problem are represented in tree space, and a near-optimal solution is searched for by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with some heuristic rules within a very short planning time. The proposed strategy is suitable for not only the shortest delay objective but also other objectives (e.g., energy-saving).

An analytical optimization approach to the joint trajectory and signal optimization problem for connected automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102759,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Traffic conflict points (e.g., intersections, work-zones) cause travel delay, stop-and-go traffic, and excessive energy consumption. Efforts have been taken to improve traffic conflict point performance via trajectory control of connected automated vehicles (CAV) as the CAV technology emerges. One major challenge to these efforts is the complexity in optimization of CAV trajectories, particularly with joint signal timing optimization. This challenge poses barriers to real-time application requirements, scaling them up to address network level problems and drawing analytical insights into problem structures. To overcome this challenge, this paper aims to seek for an efficient and analytical solution to a joint vehicle trajectory and signal timing optimization problem. This problem simultaneously optimizes CAV trajectories and signal timing to minimize travel delay and energy consumption at a conflicting point with two traffic approaches. This study modifies the original complex formulation in two ways. First, the vehicle trajectory shape is simplified into a piece-wise quadratic function with no more than five segments. Second, instead of using the highly non-linear instantaneous fuel consumption function, a simplified macroscopic measure is proposed to approximate fuel consumption as an analytical quadratic function of signal red interval. These simplifications provide elegant theoretical properties that enable solving an analytical exact solution to this complex problem with parsimonious analytical insights. Numerical examples reveal that the proposed model can significantly reduce travel delay and fuel consumption. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the presented algorithm is highly efficient and appropriate for real-world traffic applications.",0968-090X,Not found

Dynamic game-based approach for optimizing merging vehicle trajectories using time-expanded decision diagram,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102766,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Connected and automated technologies for vehicles pave the way for major changes in traffic control methodology. A decentralized control system based on a communication network using vehicle-to-vehicle communications and each vehicle’s on-board controller will be one of the predominant approaches to vehicle trajectory optimization when the deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has advanced, because of its scalability and fault resistance compared to the centralized system. In this study, we propose a dynamic game-based vehicle trajectory optimization approach that can be utilized in a decentralized control system based on CAV technologies for merging segments, which is one of the bottlenecks of highways. Since the decentralized system is constructed by equal individual vehicles that decide their own optimal control in conflicting situations, we introduce a game-theory-based approach for obtaining a satisfactory result for those vehicles. Further, for achieving the optimal result at the end of the target segment, we employ a dynamic game to design the whole interrelated time-series trajectories of competing pairs of vehicles. To tackle the curse of dimensionality, we use an efficient method to enumerate the sets of combinations – a zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD) – and propose an algorithm that uses this ZDD to solve the dynamic game. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via numerical experiments, and is compared to a static game-based model and an individual dynamic decision model. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach—it induces efficiently adjusted behaviors of competing vehicles and enables merging success, especially in a situation where the initial gaps between vehicles are not enough for immediate lane change, which is achieved by the combined effect of the game-theoretic approach and the dynamic decision approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Enhanced intelligent driver model for two-dimensional motion planning in mixed traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102780,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This study aims to model two-dimensional (lateral and longitudinal) motion of an Ego Vehicle (EV). Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is enhanced for this purpose. All the surrounding obstacles (vehicles and road boundaries) are considered as stimuli that elicit driver’s reactions (lateral and longitudinal accelerations). A Virtual LiDAR sensor on the EV perceives the surrounding. Proximity and speed are used to compute longitudinal and lateral components of average relative velocity. A new formulation is presented to compute the effective gap considering all the surrounding obstacles. It is composed of four components: front, rear, left, and right. The former two affect longitudinal acceleration, while the latter two influence lateral acceleration of the EV. A discretionary lane-change model is also developed to account for the driver’s deliberate (not just mandatory) lateral movements. A total of 13 model parameters are used, of which eight are newly introduced. These model parameters are calibrated using 1050 human-driven car trajectories from Next Generation SIMulation dataset. Taguchi’s fractional factorial design principle is used to optimize the parameters. Gray relational analysis indicated that the three newly introduced parameters to be the three most influential parameters. Validation using another 450 car trajectories resulted in a mean radial error of 3.97 m over a horizon of 10 s.

Investigating private parking space owners’ propensity to engage in shared parking schemes under conditions of uncertainty using a hybrid random-parameter logit-cumulative prospect theoretic model,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102776,120,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Shared parking allows the effective use of undersupplied parking spaces and contributes to the alleviation of urban parking problems, traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and other negative externalities of traffic. However, little is known about the acceptance of shared parking by consumers of a different socio-demographic profile. To understand the feasibility and potential success of shared parking, this paper develops a stated choice experiment with three choice options: fixed mode shared parking, flexible mode shared parking and not interested, to investigate parking space owners’ propensity to engage in shared parking under varying conditions. Because the demand for shared parking is uncertain, the revenues owners may generate are uncertain. As one of the most popular theories of decision making under uncertainty, the cumulative prospect theory is incorporated into a multinomial logit model to capture the decision problem in which some variables are uncertain and others are not. The revenue that owners expect shared parking can bring is used as the reference point to differentiate between gains and losses. Gains refer to outcomes that exceed the reference point, while losses refer to outcomes that fall short. To examine unobserved heterogeneity, a random parameter version of the model is specified to estimate the distribution of decision weights across the sample. Results show that socio-demographic characteristics, context variables, revenues and psychological concerns are all important factors in explaining parking space owners’ propensity to engage in platform-based shared parking schemes. Incorporating unobserved heterogeneous improves the overall goodness-of-fit of the model. Understanding parking space owners’ propensity to share their parking spaces in relation to their psychological concerns and uncertain conditions is critical to improve shared parking policies.

This method specifically focuses on one-way line transit corridors with curbside stops and high frequency buses. In such public transit corridors, holding buses at stops may not be suitable for implementation. Instead of holding, we choose to control bus cruising speeds between stops. The relationship between holding and speed-control is discussed. A conventional holding model M 0 as well as a model M 1 , that determines travel times between stops, are considered. In order to make control decisions easy to understand as well as to follow, an improved speed-control model M 2 is also proposed. All the models allow for control decisions based on the real-time state of the entire system. The three models are programmed in a rolling horizon scheme within a simulation system. Simulation experiments are conducted to examine these models in different scenarios associated with different levels of traffic randomness. The corresponding results show that, when the traffic is highly variable, the speed-control method can reduce average passenger waiting time by more than 23 % while the holding method results in an average passenger waiting time that is almost 2 min longer than when using the speed-control method. So the speed-control model is shown to be more suitable for implementation in practice. Four strategies that can generate more driver-friendly control decisions are further proposed and tested. The practical applications of the proposed speed-control models are discussed.",0968-090X,Not found

An optimal control problem has been formulated and solved in order to generate a set of candidate CDO trajectories per aircraft, while a mixed-integer-linear programming model has been built in order to optimally assign routes of the arrival procedure and required times of arrival (RTAs) to the arriving traffic when still in cruise. The assessment has been performed for Frankfurt am Main airport (Germany), by using arrival traffic gathered from historical data. Results show that, after assigning an RTA and a route to every arriving aircraft, it is possible to maximize the number of aircraft performing CDOs while ensuring a safe time separation throughout the arrival procedure. For low traffic scenarios, the totality of traffic can be successfully scheduled, while for high traffic scenarios this is not the case and not all aircraft can be scheduled if neutral CDOs are flown. However, by assuming different arbitrarily defined arrival times to the TMA or by considering more additional shortcuts in the trombone procedure it is possible to increase the number of aircraft scheduled.

It can be divided in two parts, a digraph-based representation for hybrid urban traffic network and a Dirgraph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCN)-based learning model. At first, the representation incorporates the fundamental traffic variables with the correlation of different traffic flows, and partially decouples the global network topology from local traffic information. And then, to proceed with digraph-based samples, a new type of graph feature extraction method is introduced and the graph Fourier transform is defined accordingly. This distinguishes the proposed model from the conventional graph convolutional networks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted based on real traffic data.

Decentralized control of connected automated vehicle trajectories in mixed traffic at an isolated signalized intersection,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102846,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"It is concerned that system-level benefits of connected automated vehicle control might only prevail in a far-future centralized control environment, whereas the benefits could be much offset in a near-future decentralized control system. To address this concern, this paper proposes a decentralized control model for connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at an isolated signalized intersection with a single-lane road where each connected automated vehicle aims to minimize its own travel time, fuel consumption and safety risks. To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and over-saturated traffic (less than 3% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.",0968-090X,Not found

This paper considers the joint routing, battery charging, and pricing problem faced by a profit-maximizing transportation service provider that operates a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles. We first establish the static planning problem by considering time-invariant system parameters and determine the optimal static policy. While the static policy provides stability of customer queues waiting for rides even if consider the system dynamics, we see that it is inefficient to utilize a static policy as it can lead to long wait times for customers and low profits. To accommodate for the stochastic nature of trip demands, renewable energy availability, and electricity prices and to further optimally manage the autonomous fleet given the need to generate integer allocations, a real-time policy is required. The optimal real-time policy that executes actions based on full state information of the system is the solution of a complex dynamic program. However, we argue that it is intractable to exactly solve for the optimal policy using exact dynamic programming methods and therefore apply deep reinforcement learning to develop a near-optimal control policy.

Modeling and optimizing bus transit priority along an arterial: A moving bottleneck approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102873,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Bus operations on arterials are often hindered by traffic signals and car queues. Transit signal priority (TSP) strategies can be used to improve bus operations on arterials. Analytically quantifying the impacts of TSP in mixed traffic, where cars and buses share lanes, is challenging since car queues can slow down buses, while slow-moving buses can create bottlenecks for cars. Furthermore, computational costs increase significantly when considering an arterial with multiple intersections. To tackle these challenges, this paper first develops a dynamic programming framework to model and evaluate TSP along an arterial. Next, the algorithm is utilized to determine the changes to car and bus delays as a result of TSP implementation along an arterial, and the sensitivity of the algorithm to the signal timing plan, bus stop locations and dwell durations, and the bus headway is evaluated. Next, a bi-level optimization framework is proposed to determine the optimal location of TSP implementation along arterials. Finally, the results of integrating TSP with dedicated bus lanes is evaluated. The results suggest that the benefits of TSP largely depend on the signal setting, and bus stop location, and that as the bus headway decreases, the marginal benefit of providing TSP also decreases. Additionally, the results suggest that the specific intersection at which TSP is implemented can play a large role on its operational impacts.

Comparing the usefulness of real-time driving aids in a connected environment during mandatory and discretionary lane-changing manoeuvres,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102871,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Lane-changing manoeuvre is one of the risky manoeuvres performed by drivers either to reach the planned destination (i.e., mandatory lane-changing; MLC) or to achieve better driving conditions (i.e., discretionary lane-changing; DLC). Essentially both lane-changing types require the driver to acquire surrounding traffic information for efficient and safe lane-changing decisions. However, this does not discount the fact that both these lane-changings are fundamentally different from each other as the urgency of lane-changing is much higher during MLC compared to DLC. Real-time driving aids in a connected environment promise to assist during the lane-changing decision-making process, but the differential effectiveness (or usefulness) of real-time driving aids in a connected environment for these two lane-changing types remains unexplored due to the novelty of a connected environment and the consequent scarcity of data. To fill this research gap, this study collected lane-changing data from 78 participants who performed MLC and DLC in the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Participants were asked to drive in three randomised driving conditions: baseline condition (without driving aids), real-time driving aids in a connected environment with perfect communication, and delayed driving aids in a connected environment. While surrogate measures of safety are analysed and compared using descriptive statistics, a hybrid framework of data mining and classical statistical modelling is employed to examine the usefulness of the real-time driving aids in a connected environment for two lane-changing types. We find that the crash risk associated with MLC is significantly reduced in the driving conditions providing driving aids compared to that of DLC. Results also reveal that the probability of engaging in a hard-braking event decreases for both the lane-changing types in the presence of real-time driving aids in the connected environment driving conditions, but a higher decrease in magnitude is found for MLC. Age and gender-related differential impact have been observed where young and male drivers have a higher possibility of engaging in a hard-braking event when driving without driving aids, but the presence of real-time driving aids reduces such risk. This study concludes that the usefulness (or effectiveness) of the real-time driving aids in a connected environment is a function of the urgency of a task, which is evidently higher during MLC, thus providing the maximum advantage during MLC.",0968-090X,Not found
Semi-supervised route choice modeling with sparse Automatic vehicle identification data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102857,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Massive and passive Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) data provides samples of whereabouts and movements of vehicles, which is a potential source of information for route choice behavior modeling. However, the AVI observations are too sparse to infer the specific chosen route and OD pair, which discourages its application on route choice model estimation. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a semi-supervised learning method that can train the route choice model with sparse AVI observations. First of all, the likelihood function in Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure was derived by decomposing the AVI trace into observation pairs. Combined with high-resolution GPS observations, the measurement equation and OD inference model were then defined to deal with the sparsity problem of AVI observations. At the same time, the Mixed Logit model was introduced to capture the correlation and heterogeneity across the choice behavior between different observation pairs. Finally, the relationship between route choice model and the likelihood function was established and the unknown parameters in route choice model can be estimated by seeking a maximum to the log-likelihood function. Empirical studies were conducted with field-testing data in this paper. The estimated results show that the proposed semi-supervised method improved the identification accuracy of route choice model significantly without sacrificing interpretability. The evaluation of the computational efficiency presented the potential of the semi-supervised method to learn route choice behavior for a large-size sample set.

A two-level probabilistic approach for validation of stochastic traffic simulations: impact of drivers’ heterogeneity models,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102843,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"This paper shows how traffic heterogeneity, and the way it is encoded into a model, drastically affects a model ability to reproduce observed traffic. Being heterogeneity a major source of uncertainty, to correctly frame the proposed validation methodology we have first reviewed and adapted cross-disciplinary theoretical concepts about uncertainty modelling to traffic simulation. A number of open issues, including error compensation and model overfitting, has been interpreted and clarified through the proposed framework. A two-level probabilistic approach has been applied to run stochastic simulations of three NGSIM I-80 traffic scenarios, and quantitatively infer the impact of heterogeneity. According to this approach, both the car-following and the lane-changing models of each vehicle have been calibrated against observed trajectories. Based on the estimated parameters distributions, different models of heterogeneity have been quantitatively validated against macroscopic traffic patterns. Being traffic a collective phenomenon emerging from microscopic interactions, even models calibrated on microscopic trajectories need to be quantitatively validated on macroscopic traffic patterns too. Among other results, normal distributions of the model parameters, which are customarily applied in traffic simulation practice, have been found unable to reproduce the observed congestion patterns. Parameters correlation, being claimed as highly influential in previous works, is responsible for a model overfitting in traffic scenarios with low congestion. In the end, it has been demonstrated that a thorough characterization of parameters heterogeneity cannot be left out in traffic simulation, if an ersatz representation of traffic is to be avoided.",0968-090X,Not found
Propensity toward ride-sourcing: Desired savings in travel time and mobility cost to switch from private mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102883,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"This paper presents a study in examining the desired savings in travel time per trip and travel cost per month that would motivate people to switch to ride-sourcing options. Simultaneous regression models with latent constructs were employed to estimate the expected time and cost savings. The presence of latent constructs accounts for the endogeneity in personal attitudes while the simultaneity allows the analyst to evaluate the potential correlation between the two decisions. Various socioeconomic and demographic variables and personal attitudes were explored in the model to investigate their potential influence on the willingness to adopt ride-sourcing. Analysis based on the survey data indicated an average desired time saving of 20 min per trip, and an average desired cost saving of $116 per month to switch to on-demand services. Accordingly, individuals younger than 25 years old, between 55 and 59, those with lower education levels, Asians, low income individuals, people with previous ride-sourcing experience, and those who did not favor private car ownership showed lower expectations in view of both travel time and travel cost savings and therefore, were more willing to adopt on-demand services. On the contrary, people aged 30–39 years old (older Millennials), highly auto-dependent individuals, self-employed, people who hardly trust strangers, and those who value private ownership advantages such as privacy and convenience would demand higher savings to convince them to adopt ride-sourcing. This study provides an approach to evaluating the propensity of ride-sourcing usage in view of the desired travel time and cost savings. A better understanding on the magnitude of time and cost savings needed to motivate the public to switch to ride-sourcing options would provide policy makers with valuable information in designing effective and efficient policies and strategies in promoting shared mobility options.",0968-090X,Not found
A generalized diffusion model for preference and response time: Application to ordering mobility-on-demand services,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102854,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The goal of this research study is to model user preferences and response times (RTs) jointly in the context of Mobility-on-Demand (MOD) services under different MOD operator pricing schemes, information frames, and pressure levels. MOD operators’ information provision, delay, and vehicle allocation strategies influence users’ preferences and RTs, which, in turn, affect which operational and information provision strategies are optimal for MOD operators. Evidence shows that preferences and RTs are sensitive to precedent decisions, information frames, risk, and time pressure. These dynamic interplaying factors are challenging to capture using a traditional discrete choice modeling framework. Hence, this study proposes a generalized diffusion model based on Decision Field Theory (DFT), multi-attribute Prospect Theory (PT), and Random Utility Theory to model these various interplaying factors. This study applies the proposed modeling approach in the context of ordering Shared-use Automated Vehicle Mobility Services (SAMS). Sensitivity analyses explore the impacts of various inputs and model parameters such as initial waiting time estimate, updated waiting time estimate, time pressure, loss aversion, and value-of-time on preferences and RTs. The proposed model can provide value to MOD operators in terms of information provision and pricing strategies. Moreover, the proposed model can assist policymakers and planners interested in the system impacts of MOD services and regulating MOD information provision and pricing strategies. The modeling framework can extend to other applications where multiple sub-decisions are necessary to make a single (travel) choice under information update, framing, risk, and time pressure.",0968-090X,Not found
An eco-friendly aircraft taxiing approach with collision and conflict avoidance,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102872,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Among several crucial objectives of the air transportation system, minimization of fuel consumption has a profound impact on the economic viability of airline companies and their effect on the environment. Given that many large airports around the world are located in the heart of residential areas such as Chicago’s O’Hare, New York’s JFK, and Montreal’s Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE) released by aircraft flying through such urban airports directly impacts the health of nearby residents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid taxiing solution to reduce the airports’ impact on GGE where part of the taxiing operations is handled by tow-trucks powered by renewable energy while some other aircraft continue using their engines to complete taxiing. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the inclusion of collision of conflict avoidance in the formulation of taxiing operations planning with an objective to minimize fuel consumption and to maximize the desired service quality. The conflict-free taxing operations planning model is tested on Montreal’s Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport.

Energy-efficient train control using nonlinear bounded regenerative braking,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102852,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Energy-efficient train control (EETC) has been studied a lot over the last decades, because it contributes to cost savings and reduction of CO2 emissions. The aim of EETC is to minimize total traction energy consumption of a train run given the running time in the timetable. Most research is focused to apply mechanical braking on this problem. However, current trains are able to use regenerative braking, which leads to another optimal driving strategy compared to mechanical braking. Research on EETC with a realistic nonlinear bounded model for regenerative braking or a combination between regenerative and mechanical braking is limited. The aim of this paper is to compare the difference between the EETC with regenerative and/or mechanical braking. First, we derive the optimal control structure for the problems with different braking combinations. Second, we apply the pseudospectral method on different scenarios where we investigate the effect of varying speed limits and gradients on the different driving strategies. Results indicate that compared to pure mechanical braking, combined regenerative and mechanical braking leads to a driving strategy with higher energy savings, a lower optimal cruising speed, a shorter coasting phase and a higher speed at the beginning of the braking phase. In addition, a nonlinear bounded regenerative braking curve leads to a different driving strategy compared to a constant braking rate that is commonly used in literature. We show that regenerative braking at a constant braking rate overestimates the total energy savings.",0968-090X,Not found
Simultaneously re-optimizing timetables and platform schedules under planned track maintenance for a high-speed railway network,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102823,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Train timetabling and train platforming are problems of crucial importance when scheduling high-speed trains. Often, these problems are solved separately and in sequence. It is also not uncommon for the problems to be further decomposed by direction since the use of tracks is usually direction specific in a high-speed network. In this paper, we consider the optimization problem of integrating re-timetabling and re-routing decisions within station areas for multiple stations when scheduled maintenance renders the existing, optimized schedules infeasible. We model the underlying problems using a space–time network on a mesoscopic level and propose a 0–1 binary integer programming model that can simultaneously modify the timings and routes of trains from different directions. Two different solution approaches are described. The first is a commonly used Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) approach, while the second utilizes the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) concept. For both methods, a time-dependent dynamic programming approach is used to solve the resulting subproblems. A comparison of the two approaches on instances provided by the Chinese high-speed railway indicates that the ADMM-based approach provides tighter upper bounds and typically requires fewer iterations than the Lagrangian Relaxation approach. Furthermore, the results show that a flexible track utilization policy provides better timetables, with fewer cancellations and less total delay, than a fixed, dedicated direction, track policy.",0968-090X,Not found
Model formulation and calibration procedure for integrated multi-modal activity routing and network assignment models,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102853,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"In this paper, a novel transport planning model system (TPMS) is formulated built on the concepts of network, multi-modality, integrity and instant calibration. In the proposed formulation, activity-travel pattern (ATP) choice elements including the choices of activity, activity sequence, mode, departure time, and parking location, are all unified into a time-dependent ATPs generator. The proposed model accounts for the dynamicity of the network, including time-of-day and congestion effects in a joint structure for transport supply and demand. Moreover, the proposed TPMS explicitly formulates an operating capacitated public transport system. To allow visiting locations multiple times and to alleviate the complexity of the proposed model, a novel multi-visit vehicle routing problem is proposed which does not enumerate the node and link visits. In order to calibrate the model based on the major travel attributes of the travel survey data, a set of splitting ratios are introduced to distribute trips on the network. The model uses the splitting ratios to integrate the ATPs generator and the traffic assignment (TA) model in a unified TPMS structure. The effectiveness of the proposed structure is demonstrated through numerical examples provided.",0968-090X,Not found
A compact and scalable representation of network traffic dynamics using shapes and its applications,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102850,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The biggest challenge of analysing network traffic dynamics of large-scale networks is its complexity and pattern interpretability. In this work, we present a new computationally efficient method, inspired by human vision, to reduce the dimensions of a large-scale network and describe the traffic conditions with a compact, scalable and interpretable custom feature vector. This is done by extracting pockets of congestion that encompass connected 3D subnetworks as 3D shapes. We then parameterize these 3D shapes as 2D projections and construct parsimonious feature vectors from these projections. There are various applications of these feature vectors such as revealing the day-to-day regularity of the congestion patterns and building a classification model that allows us to predict travel time from any origin to any destination in the network. We demonstrate that our method achieves a 44% accuracy improvement when compared against the consensus method for travel prediction of an urban network of Amsterdam. Our method also outperforms historical average methods, especially for days with severe congestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of the approach by applying the method on the entire Dutch highway network and show that the feature vector was able to encapsulate the network dynamics with a 93% prediction accuracy. There are many paths to further refine and improve the method. The compact form of the feature vector allows us to efficiently enrich it with more information such as context, weather and event without increasing the computational complexity.",0968-090X,Not found
Prediction of lane change by echo state networks,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102841,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Lane change prediction can reduce traffic accidents and improve traffic flow. To predict lane changes variables which describe lane changes are needed. Recent studies used different classifiers and different inputs for lane change classification and prediction. Here, different methods are used to extract the relevant input variables from a data set which was generated from a naturalistic driving study in the urban area of Chemnitz, Germany. First variables which show different characteristics for left and no lane changes were chosen. The variables contained driver attributes (for instance gazes), environment attributes (for instance distance to other vehicles) and vehicle attributes (for instance velocity). Second, different combinations of these input variables were analyzed with the principal component analysis. In the end, the best combinations were used to classify left lane changes with an Echo State Network and a feedforward neural network. The Echo State Network achieved high area under the curve values, true positive rates and low false positive rates for the classification with a majority of the input combinations.

Online operations of automated electric taxi fleets: An advisor-student reinforcement learning framework,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102844,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Automation and electrification are inevitable trends in the development of intelligent vehicles.

To tackle the operational challenges caused by the high spatiotemporal heterogeneity of customer demands entails novel online strategy to intelligently manage AET fleet. This study proposes an advisor-student reinforcement learning framework to solve the online operations problem of AET fleet through which the taxis are intelligently assigned to serve demands, dispatched to zones with excessive future demands, and forced to get refueled at charging stations.

Network-wide traffic flow estimation with insufficient volume detection and crowdsourcing data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102870,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"With the rapid development of urbanization and modernization, it is increasingly crucial to sense network-wide traffic. Network-wide traffic volume information is of great benefit for traffic planning, government management and vehicle emissions control. However, it is difficult to install detectors on every intersection due to the expensive deployment and maintenance costs, and the insufficient sensor coverage across the network limits the direct availability of network-wide traffic flow information. Whereas, crowdsourcing floating car data with a high coverage rate are currently available, which creates an opportunity to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to estimate network-wide traffic flow, which incorporates flow records and crowdsourcing floating car data into a geometric matrix completion model. Furthermore, a spatial smoothing index based on the divergence is developed to measure the difficulty of volume estimation for each road segment. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

A generic simulation platform for cooperative adaptive cruise control under partially connected and automated environment,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102874,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) has been regarded as the most promising technology that can be carried out in field earliest under partially connected and automated environment, and is one of the few Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) applications closest to its final shape. Therefore, validation of CACC running in real traffic is in urgent need. To support the validation, simulation plays a key role. This paper proposes a next-generation simulation platform for CACC evaluation and validation. It is able to not only validate the performance of a CACC platoon by itself, but also evaluate its performance when being released into the traffic. In addition, it can also quantify the impact of CACC vehicles on transportation systems. The proposed platform is generic in terms of CACC control system, background traffic condition, road geometry, and traffic control scheme. Furthermore, it is capable of capturing the dynamics of platoon formation and disengagement when CACC equipped vehicles are mixed up with human-driven vehicles. The proposed platform is validated by comparing against actual field data and previously published theoretical studies. The results confirm the credibility of the proposed platform in terms of: i) CACC control system embedded; ii) CAV and Human-driven Vehicle (HV) mixed traffic simulation; iii) managed lane simulation. It is also revealed that current CACC technology without upgrade may be a safety hazard and permitting CACC only on a dedicated CACC lane might be a good first step for CACC commercialization at this moment.",0968-090X,Not found

On the other hand, this paper considers the energy efficiency, i.e., reducing the total energy consumption during operations by selecting appropriate speed profiles and maximizing the utilization of regenerative braking energy. A related mathematical optimization model is formulated with the objective of maximizing the robustness and minimizing the total energy consumption.

Stop detection for smartphone-based travel surveys using geo-spatial context and artificial neural networks,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102834,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The problem of stop detection is at the base of many current and upcoming smartphone-based travel survey technologies and directly impacts the quality of many downstream operations. The inference of departure/arrival time, mode, and purpose of a trip, for example, rely on the stop/motion patterns represented by smartphone sensor-data. As users handle smartphones for various purposes and their preferences determine different device positions while traveling, accelerometer and gyroscope, for instance, often present ambiguities that prevent accurate stop detection. To mitigate the impact of these ambiguities, we combine spatial time-series, i.e. GPS, with spatial context information retrieved from Open Street Map, which we represent as multi-dimension tensors. This project explores simple representations, such as dummy variables, and novel multidimensional representations, which are bench-marked through the classification performance of specialized artificial neural network (ANN), as well as other machine learning (ML) baselines.

Up to now, single variable optimization methods resort to rule-based control logics to equalize the inter-departure headways or adhere to the target headway values. One of them is the two-headway-based control logic which determines the holding time of a bus based on its headway with its preceding and following bus without addressing other implications, such as overcrowding. To rectify this, we introduce a new model for the single variable bus holding problem that considers the passenger demand and vehicle capacity limits. Then, we reformulate this problem to an easier-to-solve program with the use of slack variables and introduce an analytic solution that can determine the holding time of a vehicle at the respective bus stop. Our analytic solution does not add a computational burden to the two-headway-based control logic and can be applied in real time.

Dynamic predictive models for ridesourcing services in New York City using daily compositional data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102833,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"In recent years, there has been a tremendous change in the landscape of mobility offerings with the introduction with the introduction of Uber and Lyft, companies collectively known as Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), otherwise known as ridesourcing companies. Due to the nascency of these companies, there is a small but rapidly growing body of literature on the impacts these TNCs are having on traditional forms of shared ride modes, however, most of the emerging literature centers on the relationships between TNC and only one other shared mode of transportation (e.g. TNCs and Public Transit). This research attempts to contribute to the literature by examining the relationship between TNCs and multiple shared ride modes simultaneously. To this end, a joint modeling framework was used to study New York City ridership data for TNCs, taxi services, bikesharing, and the subway from January 2015 to June 2017. The goal of the research presented is two-fold: explore the dynamic relationships between TNCs and other modes of shared ridership, as well as to build a predictive model for the daily ridership usage for each modal offering and total daily ridership usage. To accomplish these tasks, we first used a compositional time series approach in which the four series are modeled as proportions of total daily demand and then, after a suitable transformation, jointly modeled them via a vector autoregression with exogenous predictors (VARX) to account for trend, a weekly seasonal structure, and exogenous predictors. The second part of our analysis involved modeling the daily total usage of the four modes using a dynamic linear model (DLM) and then using that model to draw inferences about the total ridership in NYC. Results of the models were then combined to produce medium-term forecasts for each modal ridership. Our findings corroborate those of others in investigating correlations over time between usage of TNCs and taxis in servicing consumers. In keeping with our second goal, this analysis demonstrates that our modeling framework may be useful for forecasting several competing types of shared ride modes in New York City.",0968-090X,Not found

Reducing ridesourcing empty vehicle travel with future travel demand prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102826,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Ridesourcing services provide alternative mobility options in several cities. Their market share has grown exponentially due to the convenience they provide. The use of such services may be associated with car-light or car-free lifestyles. However, there are growing concerns regarding their impact on urban transportation operations performance due to empty, unproductive miles driven without a passenger (commonly referred to as deadheading). This paper is motivated by the potential to reduce deadhead mileage of ridesourcing trips by providing drivers with information on future ridesourcing trip demand. Future demand information enables the driver to wait in place for the next rider’s request without cruising around and contributing to congestion. A machine learning model is employed to predict hourly and 10-minute future interval travel demand for ridesourcing at a given location. Using future demand information, we propose algorithms to (i) assign drivers to act on received demand information by waiting in place for the next rider, and (ii) match these drivers with riders to minimize deadheading distance. Real-world data from ridesourcing providers in Austin, TX (RideAustin) and Chengdu, China (DiDi Chuxing) are leveraged. Results show that this process achieves 68%–82% and 53%–60% reduction of trip-level deadheading miles for the RideAustin and DiDi Chuxing sample operations respectively, under the assumption of unconstrained availability of short-term parking. Deadheading savings increase slightly as the maximum tolerable waiting time for the driver increases. Further, it is observed that significant deadhead savings per trip are possible, even when a small percent of the ridesourcing driver pool is provided with future ridesourcing demand information.",0968-090X,Not found

The first algorithm integrates connected vehicles (CV) and loop detector data to estimate the trajectory of unconnected vehicles based on car-following concepts. The second algorithm converts the temporal point vehicle detections to a spatial vehicle distribution on a link. The signal control methodology utilizes either algorithm to estimate traffic state on all network links at a time, optimizes the signal timing parameters over a prediction period constituting several time steps, implements the optimal decisions in the next time step, and continues this process until the end of the study period. We applied the methodology to a real-world case study network simulated in Vissim.

At a 40% penetration rate, the proposed algorithms reduced travel time by 27% to 33%and average delay by 50% to 61% compared to the existing signal and demand pattern in the case study network.

Unreliability in ridesharing systems: Measuring changes in users’ times due to new requests,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102831,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"On-demand systems in which several users can ride simultaneously the same vehicle have great potential to improve mobility while reducing congestion. Nevertheless, they have a significant drawback: the actual realization of a trip depends on the other users with whom it is shared, as they might impose extra detours that increase the waiting time and the total delay; even the chance of being rejected by the system depends on which travelers are using the system at the same time. In this paper we propose a general description of the sources of unreliability that emerge in ridesharing systems and we introduce several measures. The proposed measures are related to two sources of unreliability induced by how requests and vehicles are being assigned, namely how users’ times change within a single trip and between different realizations of the same trip. We then analyze both sources using a state-of-the-art routing and assignment method, and a New York City test case. Regarding same trip unreliability, in our experiments for different fixed fleet compositions and when reassignment is not restricted, we find that more than one third of the requests that are not immediately rejected face some change, and the magnitude of these changes is relevant: when a user faces an increase in her waiting time, this extra time is comparable to the average waiting time of the whole system, and the same happens with total delay. Algorithmic changes to reduce this uncertainty induce a trade-off with respect to the overall quality of service. For instance, not allowing for reassignments may increase the number of rejected requests. Concerning the unreliability between different trips, we find that the same origin-destination request can be rejected or served depending on the state of the fleet. And when it is served the waiting times and total delay are rarely equal, which remains true for different fleet sizes. Furthermore, the largest variations are faced by trips beginning at high-demand areas.",0968-090X,Not found
An online updating method for time-varying preference learning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102849,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The rapid proliferation of smart, personal technologies has given birth to smart Transportation Demand Management (TDM) systems that can give personalized incentives to users. This personalization capacity builds on accurate modeling of user behaviors; however, in practice, a user’s behavior data is often limited, and his preferences in the discrete choice-making process may change or evolve. In this paper, we propose a new online-updating model that can accurately and efficiently estimate an individual’s preferences from his discrete choices. Our model is built on the concept of canonical structure, where a set of canonical models are identified as the common preference patterns shared by the whole population, and a membership vector is also identified for each individual to capture the degrees of the resemblance of his preferences to those common preference patterns. To allow preference to vary in the choice-making process, a time-varying model can be integrated with the canonical structure. In the current study, we use a simple cubic polynomial model with a single variant and show the detailed formulation of the integrated model. An online-updating strategy is also proposed, such that it is possible to update the parameters partially in practice. The proposed model is suitable for modeling a heterogeneous population with insufficient data from each individual. Both simulation studies and a real-world application are taken in the current study.

Investigating generational disparities in attitudes toward automated vehicles and other mobility options,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102836,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"This paper presents a study in investigating the generational gaps between Millennials and Generation X in terms of their mobility attitudes. A comprehensive analytical framework was proposed in this study and applied to data obtained from an SP survey in the U.S. Four modeling steps were involved, to measure the attitudes, identify generational gaps, recognize potential contributors to the attitudes, and decompose the contributions into Endowment, Coefficient, and Interaction effects. The Endowment effects measure how much of the generational differences can be attributed to socioeconomic and demographic variables, while the Coefficient effects reflect the gap that is due to actual behavioral changes or attitudinal shifts between the generations. The findings of this study confirmed the existence of generational gaps in mobility attitudes and revealed that a dominant portion of the gaps stemmed from the different perspectives between the generational cohorts. This indicates that these attitudinal disparities are likely to persist and remain at significant magnitudes, reflecting the unique views and values of the Millennials. Particularly, the preferences for transit and alternative modes and less reliance on private vehicles among Millennials were more of a reflection of their preferences in lifestyle choices and not so much constrained by their socioeconomic status as the previous generation. This study provides empirical evidence of the generational gaps between Millennials and the previous generation in terms of their mobility preferences.

Evaluating resilience in urban transportation systems for sustainability: A systems-based Bayesian network model,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102840,121,2020-12-01,2020,12,"This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian network model (BNM) to quantitatively evaluate the resilience of urban transportation systems. Based on systemic thinking and taking a sustainability perspective, we investigate the long-term resilience of the road transportation systems in four cities in China from 1998 to 2017, namely Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing, respectively. The model takes into account various factors collected from multi-source data platforms involved in stages of design, construction, operation, management, and innovation in road transportation systems. We test the model with the forward inference, sensitivity analysis, and backward inference. The result shows that the overall resilience scores of all four cities’ transportation systems are within a moderate range with values between 49% to 59%. Although they all have an ever-increasing economic level, the levels of transportation resilience in Beijing and Tianjin decrease first and then gradually increase in a long run, which indicates a strong multi-dimensional, dynamic, and non-linear characteristic in resilience-economic coupling effect. Additionally, the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis and backward inference suggest that decision makers should pay more attention to the capabilities of quickly rebuilding and making changes to cope with future disturbances. As an exploratory study, this study clarifies the concepts of long-term multi-dimensional resilience and specific hazard-related resilience and provides an effective decision-support tool for stakeholders when building resilient infrastructure.",0968-090X,Not found
Evaluating the influence of information provision (when and how) on route choice preferences of road users in Greater Orlando: Application of a regret minimization approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102923,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"With the advancement in traffic management systems and improving accessibility to traffic information through various sources such as mobile apps, radio, variable message sign; road users tend to choose their route based on a complex interaction of various attributes including travel time, delay, travel cost and information provision mechanisms. While earlier research has examined route choice preferences in relation to travel time and travel cost (or toll), there is little guidance on the influence of information provision mechanisms. By accommodating for information provision attributes, the proposed research contributes to our understanding of the design of an active traffic management (ATM) system by quantitatively estimating the inherent trade-offs across the various attributes affecting route choice. Specifically, the research designs and elicits data using a web-based stated preference (SP) survey to understand road users’ preferencesin the Greater Orlando Region, USA. In the empirical analysis, the data compiled is utilized to develop random utility maximization and random regret minimization based panel mixed multinomial logit models. Route choice behavior is modeled using a comprehensive set of exogenous variables including trip characteristics, roadway characteristics and traffic information characteristics. The model results are utilized to conduct a comprehensive trade-off analysis across various attributes for the two model frameworks. In this research effort, we also customize the trade-off computation for regret minimization model for accommodating variable interactions. The trade-offs results provide useful insights on travel information provision (when and how).",0968-090X,Not found
Impacts of commercially available adaptive cruise control vehicles on highway stability and throughput,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102897,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are proving to be the first generation of automated vehicles. Although many studies have found that, theoretically, ACC vehicles may have positive impacts on traffic string stability and throughput, recent studies reveal that commercially-available ACC vehicles are string unstable. However, it is still not clear what impacts on highway traffic these commercially-available ACC vehicles may have at higher market penetration rates. Therefore, the objective of this study is twofold: (i) investigate the impacts on highway traffic capacity of mixed human-piloted vehicles and theoretical ACC vehicles as well as commercially-available ACC vehicles at different market penetration rates; (ii) explore the potential relationship between string stability and highway throughput. We use the intelligent driver model with calibrated parameter values from car following data collected on commercially-available ACC vehicles and compare the simulation results to simulations conducted using a theoretical ACC vehicle model with parameter values obtained in the literature. The results show that when simulating ACC vehicles found in the literature,traffic flow is string stable and the bottleneck capacity increases by up to 7% at higher market penetration rates as compared to homogeneous human driven traffic. When commercially-available ACC vehicles are simulated, the traffic flow is string unstable and the bottleneck capacity decreases at higher market penetration rates with some scenarios resulting in a decrease in capacity of up to 35%. The analysis provides evidence that bottleneck capacity is substantially affected by string stability and inter-vehicle time gap, while downstream throughput is solely influenced by time gap.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling epidemic spreading through public transit using time-varying encounter network,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102893,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Passenger contact in public transit (PT) networks can be a key mediate in the spreading of infectious diseases. This paper proposes a time-varying weighted PT encounter network to model the spreading of infectious diseases through the PT systems. Social activity contacts at both local and global levels are also considered. We select the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a case study along with smart card data from Singapore to illustrate the model at the metropolitan level. A scalable and lightweight theoretical framework is derived to capture the time-varying and heterogeneous network structures, which enables to solve the problem at the whole population level with low computational costs. Different control policies from both the public health side and the transportation side are evaluated. We find that people’s preventative behavior is one of the most effective measures to control the spreading of epidemics. From the transportation side, partial closure of bus routes helps to slow down but cannot fully contain the spreading of epidemics. Identifying “influential passengers” using the smart card data and isolating them at an early stage can also effectively reduce the epidemic spreading.",0968-090X,Not found
An algorithm for integrating peer-to-peer ridesharing and schedule-based transit system for first mile/last mile access,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102891,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Due to limited transit network coverage and infrequent service, suburban commuters often face the transit first mile/last mile (FMLM) problem. To deal with this, they either drive to a park-and-ride location to take transit, use carpooling, or drive directly to their destination to avoid inconvenience. Ridesharing, an emerging mode of transportation, can solve the transit first mile/last mile problem. In this setup, a driver can drive a ride-seeker to a transit station, from where the rider can take transit to her respective destination. The problem requires solving a ridesharing matching problem with the routing of riders in a multimodal transportation network. We develop a transit-based ridesharing matching algorithm to solve this problem. The method leverages the schedule-based transit shortest path to generate feasible matches and then solves a matching optimization program to find an optimal match between riders and drivers. The proposed method not only assigns an optimal driver to the rider but also assigns an optimal transit stop and a transit vehicle trip departing from that stop for the rest of the rider’s itinerary. We also introduce the application of space-time prism (STP) (the geographical area which can be reached by a traveler given the time constraints) in the context of ridesharing to reduce the computational time by reducing the network search. An algorithm to solve this problem dynamically using a rolling horizon approach is also presented. We use simulated data obtained from the activity-based travel demand model of Twin Cities, MN to show that the transit-based ridesharing can solve the FMLM problem and save a significant number of vehicle-hours spent in the system.",0968-090X,Not found
Classifying travelers' driving style using basic safety messages generated by connected vehicles: Application of unsupervised machine learning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102917,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Driving style can substantially impact mobility, safety, energy consumption, and vehicle emissions. While a range of methods has been used in the past for driving style classification, the emergence of connected vehicles equipped with communication devices provides a new opportunity to classify driving style using high-resolution (10 Hz) microscopic real-world data. In this study, location-based big data and machine learning are used to classify driving styles ranging from aggressive to calm. This classification can be used to customize driver assistance systems, assess mobility, crash risk, fuel consumption, and emissions. This study’s main objective is to develop a framework that harnesses Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) generated by connected vehicles to quantify instantaneous driving behavior and classify driving styles in different spatial contexts using unsupervised machine learning methods. To this end, a subset of the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) with more than 27 million BSM observations generated by more than 1300 individuals making trips on diverse roadways and through several neighborhoods in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were processed and analyzed. To quantify driving style, the concept of temporal driving volatility, as a surrogate safety measure of unsafe driving behavior, was utilized and applied to vehicle kinematics, i.e., observed speeds and longitudinal/lateral accelerations. Specifically, six volatility measures are extracted and used for classifying drivers. K-means and K-medoids methods are applied for grouping drivers in aggressive, normal, and calm clusters. Clustering results indicate that not only does driving style vary among drivers, but the thresholds for aggressive and calm driving vary across different roadway types due to variations in environment and road conditions. The proportion of aggressive driving styles was also higher on commercial streets than on highways and residential streets. Notably, we propose a Driving Score to measure driving performance consistently across drivers.",0968-090X,Not found
Risk assessment based collision avoidance decision-making for autonomous vehicles in multi-scenarios,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102820,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"In this paper, we proposed a new risk assessment based decision-making algorithm to guarantee collision avoidance in multi-scenarios for autonomous vehicles.

Finally, we conducted experiments in Carla (car learning to act) to evaluate our developed collision avoidance decision-making algorithm in different scenarios. The results show that our developed method was sufficiently reliable for autonomous vehicles to avoid collisions in multi-scenarios with different driving style preferences.

In this paper, we focus on routing in real time a fleet of capacitated vehicles to satisfy requests submitted by a set of customers with some of the requests unknown while assigning the service cost fairly among the requested customers. We propose a Hybrid Proportional Online Cost-Sharing (HPOCS) mechanism to tackle the cost-sharing problem and analyze its performance using simulation instances. Although HPOCS does satisfy the desirable properties, namely online fairness, budget balance, immediate response, individual rationality and ex-post incentive compatibility, it has a few drawbacks in certain scenarios. Therefore, we make two extensions to HPOCS: 1) we introduce the idea of discounts to encourage customers to request in advance to facilitate efficient vehicle routing; 2) we incorporate periodical re-optimization within the dynamic vehicle routing framework. Experimental analysis are made in both extensions to see the tradeoff between the performance and the loss of certain desirable properties.",0968-090X,Not found
Sharing the road with autonomous vehicles: Perceived safety and regulatory preferences,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102885,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Technology providers, car manufacturers, and public agencies all need to work together to undertake extensive testing of fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads before such AVs are allowed to freely travel in ways similar to human-driven vehicles. This raises the importance of understanding public perceptions regarding safety considerations when traveling alongside AVs. This study makes use of a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center to identify the affective, socio-demographic and technology-use attributes that affect an individual’s perception of the safety of sharing the road with AVs (PSSRAV) and identifies measures and interventions that can be undertaken to improve PSSRAV. Additionally, we evaluate individual preferences for AV regulations. Our results underscore the importance of the need for service providers and public agencies to be cognizant of the demographic and lifestyle/affective emotion considerations shaping AV safety perceptions and opinions about AV regulations. In particular, there is a need not only to focus on technological and other infrastructure components of AV development, but also to recognize the socio-technical considerations and human-related factors of the end-users.

Analytical analysis of the effect of maximum platoon size of connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102882,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The maximum platoon size is a critical parameter in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) platoon configuration. However, the effect of platoon size on the transportation system has not been well-studied. This paper unveils the effect of maximum CAV platoon size in terms of road capacity and traffic flow stability. Specifically, the analytical formulations of the capacity and flow stability are developed considering the maximum platoon size. Simulations are conducted to verify the developed theoretical models. For capacity analysis, both the analytical and simulation results indicate that a larger maximum platoon size can help increase the capacity. However, the increment becomes smaller with the increase of maximum platoon size. For flow stability analysis, the theoretical analysis and microscopic simulation show that smaller maximum platoon size leads to greater traffic flow stabilization. In addition, analysis shows that improvements in capacity and traffic stability are more profound when CAV penetration and platooning intensity are high.",0968-090X,Not found
Influencing the queue configuration to increase bicycle jam density and discharge rate: An experimental study on a single path,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102884,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Congestion in bicycle traffic is a daily occurrence at many urban intersections. It is known that a higher density in the queue leads to a higher discharge rate. In theory, higher jam densities than those currently observed in practice are feasible. This leads to our hypothesis that the delay at intersections can be further reduced when cyclists are encouraged to queue up closer together. To explore this option, we carried out an experiment in which the queue configuration was influenced to increase the jam density. This paper presents ways to increase the queuing density, up to twice the density found without instructions. Results show that increasing the jam density does indeed increase the queue discharge rate; this also holds for jam density values that exceed those observed in normal queuing conditions. The efficiency of the queue discharge process, captured by the discharge rate, was found to increase by 40% when cyclists queue up closely together. Qualitative comparison of the queuing positions and discharge patterns showed that the discharge sequence is largely determined by the queuing position, and that cyclists keep a distance from each other in both time and space during the queue discharge phase. When applied in practice, these findings can be used to update the signal length and green phases for all traffic, thereby reducing congestion in urban areas.",0968-090X,Not found
Stationary condition based performance analysis of the contraflow left-turn lane design considering the influence of the upstream intersection,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102919,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The present study conducted an operational performance analysis of the contraflow left-turn lane (CLL) design considering the influence of the upstream signalized intersection. The arrival distribution was generated using a platoon dispersion model. A stationary condition was defined, in which the performance of the CLL design remained stable in any stationary cycle. It has proved that the CLL system always converges to the stationary condition after a few cycles if the arrival distribution is fixed. In stationary cycles, the CLL design generates either recurrent and constant residual queues or no queues, depending on the arrival distributions of left-turning vehicles. Based on the stationary condition, analytical models were developed to estimate the operational performance for left-turns at signalized intersections with the CLL design. The results show that both the arrival pattern and the length of the contraflow lane can significantly influence the operational performance of the CLL design. The residual queues in the stationary condition could increase control delay significantly, leading to an overlong delay of the left-turning vehicles if the contraflow lane was not carefully designed. To this end, an empirical optimization method was proposed to minimize the control delay by optimizing the length of contraflow lanes and the offset between adjacent intersections. The research results can be directly employed by traffic engineers to optimize the CLL design and to estimate the operational performance of the signalized intersections with the CLL design.",0968-090X,Not found
Efficiency of UAV-based last-mile delivery under congestion in low-altitude air,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102878,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies have motivated logistics carriers to seek last-mile parcel delivery through the air so as to benefit from its convenience and flexibility. However, UAV-based delivery services are limited by several binding factors, such as low battery capacities and short delivery range, which in turn require simultaneous use of a large fleet for commercial scale operations. In such cases, congestion in low-altitude air will inevitably arise. This paper investigates self-organized UAV traffic flow in low altitude 3D airspace, and formulates the user equilibrium condition as a set of partial differential equations. We propose a finite element scheme to numerically solve the traffic equilibrium and compute system performance. Two specific test scenarios for last-mile freight delivery systems are studied, including one with a conventional ground-based distribution facility, and the other with a novel concept of airborne fulfillment center. We evaluate the operational cost and energy consumption of these systems under a variety of system configurations. The results provide insights that could be useful for logistic carriers and policy makers to achieve efficiency and sustainability for last-mile delivery.",0968-090X,Not found
Simulation-based optimization of toll pricing in large-scale urban networks using the network fundamental diagram: A cross-comparison of methods,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102894,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Simulation-based optimization (SO or SBO) has become increasingly important to address challenging transportation network design problems. In this paper, we propose to solve two toll pricing problems with different levels of complexity using the concept of the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD), where a large-scale simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model of Melbourne, Australia is used. Four computationally efficient SBO methods are applied and compared, including the proportional-integral (PI) controller, regressing kriging (RK), DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT), and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). The comparison reveals that these methods work equally well on the simple problem without exhibiting significant performance differences. But, for the complex problem, RK manifests itself to be the best-performing method thanks to its capability of filtering out the numerical noise arising from computer simulations (i.e. allowing for non-smoothness of the objective function). While the PI controller is a more competitive solution to the simple problem given its faster rate of convergence, the poor scalability of the method in the complex problem results in limited applicability. Two caveats, however, deserve emphasis: (i) the chosen critical network density of the NFD does not necessarily represent a robust network control or optimization threshold, as it might shift in the presence of toll pricing; and (ii) re-interpolation is required as part of RK in order to achieve global convergence.",0968-090X,Not found
Predicting origin-destination ride-sourcing demand with a spatio-temporal encoder-decoder residual multi-graph convolutional network,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102858,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"With the rapid development of mobile-internet technologies, on-demand ride-sourcing services have become increasingly popular and largely reshaped the way people travel. Demand prediction is one of the most fundamental components in supply-demand management systems of ride-sourcing platforms. With an accurate short-term prediction for origin-destination (OD) demand, the platforms make precise and timely decisions on real-time matching, idle vehicle reallocations, and ride-sharing vehicle routing, etc. Compared to the zone-based demand prediction that has been examined in many previous studies, OD-based demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among the demand of different OD pairs. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network (ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs. Firstly, the model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the non-Euclidean pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different OD pairs. Secondly, based on the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode the contextual-aware spatial dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used to encode the temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC networks to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the future OD demand. Through extensive experiments on the for-hire-vehicles datasets in Manhattan, New York City, we show that our proposed deep learning framework outperforms the state-of-arts by a significant margin.",0968-090X,Not found
A shock wave diagram based deep learning model for early alerting an upcoming public event,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102862,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Even though extensive efforts worked on traffic anomaly detection, this study noticed that little attention is given to predict public events before they start, like celebrations, sports games, and so on. Given a public event produces complicated spatiotemporal traffic impacts, existing data-driven approaches without involving traffic flow analysis show limited effectiveness to predict a public event. Motivated by this view, this study seeks to develop a domain-knowledge-based learning approach, which integrates shock wave analysis into deep learning models to predict the occurring of an upcoming public event (i.e., the SW-DLM approach). This integration raises new research challenging and calls for new approaches. Specifically, we develop an efficient algorithm to generate the shock wave diagrams to present the evolvement of the traffic anomaly, which expands whenever new traffic data is collected. Next, the shock wave diagram itself is not a well-coded input for feature extraction and learning. This study thus developed an innovative encoding approach, which transforms a shock wave diagram into an optimal pixel grid. Considering the features extracted from the encoded shock wave diagrams are fed into the long-short term memory (LSTM) model for the event prediction. The numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the SW-DLM is able to predict a public event with 87% accuracy around 84 min before it starts in a day. It outperforms all data-driven machine learning models using point traffic data as inputs. Thus, we claim that using the shock wave diagrams can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the learning approaches for predicting a public event. The SW-DLM will help develop preventive traffic control or route plans to avoid traffic congestion induced by public events.",0968-090X,Not found

Real-time estimation of pedestrian volume at button-activated midblock crosswalks using traffic controller event-based data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102876,122,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Pedestrian volume is essential for optimizing midblock pedestrian signals as well as for quantifying pedestrian exposure in safety analyses. However, previous methods of pedestrian volume collection require either time-consuming ground-truth data collection, or the purchase and maintenance of costly sensors in a large-scale application. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method for large-scale pedestrian estimation at midblock crosswalks using button-pushing and signal timing events. The pedestrian arrival is modeled as a Poisson process, and two submethods are developed to estimate pedestrian volume at one-stage and two-stage button-activated midblock crosswalks (BAMCs). To address the issue of missing signal cycles at two-stage BAMCs, all missing cycles that are identified by using the proposed paired signal cycle identification algorithm are accounted for and added by minimizing the error between estimation results of two stages. Eight days of the ground-truth pedestrian volume is manually collected from two study midblock crosswalks to evaluate the proposed methods. On average, 235 and 230 pedestrians per day were observed to cross the one-stage BAMC and two-stage BAMC, respectively. The average mean absolute error of estimated pedestrian volume using a one-hour interval is 2.27 and 1.78 ped/hour at two study locations, respectively. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed methods are promising for estimating pedestrian volume at midblock crosswalks using event-based data. A further sensitivity analysis of changing the estimation interval shows that the one-hour interval pedestrian volume estimation is recommended as having the least error.",0968-090X,Not found

Proportional fairness attempts to meet social fairness among evacuees without sacrificing the efficiency of the evacuation process. The proportional fair trip planning concept is compared to the commonly used maximum safety concept that attempts to maximize the summation of safety functions of evacuees. We use a combinatorial approach to model the transit mass emergency evacuation in moving people from dangerous areas to safe shelters. High-density population and medium-density population variations of the problem are studied. For each variation of the problem, we study the computational complexity of the problem. We develop polynomial or pseudo-polynomial algorithms for each problem. Our numerical analysis shows that pure consideration of efficiency may result in highly unfair plans that only consider the portion of the population with the most payoffs (e.g., the population with the highest danger level) while ignoring the rest (potentially the vast majority of the population). While still considering efficiency, proportional fairness is shown to address this issue by also allocating resources to the population that has non-optimal payoffs.",0968-090X,Not found

Although advances have been made in understanding both the promotion of ADS trust and its impact on NDRT performance, the influence of risk remains largely understudied. To fill this gap, we conducted a within-subjects experiment with 37 licensed drivers using a simulator. Internal risk was manipulated by ADS reliability and external risk by visibility, producing a 2 (ADS reliability) × 2 (visibility) design. The results indicate that high reliability increases ADS trust and further enhances the positive impact of ADS trust on NDRT performance, while low visibility reduces the negative impact of ADS trust on driver monitoring. Results also suggest that trust increases over time if the system is reliable and that visibility did not have a significant impact on ADS trust.

Convective risk areas can be derived from the latter to be included in the objective function. At the execution level, the planned trajectories are included in an air traffic simulator (NAVSIM) under observed weather (wind and storms). In this simulation process, track modifications might be triggered in case of encountering an observed thunderstorm. A tool termed DIVMET based on pathfinding algorithms has been integrated into NAVSIM is considered to that end.

Simulating the effectiveness of wave dissipation by FollowerStopper autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102954,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The traffic jam phenomenon known as stop-and-go waves is commonplace on many roadways and is unavoidable due to the imperfect nature of human driving behaviour. Previous research by Stern et al. (2018) has demonstrated experimentally that a single Autonomous Vehicle (AV) can be harnessed to dissipate stop-and-go waves produced by 20 other passenger vehicles driving in a cycle. However, the experiment was conducted in an idealistic situation of a single-lane ring road with one AV; meaning no lane changing was possible and multiple AV interaction was left untested. To address these limitations, the AV driving behaviour used to achieve this, known as FollowerStopper (FS), was modelled for use in the Aimsun traffic simulation software and validated before further numerical experiments were conducted. The microsimulation scenarios were designed to observe how multiple AVs driven by the FS controller (referred to as FS-AVs in this paper) affect their traffic wave dissipation capability. Both single and double-lane ring roads experimental designs were used with the latter capturing the untested effect of lane changes. FS-AV was found to be less effective than originally documented in both cases. Multiple FS-AVs included within one lane were still able to improve traffic flow and dissipate the stop-and-go waves, although it is sensitive to the combination of different factors and any deviation away from the ideal condition is likely to produce worse-off traffic operations in terms of traffic flow. For double-lanes, human-driven vehicles (HDVs) would change lanes at heightened rates to occupy the larger gap the FS-AV needs for its dissipating strategy, causing it to further pullback and set off a chain reaction to upstream traffic. Stop-and-go waves had not been dissipated and decreased traffic performance in terms of flow, speed and delay time resulted. Our results also showed that the wave dampening effect of the FS-AV does not translate between the ring road and its linear equivalent. On the other hand, our preliminary simulation results using a real-life freeway model did not suggest multiple FS-AVs worsen traffic conditions. The contradicting results might be due to different traffic conditions such as vehicle density. Further research is required to investigate what factors could adversely affect FS-AV’s ability to dampen shockwaves and explore possible improvement to its driving algorithm.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimal control strategies for freeway traffic mixed with connected automated vehicles: A model-based reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102987,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This paper proposes an integrated freeway traffic flow control framework that aims to minimize the total travel cost, improve greenness and safety for freeway traffic mixed with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular human-piloted vehicles (RHVs). The proposed framework devises an integrated action of several control strategies such as ramp metering, lane changing control (LCC) for CAVs and lane changing recommendation (LCR) for RHVs, variable speed limit control (VSLC) for CAVs and variable speed limit recommendation (VSLR) for RHVs with minimum safety gap control measures for lane changing and merging maneuvers. The CAVs are assumed to follow the system control instructions fully and immediately. In contrast, the RHVs would make decisions in response to the recommendations disseminated and also the behaviors of CAVs. The compliance rate of drivers to the LCR is captured by the underlying traffic flow model. A set of constraints is imposed to restrict VSLC/VSLR and LCC/LCR measures from changing too frequently or too sharply on both temporal and spatial dimensions to avoid excessive nuisance to passengers and traffic flow instability. A reinforcement learning based solution algorithm is proposed. First, a control parameterization technique is adopted to reduce the dimension of the original optimal control problem to increase computational efficiency. Then, a gradient-free Cross-Entropy-Method based algorithm is used to search the optimal parameters to circumvent the non-differentiability of the traffic flow model. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework are illustrated via numerical examples for a variety of penetration rates of CAVs under various traffic conditions. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to demonstrate the impacts of several important parameters such as the reaction time of the CAVs. It is found that the integrated control strategy can reduce the total travel cost by reducing the lane changing maneuvers and vehicles queuing at the bottleneck meanwhile smooth the traffic flow and suppress the adverse impact of shockwaves. The effect of ramp metering is not significant when the penetration rate of CAVs is high enough. Speed harmonization (with minimum gap control) in conjunction with LCC/LCR would be a better integrated control strategy under high penetration rate of CAVs.",0968-090X,Not found
To own or not to own – That is the question: The value of owning a (fully automated) vehicle,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102978,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"One of the largest uncertainties in modelling the impacts of autonomous vehicles in future is whether they will be owned or used as automated ride (hailing) services. This paper addresses this issue by modelling the inherent attractiveness or convenience value of ownership of an automated vehicle, beyond the regular convenience parameters such as journey time, waiting or access time and reliability. Using mixed logit model on a choice experimentation data, we find that ownership is inherently valued more compared to the ride services by women. However, we also report significant heterogeneity in this valuation depending on gender and other car-ownership related characteristics, which can diminish this inherent attractiveness to the point that a majority of men may find ownership no more attractive than exclusive use ride services. We also find substantial inconvenience value associated with shared/pooled automated ride services compared to exclusive-use ride services. Implications of the results are illustrated using an example of the share of automated vehicle ownership, and exclusive-use and pooled use ride services.",0968-090X,Not found
Ensemble learning activity scheduler for activity based travel demand models,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102972,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The aim of this paper is to predict travel behavior for a set of model individuals, who represent cohorts with homogeneous time-use activity patterns. The paper presents a new modeling framework that is able to simulate temporal information associated with the traveler’s daily activity schedule, for use in activity-based travel demand modeling. We employed a precise and efficient machine learning technique known as Random-Forest for temporal attribute recognition. In order to capture the uncertainty of start time and activity duration, initially we derived unique clusters of homogeneous daily activity patterns from the activity data. The Random-Forest model is formulated based on the socio-demographic characteristics of travelers and temporal features of their activities. Start time and activity duration for every activity type were allocated to a set of bins. In this study, eight different bin structures, varying in the time interval, are designed as response variables. Using a heuristic decision rule-based algorithm, the predicted activities were inserted into the traveler’s skeleton schedule. An algorithm was then applied to schedule travelers’ activities based on activity importance level and guide information gained from representative patterns for homogeneous population cohorts. The model was tested using time-diary data drawn from the Space-Time Activity Research (STAR) survey for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Results show that the proposed model is able to assemble the traveler’s schedule with an average 81.62% accuracy in the 24-hour period. The insights gained from this study include important temporal information on activities crucial for the scheduling stage of an activity-based model. Finally, the results of this paper are expected to be implemented within the activity-based travel demand model, Scheduler for Activities, Locations, and Travel (SALT).",0968-090X,Not found
Cut through traffic to catch green light: Eco approach with overtaking capability,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102927,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This research presents an enhanced eco-approach controller with overtaking capability. The proposed controller overcomes the shortcomings of the conventional eco approach and is able to: i) overtake slowly-moving vehicles for the ecological purpose; ii) optimize the travel duration approaching an intersection; iii) guarantee both fuel saving and vehicle’s mobility; iv) consider stochasticity of surrounding traffic; v) functional under partially connected and automated environment. It takes full advantage of connected vehicle technology by taking in real-time vehicle and infrastructure information as optimization input. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and is solved by GPOPS. The nonlinear bicycle model is adopted as the system dynamics to realize CAV’s longitudinal and lateral coupling control, and linearized to reduce the computational burden. The stochasticity of surrounding traffic is considered as a probability distribution that is transformed into a linear chance constraint. Quantitative evaluation is conducted to compare the proposed controller against human drivers and the conventional eco approach which only has longitudinal automation. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed controller improves the fuel efficiency by 4.13–70.12%, and outperforms two baseline controllers by 6.06–36.73% in terms of fuel saving. The range is caused by the different arrival time of the ego CAV. In addition, the simulation experiment in VISSIM is conducted to analyze how background traffic flow influences the performance of the proposed controller.",0968-090X,Not found
"Simulation of price, customer behaviour and system impact for a cost-covering automated taxi system in Zurich",10.1016/j.trc.2021.102974,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Automated Mobility on Demand (AMoD) is a concept that has recently generated much discussion. In cases where large-scale adoption of an automated taxi service is anticipated, the service’s impacts may become relevant to key transport system metrics, and thus to transport planners and policy-makers as well. In light of this increasingly important question, this paper presents an agent-based transport simulation with (single passenger) AMoD. In contrast to earlier studies, all scenario data (including demand patterns, cost assumptions and customer behaviour) is obtained for one specific area, the city of Zurich, Switzerland. The simulation study fuses information from a detailed bottom-up cost analysis of mobility services in Switzerland, a specifically tailored Stated-Preferences survey about automated mobility services conducted in the canton of Zurich, and a detailed agent-based transport simulation for the city, based on MATSim. Methodologically, a comprehensive approach is presented that iteratively runs these components to derive states in which service cost, waiting times and demand are in equilibrium for a cost-covering AMoD operator with predefined fleet size. For Zurich, several cases are examined, with 4,000 AMoD vehicles leading to the maximum demand of around 150,000 requests per day that can be attracted by the system. Within these parameters, the simulation results show that customers are willing to accept average waiting times of around 4 min at a price of 0.75 CHF/km. Further cost-covering cases with lower demand are presented, where either smaller fleet sizes lead to higher waiting times, or larger fleet sizes lead to higher costs. While our simulations indicate that an AMoD system in Zurich can bring benefits to the users, they show that the system impact is largely negative. Caused by modal shifts, our simulations show an increase of driven distance of up to 100%. All examined fleet configurations of the unregulated, cost-covering, single-passenger, door-to-door AMoD service are found to be highly counter-productive on a path towards a more shared and active transport system. Accordingly, policy recommendations for regulation are discussed.",0968-090X,Not found
Passenger itinerary inference model for congested urban rail networks,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102896,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The paper develops a data-driven approach for the inference of passenger itineraries in urban heavy rail systems, the Passenger Itinerary Inference Model (PIIM). In light of increasing demand and crowding, the model can be used to assess the impact of near capacity operations on customers, evaluate system performance, and understand passenger behavior when choosing alternative routes. PIIM uses data from Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems and is applicable to general urban rail networks with entry and exit fare transactions. PIIM consists of three main modules: the left behind model, the route fractions inference model, and the inference model. The left behind model estimates the probability of any passenger being left behind by station and time interval. The route fractions inference model estimates the route choice fractions given the left behind probabilities. The inference model maps each pair of fare transaction records (entry and exit) to a set of feasible itineraries and infers the train(s) boarded by passengers based on the left behind probabilities and the route choice fractions. Synthetic data using AFC and AVL data from a major, congested urban rail system were generated to validate the model. The results show that the model accurately predicts the itineraries used by passengers, the left behind probabilities, route choice fractions, train loads, and other performance metrics of interest. PIIM is also used with actual data to illustrate its applicability.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimization approach to metro crew scheduling and rostering,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102975,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Due to its complexity, the metro crew management problem is usually decomposed into a crew scheduling problem and a crew rostering problem.

Accordingly, this study seeks to develop an integrated optimization approach to model and solve the metro crew scheduling problem and the crew rostering problem simultaneously. To this end, we firstly construct a multi-layer time–space network, in which each layer represents a duty. We then formulate the considered problem as a minimum-cost multi-commodity network flow problem in which each crew is regarded as a commodity and present a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic to solve the proposed network flow problem. Finally, we conduct a computational study using the real-life data to test the effectiveness of our Lagrangian relaxation heuristic, compare the performance of our heuristic with the benchmark solution, and report the benefits obtained via the proposed integrated optimization approach.",0968-090X,Not found
What do we (Not) know about our future with automated vehicles?,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102948,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"While research on developing and testing automated vehicle (AVs) technologies is well underway, research on their implications on travel-related behavior is in its infancy. The aim of this paper is to summarize and analyze literature that focuses on travel-related behavior impacts of AVs, namely levels 4 and 5, as well as highlight important directions of research. We review five methods used to quantitatively investigate these implications and how each method contributes to this literature: 1) controlled testbeds, 2) driving simulators and virtual reality, 3) agent-based and travel-demand models, 4) surveys, and 5) field experiments. We also present five critical research questions regarding the implications of AVs on the demand side of transportation and summarize findings from the current literature on: 1) what is the willingness to adopt the technology? and what are the impacts of the technology on 2) in-vehicle behavior? 3) value of time? 4) travel-related behaviors (activity pattern, mode, destination, residential location)? and 5) vehicle miles traveled (VMT)? Results can be divided into four categories. The first category corresponds to results on research questions with numerous data points where the direction of the impact is consistent across the literature, albeit the magnitude varies considerably. For instance, surveys indicate 19% to 68% of people are unwilling to adopt AV technology, a sentiment that is fading over time. Moreover, people prefer owning AVs over sharing them and don’t believe their car ownership will decrease. Regarding VMT, most studies predict an increase that varies from a low of 1% to a high of 90% depending on the scenario and assumptions under study. The second category of findings corresponds to research questions with limited and consistent, albeit highly variable data points. For example, a few stated preference survey studies indicate that reduced stress and multitasking during travel will reduce the value of time between 5% and 90%. The third category of results is on research questions with a few but conflicting data points. For instance, surveys indicate that people (80% to 85%) do not believe their residential location will be impacted by the adoption of AVs. Some simulation studies, however, indicate that lower travel costs will drive people away from cities and into suburbs while other studies report the opposite. The final category of results corresponds to research question with a single or no data points. For instance, one study explores how users will use vehicles to run errands while no studies investigate user preferences for vehicle types (e.g. mobile-homes vs. right-sized) or how they plan to use their vehicles when they are not needed (e.g. rent out vs. leave them idle). Moving forward, the goal is to shift all results into the first category while simultaneously tightening the prediction interval of the magnitude of the impacts. This can be achieved by: 1) focusing more efforts on research questions that fall under the three remaining categories to fill the holes in the literature, and 2) establishing consistency and clarity of assumptions used by researchers to enable comparisons and transferability of results.",0968-090X,Not found

The cooperative sorting strategy for connected and automated vehicle platoons,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102986,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This paper presents a “cooperative vehicle sorting” strategy that seeks to optimally sort connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a multi-lane platoon to reach an ideally organized platoon. In the proposed method, a CAV platoon is firstly discretized into a grid system, where a CAV moves from one cell to another in discrete time-space domain. Then, the cooperative sorting problem is modeled as a path-finding problem in the graphic domain. The problem is solved by the deterministic A* algorithm with a stepwise strategy, where only one vehicle can move within a movement step. The resultant shortest path is further optimized with an integer linear programming algorithm to minimize the sorting time by allowing multiple movements within a step. To improve the algorithm running time and address multiple shortest paths, a distributed stochastic A* algorithm (DSA*) is developed by introducing random disturbances to the edge costs to break uniform paths (with equal path cost). Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSA* method. The results report shorter sorting time and significantly improved algorithm running time due to the use of DSA*. In addition, we find that the optimization performance can be further improved by increasing the number of processes in the distributed computing system.",0968-090X,Not found
Train timetabling with dynamic and random passenger demand: A stochastic optimization method,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102963,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Considering the dynamics and randomness of passenger demand, this paper investigates a train timetabling problem in the stochastic environment for an urban rail transit system.

Through an analysis of the features of the nonlinear constraints, a reformulation method is proposed to develop an equivalent integer linear programming (ILP) model that can be easily solved by commercial software. Moreover, a variable neighborhood search algorithm is developed to find the approximate optimal solutions for large-scale problems within the tolerable computing time.

A priority-based ADMM approach for flexible train scheduling problems,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102960,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"In this study, we focus on how to optimize multi-type train scheduling problems in a practically available and computationally efficient manner. When solving the complicated train timetabling problem with overtaking operations for a congested high-speed rail corridor, a simplified approach is to predesignate a thin time interval from its origin station for each train. This setting is difficult and laborious in practice. What is more serious is that an imperfect setting may cause the expected solutions to be unreachable in many instances. To fundamentally get out of this thorny trouble, this study proposes a flexible scheduling framework that extends narrow time limitations to one-hour periods, which allows the trains to depart from any timestamp within the relaxed period. Further, a group of incompatibility constraints with a more compact form is formulated to mirror the coupling relation between train headway and regularity requirements. However, the relaxed time window increases the difficulty of obtaining the optimal or near-optimal solution under the standard Lagrangian-based decomposition framework. Therefore, an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is introduced for effectively eliminating the computational barriers that are due to its increased complexity. Specifically, a priority-based search sequence is employed by applying the associated dual costs during the solution of train-level path subproblems individually. Finally, a set of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and availability of the proposed approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling the dynamics of hurricane evacuation decisions from twitter data: An input output hidden markov modeling approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102976,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Evacuations play a critical role in saving human lives during hurricanes. But individual evacuation decision-making is a complex dynamic process, often studied using post-hurricane survey data. Alternatively, ubiquitous use of social media generates a massive amount of data that can be used to predict evacuation behavior in real time. In this paper, we present a method to infer individual evacuation behaviors (e.g., evacuation decision, timing, destination) from social media data. We develop an input output hidden Markov model (IO-HMM) to infer evacuation decisions from user tweets. To extract the underlying evacuation context from tweets, we first estimate a word2vec model from a corpus of more than 100 million tweets collected over four major hurricanes. Using input variables such as evacuation context, time to landfall, type of evacuation order, and the distance from home, the proposed model infers what activities are made by individuals, when they decide to evacuate, and where they evacuate to. To validate our results, we have created a labeled dataset from 38,256 tweets posted between September 2, 2017 and September 19, 2017 by 2,571 users from Florida during hurricane Irma. Our findings show that the proposed IO-HMM method can be useful for inferring evacuation behavior in real time from social media data. Since traditional surveys are infrequent, costly, and often performed at a post-hurricane period, the proposed approach can be very useful for predicting evacuation demand as a hurricane unfolds in real time.",0968-090X,Not found
Harnessing connected and automated vehicle technologies to control lane changes at freeway merge bottlenecks in mixed traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102950,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This paper proposes three control strategies for lane-changing (LC) at a merge bottleneck to improve bottleneck throughput by mitigating voids and speed disturbances in mixed traffic using connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies. Strategy 1 is ‘gap closure’ control, where an LC vehicle and its follower are controlled to close the void (extra time gap ahead) induced by the LC and prevent a backward-propagating speed disturbance. Strategy 2 is ‘batch LC’, where a group of LC vehicles are controlled to line up along a kinematic wave to minimize the total voids. Strategy 3 is ‘gap redistribution’ control, where extra gaps of vehicles are redistributed to periodically create large enough gaps for disturbance-free insertions. In a general control framework, the three strategies are integrated in different combinations exploiting their complementary nature. A numerical analysis shows that certain combinations, such as Strategy 2 and 3, can be very effective for improving bottleneck throughput.

The proposed models have only three tunable parameters to capture these three features. One of these parameters is the time delay that models the actuator lag in vehicle dynamics, the reaction time of human drivers, and the communication and feedback delays of connected and automated vehicles. The proposed Lagrangian continuum traffic models with delays establish a framework for traffic prediction and control. On one hand, connected vehicles may use predictions about the future motion of neighboring vehicles or their own. On the other hand, the continuum nature of these models allows one to study the large-scale impact of connected vehicles on the traffic flow.

Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS), proposed by Mobileye, is a rigorous mathematical model that defines the real-time safety distance that the AV needs to maintain in relation to surrounding vehicles, and helps the AV respond to dangerous situations. However, RSS’s performance has not yet been tested with real driving data. This study thus calibrates and evaluates the RSS model based on car-following scenarios created from safety-critical events (SCEs) detected in the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. SCEs were identified from the raw data with a trigger method; they were manually validated and then converted into virtual scenarios in which the human-driven subject vehicle was replaced with an AV controlled by a model predictive control based adaptive cruise control (ACC) system embedded with RSS. The RSS model was calibrated with the goal of achieving optimal safety performance, that is, of generating the lowest time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT) after the AV algorithms were implemented in the safety-critical scenarios.

The problem lies on determining the turn-back stations, train composition and frequency of each service route operated on the line. Considering the interests of operators and passengers, we decompose the problem as two subproblems namely train service configuration and passenger assignment. The first subproblem is formulated as an integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing operators’ cost. Given a train service scheme, the second subproblem is modelled as a capacitated continuous multi-commodity flow model to minimize passengers’ waiting time cost and transfer cost. The optimal strategy is extended to determine the behaviour of passengers and capture the extra waiting time of passengers under capacity constraint. The two sub-models are weighted and integrated into a mixed integer nonlinear programming model, which is further transformed into a mixed integer linear programming model using a novel linearization method. By exploiting the special characteristics of the model, a tailored and easy to implement local search algorithm is developed to solve large-scale instances. Starting from the operator-optimum solution which can be easily obtained, the algorithm solves the two sub-models iteratively to search better solutions within a precalculated search range which is smaller than the complete feasible domain.

Express package routing problem with occasional couriers,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102994,123,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This study investigates the viability of a “courier friendly” crowd-shipping (CS) model to carry out express package deliveries in an urban area. Imposing almost no managerial control over the occasional couriers (OC) to maximize their willingness to participate, the envisioned model suggests using transshipment points to enhance operational efficiency and a company-controlled backup delivery capacity to account for the uncertainty in the crowd-provided delivery capacity. A dynamic programming (DP) approach is developed to address the package routing problem that needs to be solved for the real-time management of the CS network. The suggested methodology does not assume any specific distributions for the courier and demand arrivals and provides the optimal package routing policy when the courier and service point capacities are not binding. Several extensions of the basic DP approach are studied to consider limited courier and service point capacities and take advantage of the extra information provided by those couriers that declare their arrivals in advance.

At the corridor level, a real-time optimization model is formulated to design the dynamic progression plan for critical paths (i.e. paths with high flows). These two optimization models are solved by the dynamic programming technique. A real-world arterial is modeled in VISSIM to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed traffic signal control system. Simulations with various CV penetration rates and demand levels are conducted to compare the proposed system with fixed coordination and adaptive signal control systems. Results indicate that the proposed system outperforms both base systems by reducing 15.67% and 13.81% of the average delay, respectively, when the CV penetration rate is relatively high. Moreover, the proposed system can improve the arterial performance under all tested scenarios with various CV penetration rates and demand levels. Since the tested demand scenarios can reflect the real traffic fluctuations, it can be proved that the proposed control system could be applied in the field to boost the overall traffic efficiency along the arterial.",0968-090X,Not found
"Integrated simulation platform for conventional, connected and automated driving: A design from cyber–physical systems perspective",10.1016/j.trc.2021.102984,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"A comprehensive assessment of connected and automated driving is imperative before its large-scale deployment in reality, which can be economically and effectively implemented via a credible simulation platform. Nonetheless, the key components of traffic dynamics, vehicle modeling, and traffic environment are oversimplified in existing simulators. Current traffic simulators normally simplify the function of connected and autonomous vehicles by proposing incremental improvements to the conventional traffic flow modeling methods, which cannot reflect the characteristics of the realistic connected and autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, typical autonomous vehicle simulators only focus on individual function verification in some specific traffic scenarios, omitting the network-level evaluation by integrating both large-scale traffic networks and vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication. This paper designs a comprehensive simulation platform for conventional, connected and automated driving from a transportation cyber–physical system perspective, which tightly combines the core components of V2X communication, traffic networks, and autonomous/conventional vehicle model. Specifically, three popular open-source simulators SUMO, Omnet++, and Webots are integrated and connected via the traffic control interface, and the whole simulation platform will be deployed in a Client/Server model. As the demonstration, two typical applications, traffic flow optimization and vehicle eco-driving, are implemented in the simulation platform. The proposed platform provides an ideal and credible testbed to explore the potential social/economic impact of connected and automated driving from the individual level to the large-scale network level.",0968-090X,Not found
Developing a decentralized signal control strategy considering link storage capacity,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102971,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This paper proposes a double pressure (DP) signal control strategy that takes into account finite link storage capacity. Two types of pressure measures, including an endogenous and an exogenous pressure, are defined. The endogenous pressure is associated with the estimated exit-flow during a signal phase in the next time period, while the exogenous pressure is a virtual pressure associated with the downstream links. The properties of the proposed signal control strategy, including localized waiting time minimization and queue length stabilization at each isolated intersection were discussed. The performance of the proposed signal control strategy was evaluated with two testing networks via simulation, including a network with an isolated signalized intersection and a network with multiple signalized intersections. We compared the performance of the proposed DP control strategy with three existing strategies, including the fixed signal control, adaptive signal control and a back-pressure algorithm based control strategy proposed by previous studies. The test results show promise of the proposed DP control strategy in improving network travel time and queue stability when compared with several state-of-art decentralized control strategies, even though we acknowledge that future efforts in extending the decentralized strategy towards a better system-wide coordination are warranted.",0968-090X,Not found
Transferability improvement in short-term traffic prediction using stacked LSTM network,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102977,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Short-term traffic flow forecasting is a key element in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to provide proactive traffic state information to road network operators. A variety of methods to predict traffic variables in the short-term can be found in the literature, ranging from time-series algorithms, machine learning tools and deep learning methods to a selective hybrid of these approaches. Despite the advances in prediction techniques, a challenging problem that affects the application of such methods in the real world is the prevalence of insufficient data across an entire network. It is rare that extensive historical training data required for model training are available for all the links in a city. In order to address this data insufficiency problem, this paper applies transfer learning techniques to machine learning methods in short-term traffic prediction. All the traffic data used in this paper were collected from Highways England road networks in the UK. The results show that through improving the transferability of machine learning-based models, the computational burden due to the model training process can be significantly reduced and the prediction accuracy under data deficient scenarios can be improved for one-step ahead prediction. However, the prediction accuracy gradually decreases in multi-step ahead prediction. It is also found that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid method is highly dependent upon consistency between datasets but less dependent on geographical attributes of links.",0968-090X,Not found
The benefits of autonomous vehicles for community-based trip sharing,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102929,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This work reconsiders the concept of community-based trip sharing proposed by Hasan et al. (2018) that leverages the structure of commuting patterns and urban communities to optimize trip sharing. It aims at quantifying the benefits of autonomous vehicles for community-based trip sharing, compared to a car-pooling platform where vehicles are driven by their owners. In the considered problem, each rider specifies a desired arrival time for her inbound trip (commuting to work) and a departure time for her outbound trip (commuting back home). In addition, her commute time cannot deviate too much from the duration of a direct trip. Prior work motivated by reducing parking pressure and congestion in the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, showed that a car-pooling platform for community-based trip sharing could reduce the number of vehicles by close to 60%. This paper studies the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles in further reducing the number of vehicles needed to serve all these commuting trips. It proposes a column-generation procedure that generates and assembles mini routes to serve inbound and outbound trips, using a lexicographic objective that first minimizes the required vehicle count and then the total travel distance. The optimization algorithm is evaluated on a large-scale, real-world dataset of commute trips from the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The results of the optimization show that it can leverage autonomous vehicles to reduce the daily vehicle usage by 92%, improving upon the results of the original Commute Trip Sharing Problem by 34%, while also reducing daily vehicle miles traveled by approximately 30%. These results demonstrate the significant potential of autonomous vehicles for the shared commuting of a community to a common work destination.",0968-090X,Not found
Railway capacity estimation considering vehicle circulation: Integrated timetable and vehicles scheduling on hybrid time-space networks,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102961,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Railway capacity is a vague concept, related to the possibility to run a maximal transport performance given a set of available resources. While most approaches focus only on infrastructure resources (i.e. availability of train paths), we include both infrastructure and vehicle resources in a capacity estimation problem. We study the railway capacity estimation problem applying an associated timetable saturation method; in other words, the capacity is related to a timetable where no additional trains can be added. We use optimization methods to find such a timetable integrating explicitly variables and constraints from vehicle circulation. A hybrid time–space network describes the integrated timetabling and vehicles scheduling problem, based on which an integer programming model can be formulated, to maximize the overall transportation performance. A Lagrangian relaxation-based decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, and is shown able to scale to large instances efficiently. The integrated scheduling problem is decomposed into a timetabling sub-problem and a vehicle circulation sub-problem by dualizing the consistency constraints linking the two. A new heuristic, based on the concept of timetable intensity, is employed to improve the quality of the feasible (non-relaxed) solution found.

Domain adaptation from daytime to nighttime: A situation-sensitive vehicle detection and traffic flow parameter estimation framework,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102946,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Vehicle detection in traffic surveillance images is an important approach to obtain vehicle data and rich traffic flow parameters. Recently, deep learning based methods have been widely used in vehicle detection with high accuracy and efficiency. However, deep learning based methods require a large number of manually labeled ground truths (bounding box of each vehicle in each image) to train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the modern urban surveillance cameras, there are already many manually labeled ground truths in daytime images for training CNN, while there are little or much less manually labeled ground truths in nighttime images. In this paper, we focus on the research to make maximum usage of labeled daytime images (Source Domain) to help the vehicle detection in unlabeled nighttime images (Target Domain). For this purpose, we propose a new situation-sensitive method based on Faster R-CNN with Domain Adaptation (DA) to improve the vehicle detection at nighttime. Furthermore, a situation-sensitive traffic flow parameter estimation method is developed based on the traffic flow theory. We collected a new dataset of 2,200 traffic images (1,200 for daytime and 1,000 for nighttime) of 57,059 vehicles to evaluate the proposed method for the vehicle detection. Another new dataset with three 1,800-frame daytime videos and one 1,800-frame nighttime video of about 260 K vehicles was collected to evaluate and show the estimated traffic flow parameters in different situations.

Traffic congestion and travel time prediction based on historical congestion maps and identification of consensual days,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102920,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In this paper, a new practice-ready method for the real-time estimation of traffic conditions and travel times on highways is introduced. First, after a principal component analysis, observation days of a historical dataset are clustered. Two different methods are compared: a Gaussian Mixture Model and a k-means algorithm. The clustering results reveal that congestion maps of days of the same group have substantial similarity in their traffic conditions and dynamic. Such a map is a binary visualization of the congestion propagation on the freeway, giving more importance to the traffic dynamics. Second, a consensus day is identified in each cluster as the most representative day of the community according to the congestion maps. Third, this information obtained from the historical data is used to predict traffic congestion propagation and travel times. Thus, the first measurements of a new day are used to determine which consensual day is the closest to this new day. The past observations recorded for that consensual day are then used to predict future traffic conditions and travel times. This method is tested using ten months of data collected on a French freeway and shows very encouraging results.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-layer multi-rate model predictive control for vehicle platooning under IEEE 802.11p,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102905,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Vehicle platooning has gained attention for its potential to increase road capacity and safety, and higher fuel efficiency. Platoon controls are implemented over Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication, in-vehicle networks and Electronic Control Units (ECUs). V2V communication has a low message rate imposed by the V2V standard compared to the rate of modern in-vehicle networks and ECUs. The platoon control strategy should take into account such multi-rate nature of the implementation architecture for higher performance. Current literature does not explicitly consider such real-life constraints. We propose a two-layered control framework for vehicle platoons wirelessly communicating complying with the industrial standard IEEE 802.11p. In the upper-layer, vehicles receive state information from the immediate preceding vehicle over a control channel at 10 Hz under the IEEE 802.11p standard with occasional packet drops. Using such information and the vehicle state information, the engine control system, i.e.the lower-layer, realizes the desired vehicle state (e.g., acceleration) over the fast and reliable in-vehicle networks (e.g., FlexRay, Ethernet). In this work, a distributed model predictive control framework is proposed for the upper-layer targeting a Predecessor-Follower (PF) topology. A state-feedback control scheme is proposed for realizing the desired vehicle states for the lower-layer. Our framework minimizes the inter-vehicle distance and the tracking error enforcing collision avoidance and robustness against packet drops at the upper-layer. We validate our algorithm in simulation using our co-simulation framework CReTS and on an embedded platform, developed by Cohda Wireless and NXP, running in real time and communicating through the IEEE 802.11p standard. With extensive simulations and experiments, we evaluate the performance and feasibility of the proposed framework under a number of practical constraints.

Lateral collision risk assessment of parallel routes in ocean area based on space-based ADS-B,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102970,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In order to ensure the safe operation of parallel routes in the ocean area, it is necessary to assess the risk of lateral collision of routes. The data used in the assessment often come from the real flights, while the traditional land-based ADS-B equipment has limited coverage and cannot be used for research. The space-based ADS-B system can receive and send the flight position of the aircraft over the ocean area. In this paper, the ocean tracks in space-based ADS-B data are first extracted. According to the different route structures, the data of fixed route and flexible route are preprocessed by segmented Kalman filter and cubic polynomial fitting method respectively. Then the processed track position error is calculated, and Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) median method is used to test the normal distribution of the error, and k-means clustering is used to obtain the clustering center and occurrence frequency of positioning error and flight error. Finally, a collision risk model based on Bayesian network is established, and the error distribution parameters and occurrence frequency are brought into the model to evaluate the collision risk of parallel routes in the ocean area. The results show that the lateral collision risk based on space-based ADS-B ocean flight data is lower than 0.5 × 10−8 times/hour specified by ICAO when the fixed route separation is 14n miles and the flexible route separation is 49n miles. And the actual lateral interval of the Pacific flexible route is 50n miles (Jiang, 2010), which meets the safety target level.",0968-090X,Not found
A big-data driven approach to analyzing and modeling human mobility trend under non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102955,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"During the unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) challenge, non-pharmaceutical interventions became a widely adopted strategy to limit physical movements and interactions to mitigate virus transmissions. For situational awareness and decision-support, quickly available yet accurate big-data analytics about human mobility and social distancing is invaluable to agencies and decision-makers. This paper presents a big-data-driven analytical framework that ingests terabytes of data on a daily basis and quantitatively assesses the human mobility trend during COVID-19. Using mobile device location data of over 150 million monthly active samples in the United States (U.S.), the study successfully measures human mobility with three main metrics at the county level: daily average number of trips per person; daily average person-miles traveled; and daily percentage of residents staying home. A set of generalized additive mixed models is employed to disentangle the policy effect on human mobility from other confounding effects including virus effect, socio-demographic effect, weather effect, industry effect, and spatiotemporal autocorrelation. Results reveal the policy plays a limited, time-decreasing, and region-specific effect on human movement. The stay-at-home orders only contribute to a 3.5%-7.9% decrease in human mobility, while the reopening guidelines lead to a 1.6%-5.2% mobility increase. Results also indicate a reasonable spatial heterogeneity among the U.S. counties, wherein the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, income levels, industry structure, age and racial distribution play important roles. The data informatics generated by the framework are made available to the public for a timely understanding of mobility trends and policy effects, as well as for time-sensitive decision support to further contain the spread of the virus.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal parking management of connected autonomous vehicles: A control-theoretic approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102924,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In this paper we develop a continuous-time stochastic dynamic model for the optimal parking management of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in the presence of multiple parking lots within a given area. Inspired by the well-known Lotka-Volterra equations, a mathematical model is developed to explicitly incorporate the interactions among those parking garages under consideration. Time-dependent parking space availability is considered as the system state, while the dynamic price of parking is naturally used as the control input which can be properly chosen by the parking garage operators from the admissible set. By regulating parking rates, the total demand for parking can be distributed among the set of parking lots under question. Further, we formulate an optimal control problem (called Bolza problem) with the objective of maintaining the availability (managing the demand) of each parking garage at a desired level, which could potentially reduce traffic congestion as well as fuel consumption of CAVs. Based on the necessary conditions of optimality given by Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP), we develop a computational algorithm to address the nonlinear optimization problem and formally prove its convergence. A series of Monte Carlo simulations is conducted under various scenarios and the corresponding optimization problems are solved determining the optimal pricing policy for each parking lot. Since the stochastic dynamic model is general and the control inputs, i.e., parking rates, are easy to implement, it is believed that the procedures presented here will shed light on the parking management of CAVs in the near future.",0968-090X,Not found
Analytical approach to solve the problem of aircraft passenger boarding during the coronavirus pandemic,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102931,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The corona pandemic significantly changes the processes of aircraft and passenger handling at the airport. In our contribution, we focus on the time-critical process of aircraft boarding, where regulations regarding physical distances between passengers will significantly increase boarding time. The passenger behavior is implemented in a field-validated stochastic cellular automata model, which is extended by a module to evaluate the transmission risk. We propose an improved boarding process by considering that most of the passengers are travel together and should be boarded and seated as a group. The NP-hard seat allocation of groups with minimized individual interactions between groups is solved with a genetic algorithm. Then, the improved seat allocation is used to derive an associated boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission. Our results show that the consideration of groups will significantly contribute to a faster boarding (reduction of time by about 60%) and less transmission risk (reduced by 85%) compared to the standard random boarding procedures applied in the pandemic scenario.",0968-090X,Not found
Incorporating multimodal coordination into timetabling optimization of the last trains in an urban railway network,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102889,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Urban rail transit (URT) provides efficient and low-cost services for passengers. It is a common issue for operators to coordinate the last trains of a URT network. This paper discusses three models in a progressive fashion to optimize the last train timetable incorporating multimodal coordination. The first model maximizes the transferability at transfer stations without the distinction of the stations. The second model, based on a refined classification of stations and lines, optimizes the transferability at transfer stations between different transport modes. The third model maximizes the multimodal coordination taking into account the space-time distribution of the arrivals and departures of the connecting modes. These models are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming by linearization techniques for finding the optimal timetable solutions. The proposed models are tested in the Beijing URT network connecting three railway stations and two airport terminals.

In this paper, we develop a joint revealed preference-stated preference model for the choice between pooled versus private ride-hailing that (a) accommodates a suite of individual-level socio-demographics, individual-level psycho-social attributes, built environment variables, and trip-level variables, and (b) explicitly recognizes the importance of considering familiarity with pooled ride-hailing (RH) as an integral element of the pooled RH choice process. The primary source of data for the analysis is drawn from a 2019 survey of Austin, Texas residents. Our results underscore the value of using psycho-social latent constructs in the adoption of current and emerging mobility services, both in terms of improved prediction fit as well as in terms of designing proactive strategies to promote pooled RH service adoption. Women, older adults, and non-Hispanic/non-Latino Whites have a low propensity to choose the pooled RH mode, while employed individuals, highly educated individuals, and those living in high density urban areas have a high propensity. Overall, the average VTT estimate is $27.80 per hour for commute travel, $19.40 per hour for shopping travel, and $10.70 per hour for leisure travel, while the willingness to pool (that is, the willingness to pay to not pool a ride or WTS) averages about 62 cents for commute travel, $1.70 for shopping travel and $1.32 for leisure travel.

Model-free perimeter metering control for two-region urban networks using deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102949,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Various perimeter metering control strategies have been proposed for urban traffic networks that rely on the existence of well-defined relationships between network productivity and accumulation, known more commonly as network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFD). Most existing perimeter metering control strategies require accurate modeling of traffic dynamics with full knowledge of the network MFD and dynamic equations to describe how vehicles move across regions of the network. However, such information is generally difficult to obtain and subject to error. Some model free perimeter metering control schemes have been recently proposed in the literature. However, these existing approaches require estimates of network properties (e.g., the critical accumulation associated with maximum network productivity) in the controller designs. In this paper, a model free deep reinforcement learning perimeter control (MFDRLPC) scheme is proposed for two-region urban networks that features agents with either continuous or discrete action spaces. The proposed agents learn to select control actions through a reinforcement learning process without assuming any information about environment dynamics. Results from extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed agents: (a) can consistently learn perimeter control strategies under various environment configurations; (b) are comparable in performance to the state-of-the-art, model predictive control (MPC); and, (c) are highly transferable to a wide range of traffic conditions and dynamics in the environment.",0968-090X,Not found
Measurement and prediction of driver trust in automated vehicle technologies: An application of hand position transition probability matrix,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102957,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Driver trust has a great impact on the intention to accept, use, and adapt to automated vehicles. To date, driver trust in automated vehicle technologies has mostly been estimated by subjective data. Currently available objective measures of driver trust primarily rely on self-reported ratings as the ground truth, while the largely reported inconsistency between drivers’ self-reported trust levels and observed actual behavior suggests that drivers’ trust measures shall not solely rely on subjective reporting values. To address the issue, this study proposes an objective method to assess and predict driver trust in automated vehicle technologies, by using the transition probability matrix of drivers’ hand positions during automated vehicle system engagement. An on-road experiment was conducted on public roadways in real traffic. Data on use frequencies of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-reported trust ratings were collected and combined in classifying driver trust levels: lower, medium, and higher based on the K-means clustering results. Drivers’ hand positions during ADAS engagement (i.e., during lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist system uses) were then found closely associated with their trust levels. Differences of frequencies and transition probabilities for hand positions were further compared within and across the three trust groups. Results showed that drivers from the lower, medium, and higher trust groups were more likely to keep hands on the top, mid, and low positions of the wheel, respectively. Factors affecting driver trust in automated vehicle technologies were also explored through mixed model analyses. Middle-aged drivers placed more trust in ADAS than younger drivers, while female drivers exhibited greater trust than male drivers. The Random Forests algorithm was applied to build a prediction model for driver trust in automated vehicle technologies, by inputting the hand position transition probability matrix, age, gender, and ADAS types as independent variables. The overall prediction accuracy was approximately 80%. Findings in this study could contribute to the objective and real-time estimations of driver trust in automated vehicle technologies.",0968-090X,Not found
From Twitter to traffic predictor: Next-day morning traffic prediction using social media data,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102938,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods, such as autoregressive or spatio-temporal models, is often extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight (called ‘next-day morning traffic prediction’ thereafter). In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people’s work and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides, people’s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning (by 5am) are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute congestion using people’s tweeting profiles extracted by 5am. In most cases, the tweet information collected by the midnight before is sufficient to make good prediction for next-day morning traffic. The Pittsburgh study supports that this framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion variation, while its prediction performance being no worse than baseline methods on other roads. Through experiments, we demonstrate our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights. The proposed social media empowered framework can be a promising tool for real-time traffic management and potentially extended for traffic prediction at other times of day.",0968-090X,Not found

Different from other short-term traffic forecasting methods, the short-term OD flow prediction possesses three unique characteristics: (1) data availability: real-time OD flow is not available during the prediction; (2) data dimensionality: the dimension of the OD flow is much higher than the cardinality of transportation networks; (3) data sparsity: URT OD flow is spatiotemporally sparse. There is a great need to develop novel OD flow forecasting method that explicitly considers the unique characteristics of the URT system. To this end, a channel-wise attentive split–convolutional neural network (CAS-CNN) is proposed. The proposed model consists of many novel components such as the channel-wise attention mechanism and split CNN. In particular, an inflow/outflow-gated mechanism is innovatively introduced to address the data availability issue.

While most previous studies have analysed single modes, only few comparative studies of two modes exist and none so-far have analysed competition or mode choice at a high spatiotemporal resolution for more than two modes. To this end, we develop a generally applicable methodology to model and analyse shared micromobility competition and mode choice using widely accessible vehicle location data. We apply this methodology to estimate the first comprehensive mode choice models between four different micromobility modes using the largest and densest empirical shared micromobility dataset to-date. Our results suggest that mode choice is nested (dockless and docked) and dominated by distance and time of day. Docked modes are preferred for commuting. Hence, docking infrastructure for currently dockless modes could be vital for bolstering micromobility as an attractive alternative to private cars to tackle urban congestion during rush hours. Furthermore, our results reveal a fundamental relationship between fleet density and usage. A “plateau effect” is observed with decreasing marginal utility gains for increasing fleet densities.

Strategies for chassis dislocation management at container ports: repositioning and yard consolidation,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102782,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Marine container chassis have emerged at the forefront of container port operations in the U.S., with chassis dislocation being a major new problem. To manage chassis dislocation, two strategies are presented in this paper. In the first strategy, a model is presented to support the chassis repositioning decision faced by chassis pool operators. We consider the case that an (accurate) probability distribution of chassis demand is unknown. For such a case, it is generally not possible to determine the exact optimal number of chassis to reposition. Lower and upper bounds on the optimal cost are derived that are explicitly shown to converge to the minimum cost. The second strategy is chassis yard consolidation, which has the potential to reduce the variance in chassis demand and, therefore, lead to more accurate demand forecasts.

The system consists of three levels of models. At the vehicle level, a state transition diagram is designed for different modes of operations of CAVs including eco-trajectory planning, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and collision avoidance. At the intersection level, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is formulated to optimize the signal timing plan and arrival time of CAVs, with consideration of CACC platooning behaviors. At the corridor level, link performance functions are applied to calculate the total delay of the coordinated phases of each intersection, and a linear programming (LP) problem is formulated to optimize the offsets for every cycle, which are then passed to the intersection level. Simulation results from a calibrated real-world arterial corridor show that both mobility and fuel economy benefits from the cooperative driving framework. The total delay is reduced by 2.2%−33.0% and fuel consumption by 3.9%−7.4%, with different mixture of vehicle compositions and CAV penetration rates (e.g., 0%−100%). Sensitivity analysis on volume fluctuation is performed, which confirms the benefits of the dynamic offset optimization.",0968-090X,Not found
A multi-vehicle communication system to assess the safety and mobility of connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102887,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to improve both traffic safety and efficiency by reducing the human driver errors. Recently, many researchers have focused on the simulation-based studies in order to evaluate the benefits of CAVs due to the lack of real-world data. However, none of the previous studies have attempted to differentiate the benefits of CAVs over automated vehicles (AVs) by incorporating multiple preceding vehicle information (i.e., acceleration, position, etc.). This paper aims to fill the existing gap by utilizing separate car-following models for both CAVs and AVs in order to approximate their driving behavior in the Aimsun Next simulation platform. Additionally, a different car-following model is used for the connected vehicles (CVs) without automation by addressing the human driver compliance factor. This study also utilizes mixed penetration of CAV and CV with no automation. A well calibrated and validated simulation testbed is developed for SR417 in Orlando, Florida which is the base scenario in this study. To this end, the impact of CAVs, AVs, and CVs are evaluated based on both traffic efficiency (i.e., travel time) and safety (i.e., traffic conflicts) under various market penetration rates (MPRs). The traffic efficiency results show that travel time is significantly reduced for any MPRs of CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs compared to the base scenario. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model is developed to quantify the travel time improvement for CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs. The results suggest at least 20% penetration is required for CAVs to get travel time improvement while 40% penetration is needed for AVs. Also, CAV significantly outperforms AV for the same MPRs. For the safety assessment, traffic conflicts are estimated by using different surrogate measures i.e., time-to-collision (TTC) and time exposed time-to-collision (TET). The results imply that crash risk is significantly reduced for CAVs, AVs, and the mixture of CVs and CAVs scenarios compared to the base condition. A Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model is developed in order to model the number of traffic conflicts as a function of MPRs of CAVs, AVs, mixture of CVs and CAVs, and traffic parameters. The results confirm that CAVs are more efficient in reducing crash risk compared to AVs for the same MPR. The mix penetration rate of CV (60%) and CAV (20%) shows almost similar reduction of crash risk with the 80% MPR of AV. Also, crash risk analysis based on different vehicle types shows that CAVs driving behavior is safer compared to the AVs. Finally, the results of this study indicate a significant improvement of both traffic efficiency and safety by implementing CAV with multivehicle communication system on the freeway segments.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-community passenger demand prediction at region level based on spatio-temporal graph convolutional network,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102951,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Region-level passenger demand prediction plays an important role in the coordination of travel demand and supply in the urban public transportation system. The complex urban road network structure leads to irregular shapes and arrangements of regions, which poses a challenge for capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of demand generated in different regions. In this study, we propose a multi-community spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (MC_STGCN) framework to predict passenger demand at a multi-region level by exploring spatio-temporal correlations among regions. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is applied to encode the temporal correlation in regions into a vector. On the other hand, the spatial correlations among regions are encoded into two graphs through the graph convolutional network (GCN): geographically adjacent graph and functional similarity graph. Then, a prediction module based on the Louvain algorithm is used to accomplish the passenger demand prediction of multi-regions. The two real-world taxi order data collected in Shenzhen City and New York City are used in model validation and comparison. The numerical results show that the MC_STGCN model outperforms both classical time-series prediction methods and deep learning approaches. Moreover, in order to better illustrate the superiority of the proposed model, we further discuss the improvement of prediction performance though spatio-temporal correlation modeling and analyzing, the effectiveness of community detection compared with random classification of regions, and the advantages of regional level prediction compared with grid-based prediction models.",0968-090X,Not found
Predicting cycle-level traffic movements at signalized intersections using machine learning models,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102930,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Predicting accurate traffic parameters is fundamental and cost-effective in providing traffic applications with required information. Many studies adopted various parametric and machine learning techniques to predict traffic parameters such as travel time, speed, and traffic volume. Machine learning techniques have achieved promising results in predicting traffic volume. However, the utilized data were mostly aggregated in 5, 10, or 15 min. This study attempts to bridge the research gap by predicting signal cycle-level through and left-turn movements in real-time at signalized intersections. The utilized data were limited to the upstream and downstream intersections at the corridor level. Aiming to achieve this objective, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models were developed using datsets that contain variables from different number of utilized cycles (4, 6, and 8 cycles). The three models were evaluated by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results showed that the performance measures for the three models were close. Meanwhile. the GRU model using variables from six previous cycles outperformed the others. This modelling approach was followed to predict traffic movements for different time horizons (five cycles ahead). The performance measures values were close for the five predicted cycles. It is expected that the model could help in obtaining accurate traffic movement at intersections, which could be used for adjusting adaptive signal timing and improve signal and intersections’ efficiency.",0968-090X,Not found

It is generally expected to improve vehicle utilization rate, and therefore alleviate traffic congestion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. A few recent theoretical studies are conducted, mainly focusing on the equilibrium analysis of the ride-sourcing markets with ride-pooling services and the impacts of ride-pooling services on transit ridership and traffic congestion. In these studies, there are three key measures that distinguish ride-pooling service analysis from the non-pooling ride-sourcing market analysis. The first is the proportion of passengers who are pool-matched(referred to as pool-matching probability), the second is passengers’ average detour distance, and the third is average vehicle routing distance to pick up and drop off all passengers with different origins and destinations in one specific ride. These three measures are determined by passenger demand for ride-pooling and matching strategies. However, due to the complex nature of ride-resourcing market, it is difficult to analytically determine the relationships between these measures and passenger demand. To fill this research gap, this paper attempts to empirically ascertain these relationships through extensive experiments based on the actual on-demand mobility data obtained from Chengdu, Haikou, and Manhattan. We are surprised to find that the relationships between the three measures (pool-matching probability, passengers’ average detour distance, average vehicle routing distance) and number of passengers in the matching pool (which reflects passenger demand) can be fitted by some simple curves (with fairly high goodness-of-fit) or there exist elegant empirical laws on these relationships. Our findings are insightful and useful to theoretical modeling and applications in ride-resourcing markets, such as evaluation of the impacts of ride-pooling on transit usage and traffic congestion.",0968-090X,Not found
A column-and-row generation approach for the flying sidekick travelling salesman problem,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102913,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FS-TSP) is a parcel delivery problem arising in the last-mile logistics, where the distribution plan of a driver-operated truck assisted by a drone (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) has to be defined. The FS-TSP is a variant of the TSP where routing decisions are integrated with customer-to-drone and customer-to-truck assignment decisions and truck-and-drone synchronization constraints. The objective is the minimization of the time required to serve all the customers, taking into account drone payload capacity and battery power constraints. In this work we provide a new representation of the FS-TSP based on the definition of an extended graph. This representation allows to model the problem by a new and compact integer linear programming formulation, where the synchronization issue is tackled in a column generation fashion, thus avoiding the usage of big-M constraints, representing one of the main drawbacks of the models present in literature. The proposed formulation has been solved by an exact approach which combines a Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a column generation procedure, strengthened by variable fixing strategies and new valid inequalities specifically defined for the problem. The proposed method has been experienced on a large set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the proposed approach either is competitive or outperforms the best exact approach present in literature for the FS-TSP. Indeed, it is able to provide the optimal solution for all small size instances with 10 customers and for several medium size instances with 20 customers, some of them never solved before.",0968-090X,Not found
A time-dependent shared autonomous vehicle system design problem,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102956,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The emergence of the shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) provides new opportunities and challenges for the fashionable car-sharing mode. This study proposes a time-dependent SAV system design problem by jointly optimizing fleet size, parking infrastructure deployment, and daily operation of the system for infrastructure planning in the long run.

By incorporating the link transmission model (LTM) as the traffic flow model, the daily operation problem (DOP) of the SAV system is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem. Further, the time-dependent SAV system design problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The LP relaxation of the proposed MILP problem could provide a tight lower bound, and a diving heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the proposed MILP problem.

"Assessing traffic disturbance, efficiency, and safety of the mixed traffic flow of connected vehicles and traditional vehicles by considering human factors",10.1016/j.trc.2020.102934,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In the foreseeable future, connected vehicles (CVs) will coexist with traditional vehicles (TVs) resulting in a complex mixed traffic environment and the success of CVs will depend on the characteristics of this mixed traffic. Therefore, before the large scale deployment of CVs, it is important to examine how CVs will influence the characteristics of the resultant mixed traffic. To achieve this aim, this study models the mixed traffic of TVs and CVs, and examines the traffic flow disturbance, efficiency, and safety. Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with estimation errors is utilised to model TVs since it incorporates human factors such as estimation errors. Whereas, connected vehicle driving strategy integrated with IDM is utilised to model CVs because it incorporates driver compliance, a critical human factor for the success of CVs. Moreover, two classes of drivers based on their compliance levels are considered, namely the high-compliance drivers and the low-compliance drivers, to comprehensively investigate the impact of driver compliance on the mixed traffic of CVs and TVs. Two simulation experiments are performed in this study. The first experiment is used to measure traffic flow disturbance and safety while the second is used to measure the traffic flow efficiency. Furthermore, a total of 7 mixed traffic environments are generated in each experiment via different combinations of TVs, CVs with low compliance drivers, and CVs with high compliance drivers. Another important point considered in the simulation is the spatially distribution of CVs in the platoon. As such, three platoon policies are investigated. In the first policy i.e., the best case, the CVs are spatially arranged with a motive to maximise benefits from CVs whereas in the second policy i.e., the worst case, the CVs are spatially arranged with a motive to minimise benefits from CVs. Finally, in the third platoon policy i.e., the random case, the CVs are distributed randomly in the platoon. This study demonstrates the importance of the spatial arrangement of CVs in a platoon at a given penetration rate and its impact on traffic flow disturbance, efficiency, and safety. Moreover, findings from this study underscores that CVs can supress the traffic flow disturbance, and enhance traffic flow efficiency, and safety; however, traffic engineers and policy makers have to be cautious regarding how CVs are distributed in a traffic stream when deploying these vehicles in the real world traffic environment.",0968-090X,Not found
An optimization model and traffic light control scheme for heterogeneous traffic systems,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102911,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In this paper, one type of heterogeneous traffic network, which consists of signalized intersections and non-signalized ones, is analyzed and modelled with a macroscopic model and logic constraints, which involves the evolution of the number of vehicles on each link and the leaving flow dynamics at each intersection. We propose a novel model describing the dynamic behaviors of such a system and the proposed model is validated via road tests in Singapore traffic network and simulations in VISSIM. A piecewise linear model is adopted to describe the traffic flow dynamics at each signalized intersection, while a platooning-like first-in-first-out (FIFO) model is proposed to depict the dynamics at each non-signalized intersection. A traffic light control problem for a heterogeneous traffic network is formulated based on the proposed macroscopic model as a mixed integer programming problem. Simulations indicate that the proposed optimal traffic control scheme could outperform the fixed-time traffic light control strategy and conventional actuated traffic light control scheme. Besides, we demonstrate potentials in developing a systematic planning approach on deciding which traffic intersections require signal control to ensure good traffic control performance.",0968-090X,Not found
Decoding pedestrian and automated vehicle interactions using immersive virtual reality and interpretable deep learning,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102962,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"To ensure pedestrian-friendly streets in the era of automated vehicles, reassessment of current policies, practices, design, rules and regulations of urban areas is of importance. This study investigates pedestrian crossing behaviour which, as an important element of urban dynamics, is expected to be affected by the presence of automated vehicles. For this purpose, an interpretable machine learning framework is proposed to explore factors affecting pedestrians’ wait time before crossing mid-block crosswalks in the presence of automated vehicles. To collect rich behavioural data, we developed a dynamic and immersive virtual reality experiment, with 180 participants from a heterogeneous population in 4 different locations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Pedestrian wait time behaviour is then analysed using a data-driven Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, in which the linear combination of the covariates is replaced by a flexible non-linear deep neural network. The proposed model achieved a 5% improvement in goodness of fit, but more importantly, enabled us to incorporate a richer set of covariates. A game theoretic based interpretability method is used to understand the contribution of different covariates to the time pedestrians wait before crossing. Results show that the presence of automated vehicles on roads, wider lane widths, high density on roads, limited sight distance, and lack of walking habits are the main contributing factors to longer wait times. Our study suggested that, to move towards pedestrian-friendly urban areas, educational programs for children, enhanced safety measures for seniors, promotion of active modes of transportation, and revised traffic rules and regulations should be considered.",0968-090X,Not found
A schedule-based timetable model for congested transit networks,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102925,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This study proposes a model and method for solving the transit timetabling problem with consideration of passenger path choices within a congested and schedule-based transit network. The model has two submodels: transit timetabling and passenger-equilibrium assignment. The transit timetabling submodel generates timetables to improve passengers’ journey experience based on the results of passenger-equilibrium assignment, whereas the passenger-equilibrium assignment loads passengers on transit vehicles based on a fixed vehicle capacity and timetable output from the transit timetabling. An iterative method is developed to connect these two submodels and efficiently determine an optimal solution. The iterative method includes an equilibrium assignment method to simulate passenger loading and suggests a decomposition approach for transit timetabling. The decomposition approach has a significant computational advantage when handling transit systems that involve hundreds of transit vehicles because the algorithm generates a timetable for one transit line in each step rather than for all transit lines. The decomposition approach can therefore handle relatively large problems with more transit lines. The suggested algorithms are analyzed with a hypothetical example and with the practically sized example of South China’s high-speed railway in terms of efficiency, optimality, and applicability.",0968-090X,Not found
Urban mobility analytics: A deep spatial–temporal product neural network for traveler attributes inference,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102921,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This study examines the potential of using smart card data in public transit systems to infer attributes of travelers, thereby facilitating a more user-centered public transport service design while reducing the use of expensive and time-consuming travel surveys. This is challenging since travel behaviors vary significantly over the population, space, and time and developing meaningful links between them and traveler attributes are not trivial. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive analysis of spatio-temporal travel behavior patterns using smart card data from the Greater Sydney area (Opal card), and then develop a Hybrid Neural Network to utilize spatial and temporal dependencies in the dataset. In particular, we first empirically analyze passengers’ movements and mobility patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives and design a set of discriminative features to characterize the patterns. We then propose a deep-learning-based framework to investigate spatial and temporal features in order to infer traveler attributes. The proposed modeling framework consists of two components, i.e., a Product-based Spatial–Temporal Module (PSTM) and an Auto-Encoder-based Compression Module (AECM). PSTM encodes the relationships across a variety of features while AECM derives useful spatial information from a transit stop matrix. The proposed model is tested and evaluated using a large-scale public transport dataset in the Greater Sydney area to infer two attributes of passengers, i.e., the age group and residential area. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against a number of established tools in the literature. The developed techniques can be potentially adapted to other domains where spatio-temporal features are critical, such as commercial/entertainment site selection and urban service planning.",0968-090X,Not found
"Modelling and solving the airport slot-scheduling problem with multi-objective, multi-level considerations",10.1016/j.trc.2020.102914,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In overly congested airports requests for landing and take-off slots are allocated according to the IATA World Scheduling Guidelines (WSG). A central concept of these guidelines is the prioritization of the satisfaction of the requested slots according to a hierarchy that recognizes historic usage rights of slots. A number of criteria have been proposed in the literature to optimize airport slot allocation decisions. Multi-objective programming models have been proposed to investigate the trade-offs of the slot allocation objectives for the same level of the slot hierarchy. However, the literature currently lacks models that can study in a systematic way the trade-offs among the scheduling objectives across all levels of the hierarchy and the airport schedule as a whole. To close the existing literature gap, we are proposing a new tri-objective slot allocation model (TOSAM) that considers total schedule displacement, maximum schedule displacement and demand-based fairness, and we introduce a multi-level, multi-objective algorithm to solve it. We are using real world slot request and airport capacity data to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Our computational results suggest that the systematic consideration of the interactions among the objectives of the different levels of the slot hierarchy, results to improved schedule-wide slot scheduling performance.

Drivers of participant's choices of monthly mobility bundles: Key behavioural findings from the Sydney Mobility as a Service (MaaS) trial,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102932,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Australia’s first Mobility as a Service (MaaS) trial commenced in April 2019 in Sydney.

This paper develops a mixed logit choice model to investigate the participants’ choice between PAYG and four subscription plans (or bundles) that were incrementally introduced over a 5-month period. This is the first paper to model real uptake as previous studies are based on stated preference data. New evidence is provided on what role financial savings, estimated using tracking technology embedded in the MaaS app, play in the context of modal offerings and a monthly subscription fee as well as socio-demographic and seasonal effects. Behaviourally, we present evidence on the extent of take up of each bundle relative to PAYG as well as elasticity estimates for all exogenous influences and estimates of willingness to pay and scenario assessment, particularly for how much someone would have to save over a previous month’s cost outlay to be willing to subscribe to a particular bundle in a subsequent month. Within the context of the trial, the findings suggest a substantial market for mobility bundles but PAYG is an option preferred by many, particularly those with varying travel needs.

Integrating probabilistic tensor factorization with Bayesian supervised learning for dynamic ridesharing pattern analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102916,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In the era of transportation big data, the analysis of mobility patterns generally involves large quantities of datasets with high-dimensional variables recording individual travelers’ activities and socio-economic attributes, bringing new challenges to researchers. Conventional regression-based models commonly require complex structures in depicting random or fixed effects with a considerable number of parameters to estimate, and state-of-the-art machine learning models are regarded as black-boxes that are not clear in interpreting the mechanism in human mobility. To overcome the challenges of capturing complex high-order relationships among variables of interest, this paper proposes a Bayesian supervised learning tensor factorization (BSTF) model for the classification of travel choices in the mobility pattern analysis. The BSTF model induces a hierarchical probabilistic structure between predictor variables and the dependent variable, which offers a nature supervised learning foundation via Bayesian inference. Latent class (LC) variables are considered in the BSTF model to discover hidden preferences/states among travelers associated with their mobility patterns. We apply the BSTF model to analyze passenger-side choice patterns between diverse service options on a ride-sourcing platform, drawing increasing attention during recent years. A case study with a real-world dynamic ridesharing dataset in Hangzhou, China, is conducted. Different cases of training sizes are utilized to fit the proposed BSTF model as well as some other state-of-the-art machine learning models. By identifying significant variables and derive their probabilistic relationship between service types (i.e., ridesharing, non-sharing, and taxi), the proposed BSTF model offers good performance in both classification accuracy and the interpretability of shared mobility.",0968-090X,Not found
Metamodel-based calibration of large-scale multimodal microscopic traffic simulation,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102859,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Agent-based microscopic traffic simulation models are gaining popularity over traditional trip-based traffic models due to their superiority in modeling household member interaction, car-sharing, vehicle interaction, etc. Calibrating these models is challenging due to the intrinsic complexity, e.g., nonlinearity, high simulation time, and lack of closed-form expressions. With multimodal large-scale networks, this problem becomes even more severe. This paper proposes a metamodel-based simulation optimization framework for calibrating an agent-based multimodal traffic microsimulator. The metamodel serves as a surrogate of the simulation model for faster and more tractable calibration optimization. In particular, a simplified multimodal traffic model is developed and incorporated in the metamodel. This paper also develops and compares three gradient-based metamodel schemes, taking account of the derivatives of link flows with respect to the calibration parameters in the metamodel fitting process. Numerical results on a toy network show that the proposed metamodel incorporating an analytical traffic model is more efficient and highly adaptable compared to the conventional pure polynomial metamodel schemes. Moreover, taking into account gradient information in the metamodels improves the performance of convergence and solution quality. The proposed metamodel-based method is further applied to calibrate the simulation of an actual network in Hong Kong.

The value pedestrians attribute to environmental information diminishes in route choice sequences,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102909,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Suppose someone wants to walk from one location to another location. In doing so, they either follow a pre-planned route or decide which way to go each time they reach a junction. Research into pedestrian dynamics has carefully studied route planning and single instances of decisions on routes. However, little is known about the decision-making processes in sequences of consecutive pedestrian route choices. Here, we propose the first mathematical model for this situation. Its key hypothesis is that the sensitivity of pedestrians to environmental information, such as signs or the movement of others, diminishes, the more decisions they make in sequence. To validate our model, we conduct a virtual reality experiment with over 200 participants. Our findings suggest that sensitivity to information diminishes for the experimental case when only information on the movement of others is available to pedestrians. Comparison of our model to situations when signs are present and to data from previously published work suggests that this effect cannot be detected in short sequences of route decisions that contain three or fewer decision points. We demonstrate the implications of this diminishing sensitivity to environmental information at the example of egress from a metro-station. While the proportion of pedestrians using a signposted shortest route may decrease, following behaviour is also suppressed which may result in more predictable route choice dynamics across pedestrian crowds. We advocate further study on this topic in real-world settings, to investigate the need for appropriate pedestrian route choice management strategies. Our experiment also provides preliminary insights into how different personality traits affect following behaviour and we suggest this opens another avenue for future investigation.",0968-090X,Not found

Many features impact on taxi time, including the route taken, aircraft category, operational mode of the airport, traffic congestion information, and local weather conditions. Working with real-world data for several international airports, we compare multiple prediction models and investigate the impact of these features, drawing conclusions on the most important features for accurately modelling taxi times. We show that high accuracy can be achieved with a small subset of the features consisting of those generally important across all airports (departure/arrival, distance, total turns, average speed and numbers of recent aircraft), and a small number of features specific to particular target airports. Moving from all features to this small subset results in less than a 1 percentage-point drop in movements correctly predicted within 1, 3 and 5 min.",0968-090X,Not found

Companies that offer these services are called Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) due to their internet-based nature. Although ride-sourcing is the most notorious service TNCs provide, little is known about to what degree its operations can interfere in traffic conditions, while replacing other transportation modes, or when a large number of idle vehicles is cruising for passengers. We experimentally analyze the efficiency of TNCs using taxi trip data from a Chinese megacity and an agent-based simulation with a trip-based MFD model for determining the speed. We investigate the effect of expanding fleet sizes for TNCs, passengers’ inclination towards sharing rides, and strategies to alleviate urban congestion. We observe that, although a larger fleet size reduces waiting time, it also intensifies congestion, which, in turn, prolongs the total travel time. Such congestion effect is so significant that it is nearly insensitive to passengers’ willingness to share and flexible supply. Finally, parking management strategies can prevent idle vehicles from cruising without assigned passengers, mitigating the negative impacts of ride-sourcing over congestion, and improving the service quality.",0968-090X,Not found

We consider the agencies of residential parking lots as the players to make collective decisions on behalf of the property owners, and study the market design problem for this new shared parking model. Specifically, we investigate how to assign to each agency a quota of parking spaces from every other agency that its commuters can book in advance through an e-platform and how to specify transfer prices for exchanges, with the objective to maximize agencies’ welfare. Our problem is a new discrete many-to-many exchange economy with multi-unit valuation. We design a stable exchange scheme based on the trading network theory, and show that this new scheme is efficient and in the core. In the real environment with random cancelations over time, we further develop a rolling-horizon rebalance procedure that minimizes the welfare loss. Computational experiments using real-world data demonstrate that our stable exchange scheme substantially outperforms the commonly adopted solutions based on the first-come-first-serve protocol and also reveal a variety of interesting insights for practice.",0968-090X,Not found
Urban flow prediction with spatial–temporal neural ODEs,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102912,124,2021-03-01,2021,3,"With the recent advances in deep learning, data-driven methods have shown compelling performance in various application domains enabling the Smart Cities paradigm. Leveraging spatial–temporal data from multiple sources for (citywide) traffic forecasting is a key to strengthen the smart city management in areas such as urban traffic control, abnormal event detection, etc. Existing approaches of traffic flow prediction mainly rely on the development of various deep neural networks –e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks such as ResNet are used for modeling spatial dependencies among different regions, whereas recurrent neural networks are increasingly implemented for temporal dynamics modeling. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches suffer from limitations of intensive computations, lack of capabilities to properly deal with missing values, and simplistic integration of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel urban flow prediction framework by generalizing the hidden states of the model with continuous-time dynamics of the latent states using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we introduce a discretize-then-optimize approach to improve and balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only guarantees the prediction error but also provides high flexibility for decision-makers. Furthermore, we investigate the factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that affect the city traffic volume and use separate neural networks to extract and disentangle the influencing factors, which avoids the brute-force data fusion in previous works. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, while requiring significantly less memory cost and fewer model parameters.",0968-090X,Not found
Double-balanced relocation optimization of one-way car-sharing system with real-time requests,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103071,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"One-way car-sharing systems, an increasingly prominent transportation means, are facing the vehicle imbalance issue with their emergence. To overcome the problem, operators have adopted a common strategy to relocate vehicles among stations by dispatchers. However, along with this approach come imbalanced dispatchers, demanding double-balanced optimization for relocation operations in vehicle relocation and dispatcher scheduling. In this paper, we propose an integrated model to determine the optimal requests served, relocation tasks, and dispatchers’ routes in order to minimize the generalized daily operational cost. The model adopts two different time granularities to obtain all the possible relocation tasks and the refined scheduling of dispatchers. Due to the dynamic nature and the scale of this double-balanced relocation problem, a hybrid solution algorithm is designed combining a rolling horizon algorithm with a customized decomposition algorithm. The planning horizon consists of several stages, each of which contains a sub-problem for the double-balanced relocation, and a customized decomposition is embedded to optimize it efficiently. Some computational experiments and a case study in Lanzhou, China are conducted to identify critical parameters and illustrate the performance of the proposed method.",0968-090X,Not found
A survey on autonomous vehicle control in the era of mixed-autonomy: From physics-based to AI-guided driving policy learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103008,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"This paper serves as an introduction and overview of the potentially useful models and methodologies from artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of transportation engineering for autonomous vehicle (AV) control in the era of mixed autonomy when AVs drive alongside human-driven vehicles (HV). It is the first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, and raise open questions. We divide the stage of AV deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AV-dominated, and the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and autonomous vehicles characterized? We also provide a list of public datasets and simulation software related to AVs. Hopefully this paper will not only inspire our transportation community to rethink the conventional models that are developed in the data-shortage era, but also start conversations with other disciplines, in particular robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a safe and efficient mixed traffic ecosystem.",0968-090X,Not found
The adverse impact of electric vehicles on traffic congestion in the morning commute,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103073,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Many governments around the world are striving to promote the development of EVs for EV’s sustainability and efficiency. However, EVs may induce extra traffic congestion in the morning commute. To illustrate this point, we incorporate the vehicle's energy consumption (EC) into the classical morning commute model to explore the EV's influence on the morning commute. First, we study the impact of the vehicle’s EC on the waiting time in the user equilibrium (UE) state. Second, the properties of commuter’s waiting time in the traffic system with EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) are analyzed. Finally, two interventions are proposed to alleviate the extra traffic congestion caused by EVs. The analytical and numerical results of this study reveal that i) EVs will induce extra traffic congestion, and ii) we can apply some interventions to alleviate the side effect of EVs and reap more benefits from EVs. The conclusions indicate that some interventions should be conducted when EVs enter the traffic system, which sheds light on the policymaking for the promotion of EVs.",0968-090X,Not found
A multi-faceted characterization of free-floating car sharing service usage,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102966,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"During the last decade, car sharing systems appeared in many cities and gained popularity. The research community has analyzed their current utilization trends in different contexts, their growth perspectives, and their gradual shift towards more sustainable technologies. Through the large and heterogeneous amount of car sharing usage data that is now available, researchers have been able to gain new insights into these services. In this paper, we provide an extensive characterization of the Free-Floating Car Sharing (FFCS) service usage in 23 cities in Europe and North America over a 14-month period. From our data about FFCS services, we detail fleet size, operating area, and characteristics of the car bookings and rentals. We also identify temporal patterns that are peculiar to specific cities and countries. We further highlight urban zones with high attractiveness or with a high rental generation rate. Finally, we compare the systems relying on internal combustion engine cars with those based on electric vehicles in terms of various indicators, including the influence on car refueling. The results show that car utilization patterns are rather variable across cities with the highest per-car utilization rate in Madrid. The majority of the cities show negative or stable usage trends due to either the reduced appeal of the service or the presence of inefficiencies in the service provision. These data-driven insights may help system managers assess the provided services’ profitability and sustainability from multiple perspectives.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamics of local interactions and evacuation behaviors in a social network,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103056,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"This paper examines how social interaction affects the choice to evacuate during a network formation process. The primary objective is to evaluate in detail the influence of other individuals by considering how influencers and entire network structures affect one-to-one interactions. This study proposes an analytical framework for the simultaneous evaluation of local interaction and face-to-face communication network formation. This framework is appropriate for dynamic scenarios, because local interactions strongly influence human decision-making and because network formation changes over time. Our detailed local interaction model, which is based on Brock and Durlauf (2001), analyzes the differences in the interaction weights related to pairs and behaviors. We estimate the utility and the asymmetric weight parameters in the local interaction model by using the nested pseudo-likelihood approach. Our proposed network formation model, which is based on the discrete choice model, evaluates the probability of face-to-face communication and the spatial correlations of the interaction pairs in an area. Our case study validates the introduction of (1) asymmetric weights of interaction in the evacuation departure choice and (2) spatial correlation in the network formation model, using the behavioral data collected during a no-notice disaster in a devastated settlement. In numerical simulations, the proposed evaluation framework can effectively illustrate the impact of network structures on the choice probabilities influenced by interactions. Additionally, the framework is useful for evaluating the critical measures for prompt evacuation.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic planning for simultaneous recharging and relocation of shared electric taxies: A sequential MILP approach,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102933,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Short driving range, limited chargers, and long charging times challenge the profitability of electric taxi operations. In this paper, a charging algorithm is developed to accompany a taxi service with online trip requests, which uses a private charging infrastructure for both slow and fast charging. The vehicle charging curves are assumed to be piece-wise linear functions. The proposed algorithm uses historical operation data to generate a pro-active planning that avoids queuing of vehicles. The algorithm is built upon three sequential, iterative, finite-horizon Mixed Integer Linear Programs. This iterative process, in which the three MILPs are solved sequentially, allows the current time-step to be optimized, while taking future time-steps into account. This is achieved by optimizing over multiple time-steps, but only implementing the current time-step in each iteration. The sequential aspect of the algorithm allows the vast amount of information over time and space to be exploited for charging trip decisions in real time, while maintaining a tractable computation time. The first level with the longest horizon is an aggregated, daily problem, that plans the charging duration required for the fleet. The second level has a horizon of up-to three hours and is an aggregated, zone-based problem for determining charger selection and empty vehicle relocations. The third level translates the outputs of the first two problems to executable decisions for individual vehicles based on their real-time location, state of charge, and assigned passengers. The first level is the most computationally expensive and is solved using Column Generation. The performance of the first two levels is then independent of the fleet size, which makes the algorithm highly scalable. A case study with travel data for the city of Barcelona is used to test the model. Results show that the proposed method can utilize the full capacity of the charging infrastructure, and improve the number of accepted requests by 14% compared to employing a naive charging rule.",0968-090X,Not found
Regulating mobility-on-demand services: Tri-level model and Bayesian optimization solution approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103075,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The goal of this paper is to develop a modeling framework that captures the inter-decision dynamics between mobility service providers (MSPs) and travelers that can be used to optimize and analyze policies/regulations related to MSPs. To meet this goal, the paper proposes a tri-level mathematical programming model with a public-sector decision maker (i.e. a policymaker/regulator) at the highest level, the MSP in the middle level, and travelers at the lowest level. The public-sector decision maker aims to maximize social welfare via implementing regulations, policies, plans, transit service designs, etc. The MSP aims to maximize profit by adjusting its service designs. Travelers aim to maximize utility by changing their modes and routes. The travelers’ decisions depend on the regulator and MSP’s decisions while the MSP decisions themselves depend on the regulator’s decisions. To solve the tri-level mathematical program, the study employs Bayesian optimization (BO) within a simulation–optimization solution approach. At the lowest level, the solution approach includes an agent-based transportation system simulation model to capture travelers’ behavior subject to specific decisions made by the regulator and MSP. At the middle and highest levels, the solution approach employs BO for the MSP to maximize profit and for the regulator to maximize social welfare. The agent-based transportation simulation model includes a mode choice model, a road network, a transit network, and an MSP providing automated mobility-on-demand (AMOD) service with shared rides. The modeling and solution approaches are applied to Munich, Germany in order to validate the model. The case study investigates the tolls and parking costs the city administration should set, as well as changes in the public transport budget and a limitation of the AMOD fleet size. Best policy settings are derived for two social welfare definitions, in both of which the AMOD fleet size is not regulated as the shared-ride AMOD service provides significant value to travelers in Munich.",0968-090X,Not found
Event triggered rolling horizon based systematical trajectory planning for merging platoons at mainline-ramp intersection,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103006,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Two traffic steams merging at a mainline-ramp intersection often leads to recurrent traffic accidents, delays, oscillations and pollution. Existing literature shows that we still lack efficient methods to address this issue considering stream-wide traffic optimality, due to the model complexity and computation challenge. To make up these gaps, this study developed an event-triggered rolling horizon based systematical trajectory planning (RSTP), which expects to safely and smoothly merge two platoons (pure or mixed CAV) in a well-designed trajectory control zone at a mainline-ramp intersection. Specifically, the trajectory control zones on both mainline and ramp are divided into pre-merging, virtual-merging and post-merging subzones. The RSTP is only activated and then generates an optimal trajectory plan for the CAV platoons in the two pre-merging subzones by a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), when a new CAV approaches to the virtual merging subzone either on the mainline or ramp. The RSTP combined with a real-time correction mechanism enables the two platoons to smoothly merge at the end of the virtual merging subzone against certain level of disturbance, aiming to maximize stream-wide traffic performance. Using the unique features of the problem, a heuristic algorithm (MIA) is developed to efficiently solve the MINLPs. The numerical experiments built upon the NGSIM data show that the RSTP achieves expected performance under both pure CAV and CAV-HDV mixed traffic flow. The MIA can solve the MINLPs more quickly with a competitive solution quality than the existing solvers do in GAMS. The RSTP performs better under a traffic flow with higher CAV penetration. The real time re-planning mechanism works effectively to correct mild trajectory deviation occurring to a few CAVs.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperatively coevolutionary optimization design of limited-stop services and operating frequencies for transit networks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103038,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The objective of the limited-stop service design and frequency setting problem (LSDFSP) is to realize the operation of a transit route with a set of elaborate service patterns and corresponding frequencies that can minimize the total social cost of the users and operators. In practice, these different patterns and frequencies involve a trade-off between the user and operator requirements, and this aspect cannot be fully clarified by a single-objective optimization problem. Therefore, in this study, the LSDFSP is considered at the network level and formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with competing objectives of minimizing the user and operator costs. The cooperative coevolutionary multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is redesigned to collaboratively optimize the service patterns and frequencies. A prioritization method is proposed to separately incorporate different types of unsatisfied demand as critical indicators, prompting the algorithm to dig deeper into valuable genes and evolve more feasible solutions. The proposed algorithm is tested on a small network and a real intricate network. It is noted that higher frequencies increased the fleet size and decreased the users’ waiting time and in-vehicle time. Furthermore, skipping more stations reduced the fleet size and users’ in-vehicle time, while increasing the users’ waiting time and number of transfers. The computational results indicated that the proposed algorithm can suitably incorporate the trade-offs and generate an accurate set of Pareto-optimal solutions.",0968-090X,Not found
A formulation of the relaxation phenomenon for lane changing dynamics in an arbitrary car following model,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103081,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Lane changing dynamics are an important part of traffic microsimulation and are vital for modeling weaving sections and merge bottlenecks. However, there is often much more emphasis placed on car following and gap acceptance models, whereas lane changing dynamics such as tactical, cooperation, and relaxation models receive comparatively little attention. This paper develops a general relaxation model which can be applied to an arbitrary parametric or nonparametric microsimulation model. The relaxation model modifies car following dynamics after a lane change, when vehicles can be far from equilibrium. Relaxation prevents car following models from reacting too strongly to the changes in space headway caused by lane changing, leading to more accurate and realistic simulated trajectories. We also show that relaxation is necessary for correctly simulating traffic breakdown with realistic values of capacity drop.",0968-090X,Not found

This study tackles a static green BRP that aims to minimize the CO2 emissions of the repositioning vehicle besides achieving the target inventory level at stations as much as possible within the time budget. Two types of bikes are considered, including usable and broken bikes. The Enhanced Artificial Bee Colony (EABC) algorithm is adopted to generate the vehicle route. Two methods, namely heuristic and exact methods, are proposed and incorporated into the EABC algorithm to compute the loading/unloading quantities at each stop. Computational experiments were conducted on the real-world instances having 10–300 stations.

Dynamic railway timetable rescheduling for multiple connected disruptions,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103080,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Unexpected disruptions occur in the railways on a daily basis, which are typically handled manually by experienced traffic controllers with the support of predefined contingency plans. When several disruptions occur simultaneously, it is rather hard for traffic controllers to make rescheduling decisions, because (1) the predefined contingency plans corresponding to these disruptions may conflict with each other and (2) no predefined contingency plan considering the combined effects of multiple disruptions is available. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to reschedule the timetable in case of multiple disruptions that occur at different geographic locations but have overlapping periods and are pairwise connected by at least one train line. The dispatching measures of retiming, reordering, cancelling, adding stops and flexible short-turning are formulated in the MILP model that also considers the rolling stock circulations at terminal stations and platform capacity. We develop two approaches for rescheduling the timetable in a dynamic environment: the sequential approach and the combined approach. In the sequential approach, a single-disruption rescheduling model is applied to handle each new disruption with the last solution as reference. In the combined approach, the multiple-disruption rescheduling model is applied every time an extra disruption occurs by considering all ongoing disruptions. A rolling-horizon solution method to the multiple-disruption model has been developed to handle long multiple connected disruptions in a more efficient way. The sequential and combined approaches have been tested on real-life instances on a subnetwork of the Dutch railways with 38 stations and 10 train lines operating half-hourly in each direction. In a few cases, the sequential approach did not find feasible solutions, while the combined approach obtained the solutions for all considered cases. Besides, the combined approach was able to find solutions with less cancelled train services and/or train delays than the sequential approach. For long disruptions, the proposed rolling-horizon method was able to generate high-quality rescheduling solutions in an acceptable time.",0968-090X,Not found

The proposed method is evaluated through two experiments respectively using synthetic and real-world datasets. The comparison with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning-based and conventional transportation methods demonstrate the proposed KS-DDPG has significant efficiency in controlling large-scale transportation networks and coping with fluctuations in traffic flow.

Integrated optimization of capacitated train rescheduling and passenger reassignment under disruptions,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103025,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"During railway operations, unexpected events may influence normal traffic flows. This paper focuses on a train rescheduling problem for handling large disruptions, such as a rolling stock breakdown leading to a cancelled train service, where passenger reassignment strategies have to be considered. A novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation is established with consideration of train retiming, reordering, rerouting, and reservicing (addition of extra stops). The proposed mathematical formulation considers planning extra stops for non-canceled trains in order to transport the disrupted passengers, which were supposed to travel on the canceled train, to their pre-planned destination stations. Other constraints deal with limited seat capacity and track capacity, and mapping train rescheduling with passenger reassignment. A bi-objective function is optimized by a weighted-sum method to maximize the number of disrupted passengers reaching their destination stations and to minimize the weighted total train delay for all non-canceled trains at their destinations. A series of numerical experiments based on a part of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line is carried out to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and to perform a sensitivity analysis of various performance factors. The results show that an optimal reassignment plan of disrupted passengers is important to achieve real-time efficiency of traffic and re-ticketing. The impact of passenger reassignment on train rescheduling is influenced by the weights for objectives, duration of disruption, allowed additional dwell and running times, and relationship between passenger demand and total available train capacity.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimating economic severity of Air Traffic Flow Management regulations,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103054,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The development of trajectory-based operations and the rolling network operations plan in European air traffic management network implies a move towards more collaborative, strategic flight planning. This opens up the possibility for inclusion of additional information in the collaborative decision-making process. With that in mind, we define the indicator for the economic risk of network elements (e.g., sectors or airports) as the expected costs that the elements impose on airspace users due to Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) regulations. The definition of the indicator is based on the analysis of historical ATFM regulations data, that provides an indication of the risk of accruing delay. This risk of delay is translated into a monetary risk for the airspace users, creating the new metric of the economic risk of a given airspace element. We then use some machine learning techniques to find the parameters leading to this economic risk. The metric is accompanied by an indication of the accuracy of the delay–cost prediction model. Lastly, the economic risk is transformed into a qualitative economic severity classification. The economic risks and consequently economic severity can be estimated for different temporal horizons and time periods providing an indicator which can be used by Air Navigation Service Providers to identify areas which might need the implementation of strategic measures (e.g., resectorisation or capacity provision change), and by Airspace Users to consider operation of routes which use specific airspace regions.",0968-090X,Not found

Respondents chose their preferred mode for going to work in a set of stated preference choice tasks, based on the attributes of their current commutes using a Bayesian D-Efficient design. Users were segmented into two latent classes based on latent factors that capture time style orientation and public transit dislike. The effects of seating designation, not modeled previously in this context, trip cost and travel times in a shared ride, were estimated for the two classes. Users who neither like transit nor ridesharing with strangers are less likely to choose a shared ride if their designated seat is the middle seat, and overall less likely to choose automated transit. Individuals who have more organized time styles demonstrate higher marginal sensitivity to travel times and costs and are more likely to choose automated transit.

We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed pricing scheme via an agent-based simulation for the Melbourne network. Results of the proposed CPV-based distance toll is compared with the flat distance-based toll and bi-direction cordon toll in terms of the network performance, behavioral changes, and social welfare improvement. Promisingly, the proposed CPV-based pricing scheme can reduce the long-distance trips (greater than10 km) inside the congested central business district by over 30% while discourage non-commuting trips during peak hours, making more road resources available to commuting trips.

This research addresses identifying desirable locations for vertiports while taking into account vehicle limitations, desired operational strategies, and the possibility of passenger trips involving more than two vertiports. The vertiport selection problem is presented as a modified single-allocation p -hub median location problem that incorporates elements of subgraph isomorphism to create structured networks to allow for public transit operations. Because the problem is NP-hard, five heuristic algorithms are developed to find potential solutions with acceptable computation times. The methods are compared to the optimal solution in three different areas of the United States.

Generalized model for mapping bicycle ridership with crowdsourced data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102981,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Fitness apps, such as Strava, are a growing source of data for mapping bicycling ridership, due to large samples and high resolution. To overcome bias introduced by data generated from only fitness app users, researchers build statistical models that predict total bicycling by integrating Strava data with official counts and geographic data. However, studies conducted on single cities provide limited insight on best practices for modeling bicycling with Strava as generalizability is difficult to assess. Our goal is to develop a generalized approach to modeling bicycling ridership using Strava data. In doing so we enable detailed mapping that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and will support more equitable decision-making across cities. We used Strava data, official counts, and geographic data to model Average Annual Daily Bicycling (AADB) in five cities: Boulder, Ottawa, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Victoria. Using a machine learning approach, LASSO, we identify variables important for predicting ridership in all cities, and independently in each city. Using the LASSO-selected variables as predictors in Poisson regression, we built generalized and city-specific models and compared accuracy. Our results indicate generalized prediction of bicycling ridership on a road segment in concert with Strava data should include the following variables: number of Strava riders, percentage of Strava trips categorized as commuting, bicycling safety, and income. Inclusion of city-specific variables increased model performance, as the R2 for generalized and city-specific models ranged from 0.08–0.80 and 0.68–0.92, respectively. However, model accuracy was influenced most by the official count data used for model training. For best results, official count data should capture diverse street conditions, including low ridership areas. Counts collected continuously over a long time period, rather than at peak periods, may also improve modeling. Modeling bicycling from Strava and geographic data enables mapping of bicycling ridership that is more inclusive of all bicyclists and better able to support decision-making.",0968-090X,Not found
A vehicle-by-vehicle approach to assess the impact of variable message signs on driving behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103015,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Variable Message Signs (VMS) provide real-time information on traffic conditions, making it possible to guide drivers through electronic signs along the road. Relevant literature has proved VMS to be effective, especially for diverting traffic during incidents in the highway or inducing a speed reduction. Previous efforts, however, usually involve off-highway experiences, including the use of simulators or stated preference surveys, or the measurement of aggregate values of traffic through technologies that are prone to a higher failure rate, such as loop detectors. For bridging this gap, in this research, we propose a novel vehicle-by-vehicle approach (VBV), that differentiate by vehicle type, to assess the impact of VMS on drivers’ road behavior patterns along a section of a Chilean urban highway during risky situations. In addition to the messaging information, we use full traffic data obtained from free-flow gates equipped with automatic vehicle identification (AVI) technology.

For the speed reduction behavior, in 87.50% of the studied messages, the results indicate that the messages failed to induce the desired change in behavior. This value decreases to 71.85% for lane changes. The results indicate that heavy vehicle drivers and low-mileage drivers are more likely to follow lane change messages.",0968-090X,Not found
Risk evaluation of traffic standstills on winter roads using a state space model,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103005,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"A method that evaluates the risk of traffic standstills on winter roads in real time using a state space model is proposed herein. In Japan, large-scale anomaly events such as traffic standstills that cause serious road disturbances occur frequently every year because of heavy snowfall. However, if the risk of anomaly events is known in advance, appropriate preparation and management can be undertaken to prevent such events and/or alleviate their impacts on road traffic. Therefore, this study attempts to evaluate the risk of standstills based on the degraded road performance estimated from probe vehicle speeds using sequential Bayesian filtering in a state space model (SSM). The SSM comprises a system model constructed by learning historical data and a measurement model using several exogenous variables such as snowfall amounts and temperature. The risk of anomaly events is then determined as the deviation of the filtered vehicle speed by the SSM from the statistically feasible speed distribution. The validation is performed by applying the proposed model to 58 traffic-standstill cases in northern Japan, and we confirm that the model successfully evaluates risks at a reasonable level that permits the practical use.",0968-090X,Not found
Personalized Pareto-improving pricing-and-routing schemes for near-optimum freight routing: An alternative approach to congestion pricing,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103004,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Traffic congestion constitutes a major problem in urban areas. Trucks contribute to congestion and have a negative impact on the environment due to their size, slower dynamics and higher fuel consumption. The individual routing decisions made by truck drivers do not lead to system optimum operations and contribute to traffic imbalances especially in places where the volume of trucks is relatively high. In this paper, we design a coordination mechanism for truck drivers that uses pricing-and-routing schemes that can help alleviate traffic congestion in a general transportation network. We consider the user heterogeneity in Value-Of-Time (VOT) by adopting a multi-class model with stochastic Origin–Destination (OD) demands for the truck drivers. The main characteristic of the mechanism is that the coordinator asks the truck drivers to declare their desired OD pair and pick their individual VOT from a set of N available options, and guarantees that the resulting pricing-and-routing scheme is Pareto-improving, i.e. every truck driver will be better-off compared to the User Equilibrium (UE) and that every truck driver will have an incentive to truthfully declare his/her VOT, while leading to a revenue-neutral (budget balanced) on average mechanism. This approach enables us to design personalized (VOT-based) pricing-and-routing schemes. We show that the Optimum Pricing Scheme (OPS) can be calculated by solving a nonconvex optimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we propose an Approximately Optimum Pricing Scheme (AOPS) and prove that it satisfies the aforementioned properties. Both pricing-and-routing schemes are compared to the Congestion Pricing with Uniform Revenue Refunding (CPURR) scheme through extensive simulation experiments where it is shown that OPS and AOPS achieve a much lower expected total travel time and expected total monetary cost for the users compared to the CPURR scheme, without negatively affecting the rest of the network. These results demonstrate the efficiency of personalized (VOT-based) pricing-and-routing schemes.",0968-090X,Not found
Traffic management with autonomous and connected vehicles at single-lane roundabouts,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102964,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The continuous evolution of automotive and communication technologies can result in more efficient traffic management. At roundabouts, Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance traffic operations, minimizing lost time and providing higher capacities by improving the gap acceptance process. This research aims to take advantage of those evolving technologies in order to design a more efficient traffic management system for single-lane roundabouts. Such a system would provide optimal coordination of CAVs to negotiate the roundabout, maximizing throughput and minimizing average control delay. The expert system developed and tested (Roundabout Manager) acts as a central controller and manages conflicts within the roundabout. It prioritizes incoming vehicles based on demand-dependent strategies and adjusts their trajectories accounting for the geometry of the roundabout. Seven strategies are proposed to coordinate CAV trajectories. The first strategy prioritizes incoming vehicles based on their Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF, i.e., the shortest time till the vehicle reaches the first conflict section it will encounter) to the conflict sections within the circular roadway, while the other strategies add to the SRTF rules to accommodate highly unbalanced traffic flows, with heavy right- or left-turning maneuvers. To illustrate the operation of the algorithm and assess its effectiveness as a function of the demand distribution, a total of 15 oversaturated demand scenarios with 10 replications per scenario were simulated for each of the seven strategies examined. It was concluded that, under any of the strategies proposed, the system guarantees higher throughput with lower average control delay compared to conventional vehicles’ operation. The capacity of the roundabout under fully CAVs traffic flow is increased by 58 to 73% (from low to high conflicting flow, respectively). The strategy that prioritizes vehicles that have to travel through more conflict points and those that leave the system first outperforms the other strategies at all demand scenarios, becoming the optimal coordination of CAVs at roundabouts. This strategy reduces the average control delay between 80 and 97% compared to traffic with conventional vehicles, as assessed using the Highway Capacity Manual procedures.",0968-090X,Not found

The economics of electric roads,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102990,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"In this paper we present a method for evaluating social benefits of electric roads and apply it to the Swedish highway network. Together with estimated investments costs this can be used to produce a cost benefit analysis. An electric road is characterized by high economies of scale (high investment cost and low marginal cost) and considerable economies of scope (the benefit per kilometre electric road depends on the size of the network), implying that the market will produce a smaller network of electric roads, or charge higher prices for its use, than what is welfare optimal. For this reason, it is relevant for governments to consider investing in electric roads, making the cost-benefit analysis a key decision support. We model the behaviour of the carriers using the Swedish national freight model system, SAMGODS, determining the optimal shipment sizes and optimal transport chains, including mode and vehicle type. We find that if the user charge is set as to optimize social welfare, the revenue will not fully cover the investment cost of the electric road. If they are instead set to optimize profit, we find that the revenue will cover the costs if the electric road network is large enough. Electric roads appear to provide a cost-effective means to significantly reduce carbon emissions from heavy trucks. In a scenario where the expansion connects the three biggest cities in Sweden, emissions will be cut by one-third of the overall emissions from heavy trucks in Sweden. The main argument against a commitment to electric roads is that investment and maintenance costs are uncertain and that, in the long run, battery development or hydrogen fuel cells can reduce the benefit of such roads.",0968-090X,Not found
Active learning for multi-objective optimal road congestion pricing considering negative land use effect,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103002,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The road congestion pricing policy is implemented to alleviate traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of the transportation system during peak hours. However, the negative land use effect caused by this policy could not be ignored. How to design the optimal congestion toll that can not only ensure its positive effect on the transportation system but also reduce its negative effect on land use is an urgent problem to be solved. Given this, this paper proposed a multi-objective bi-level programming road congestion pricing model based on the integrated land use and transportation model to optimize the regional average accessibility, regional average land use diversity, and regional total flow time. Since the proposed problem is NP-hard, this paper innovatively proposed an active learning optimization algorithm based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization, which improves the computation efficiency of the bi-level programming model by automatically finding the next sampling point (candidate solution) according to the probability information. An empirical analysis of Jiangyin City demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in coordinating the relationship between land use and transportation and alleviating the negative land use effect caused by road congestion pricing.

Prediction of runway configurations and airport acceptance rates for multi-airport system using gridded weather forecast,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103049,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Accurate prediction of real-time airport capacity, a.k.a. airport acceptance rates (AARs), is key to enabling efficient air traffic flow management. AARs are dependent on selected runway configurations and both are affected by weather conditions. Although there have been studies tackling on the prediction of AARs or runway configurations or both, the prediction accuracy is relatively low and only single airport is considered. This study presents a data-driven deep-learning framework for predicting both runway configurations and AARs to support efficient air traffic management for complex multi-airport systems. The two major contributions from this work are 1) the proposed model uses assembled gridded weather forecast for the terminal airspace instead of an isolated station-based terminal weather forecast, and 2) the model captures the operational interdependency aspects inherent in the parameter learning process so that proposed modeling framework can predict both runway configuration and AARs simultaneously with higher accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated with a numerical experiment taking three major airports in New York Metroplex as the case study.

Demand control model with combinatorial incentives and surcharges for one-way carsharing operation,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102999,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"One-way carsharing is an alternative shared-use transportation mode that provides flexible travel accommodations for urban mobility. However, vehicle distributions can be mismatched with demand distributions because users are not required to return to their departure locations. Conventional operator-based vehicle relocation is limited by labor resources, but user-based and demand-controlled approaches can open new avenues for mitigating vehicle imbalance. This paper proposes a method for controlling demand patterns by applying measures of combinatorial monetary incentives and surcharges. A two-level nested logit model is adopted to analyze user decisions regarding the travel process in response to differentiated pricing combinations. A user choice model is aggregated and loaded into a time-space network that reveals the dynamics of the carsharing system. An optimization framework is proposed to determine the incentives and surcharges at different stations and times of day. This paper presents an algorithm for solving the proposed optimization model, as well as an example of parameter calibration and the solving process. Case analysis suggests that the proposed method can increase revenues by 22.5% compared to a scenario without demand control and vehicle relocation policies. Comparisons suggest that the proposed demand-based control policy can achieve higher revenues than operator-based relocation, whereas operator-based relocation could satisfy greater demand.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal toll design problems under mixed traffic flow of human-driven vehicles and connected and autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102952,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Compared to human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can drive closer to each other to enhance link capacity. Thereby, they have great potential to mitigate traffic congestion. However, the presence of HDVs in mixed traffic can significantly reduce the effects of CAVs on link capacity, especially when the proportion of HDVs is high. To address this problem, this study seeks to control the HDV flow using the autonomous vehicle/toll (AVT) lanes introduced by Liu and Song (2019). The AVT lanes grant free access to CAVs while allowing HDVs to access by paying a toll. To find the optimal toll rates for the AVT lanes to improve the network performance, first, this study proposes a multiclass traffic assignment problem with elastic demand (MTA-ED problem) to estimate the impacts of link tolls on equilibrium flows. It not only enhances behavioral realism for modeling the route choices of HDV and CAV travelers by considering their knowledge level of traffic conditions but also captures the elasticity of both HDV and CAV demand in response to the changes in the level of service induced by the tolls on AVT lanes. Thereby, it better estimate the equilibrium network flows after the tolls are deployed. Then, two categories of optimal toll design problems are formulated according to whether the solution of the HDV route flows, CAV link flows and corresponding origin–destination demand of the proposed MTA-ED problem is unique or not. To solve these optimal toll design problems, this study proposes a revised method of feasible direction. It linearizes the anonymous terms in the upper-level problem by leveraging the analytical sensitivity analysis results of the lower-level MTA-ED problem. This algorithm is globally convergent on the condition that the MTA-ED problem has a unique solution. It can also be leveraged to solve optimal toll design problems when the MTA-ED problem has multiple solutions. Numerical application found that due to disruptive effects on link capacity, using HDVs may significantly reduce the network performance such as customer surplus and total travel demand. The proposed method can assist different stakeholders to find the optimal toll rates for HDVs on AVT lanes to maximize the network performance under mixed traffic environments.",0968-090X,Not found
Large-scale pavement roughness measurements with vehicle crowdsourced data using semi-supervised learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103048,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Rapid measurements of large-scale pavement roughness have long been a hot topic in pavement condition evaluation and maintenance. Most traditional methods rely on dedicated devices, such as laser, Lidar and so on, which should be set up on customized vehicles. With the rapid development of sensing technology, vehicles owned by the general public are empowered with the ability to collect vibration measurements themselves. This crowdsourced dataset is convenient, extensive coverage, inexpensive, and has high sampling frequency, making it a suitable source for large-scale pavement roughness evaluation. However, vehicle information is missing for these data due to privacy protection, which renders them quite difficult to directly use with traditional model-based methods. Thus, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) model to deal with the problem of incomplete data and multi-vehicle data fusion. A mathematical derivation of the ‘international roughness index’ (IRI) using in-car vibrations is established. Furthermore, given the multi-vehicle scenario, a self-training model is designed to iteratively estimate IRIs in a roadway network. Both the confidences of the vehicle parameters and IRI estimation are considered in the algorithm to improve its reliability and robustness. A full-car simulation model is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the overall relative error is less than 10% for 50 road sections in the network, which is a significant improvement compared to traditional multi-vehicle average models. The errors of the SSL model are found to be significantly dependent on the iteration order. Based on the proposed model, the coupled impact of the sampling rate and vehicle quantity on the model’s accuracy is further discussed. The proposed approach provides new insights into large-scale pavement roughness measurements.",0968-090X,Not found

This study calibrates and evaluates the RSS model based on cut-in scenarios in which minimal time-to-collision (TTC) is less than 3 s. Two hundred cut-in events were extracted from Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study data, and the corresponding scenario information for each event was imported into a simulation platform. In each scenario, the human driver was replaced by an AV driven by the model predictive control-based adaptive cruise control (ACC) system embedded with the RSS model. The safety performance of three conditions, the human driver, RSS-embedded ACC model, and ACC-only model, were evaluated and compared. Compared to the performance of human drivers and ACC-only algorithm respectively, the RSS model increased the average TTC per event by 2.86 s and 0.94 s, shortened time-exposed TTC by 1.34 s and 0.65 s, and reduced time-integrated TTC by 0.91 s2 and 0.72 s2. These changes indicate that the RSS-embedded ACC model can improve safety performance in emergent cut-in scenarios. The RSS model can therefore be applied as a security guarantee, that is, to ensure the AV’s timely awareness and response to dangerous cut-in situations, thus mitigating potential conflict.",0968-090X,Not found

Their penetration rate in the fleet is constantly increasing, as well as their use, especially under freeway conditions. At the same time, limited information is openly available on how these systems actually operate and their differences depending on the vehicle manufacturer or model. This represents an important gap because as the number of ACC vehicles on the road increases, traffic dynamics on freeways may change accordingly, and new collective phenomena, which are only marginally known at present, could emerge. Yet, as ACC systems are introduced as comfort options and their operation is entirely under the responsibility of the driver, vehicle manufacturers do not have explicit requirements to fulfill nor they have to provide any evidence about their performances. As a result, any safety implication connected to their interactions with other road users escapes any monitoring and opportunity of improvement. This work presents a set of experimental car-following campaigns, providing an overview of the behavior of commercial ACC systems under different driving conditions. Furthermore, the suggestion of a unified data structure across the different tests facilitates comparison between the different campaigns, vehicles, systems and specifications.

Bicycle flow dynamics on wide roads: Experiments and simulation,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103012,125,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Cycling is a popular and sustainable mode of transportation. However, few studies have examined experimental and modeling studies on bicycle flow dynamics. In particular, for wide roads, the characteristics of high-density regimes in the fundamental diagram have not been well addressed, and the emergence of stop-and-go waves has not been fully understood. This study experimentally investigated bicycle flow dynamics on wide roads, using two types of 3-m-wide track. Different riding behaviors, namely, free riding, following, and overtaking, were analyzed. The bicycle flow dynamics were found to be essentially the same on the two tracks: (i) The bicycle flow rate remained nearly constant across a wide range of densities, in marked contrast to the single-file bicycle flow, which exhibited a unimodal fundamental diagram. By studying the weight density of the radial and lateral locations of cyclists, we argue that this behavior arises from the formation of more lanes with increase in global density. The newly formed lanes prevented the flow rate from decreasing. (ii) When the density exceeded 0.5 bicycles/m2, the flow rate began to decrease, and stop-and-go traffic emerged. Based on these behavioral observations, we propose an improved heuristic-based model to simulate bicycle flow on roads of different radii and explicitly account for the centrifugal effect of bicycles. The calibration and validation results demonstrate that the proposed model can reproduce the traffic dynamics of bicycle flow.",0968-090X,Not found

Compared to existing studies on the subject, that are based on up to about 2 million miles driven, our study involves an estimated 2.3 billion miles driven. Bayesian negative binomial models were applied to examine the association between three outcomes (crashes, injuries, and fatalities) and the four SCEs. It was found that a unit increase in the number of any type of SCEs per 10,000 miles was associated with 8.4% (95% credible interval (CI): 8.0–8.8%) increase in crashes per mile and 8.7% (95% CI: 4.8–13.6%) increase in the number of injuries per mile. The increase was different in different types of SCEs: 3.3% (95% CI: 2.6–4%) for headways, 8.1% (95% CI: 7.5–8.7%) for hard brakes, 50.4% (95% CI: 41.4–60%) for rolling stability, and 22.2% (95% CI: 19.8–24.5%) for collision mitigation. The results are consistent when stratified by different business units and driver types. This study provides statistically strong and robust evidence that SCEs are positively associated with crashes and injuries among commercial truck drivers. NDS and kinematic data routinely collected by trucking companies provide a promising opportunity for future data analytic research.",0968-090X,Not found
Combining immediate customer responses and car–passenger reassignments in on-demand mobility services,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103104,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"This paper presents a two-step information system for operating an on-demand mobility (ODM) service using the advantages of both immediate responses based on heuristics and global (re)optimization of car–passenger assignments. Service providers using such a model can offer a better user experience due to shorter response times, while they also benefit from the increased profits made possible by the global optimization of assignments. This study compares two immediate response strategies (IRSs) in terms of their system performance and individual ability to correctly predict customers’ pickup time windows. It also compares the key performance indicators (KPIs) of global reassignment optimization without immediate responses and several constrained cases in which customer acceptances and rejections are handled by IRSs. Ten combinations of IRSs and service model variations are tested in simulations using the ODM demand data from New York City taxis obtained over one week for varying fleet sizes of between 1,000 and 6,000 vehicles. The results show that in general, the list-based assignments (LBA) approach outperforms the nearest neighbor policy (NNP) as an IRS in most of the scenarios evaluated with respect to KPIs, such as requests served and profit generated for the service provider, while it also produces more empty vehicle mileage and longer customer waiting times. The pickup time window predictions of both LBA and NNP were correct in 68% to 72% of cases in scenarios in which no constraints are induced by the IRS. It was also found that global (re)optimization of assignments helps to improve the profit generated for the service provider, especially if the decision as to which requests are accepted is made during global optimization rather by the IRS. However, such a service model would imply an average customer response time of half the optimization period, which was set to 30s in this study compared to the immediate responses given when using an IRS.",0968-090X,Not found

Accordingly, shopping behaviors, i.e. shopping channels, are becoming more complex than ever. However, the current research focus is still mainly on traditional parcel delivery and little is known for food and grocery deliveries and their impacts on transportation systems. To have a better understanding of deliveries and their impacts on transportation systems, using the survey data from NYC DOT Citywide Mobility Survey in 2018, this paper investigated (a) factors affecting the three types of deliveries (retail, grocery, and food) by developing a seemingly unrelated model, and (b) the relationships between deliveries and in-store shopping trips by different modes using multiple simultaneous equations models. The results showed that factors affecting deliveries vary by the type of delivery, and the three deliveries are positively correlated by common unobserved factors. In addition, the relationships between delivery and shopping trip vary not only by delivery type but also by trip mode (driving/walking).

In specific, we have developed and implemented a machine learning computational algorithm and built a deep neural network to determine and identify the initial impact conditions of car crash based on its final material damage state and permanently deformed structure configuration (wreckage). In this work, we have demonstrated that the developed machine learning algorithm as an inverse problem solver can accurately identify initial collision conditions in an inverse manner, which are practically unique if we use permanent plastic deformation as the forensic data signatures. In other words, we think that the massive plastic energy dissipation process and the related big data will make final structure damage state insensitive to the initial car collision conditions. Thus, it provides an inverse solution for car crash forensic analysis by reconstructing the initial failure load parameters and conditions based on the permanent plastic deformation distribution of cars. This approach has general significance in solving the inverse problem for engineering failure analysis and vehicle crashworthiness analysis, which provides a key contribution for the unmanned autonomous vehicle and the related technology.",0968-090X,Not found

Preferences of urban rail users for first- and last-mile autonomous vehicles: Price and service elasticities of demand in a multimodal environment,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103105,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Integrating autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transit networks is a critical problem for metropolitan areas worldwide. This study investigates the preferences of urban rail/rapid transit users for first- and last-mile AV services, which are not well understood. First, it develops an access mode choice model incorporating on-demand transit access enabled by AVs. Second, the model is estimated with stated choice data obtained from a survey of 2,300 residents living within 1–5 km of their nearest rail stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area, in which choice tasks are based on recent access to home-end stations. Finally, estimated models are used to compute elasticities of demand for access modes with respect to AV cost and wait time. The results show that price sensitivities of demand for AV services lie within a reasonable range of transit fare elasticities. AVs have diverse substitution patterns with existing modes. Riding in AV services is more likely to be a substitute for riding on buses/in slower modes of transit for all travel purposes, and for driving cars, particularly for leisure trips, but less likely for cycling and walking, particularly for work trips. The AV wait time elasticities might vary according to the waiting environment and conditions. The results also suggest that AVs may particularly benefit those who currently have restrictions in accessing transit.",0968-090X,Not found
A holding control strategy for diverging bus lines,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103087,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Holding has been extensively used as control strategy to regulate public transport operations, especially to maintain even headways and prevent buses of the same line to bunch up. Applying holding to multiple lines requires however to deal with the transition between corridor and branching segments. In this study, we introduce a holding criterion for network configurations with lines that operate jointly along a common corridor and then diverge to individual branches serving different urban areas. The proposed holding decision rule accounts for all different passenger groups in the overlapping segment and considers the transition to individual line operation. The holding rule is evaluated using simulation for different demand levels and compositions and is compared with state-of-the-art control schemes for a real-world network. Results show that the proposed multi-line control yields performance improvements along the shared transit corridor as well as at the line level.

Improving railway maintenance schedules by considering hindrance and capacity constraints,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103108,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The availability of railway networks is important for society and the economy. To keep the infrastructure in good condition, regular maintenance is needed. Regular maintenance is achieved by devising maintenance schedules that assign safe work zones to crews executing preventive maintenance activities. This study aims to optimize the maintenance schedules for both train operators and maintenance contractors, by considering (a) hindrance for parked passenger trains and planned freight trains, and (b) the workload for track workers. Further, maintenance operations are distinguished into different engineering fields (switches, straight tracks, and overhead wiring) since this influences the amount of hindrance. The method presented for designing maintenance schedules is a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that considers these aspects. In our Dutch case study, we assess our new scheduling model and show that large improvements can be made in terms of mean workload for work crews and total hindrance for train operators.

Research in this area usually relies on AV trials using naturalistic driving which are expensive with various legal and ethical obstacles designed to keep the general public safe. The emerging concept of Wizard-of-Oz simulation is a promising solution to this problem wherein the driver of a standard vehicle is hidden from the passenger using a physical partition, providing the illusion of riding in an AV. Furthermore, head-mounted display (HMD) virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as a means of providing a Wizard-of-Oz protocol for on-road simulations of AVs. Such systems have potential to support a variety of study conditions at low cost, enabling simulation of a variety of vehicles, driving conditions, and circumstances.

Automated eco-driving in urban scenarios using deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.102967,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Urban settings are challenging environments to implement eco-driving strategies for automated vehicles. It is often assumed that sufficient information on the preceding vehicle pulk is available to accurately predict the traffic situation. Because vehicle-to-vehicle communication was introduced only recently, this assumption will not be valid until a sufficiently high penetration of the vehicle fleet has been reached. Thus, in the present study, we employed Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop eco-driving strategies for cases where little data on the traffic situation are available. An A-segment electric vehicle was simulated using detailed efficiency models to accurately determine its energy-saving potential. A probabilistic traffic environment featuring signalized urban roads and multiple preceding vehicles was integrated into the simulation model. Only information on the traffic light timing and minimal sensor data were provided to the control algorithm. A twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) agent was implemented and trained to control the vehicle efficiently and safely in this environment. Energy savings of up to 19% compared with a simulated human driver and up to 11% compared with a fine-tuned Green Light Optimal Speed Advice (GLOSA) algorithm were determined in a probabilistic traffic scenario reflecting real-world conditions.

Then, we establish a model to formulate the optimal design of service providers on a homogeneous plane as a mixed-integer program (MIP) problem and further extend the model that enables it to solve the case with a heterogeneous plane. Numerical tests of the equilibrium model show that the algorithm can quickly converge to the equilibrium solution, and some managerial insights for the hybrid charging system design are identified from the numerical tests of the optimal design model.",0968-090X,Not found
"Visualizing, clustering, and characterizing activity-trip sequences via weighted sequence alignment and functional data analysis",10.1016/j.trc.2021.103007,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Smartphone-based activity-travel surveys have enabled the collection of continuous, multi-day data on individuals’ trips and activities with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the multi-dimensional nature of these data makes it challenging to compare activity-travel patterns and identify clusters of individuals with similar patterns and use them to study behaviors and forecast travel demands. To address this challenge, we adopt a discrete, step-based view on time and transform the episodic-based diary into a sequence of states observed at a sample interval. The resulting sequences can visually characterize variations in activity-travel patterns across days of a week and among different individuals. Motivated by techniques in genomics and data science, we apply sequence alignment methods to measure the pairwise similarity between these activity-trip sequences. To address its practical implementation in transportation studies, we define and compare four weighting schemas: (1) the unit-cost distance, which assigns equal weights to all substitution operations between states; (2) the fixed-flexible weighted distance based on the time geography framework, where costs differ for substitutions involving fixed and flexible activities; (3) the trip-activity weighted distance considering travel as a derived demand, where costs differ for substitutions between trips and activities; and (4) transition-based weighted distance, where costs are based on the global or time-varying activity and trip transition rates estimated from the data. Then, we calculate the pairwise distances between individuals’ sequences and use them as inputs to a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group individuals with similar sequences. We visualize the state distributions of the identified clusters to infer and compare behavior patterns, and use functional data regression methods to estimate the time-dependent probabilities of engaging in various activities and trips. To demonstrate our methods, we analyze a smartphone-based survey dataset collected in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. We also conduct sensitivity analysis on the selection of cost metrics and sample intervals to ensure the robustness of our methods and discuss their implications in practice. By identifying population subgroups with distinct daily activity-travel patterns and explaining how these patterns vary over one day and depend on user profiles, our weighted sequence alignment approach provides an intuitive and flexible method for extracting and characterizing individuals’ activity-travel behaviors for use in transportation planning.",0968-090X,Not found

Whether the cameras are mounted on drones, vehicles, or fixed in the built environments, they inevitably remain scatter. We need to develop the technology to re-identify the same agents across images captured from non-overlapping field-of-views, referred to as the visual re-identification task. State-of-the-art methods learn a neural network based representation trained with the cross-entropy loss function. We argue that such loss function is not suited for the visual re-identification task hence propose to model confidence in the representation learning framework.

Of these, air traffic management in the multi-airport (metroplex) terminal airspace is one of the most complicated subsystems to manage, especially due to the interactions between proximal airports. Analyzing anomalous behaviors in the metroplex is emerging as a key problem in understanding air traffic management complexity and safety. Although physics-based approaches have been studied in-depth for this application, newfound interest has been observed to use recorded time-series air traffic surveillance and airport operations datasets for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithm that generates mathematical models to detect anomalies in metroplex operations. Several machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect anomalies using only air traffic surveillance data, but there is a significant scope of improvement by including airport operational characteristics as well, since integrating such closely-controlled metroplex operational datasets allows the developed models to effectively detect anomalies. The key contribution of this paper is in allowing anomaly detection models to recursively update so as to adapt to changes in metroplex operations.

This paper investigates the welfare effects of inaccurate pre-trip information on commuters’ departure time choice under stochastic bottleneck capacity in the morning commute. Three cases concerning commuters’ actions in response to inaccurate pre-trip information, namely compliance, noncompliance, and co-existence, are studied. We consider two types of traffic conditions: good conditions and bad conditions, as well as errors in forecasting good conditions and bad conditions, respectively. We derive all theoretical solutions under different magnitudes of forecast errors, and frequency and severity of bottleneck capacity reductions in the compliance and noncompliance cases, and adopt an iterative algorithm to obtain the departure flow patterns in the co-existence case. Our results show that the benefits of inaccurate information depend on information quality, commuters’ response and heterogeneity, and the frequency and severity of bottleneck capacity reductions.

However, econometric studies have argued that machine learning techniques are a ‘black-box’ and difficult to interpret for use in the choice analysis. We develop a data-driven choice model that extends the systematic utility function to incorporate non-linear cross-effects using a series of residual layers and using skipped connections to handle model identifiability in estimating a large number of parameters. The model structure accounts for cross-effects and choice heterogeneity arising from substitution, interactions with non-chosen alternatives and other effects in a non-linear manner.

In this research, we propose a new approach that can detect the occurrence times and locations of multiple crashes simultaneously. We first construct the speed contour plot using probe vehicle data on candidate links. We then formulate the detection process as an integer programming model and develop a set of novel constraints to estimate the spatiotemporal impact regions associated with multiple crashes by leveraging the spatiotemporal propagation of congestion. We subsequently take the time and location when the travel speed begins to drop in each impact region as the occurrence time and location of each corresponding crash. Finally, we validate our model using real data in Beijing and find that our model can handle the situation where multiple crashes are incorporated in the speed contour plot. Besides, our model can reduce the average time and location bias by 79.52% and 81.29%, respectively.",0968-090X,Not found

We discuss the psychological factors underlying the question of how safe AVs need to be to compel consumers away from relying on the abilities of human drivers. For consumers, how safe is safe enough? Three preregistered studies (N = 4566) reveal that the established psychological biases of algorithm aversion and the better-than-average effect leave consumers averse to adopting AVs unless the cars meet extremely potentially unrealistically high safety standards. Moreover, these biases prove stubbornly hard to overcome, and risk substantially delaying the adoption of life-saving autonomous driving technology.

Robust perimeter control with cordon queues and heterogeneous transfer flows,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103043,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Accumulation-based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model is widely employed to design perimeter control methods to improve traffic operation in urban networks. While the accumulation-based MFD assumes a low-scatter, non-linear relationship between region production and accumulation, the outflow relationship in formulating dynamics of multi-region networks requires simplifying assumptions. The existing perimeter control methods are grounded on accumulation-based MFD models where the number of transferring vehicles is approximated by the ratio of the instantaneous number of vehicles based on their destinations. Moreover, perimeter control may lead to more vehicles queuing at the region boundary (i.e. cordon queues) which add local impediments on traveling vehicles and impact the accuracy of well-defined MFDs. To address these shortcomings under time-varying conditions, this paper develops a robust perimeter control method based on the Sliding Mode Control to minimize total travel time in the entire network.

Since each user’s choice has impacts on another via cruising-incurred traffic congestion and parking competition, we model the parking choice problem of AVs as a Wardrop equilibrium in which each user cannot further reduce their parking cost by unilaterally changing their choice. The model considers all possible options for parking a private AV, and finds that these parking choices may yield multiple equilibria under which the congestion and social welfare are very different. We further develop an efficient solution algorithm to find all equilibrium solutions. Our analysis shows that even if AVs act in a non-cooperative manner, one possible outcome would involve many AVs choosing to cruise, which creates severe congestion to decrease the cost of cruising. However, this outcome can be avoided by a time-based congestion toll, which discourages AVs from cruising for a long period and increases the social welfare. Our analysis also shows parking pricing and provision may not reduce congestion induced by cruising AVs without the help of a congestion toll.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimating traffic flow states with smart phone sensor data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103062,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"This study proposes a framework to classify traffic flow states. The framework is capable of processing massive, high-density, and noise-contaminated data sets generated from smartphone sensors. The statistical features of vehicle acceleration, angular acceleration, and GPS speed data, recorded by smartphone software, are analyzed, and then used as input for traffic flow state classification. Data collected by a five-day experiment is used to train and test the proposed model. A total of 747,856 sets of data are generated and used for both traffic flow state classification and sensitivity analysis of input variables. After applying various algorithms to the proposed framework, the study found that acceleration and angular acceleration data can increase the accuracy of traffic flow classification significantly. When the hyper-parameters of the Deep Belief Network model are optimized by the Differential Evolution Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, the classification accuracy is further improved. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness of using smartphone sensor data to estimate the traffic flow states and shown that our proposed model outperforms some traditional machine learning methods in traffic flow state classification accuracy.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimizing operations at freeway weaves with connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103072,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"In this research, we propose novel mathematical models and algorithms for optimizing connected and automated vehicles’ (CAVs) trajectories at freeway weaving segments assuming 100 percent CAV market penetration. The proposed system receives vehicle arrival information and generates optimal trajectories that are relayed to the CAVs. The algorithm simulates vehicle arrivals and develops optimal vehicle trajectories on a 2-lane weaving section (one mainline and one auxiliary lane). We test the optimization algorithm under a variety of demand scenarios and using real-world arrival data. Results suggest that the proposed algorithm increases the average travel speed and capacity by 12 to 16% and up to 11%, respectively when compared to HCM estimates. Also, our case study shows the algorithm increases the average speed by 17%, 30%, and 38% for minimum time headways of 1.7 s, 1.4 s, and 1 s, respectively, compared to conventional vehicles.",0968-090X,Not found
Disentangling the city traffic rhythms: A longitudinal analysis of MFD patterns over a year,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103065,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Urban road transportation performance is the result of a complex interplay between the network supply and the travel demand. Fortunately, the framework around the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) provides an efficient description of network-wide traffic performance. In this paper, we show how temporal patterns of vehicle traffic define the performance of urban road networks. We present two high-resolution traffic datasets covering a year each. We introduce a methodology to quantify the similarity of macroscopic traffic patterns. We do so by using the concepts of the MFD and a dynamic time warping (DTW) based algorithm for time series. This allows us to derive a few representative MFD clusters that capture the essential macroscopic traffic patterns. We then provide an in-depth analysis of traffic heterogeneity in the network which is indicative of the previously found clusters. Thereupon, we define a parsimonious classification approach to predict the expected MFD clusters early in the morning with high accuracy.",0968-090X,Not found
A decision making framework for incorporating fairness in allocating slots at capacity-constrained airports,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103039,126,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Fairness constitutes an important criterion for allocating scarce resources among self-interested parties. The capacity of congested airports is a scarce resource which is allocated in the form of slots to airlines to operate their flights. Traditionally, the optimisation of slot allocation efficiency has been considered as the primary criterion in making slot allocation decisions at capacity-constrained airports. The efficiency of slot allocation is expressed as a function of displacement, which is defined as the difference between the time requested by the airlines and the time allocated to airlines to operate their flights. Recent research work has considered fairness as an additional slot allocation objective. However, the literature has not adequately addressed the following two key research questions: i) in the presence of alternative fairness measures, which fairness measure should be used to investigate the slot allocation efficiency-fairness trade-off, and how the choice of the efficient frontier describing this trade-off should be made? and ii) given that the choice of the efficient frontier has been made, which slot allocation solution should be selected for implementation, and how this choice should be made? To address these questions, we investigate three inter-airline fairness objectives, and we introduce a decision-making framework to assist decision-makers in identifying the most preferable acceptable slot allocation outcome. The proposed decision-making framework is based on a voting mechanism which incorporates the preferences of stakeholders. We use slot request and capacity data to determine the most preferable slot allocation outcome at a capacity-constrained airport.",0968-090X,Not found
Identification and characterizing of the prevailing paths on a urban network for MFD-based applications,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102953,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"One of the main challenges for multi-regional application of the aggregated traffic models based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram, lies in the identification and characterization of the most prevailing paths chosen by drivers. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework, based on two distinct methods, to determine these prevailing paths. The first method requires the information about travel patterns in the urban network as well as the information about the city network partitioning. The second method is more parsimonious, and consists on the direct calculation of shortest-cost paths on the aggregated network. For this, we propose four impedance functions that utilize topological features of the urban network and its partitioning. We test the performance of this methodological framework for determining the most prevailing paths on a network representing the metropolitan area of Lyon (France). We consider a set of real trajectories (i.e. GPS data) of drivers in this network as a benchmark. We show that the proposed methods are able to identify the most prevailing paths as the ones chosen by drivers, as evidenced by a large similarity value between the sets of paths. Based on a maximum likelihood estimation, we also show that the Weibull distribution is the one that better reproduces the functional form of the network-wide distribution of travel distances. However, the characterization of the functional form of such distributions characteristic to each region defining a path is not trivial, and depends on the complex topological features of the urban network concerning the definition of its partitioning. We also show that the Euclidean distance metrics provides good estimates of the average travel distances. Interestingly, we also show that the most prevailing paths are not necessarily the ones that have the lowest average travel distances.",0968-090X,Not found
Efficient dispatching for on-demand ride services: Systematic optimization via Monte-Carlo tree search,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103156,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Efficient dispatching for on-demand ride services is essential to the ride-sourcing platform, passengers, and drivers in a competitive ride-sourcing market. The existing first-come-first-serve (FCFS) dispatching method is a myopic mechanism that sought to minimize individual-level waiting time. To improve the passenger-vehicle matching efficiency and reduce the cancelation rate, a searching tree structure is developed to deal with the vehicle dispatching problem considering vehicles still in service. This paper formulates a distinctive systematic dispatching model from the passengers' perspective and presents new dispatching rules to match passengers and vehicles. Based on an improved tree policy and efficient branch reduction policy, we customize and enhance the reinforcement learning approach, Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to solve the multi-period sequential dispatching problem and enable efficient dispatches. The computational Complexity of MCTS is analytically derived. As benchmarks, the Hungarian algorithm, CPLEX, greedy algorithm, and two global optimization algorithms are employed. We compare these algorithms by using both simulation and real-world city-scale on-demand ride-sourcing data. Both numerical and city-scale experiment results show that the improved MCTS dispatching approach increases the percentages of satisfied passengers and dispatched drivers, and reduces the number of unmatched passengers and cumulative waiting time compared to the benchmark algorithms. The results shed light on modeling urban dispatching problems with available vehicles in both forward-looking and backward-looking time periods. This paper demonstrates that improved MCTS performs well in solving a multi-period sequential optimization problem in real-world city-scale applications.",0968-090X,Not found
Anomaly detection and classification in traffic flow data from fluctuations in the flow–density relationship,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103178,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"We describe and validate a novel data-driven approach to the real time detection and classification of traffic anomalies based on the identification of atypical fluctuations in the relationship between density and flow. For aggregated data under stationary conditions, flow and density are related by the fundamental diagram. However, high resolution data obtained from modern sensor networks is generally non-stationary and disaggregated. Such data consequently show significant statistical fluctuations. These fluctuations are best described using a bivariate probability distribution in the density–flow plane. By applying kernel density estimation to high-volume data from the UK National Traffic Information Service (NTIS), we empirically construct these distributions for London’s M25 motorway. Curves in the density–flow plane are then constructed, analogous to quantiles of univariate distributions. These curves quantitatively separate atypical fluctuations from typical traffic states. Although the algorithm identifies anomalies in general rather than specific events, we find that fluctuations outside the 95% probability curve correlate strongly with the spikes in travel time associated with significant congestion events. Moreover, the size of an excursion from the typical region provides a simple, real-time measure of the severity of detected anomalies. We validate the algorithm by benchmarking its ability to identify labelled events in historical NTIS data against some commonly used methods from the literature. Detection rate, time-to-detect and false alarm rate are used as metrics and found to be generally comparable except in situations when the speed distribution is bi-modal. In such situations, the new algorithm achieves a much lower false alarm rate without suffering significant degradation on the other metrics. This method has the additional advantages of being self-calibrating and adaptive: the curve marking atypical behaviour is different for each section of road and can evolve in time as the data changes, for example, due to long-term roadworks.",0968-090X,Not found
Route based equilibrium assignment in congested transit networks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103125,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This work introduces a new route-based equilibrium assignment formulation and algorithm for congested transit networks. It is an extension of De Cea and Fernández (1993), which implements congestion effects in the boarding process and introduced the concept of effective frequencies. That seminal work provides a solution algorithm for the equilibrium problem that takes advantage of two main simplifications. First, it limits the number of route sections under consideration (i.e., it considers a reduced set of attractive services for users to choose from on each leg of their trip). Second, it assumes that the flow split between attractive services can be estimated using the nominal frequencies of the services instead of the effective ones. In this paper, we develop an equilibrium model and solution algorithm that extend the original formulation without relying on the two assumptions mentioned above, while still addressing three key challenges. First, user cost functions are asymmetric in nature, and therefore, an equivalent optimization problem cannot be formulated. Second, cost functions on this approach can only be expressed implicitly, which makes the implementation of a diagonalization algorithm a challenging problem. Lastly, dealing with the whole set of route sections implies working with all feasible sets of attractive services, which can make the underlying auxiliary network grow exponentially in size. We solve the equilibrium problem by using a diagonalization algorithm, obtaining approximate diagonalized functions by solving a fixed-point problem. Our methodology also includes an efficient algorithm to generate potential candidate sets of services in the network. We test our algorithm on three networks of increasing size, where we show that the approach effectively converges to a user equilibrium solution in a matter of seconds. We also show that the benchmark original algorithm converges to solutions that violate user equilibrium conditions, exhibiting unutilized routes with lower than equilibrium costs, confirming that our algorithm is the first one to find an exact solution to the route-based public transport user equilibrium problem.",0968-090X,Not found
Traffic state estimation by backward moving observers: An application and validation under an incident,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103158,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This study analyzes measurements by backward moving observers that could be probe vehicles running backward on the opposite lane observing forward moving traffic to be investigated. These probe vehicles are called as backward probe vehicles (BP) and they are proven to measure the traffic flow and density. Using some advanced technology, a BP is assumed to estimate the flow of vehicles running forward from their passing time measurements along the BP trajectory. Then, as a useful application for the flow measurement by a BP, we propose a data assimilation method that estimates traffic states under an incident on an expressway section utilizing BP measurements in addition to conventional probe vehicles moving forward (forward probe vehicles) and detector data. Ample literature exists on traffic state estimation using several sensing data. However, they have difficulty in estimating traffic states during an incident, since the observations of the incident period and the declined flow rate due to the incident may not be sufficiently accurate. Therefore, this study proposes a state space model (SSM) that estimates traffic states under an incident on an expressway utilizing BP measurements. The model validation using a hypothetical network with an incident confirms the promising potential of the proposed model; that is, the reproducibility of traffic states using BP measurements is superior to one using forward probe measurements.",0968-090X,Not found
Understanding travel preferences for user-based relocation strategies of one-way electric car-sharing services,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103135,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"One-way electric car-sharing services (ECS) are considered a promising solution for sustainable passenger mobility. To ensure balanced supply–demand of shared cars in the operational areas, ECS operators tend to explore user-based relocation strategies in addition to the costly operator-based ones. Through a stated preference experiment administered in the Netherlands, we study the travel preferences for ECS and user-based relocation strategies in a comprehensive framework integrating people’s current mobility choices and contextual variables. Incentives for picking-up/dropping-off shared cars at distant alternative locations and sharing rides are embedded in two sub-experiments of varied trip distances. The results from an error component multinomial logit (EC-MNL) model show multi-faceted preferences. Particularly, we find that people interested in ECS are willing to collaborate with ECS operators. Alternative pick-up is the most favorite relocation strategy, followed by alternative drop-off and sharing rides. The willingness to accept the incentive for additional access and egress time is estimated as high as 0.33 EUR per walking minute. It is also found that respondents do not show significant differences in preferences for car sanitation by ECS operators or self-service during the times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Differentiating and modeling the installation and the usage of autonomous vehicle technologies: A system dynamics approach for policy impact studies,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103089,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Existing research that forecasts market penetration of installed connected and autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies is often confused with the traffic composition in roadway networks. Users may override AV mode due to arrival time pressure, facility constraint (e.g., “I will have to make a U-turn a mile away if I do not cross the solid double-yellow lines here”), drug and alcohol influence, pleasure, envy (e.g., “why the front car can surpass that slow truck but I can’t?”), insufficient law enforcement, driving culture, media and public sentiment, etc. Therefore, the installation and the usage of AV technologies should not be instantaneously assumed ignorable in planning and policy studies. This paper is dedicated to clarifying this confusion by demonstrating that ignoring the difference between the installation and the usage of AV technologies might lead to systematic bias in evaluating policy and investment decisions. Through a system dynamics (SD) model, the complex interactions of relevant factors are captured so that the mixed traffic condition influences traffic law enforcement adjustment effort and system investment decisions, which, in turn, influence the AV technology usage share and the system performance. The case study applies to the greater Washington, D.C. area for demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of the proposed model and for studying policy implications. This paper does not attempt to forecast; instead, it proposes a modeling framework for studying the conditions under which differentiating the installation and the usage of AV technologies might be critical in forecasting the traffic composition trend and system performance for public policy and investment decisions.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling and optimization of dedicated bus lanes space allocation in large networks with dynamic congestion,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103082,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Dedicated bus lanes provide a low cost and easily implementable strategy to improve transit service by minimizing congestion-related delays. Identifying the best spatial distribution of bus-only lanes in order to maximize traffic performance of an urban network while balancing the trade-off between bus priority and regular traffic disturbance is a challenging task. This paper studies the problem of optimal dedicated bus lane allocation and proposes a modeling framework based on a link-level dynamic traffic modeling paradigm, which is compatible with the dynamic characteristics of congestion propagation that can be correlated with bus lane relative positions. The problem is formulated as a non-linear combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables. An algorithmic scheme based on a problem-specific heuristic and Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic, potentially combined with a network decomposition technique and a performance-based learning process for increased efficiency, is proposed for deriving good quality solutions for large-scale network instances.

This study examines consumers’ consideration to adopt AVs, with a particular focus on the impact of informational cues from different communication channels. Data for our analysis is collected through an online survey conducted in December 2019, and our sample comprises 862 residents from Sydney, Australia. The survey asks respondents about their social networks, and their use of different mass and social media platforms. Respondents are subsequently presented a discrete choice experiment where we systematically vary informational cues about AVs from each of these communication channels, and respondents are asked to indicate their willingness to consider AVs under each scenario. This data is used to develop a latent class choice model of AV consideration as a function of the informational cues received from different communication channels. Our model also considers the level of trust that respondents associate with their social contacts when modelling the effect of word-of-mouth from these social contacts. The results reveal eleven segments in the sample that differ from one another in terms of sociodemographic attributes, evaluation of social contact trust, and the relative importance they attach to different communication channels.

Inferring trip purpose by clustering sequences of smart card records,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103131,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Smart card transactions are known as a rich and continuous source of public transit data, but they miss some important attributes about trips and passengers. One of these missing attributes is the trip purpose attribute. This paper proposes a novel method to infer the trip purpose attribute from the sequences of trips of passengers instead of separate trips. The proposed method infers the trip purpose attribute (a missing attribute in the smart card data) from the temporal attributes (available attributes in the smart card data). First, the relation between the temporal attributes and the trip purpose attribute is learnt by discovering clusters of passengers in the Household Travel Survey dataset while each passenger is represented by one sequence of trips. Then, the discovered clusters are utilized to infer the trip purpose of smart card transactions by allocating each passenger to the closest clusters. The proposed method is implemented on the smart card and HTS datasets from southeast Queensland, Australia. The evaluation results showed a considerable improvement in inferring the trip purpose compared to the results published in the literature.

Will urban air mobility fly? The efficiency and distributional impacts of UAM in different urban spatial structures,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103124,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Recent technological developments open up possibilities for introducing a vast number of novel mobility concepts in urban environments. One of these new concepts is urban air mobility (UAM). It makes use of passenger drones for on-demand transport in urban settings, promising high travel speeds for those willing and able to pay. This research aims to answer the question how benefits from UAM will be distributed, taking into account the spatial dimension and the differential impacts on low- and high-skilled households. We develop a framework that can more generally be used to assess the welfare impacts resulting from the introduction of novel transport modes. The development of an urban spatial computable general equilibrium model building on the polycentric modelling tradition developed by Anas and co-authors allows for an analysis of mutually dependent effects on the land, labour and product markets, triggered by changes on the transport market. Allowing for an endogenous spatial structure through the introduction of agglomeration effects and an amenity-based approach, the framework investigates the relevance of the initial spatial structure for the impact of the introduction of UAM. Incorporating different skill levels of households allows to assess location choice and travel behaviour for households with different characteristics. A numerical simulation of the model shows that the different initial spatial structures impose comparable welfare changes. Variations in UAM features like marginal cost, prices, land demand for infrastructure, vertical travel speed and access and egress times have a (much) more decisive impact on modal choice and welfare effects than the initial urban structure. Simulations show that considering households of different skill levels brings additional insights, as welfare effects of UAM introduction strongly differ between groups and sometimes even go in opposing directions.",0968-090X,Not found
On lane assignment of connected automated vehicles: strategies to improve traffic flow at diverge and weave bottlenecks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103126,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper presents a novel approach to improve traffic throughput near diverge and weave bottlenecks in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected automated vehicles (CAVs). This is done by the strategic assignment of CAVs across lanes. The main principle is to induce strategic and necessary lane changes (LCs) (by CAVs and HDVs) well upstream of the potential bottleneck, so that the traffic flow approaching the bottleneck is organized and exhibits fewer throughput-reducing LCs at the bottleneck. A hybrid approach is used to investigate the problem: macroscopic analytical approach to formulate lane assignment strategies, and numerical simulations to quantify the improvements in throughput for various scenarios. Several strategies are formulated considering various operational conditions for each bottleneck type. Furthermore, compensatory behaviour of HDVs in response to the flow/density imbalance created by the CAV lane assignment is explicitly accounted for in our framework. Evaluation by numerical simulations demonstrates significant benefits of the proposed method, even at low to moderate CAV penetration rates: they can lead to an increase of throughput by several percent, thereby decreasing delays significantly.",0968-090X,Not found

A large neighborhood search algorithm to optimize a demand-responsive feeder service,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103102,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Feeder services are public transit services that transport people from a low demand, typically suburban, area to a high demand area, such as a transportation hub or a city. Here, passengers continue their journey using traditional forms of public transport. On the one hand, on-demand feeder services have been a topic of discussion in a number of recent studies, since these services can serve the demand efficiently. On the other hand, traditional feeder services with predetermined routes and timetables provide predictability and easier cost control. In this paper, a demand-responsive feeder service is considered, which combines positive characteristics of both traditional services as well as on-demand-only services. This feeder service has mandatory bus stops which are always serviced, as well as optional bus stops which are only serviced when there is demand for transportation nearby. To optimize the performance of this feeder service, a large neighborhood search heuristic is developed. Experimental results on 14 benchmark instances illustrate that the LNS algorithm obtains solutions with an average gap of 1% or less compared to the optimal solution, within 1s of runtime. Larger instances can also be solved, typically in less than 60s.

Proactive safety monitoring: A functional approach to detect safety-related anomalies using unmanned aerial vehicle video data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103130,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The advent of smart cities has motivated the field of transportation safety to transition towards a proactive approach that anticipates and mitigates risks before crashes occur. One of the stepping-stones to complete this transition is to monitor the risk levels of the transportation roadway system continuously. With the advancement in emerging technologies, computer-vision-based safety analysis approaches that focus on risk assessment using traffic conflicts quantified by surrogate safety measures extracted from traffic videos have been proposed. As the detailed movements of all the vehicles are logged in the video data, the quantified traffic conflicts can depict the whole picture of risk levels for a specific location. However, the capability of using traffic videos and the quantified traffic conflicts for proactive safety monitoring has yet to be investigated widely. In addition, one of the limitations of past safety research is that safety-related data are mostly aggregated into summary statistics (such as the total number of crashes/conflicts), which constitutes a major simplification of the real risk levels that change over time. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature by proposing a novel functional approach that models time series of a variant of the time exposed time-to-collision safety indicator directly to detect safety-related anomalies from traffic video data. Functional data smoothing methods that can mitigate overfitting and account for the nonnegative characteristics of safety indicator are applied. Nine commonly used functional anomaly detection methods are summarized and compared using approximately one-hour of traffic video data recorded by an unmanned aerial vehicle at a signalized intersection. Ground truth safety-related anomalies are identified by manually reviewing the video data, which is used to validate the performances of anomaly detection methods.

Our model predicts outbound truck volumes with high accuracy. We formulate 2 scenarios to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the model. The model predicts lag and non-proportional responses of truck flows to changes in container turnover at terminals. The findings are relevant for traffic management agencies to help improve the efficiency and reliability of transport networks, in particular around major freight hubs.",0968-090X,Not found
Competition between shared autonomous vehicles and public transit: A case study in Singapore,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103058,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Emerging autonomous vehicles (AV) can either supplement the public transportation (PT) system or compete with it. This study examines the competitive perspective where both AV and PT operators are profit-oriented with dynamic adjustable supply strategies under five regulatory structures regarding whether the AV operator is allowed to change the fleet size and whether the PT operator is allowed to adjust headway. Four out of the five scenarios are constrained competition while the other one focuses on unconstrained competition to find the Nash Equilibrium. We evaluate the competition process as well as the system performance from the standpoints of four stakeholders—the AV operator, the PT operator, passengers, and the transport authority. We also examine the impact of PT subsidies on the competition results including both demand-based and supply-based subsidies. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to update supply strategies for AV and PT based on the operators’ historical actions and profits. An agent-based simulation model is implemented in the first-mile scenario in Tampines, Singapore. We find that the competition can result in higher profits and higher system efficiency for both operators compared to the status quo. After the supply updates, the PT services are spatially concentrated to shorter routes feeding directly to the subway station and temporally concentrated to peak hours. On average, the competition reduces the travel time of passengers but increases their travel costs. Nonetheless, the generalized travel cost is reduced when incorporating the value of time. With respect to the system efficiency, the bus supply adjustment increases the average vehicle load and reduces the total vehicle kilometers traveled measured by the passenger car equivalent (PCE), while the AV supply adjustment does the opposite. The results suggest that PT should be allowed to optimize its supply strategies under specific operation goals and constraints, and AV operations should be regulated to reduce their system impacts, including potentially limiting the number of licenses, operation time, and service areas, which makes AV operate in a manner more complementary to the PT system. Providing subsidies to PT results in higher PT supply, profit, and market share, lower AV supply, profit, and market share, and increased passenger’s generalized cost and total system PCE.",0968-090X,Not found
Extracting the topology of urban airspace through graph abstraction,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103116,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"With the rapid adoption of the operational concept of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in urban airspace, there is an increased focus on the spatial extent that Unmanned Aircraft (UA) can safely navigate. Urban airspace is full of intrinsic risks associated with several factors, including but not limited to unpredictable microclimates, radio-frequency disturbances and electro-magnetic interferences. For safe and efficient use of airspace, it is imperative to proactively assess the availability of airspace volumes to accommodate large-scale operations. In this paper, we highlight that urban airspace is a unique environment where highly obstructed (complex topology) and sparsely structured (simple topology) regions coexist. The presence of static obstacles and required separation from those obstacles create particular spatial structures, such as narrow passages, islands and funnels, throughout the airspace. Considering that not only throughput capacity of airspace but also complexity of path planning is highly dependent on the topology of a navigable space, we propose a new airspace assessment approach to extract the topology of airspace using computational geometry techniques. We focus on identifying geospatial locations suitable for high density UAS operations as well as examining spatial contiguity between those locations in highly urbanized areas. In doing so, we define segment as an airspace region that is wide enough for multiple vehicles to simultaneously pass through. Low-altitude urban airspace is abstracted into a compact and informative graph structure called segment graph that summarizes segment connectivity in the horizontal and vertical dimension. The proposed method shows that the geometry of low-altitude airspace is fundamentally different from that of conventional high-altitude airspace and can provide a useful basis for airspace design and management within low-altitude urban environments.",0968-090X,Not found
Regulating ridesourcing services with product differentiation and congestion externality,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103088,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper proposes a model of the ridesourcing market in presence of traffic congestion and with the provision of both solo and pooling services. Our analysis of the first-best solution shows that, under a highly congested scenario, the ridesourcing platform may enjoy non-negative profits. However, when congestion is low, the ridesourcing market must be subsidized due to low marginal costs of operation. This mirrors previous findings in the traditional taxi literature. We also demonstrate that a commission cap on the solo service combined with a congestion toll (however small) on ridesourcing vehicles can induce any desired, sustainable equilibrium under the assumption of homogeneous value of travel time and sufficient supply of homogeneous drivers. Furthermore, numerical experiments suggest that the most important problem that a regulator should address when faced with a monopoly may not be that of congestion but rather that of market power. Indeed, when congestion is high, similar to previous findings in the literature, decisions by the monopolist tend to mirror that of the regulator. This is because customers on the platform must also bear the congestion cost, which hurts the platform’s revenues. Additionally, numerical examples reveal that, even when accounting for heterogeneity in the value of travel time, the commission cap is able to achieve the second-best–whether combined with a toll or not. This confirms the effectiveness of the commission cap strategy illustrated in previous literature and provides decision makers with a simple, non-intrusive mechanism for regulating the market.",0968-090X,Not found

Lanes must not be blocked for one simple reason: a blocked car might need to leave before the car that blocks it. Self-parking and intelligent communication capabilities of autonomous vehicles introduces an opportunity to overcome this constraint, and therefore to achieve much higher storage capacity of cars. We show how to maximize the number of cars in a parking lot that assumes interfering cars could be moved out of the way by a centralized controller.

Robust optimal predictive control for real-time bus regulation strategy with passenger demand uncertainties in urban rapid transit,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103086,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The bus is inevitably affected by various factors during the trip, which causes that the phenomenon of bus bunching often occurs. This paper proposed a nonlinear optimal control model with passenger demand and disturbance uncertainties for the real-time bus regulation in urban rapid transit. The aim of this model is to assure the stability of bus headway in the line, reduce passengers’ waiting time and improve bus service level. Considering the system uncertainties and the real-time control requirement of bus regulation, a robust optimal predictive control algorithm is put forward to generate the real-time optimal bus regulation strategy based on updated delay feedback of buses by a rolling horizon strategy. Simultaneously, by using continuous interval number to describe the uncertain parameters, the robust counterpart of the formulated robust optimization model is obtained using the duality theory, which is further converted to a mixed integer convex quadratic programming problem by a linearization method, which can be easily solved to obtain the robust solution with a good performance for any value of uncertain parameters.

Joint predictions of multi-modal ride-hailing demands: A deep multi-task multi-graph learning-based approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103063,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Ride-hailing platforms generally provide various service options to customers, such as solo ride services, shared ride services, etc. It is generally expected that demands for different service modes are correlated, and the prediction of demand for one service mode can benefit from historical observations of demands for other service modes. Moreover, an accurate joint prediction of demands for multiple service modes can help the platforms better allocate and dispatch vehicle resources. Although there is a large stream of literature on ride-hailing demand predictions for one specific service mode, few efforts have been paid towards joint predictions of ride-hailing demands for multiple service modes. To address this issue, we propose a deep multi-task multi-graph learning approach, which combines two components: (1) multiple multi-graph convolutional (MGC) networks for predicting demands for different service modes, and (2) multi-task learning modules that enable knowledge sharing across multiple MGC networks. More specifically, two multi-task learning structures are established. The first one is the regularized cross-task learning, which builds cross-task connections among the inputs and outputs of multiple MGC networks. The second one is the multi-linear relationship learning, which imposes a prior tensor normal distribution on the weights of various MGC networks. Although there are no concrete bridges between different MGC networks, the weights of these networks are constrained by each other and subject to a common prior distribution. Evaluated with the for-hire-vehicle datasets in Manhattan, we show that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms in prediction accuracy for different ride-hailing modes.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic driving environment complexity quantification method and its verification,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103051,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"To meet the requirements of scenario-based testing for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), driving scenario characterization has become a critical issue. Existing studies have concluded that complexity is a necessary criticality measure for supporting critical AV testing scenario identification. However, the existing scenario complexity quantification studies mainly have two limitations, namely, subjective quantification methods highly rely on human participations and are difficult to apply to big data, and existing objective methods lack consideration of human driver characteristics and hence the performance cannot be guaranteed. To bridge these research gaps, a general objective quantification framework is proposed to quantify human drivers’ judgement on driving environment complexity, by describing the vehicle-vehicle spatial-temporal interactions from the perspectives of quantity, variety, and relations. The model mainly contains three parts. First, to describe quantity information, a dynamic influencing area was set to identify the surrounding vehicles that contribute to driving environment complexity based on Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) theory. Second, considering the various surrounding vehicles’ driving statuses, behaviors, and intentions, a basic vehicle-pair complexity quantification model was constructed based on encounter angles. Then, nonlinear relationships based upon information entropy theory were introduced to capture the heterogeneous longitudinal and lateral complexities. Third, a vehicle-pair complexity aggregation and smoothing step was conducted to reflect the characteristics of human driver's cognition. To demonstrate the abovementioned model, empirical Field Operational Test (FOT) data from Shanghai urban roadways were used to conduct case studies, and it can be concluded that this model can accurately describe the timing and extent of the complexity change, and reveal the complexity differences due to scenario type and spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Besides, Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) index was calculated to validate the consistency of scenario complexity judgement between the proposed model and human drivers, and for performance comparison with the existing models. Finally, the applications of the proposed model and its further investigations have been discussed.",0968-090X,Not found
Incorporating personalization and bounded rationality into stochastic transit assignment model,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103127,127,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The use of smartphone applications (apps) to acquire real-time information for trip planning has become and progressively continues becoming a more instinctive behavior among public transport (PT) users. Thus, it becomes an integral part of the design and management of PT systems, but corresponding transit assignment models for improving the prediction of passenger ridership have yet to be developed. This work proposes a novel stochastic transit assignment model that predicts passenger ridership. Two new features are incorporated into a transit assignment model, namely, personalization and bounded rationality. Personalization refers to a personalized route-ranking methodology so that the app recommends paths with respect to a traveler’s preference considering various PT attributes. Bounded rationality is modeled over three route-choice strategies representing different levels of cognitive effort exercised by a traveler in selecting a path from the set of paths recommended by the app. The transit assignment model is formulated as a fixed-point problem. Because the mapping function of the fixed-point formulation is not necessarily continuous, the model constructs an approximated fixed point existing under certain measures of discontinuity. The method of successive averages (MSA) is applied to solve the problem. Numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the properties of the new transit assignment model, the effect of demand on the path choice probability, and the effect of passengers’ heterogeneity on the convergence of the algorithm. The results reveal that, with a personalized path recommendation, passenger’s preferences could stabilize the differences of path choice probability when adopting route-choice strategies relying on the path order. In addition, although the MSA may not always converge and oscillate, the fluctuation is below the derived measure of discontinuity, indicating that an approximated fixed point can be found.",0968-090X,Not found

Using data from relevant Twitter users, a Twitter influence score was established for each of the 947 municipalities in the Barcelona Region, providing a spatially distributed picture of the demand to attend the event, prior to event ticket purchase. This was used as the basis for planning and delivering 11 new commercially viable event bus routes transporting over 450 additional passengers from peri-urban and more rural areas in the Barcelona Region.

Data-driven road side unit location optimization for connected-autonomous-vehicle-based intersection control,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103169,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Low communication delay is crucial for the effectiveness of connected-autonomous-vehicle-based (CAV-based) intersection control strategies. To achieve low vehicle-to-road-side-unit (V2R) communication delay and support the implementation of CAV-based intersection control strategies, this study addresses the problem of road side unit (RSU) location optimization at a single intersection. Considering the uncertainty of the selection of intersection control strategies, the problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program. The model aims to minimize the sum of the cost associated with RSU investment and the expectation of the penalty cost associated with V2R communication delay exceeding a pre-determined threshold. The first stage of the program determines the number and location of RSUs, when the intersection control strategy to be implemented is unknown. Given the first stage decision and the implemented intersection control strategy, the second stage model optimizes the detection area allocation among RSUs to minimize the penalty cost. The model is linearized using the piecewise linearization technique. Then an integer L-Shaped algorithm is proposed to find a global optimal solution to the linearized program. In the numerical example, the proposed model is compared with a deterministic model. The results demonstrate that the V2R communication reduction per cost obtained by the proposed model is 28.95 larger than that obtained by the deterministic model, in the scenario that a CAV-based control strategy is implemented in the second stage. This indicates that the proposed model provides cost-effective low V2R communication delay for intersection control in CAV environment.",0968-090X,Not found
Airline unit load device dispatch and scale in short-term operations involving skypooling – A new sharing economy in airline industry,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103164,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The skypooling is a free platform for the sharing of unit load devices (ULD), which contributes a new sharing economy by allowing airlines to exchange ULDs and coordinate ULD delivery services. The akypooling aids airlines to match their requirements for the two ULD sharing operations. However, such matching is not always successful. The matching success rate naturally affects skypooling performance and generates a gap between the expected and available numbers of ULDs for the two ULD sharing operations. We design two achievement rates for ULD sharing operations, which represent the likelihood of meeting ULD dispatch requirements in actual operations, as well as devising.

The Multi-visit Traveling Salesman Problem with Multi-Drones,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103172,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The use of drones for parcel delivery has recently attracted wide attention due to its potential in improving efficiency of the last-mile delivery. Though attempts have been made on combined truck-drone delivery to deploy multiple drones that can deliver multiple packages per trip, many placed extra assumptions to simplify the problem. This paper investigates the multi-visit traveling salesman problem with multi-drones (MTSP-MD), whose objective is to minimize the time (makespan) required by the truck and the drones to serve all customers together. The energy consumption of the drone depends on the flight time, the self-weight of the drone and the total weight of packages carried by the drone, which declines after each delivery throughout the drone flight. The MTSP-MD problem consists of three complicated sub-problems, namely (1) the drone flight problem with both a payload capacity constraint and an energy endurance constraint, (2) the traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints, and (3) the synchronization problem between the truck route and the drone schedules. The problem is first formulated into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) model and we propose a multi-start tabu search (MSTS) algorithm with tailored neighborhood structure and a two-level solution evaluation method that incorporates a drone-level segment-based evaluation and a solution-level evaluation based on the critical path method (CPM).

Safety challenges for autonomous vehicles in the absence of connectivity,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103133,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are promoted as a technology that will create a future with effortless driving and virtually no traffic accidents. AV companies claim that, when fully developed, the technology will eliminate 94% of all accidents that are caused by human error. Indeed, these AVs will likely avoid the large number of crashes caused by impaired, distracted or reckless drivers. But there remains a significant proportion of crashes for which no driver is directly responsible. In particular, the absence of connectivity of an AV with its neighboring vehicles (V2V) and the infrastructure (I2V) leads to a lack of information that can induce such crashes. Since AV designs today do not require such connectivity, these crashes would persist in the future. Using prototypical examples motivated by the NHTSA pre-crash scenario typology, we show that fully autonomous vehicles cannot guarantee safety in the absence of connectivity. Combining theoretical models and empirical data, we also argue that such hazardous scenarios will occur with a significantly high probability.

Why did you predict that? Towards explainable artificial neural networks for travel demand analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103143,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in transportation research in general and travel demand analysis in particular. While ANNs typically outperform conventional methods in terms of predictive performance, they suffer from limited explainability. That is, it is very difficult to assess whether or not particular predictions made by an ANN are based on intuitively reasonable relationships embedded in the model. As a result, it is difficult for analysts to gain trust in ANNs. In this paper, we show that often-used approaches using perturbation (sensitivity analysis) are ill-suited for gaining an understanding of the inner workings of ANNs. Subsequently, and this is the main contribution of this paper, we introduce to the domain of transportation an alternative method, inspired by recent progress in the field of computer vision. This method is based on a re-conceptualisation of the idea of ‘heat maps’ to explain the predictions of a trained ANN. To create a heat map, a prediction of an ANN is propagated backward in the ANN towards the input variables, using a technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). The resulting heat map shows the contribution of each input value –for example the travel time of a certain mode– to a given travel mode choice prediction. By doing this, the LRP-based heat map reveals the rationale behind the prediction in a way that is understandable to human analysts. If the rationale makes sense to the analyst, the trust in the prediction, and, by extension, in the trained ANN as a whole, will increase. If the rationale does not make sense, the analyst may choose to adapt or re-train the ANN or decide not to use it at all. We show that by reconceptualising the LRP methodology towards the choice modelling and travel demand analysis contexts, it can be put to effective use in application domains well beyond the field of computer vision, for which it was originally developed.",0968-090X,Not found

Onboard sensing equipment including LiDAR and camera can reasonably characterize the traffic environment in the immediate locality of the CAV. However, their performance is limited by their sensor range (SR). On the other hand, longer-range information is helpful for characterizing imminent conditions downstream. By contemporaneously coalescing the short- and long-range information, the CAV can construct comprehensively its surrounding environment and thereby facilitate informed, safe, and effective movement planning in the short-term (local decisions including lane change) and long-term (route choice). Current literature provides useful information on CAV control approaches that use only local information sensed from the proximate traffic environment but relatively little guidance on how to fuse this information with that obtained from downstream sources and from different time stamps, and how to use the fused information to enhance CAV movements. In this paper, we describe a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach that integrates the data collected through sensing and connectivity capabilities from other vehicles located in the proximity of the CAV and from those located further downstream, and we use the fused data to guide lane changing, a specific context of CAV operations. In addition, recognizing the importance of the connectivity range (CR) to the performance of not only the algorithm but also of the vehicle in the actual driving environment, the study carried out a case study. The case study demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm and duly identifies the appropriate CR for each level of prevailing traffic density. It is expected that implementation of the algorithm in CAVs can enhance the safety and mobility associated with CAV driving operations. From a general perspective, its implementation can provide guidance to connectivity equipment manufacturers and CAV operators, regarding the default CR settings for CAVs or the recommended CR setting in a given traffic environment.",0968-090X,Not found

It includes recommendation about what calibration settings should be avoided and what are to be adopted. On the one hand, a general agreement on a sound calibration setting for car-following models is deemed necessary for comparing results from different studies which use different models and datasets.

The data is combined with meteorological data to provide additional features. Bayesian networks are then learnt from the feature set, and two network learning algorithms are compared, Bayesian Search and Greedy Thick Thinning (GTT). Cross-validation of the resulting networks shows both algorithms produce similarly performing networks, and a subjective analysis concludes that the GTT algorithm is marginally preferred. The resulting networks produce relative probabilities, which airlines can use to quantitatively assess runway veer-off risk under different scenarios, such as different meteorological conditions and unstable approaches. This paper's main finding is that by utilising existing data sources, such as FDM and weather databases, airlines can create and use Bayesian networks alongside their existing qualitative risk assessment methods to provide quantitative risk assessment and understand the effect of different conditions on those risks. This is not possible with current methods in use by airlines. The method described can be extended to other operational safety risks, such as runway overrun.",0968-090X,Not found
Incorporating travel behavior regularity into passenger flow forecasting,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103200,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Accurate forecasting of passenger flow (i.e., ridership) is critical to the operation of urban metro systems. Previous studies mainly model passenger flow as time series by aggregating individual trips and then perform forecasting based on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach essentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each individual traveler. For example, a traveler’s work trip in the morning can help predict his/her home trip in the evening, while this causal structure cannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this paper, we propose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the generative mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong regularity rooted in travel behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow from previous alighting trips as a new covariate, which captures the causal structure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on travel behavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize the causal relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework is evaluated using real-world passenger flow data, and the results confirm that the returning flow—a single covariate—can substantially and consistently improve various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead forecasting, multi-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the proposed method is more effective for business-type stations with most passengers come and return within the same day. This study can be extended to other modes of transport, and it also sheds new light on general demand time series forecasting problems, in which causal structure and long-range dependencies are generated by the user behavior.",0968-090X,Not found
Multistep traffic forecasting by dynamic graph convolution: Interpretations of real-time spatial correlations,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103185,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Accurate and explainable short-term traffic forecasting is pivotal for making trustworthy decisions in advanced traffic control and guidance systems. Recently, deep learning approach, as a data-driven alternative to traffic flow model-based data assimilation and prediction methods, has become popular in this domain. Many of these deep learning models show promising predictive performance, but inherently suffer from a lack of interpretability. This difficulty largely originates from the inconsistency between the static input–output mappings encoded in deep neural networks and the dynamic nature of traffic phenomena. Under different traffic conditions, such as freely-flowing versus heavily congested traffic, different mappings are needed to predict the propagation of congestion and the resulting speeds over the network more accurately. In this study, we design a novel variant of the graph attention mechanism. The major innovation of this so-called dynamic graph convolution (DGC) module is that local area-wide graph convolutional kernels are dynamically generated from evolving traffic states to capture real-time spatial dependencies. When traffic conditions change, the spatial correlation encoded by DGC module changes as well. Using the DGC, we propose a multistep traffic forecasting model, the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (DGCN). Experiments using real freeway data show that the DGCN has a competitive predictive performance compared to other state-of-the-art models. Equally importantly, the prediction process in the DGCN and the trained parameters are indeed explainable. It turns out that the DGCN learns to mimic the upstream–downstream asymmetric information flow of typical road traffic operations. Specifically, there exists a speed-dependent optimal receptive field – which governs what information the DGC kernels assimilate – that is consistent with the back-propagation speed of stop-and-go waves in traffic streams. This implies that the learnt parameters are consistent with traffic flow theory. We believe that this research paves a path to more transparent deep learning models applied for short-term traffic forecasting.",0968-090X,Not found
A continuous model for coordinated pricing of mixed access modes to transit,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103208,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The land-use pattern for many cities is a central business district surrounded by sprawling suburbs. This pattern can lead to an inefficient and congestion-prone transportation system due to a reliance on automobiles. This is because high-capacity transit is inefficient in low-density areas where insufficient travelers can access transit. This also poses an equity concern as the monetary cost of faster and more expensive travel disproportionately burdens low income travelers, especially when fixed congestion pricing is imposed. This paper presents a deterministic approximation of a discrete choice model for mixed access and mainline transportation modes, meaning that travelers may use different modes to access a mainline system, such as transit. The purpose is to provide a tractable computationally efficient model to address the first/last mile problem using a system-wide pricing policy that can account for heterogeneous values of time; a problem that is difficult to solve efficiently using a stochastic model. The model is structured for a catchment area around a central access point for a mainline mode, approximating choice by comparing modal utility costs. The underlying utility model accommodates both fixed prices (e.g., parking, fixed tolls, and fares) and distance-based unit prices (e.g. taxi fare, bike-share, and distance tolls) that may be set in a coordinated way with respect to value of time. Using numerical analysis to assess accuracy, the deterministic model achieved results within 3% of a stochastic logit-based model, and within 7% of measured values. The optimization of prices using the final model achieved a 22% reduction in generalized travel time and a 30% improvement in the Gini inequity measure from 0.2 to 0.14.",0968-090X,Not found
Development of optimal scheduling strategy and approach control model of multicopter VTOL aircraft for urban air mobility (UAM) operation,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103181,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Urban air mobility (UAM) is emerging as a new alternative to solve the traffic problem in the metropolitan area. Industries and government agencies are preparing for the future UAM system and operation. A new ATC (Air Traffic Control) strategy or aircraft separation method that reflects flight characteristics of multicopter VTOL (Vertical Take-off and Landing) aircraft is required. Particularly, approach control around the vertiport is one of the essential issues for the safe and efficient operation of UAM, and strict safety standards are required for service in populated urban areas. In this study, the concept of holding points where multicopter aircraft can hover is introduced, and three scheduling strategies for arriving aircraft are developed and evaluated by comparing the on-time performance (OTP) with hovering time and ground time. BQA (Branch Queuing Approach), SBA (Sequence-based Approach) and, SBAM (sequence-based approach with moving circles) models are proposed and compared. BQA model prioritizes airspace safety by limiting the aircraft’s travel path; SBA model allows the aircraft to move freely within the airspace and prioritizes aircraft’s arrival sequence; and finally, SBAM adds the moving circle concept to the SBA model. For each model, OTP and loss of separation (LOS) risk of the proposed models are found and they are compared by simulations. The simulation result shows that SBA and BQA have similar punctuality performance and BQA model with no LOS risk is the most efficient approach control model for multicopter VTOL aircraft of UAM.",0968-090X,Not found
How many trip requests could we support? An activity-travel based vehicle scheduling approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103222,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"In a world of ever-changing travel behavior and ever-increasing modal options, is vital to have integrated models that could capture the interactions between supply and demand layers of travel. Addressing this need, we propose three different versions of network representation and mathematical models for the activity-based vehicle routing problem to connect activity-travel graphs of passengers (demand layer) to spatio-temporal networks of vehicles (supply layer). Versions I and II are arc-based, while version III is path-based. In version I, we introduce the concept of activity-travel graphs for passengers. For vehicles, we construct space–time networks and add a new dimension, called “under-service state”, to track the execution status of trip requests at any location and time. In version II, we reduce the complexity of the network structure by eliminating the state dimension and some other modifications in the structure of the passengers’ and vehicles’ network. Although both versions can capture various behavioral constraints of the activity-based vehicle routing problem (e.g., mandatory and optimal activities, duration of activities, chain of activities, preferred starting and ending times of activities), due to the high level of complexity of the network structure, both versions can only solve small-sized problems. To tackle the computational complexity, we propose a path-based network representation in version III, and to make a balance between the disutility of passengers and vehicles, we present a tolled user equilibrium problem. Mathematical models are coded in C and GAMS and implemented on real-world Phoenix regional transportation network with more than 39 million trip requests, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for the original and restricted master problems.",0968-090X,Not found
On multi-class automated vehicles: Car-following behavior and its implications for traffic dynamics,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103166,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper develops a unifying framework to unveil the physical car-following (CF) behaviors of automated vehicles (AVs) under different control paradigms and parameter settings. The proposed framework adopts the flexible asymmetric behavior (AB) model to reveal the control mechanisms and their manifestation in the physical CF behavior, particularly their response to traffic disturbances. A mapping relationship between the AB model parameters and control parameters is then obtained to understand the range of CF behavior possible. Finally, a predictive modeling approach based on a logistic classifier coupled with a convoluted Multivariate Gaussian Process ( MGP ) is designed to predict the CF behavior of an AV. Analysis of two well-known controllers, linear state-feedback and Model Predictive Control (MPC), show how the proposed framework can uncover the CF mechanisms and provide insights into traffic-level disturbance evolution. The proposed analysis framework remains scalable and can be applied to a variety of controllers. Ultimately, it can guide AV control design that is not myopic, but considers traffic-level performance.",0968-090X,Not found
Game theoretical framework for bicycle operations: A multi-strategy framework,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103175,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper presents a novel microscopic modelling framework for bicycle flow operations. The modelling principles are based on similar principles successfully applied in our previous work on pedestrian and vessel flow. The main contributions of the paper are in the extension towards modelling cyclists that has not been proposed in literature before, and in the insights gained by simulation with the model using different scenarios, showing how the model outcomes depend on the modelling choices and parameters. The generalisation entails two major changes compared to our previous pedestrian model. First of all, the model does justice to the kinematics of cyclists. Contrary to pedestrians, cyclist are more restricted in their movement. The model approximates these restrictions by considering speed and movement direction and changes therein. Secondly, the model includes different strategies (cooperative, zero-acceleration, demon opponent) in its underlying game-theoretical framework, and allows including traffic rules. This allows us to model different attitudes towards risk representing different types of cyclists. The (qualitative) insights gained by application of the model pertain to one-on-one interactions between cyclists and the impact of the strategy assumptions and parameter choices on those interactions as well as on the collective phenomena that occur in the cyclist flow and their sensitivity to parameters (reflecting the extent of the prediction horizon, the level of anisotropy, and the relative importance of keeping the desired path). With respect to the collective phenomena, we look at efficiency and self-organised patterns. We conclude that the model acts in a plausible manner. While we do not aim to show empirical validity, we see that the qualitative behaviour of one-on-one interactions is plausible if compared to experimental or field data. We also observe plausible collective patterns, including forms of self-organisation under specific parameter settings. The latter is not trivial given the fundamental differences in bicycle and pedestrian flow.",0968-090X,Not found
Automated joint faulting measurement based on full-lane 3D pavement surface data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103221,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Using full-lane 3D pavement data, this paper proposes an automated and systematic approach to efficient measurement of pavement faulting occurring at transverse joints. First, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed in the paper to detect pavement joints. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FCN outperforms FCN-VGG16 and U-Net in terms of detection accuracy, but results in a slower processing speed due to the increased number of hidden layers. Compared with the 3D Shadow Modeling, the proposed FCN shows significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and time efficiency. The precision, recall and F-measure achieved by the proposed FCN on 1130 testing images are 92.64%, 97.14% and 94.83% respectively. Based on detection outputs of the proposed FCN, this paper applies Hough Transform only at orientations feasible for transverse joints. Such a strategy helps retain transverse joints for analysis, and eliminate unneeded longitudinal joints. Finally, this paper proposes a practical method to conduct comprehensive faulting measurements along the entire detected transverse joint, while field measurements today are generally on limited spots on the joint. Meaningful statistical indicators are also recommended in the paper to describe the general faulting condition along a transverse joint. The field test on a jointed concrete pavement reveals that the proposed automated approach is comparable in accuracy with manual investigation. Measurement errors at most testing locations are within ± 2 mm, and the average absolute error with respect to all testing locations is 1.2 mm. Compared with manual means or automated methods using only a few longitudinal profiles, the proposed automation of faulting survey achieves the following improvements: detecting transverse joints to the full-lane width through full-lane 3D pavement data as well as deep learning technology, and measuring faulting values along the entire transverse joint in a more efficient and more complete manner.",0968-090X,Not found
Trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles in complicated urban environments: A control network approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103120,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Trajectory planning is crucial for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) applications. It is still a challenge to plan UAV trajectories in large-scale complicated three-dimensional urban environments, mainly due to the complexities associated with handling a tremendous number of obstacles. To relieve this difficulty, this study proposes a two-stage control network approach. The first stage is an offline planning stage, aiming at constructing a discrete control network in the working environment achieving collision avoidance and meanwhile considering UAV kinetic properties. The second stage is an online planning stage, where a feasible corridor is generated based on the shortest path in the control network, and the obtained route is smoothed by a three-dimensional Dubins curve algorithm; then, a time-optimal trajectory generation algorithm is applied to trace the designed spatial path. Numerical studies based on a virtual city as well as a large-scale real-world urban area are conducted.

Dynamic driving and routing games for autonomous vehicles on networks: A mean field game approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103189,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper aims to answer the research question as to optimal design of decision-making processes for autonomous vehicles (AVs), including dynamical selection of driving velocity and route choices on a transportation network. Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) has been widely used to model travelers’ route choice or/and departure-time choice and predict dynamic traffic flow evolution in the short term. However, the existing DTA models do not explicitly describe one’s selection of driving velocity on a road link. Driving velocity choice may not be crucial for modeling the movement of human drivers but it is a must-have control to maneuver AVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a game-theoretic model to solve for AVs’ optimal driving strategies of velocity control in the interior of a road link and route choice at a junction node. To this end, we will first reinterpret the DTA problem as an N-car differential game and show that this game can be tackled with a general mean field game-theoretic framework. The developed mean field game is challenging to solve because of the forward and backward structure for velocity control and the complementarity conditions for route choice. An efficient algorithm is developed to address these challenges. The model and the algorithm are illustrated on the Braess network and the OW network with a single destination. On the Braess network, we first compare the LWR based DTA model with the proposed game and find that the driving and routing control navigates AVs with overall lower costs. We then compare the total travel cost without and with the middle link and find that the Braess paradox may still arise under certain conditions. We also test our proposed model and solution algorithm on the OW network.",0968-090X,Not found
An integrated approach of train scheduling and rolling stock circulation with skip-stopping pattern for urban rail transit lines,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103170,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Integrated planning for urban rail transit (URT) systems is a significant technique in URT operation to balance service level and operating cost. It is generally oriented towards transportation efficiency and solved in a sequential way due to the complexity, but ignores the service experiences among equitable passengers and the utilization balance among equal rolling stocks. This paper aims to study the integrated planning for an oversaturated URT line, incorporating the fairness in train scheduling and workload balance in rolling stock circulation that are measured by two defined min–max indexes. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is established to formulate the integrated planning of stop planning, train scheduling and rolling stock circulation, explicitly considering time-dependent origin–destination demand, first-come-first-serve principle and rigid capacity constraints. Due to the model complexity, an iterative searching approach (ISA) is proposed to solve the model, involving adjusting stop patterns, departure times and connections at the depot terminal. The performance of the ISA is evaluated by three cases with different time lengths based on the practical data from No.8 URT line in Guangzhou. The results are compared with the practical plans and the solutions solved by the two-stage approach respectively. It shows that the ISA can not only mitigate unfairness and balance workload, but also improve transportation efficiency. We also investigate the optimization effects and application conditions of different combinations of searching strategies in the ISA. Furthermore, the study on the typical case during peak hours shows more details about the optimization effects and mechanism of the ISA, which can reach a uniform state in both service level and resource utilization.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimizing the integrated off-ramp signal control to prevent queue spillback to the freeway mainline,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103220,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This study presents an integrated off-ramp control model that incorporates the impact of ramp queue spillback on the freeway mainline in design of the off-ramp intersection’s signal plan. The proposed model consists of a mesoscopic traffic module to capture the complex interrelations between the freeway mainline’s traffic state and the lane-changing maneuvers triggered by off-ramp queue spillback, and a local signal optimization module to maximize the total benefit for both the freeway and intersection in the vicinity of an interchange. Using the simulation–optimization solution logic, the proposed model will first estimate the off-ramp queue length, produced from the signal module, to assess the resulting impacts on the freeway mainline, and then feed such impacts back to the control objective to iteratively search for the optimal cycle length and phase durations with the genetic algorithm. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, this study has conducted a two-stage evaluation, where the first stage uses the extensive field data to confirm the reliability of its freeway queue impact module and the second stage focuses on evaluating the benefits of accounting for the queue impacts on the freeway in design of the off-ramp signal plan under various traffic scenarios. The results from extensive tests have confirmed that the proposed model can effectively minimize the likelihood of causing off-ramp queues to spill back to the freeway mainline, and the failing to incorporate such impacts in design of the off-ramp signal will contribute significantly to the formation of freeway bottlenecks in the interchange area.",0968-090X,Not found
A data-driven method for falsified vehicle trajectory identification by anomaly detection,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103196,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications enable a wide range of new applications, which bring prominent benefits to the transportation system. However, malicious attackers can potentially launch falsified data attacks against V2I applications to jeopardize the traffic operation. To ensure the benefits brought by the V2I applications, it is critical to protect the applications from those cyber-attacks. However, existing literature on the defense solution that protects the V2I applications is very limited. This paper aims to fill this research gap by proposing a data-driven method to identify falsified trajectories generated by compromised connected vehicles (CVs). A trajectory embedding model, inspired by the word embedding model from the natural language processing (NLP) community, is developed. The proposed trajectory embedding model generates vector representations of vehicle trajectories that can be used to compute the similarities between trajectories. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, historical trajectory data are used to train a neural network and obtain the vector representations of trajectories. The second step computes a distance matrix between each pair of trajectories and identifies falsified trajectories using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method has a very high detection rate (>97.0%) under different attack goals with varying CV penetration rates from 100% to 25%, while the false alarm rate remains low. It has great potential to be implemented in a wide range of trajectory-based CV applications such as traffic state estimation and traffic signal control, to safeguard the CV system from cyber threats.",0968-090X,Not found
Markov-game modeling of cyclist-pedestrian interactions in shared spaces: A multi-agent adversarial inverse reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103191,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Understanding and modeling road user dynamics and their microscopic interaction behaviour at shared space facilities are curial for several applications including safety and performance evaluations. Despite the multi-agent nature of road user interactions, the majority of previous studies modeled their interactions as a single-agent modeling framework, i.e., considering the other interaction agents as part of the passive environment. However, this assumption is unrealistic and could limit the model's accuracy and transferability in non-stationary road user environments. This study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning approach (MA-AIRL) to model and simulate road user interactions at shared space facilities. Unlike the traditional game-theoretic framework that models multi-agent systems as a single time-step payoff, the proposed approach is based on Markov Games (MG) which models road users' sequential decisions concurrently. Moreover, the proposed model can handle bounded rationality agents, e.g., limited information access, through the implementation of the Logistic Stochastic Best Response Equilibrium (LSBRE) solution concept. The proposed algorithm recovers road users' multi-agent reward functions using adversarial deep neural network discriminators and estimates their optimal policies using Multi-agent Actor-Critic with Kronecker factors (MACK) deep reinforcement learning. Data from three shared space locations in Vancouver, BC and New York City, New York are used in this study. The model's performance is compared to a baseline single-agent Gaussian Process Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GPIRL). The results show that the multi-agent modeling framework led to a significantly more accurate prediction of road users’ behaviour and their evasive action mechanisms. Moreover, the recovered reward functions based on the single-agent modeling approach failed to capture the equilibrium solution concept similar to the multi-agent approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Adaptive network traffic control with an integrated model-based and data-driven approach and a decentralised solution method,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103154,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper presents an adaptive traffic controller for stochastic road networks with an integrated model-based and data-driven solution framework. The model-based optimisation component operates based upon an underlying kinematic wave model driven by stochastic demand within a prediction horizon. The data-driven optimisation component operates based upon an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) formulation which approximates the state-control interactions over future stages with a parametric approximator. The approximator reduces the computational complexity of the adaptive control problem by parameterising the state and decision space. The parametric approximator is to be iteratively updated with online feeding of realisations of traffic states via a temporal difference (TD) learning process. Our results reveal that incorporation of the model-based component facilitates the training of the ADP-based state approximator, and hence improve the overall performance of the control system. We further develop a decentralised solution approach in which individual intersections are allowed to derive their own control policies in an asynchronous manner. The data-driven ADP approximator would serve as a central agent coordinating the control policies derived at individual intersections in the network. This is shown to be able to improve and stabilise the performance of the overall control system even under congested conditions. This is a significant progress in adaptive control system design with use of decentralised optimisation techniques.

However, a major threat to the growing usage of shared-cars is customer churn. Despite companies continually providing rewards to attract customers, factors that contribute to customer churn are not well-understood in the existing literature. This study analyzed one-year transaction data of a one-way carsharing program and applied an extended Cox proportional hazards model to examine these effects. Our results show that: (1) A customer’s retention probability decreased over time with a decelerating rate. (2) Customers were less likely to churn when their frequently-visited shared-car stations were located in neighborhoods with low access to transit or in areas with colleges, railway hubs, or airports. (3) Elderly and male customers had a lower likelihood of churning. (4) The number of coupons was negatively associated with the likelihood of customer churn. (5) The effect of coupons generally increased at first and then decreased after the 130th day. These findings contribute to coupon design and the location choice of shared-car stations. Specifically, we suggest that large-denomination coupons should be split into multiple small-denomination coupons. We encourage companies to locate stations in areas with poor transit access. Meanwhile, coupon issuing strategies can be redeveloped. Offering more coupons to new customers can help maximize the profits of service providers.

The model is applied in a case study consisting of 20 turnarounds during a morning peak at Frankfurt airport. Schedule recovery performance (resilience) is analyzed for a set of key performance indicators within multiple scenario instances which contain different resource availability and aim at solving various arrival delay situations. Results highlight that a minimization of tactical cost concurrently reduces average departure delay for flight and passengers while recovery performance is substantially affected when some options are not included in the evaluation process. Thus, our concept provides airlines with an optimization approach for constrained airport resources so that total cost and delay resulting from schedule deviations are reduced, which may benefit strategic schedule planning and improve predictability of operations for local collaborators, such as airport, ground handlers and ATM performance.",0968-090X,Not found

In addition, transit routes involve dedicated bus lanes that occupy part of the city streets and affect the capacity reserved for private cars. Hence, roadway congestion depends on the transit route design, and its dynamic evolution is described by regional macroscopic fundamental diagrams. The proposed modeling framework consists of two parts: a bus network optimization module based on continuum approximation that produces optimal headways and local route spacing, and a dynamic aggregated network model that determines route choice, mode split, and user equilibrium conditions.

Numerical experiments in a four-region network demonstrate that the proposed parking dispatch and regional route guidance of AVs are effective in reducing intense cruising-for-parking traffic, and the integration of both has the best control performance by regulating the network towards under-saturated conditions.

According to the event-triggered control framework, a co-design method is introduced to design the cruise controller and the event-triggered condition jointly. Based on the Lyapunov stability method, a sufficient condition for the existence of the robust state-feedback control law and the event-triggered condition parameter are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which ensures that the high-speed train tracks the desired speed, and the coupler deviations are stable at the equilibrium point under external disturbances. With the fact that the event-triggered controller often requires a dedicated detector to continuously monitor the system state, a self-triggered implementation is further developed to dynamically calculate the next triggered instant at each update time based on recently collected information.

Dynamic user equilibrium for departure time choice in the basic trip-based model,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103190,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Recent research indicates that the trip-based models can perform more accurately for capturing network hyper-congestion than the conventional macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) dynamics, especially during transient phases. However, due to the complex mathematical structure of the trip-based models, deriving analytical properties of the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) of departure time choice with the trip-based models is still a challenge. This paper investigates the DUE problem of departure time choice in an isotropic urban network with identical travelers. Traffic dynamics is captured by the basic trip-based model using a speed-MFD that maps the traffic accumulation to the space-mean speed of the network. Necessary conditions for dynamic user equilibrium with and without inflow capacity constraint are derived, respectively. Under dynamic user equilibrium condition, no traveler can reduce her/his travel cost by changing the departure time. The analysis reveals the significant difference between the basic trip-based model and the conventional MFD models regarding the information support involved in the departure time choice. The derivation does not rely on some common assumptions in the literature such as linear travel cost function, no late arrivals, or linear speed-MFD.

Dynamic modeling and real-time management of a system of EV fast-charging stations,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103186,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and thus EV charging, has steadily increased over the last decade. Studies suggest that fast-charging facilities are crucial for the EV market. However, there is limited fast-charging infrastructure in most parts of the world to support EV travel, especially long-distance trips. The goal of this study is to develop a stochastic dynamic simulation modeling framework of a regional system of EV fast-charging stations for real-time management and strategic planning (i.e., capacity allocation) purposes. To model EV user behavior, specifically fast-charging station choices, the framework incorporates a multinomial logit station choice model that considers station charging prices, expected wait times, and detour distances. To capture the dynamics of supply and demand at each EV fast-charging station, the framework incorporates a multi-server queueing model in the simulation. The study assumes that multiple fast-charging stations are managed by a single entity (public or private) and that the demand for these stations are interrelated (through the station choice model). To manage the system of stations, this study proposes and tests dynamic demand-responsive price adjustment (DDRPA) schemes based on station queue lengths. The study applies the modeling framework to a system of EV fast-charging stations in Southern California. The computational results indicate that DDRPA strategies are an effective mechanism to balance charging demand across fast-charging stations. Specifically, compared to the no DDRPA scheme case, the quadratic DDRPA scheme reduces average wait time by 26%, increases charging station revenue (and user costs) by 5.8%, while, most importantly, increasing social welfare by 2.7% in the base scenario. Moreover, the study also illustrates that the modeling framework can evaluate the allocation of EV fast-charging station capacity, to identify stations that require additional chargers and areas that would benefit from additional fast-charging stations.",0968-090X,Not found
Information provision and congestion pricing in a risky two-route network with heterogeneous travelers,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103083,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Travel information and congestion pricing are two major approaches to relieving congestions. This paper examines travelers’ travel strategies and route choices in a road network with a risky route and a safe route, where travel information pricing are jointly implemented. We derive the equilibrium of the risk-averse travelers with heterogeneous Values of Time (VOTs) under various information regimes. We find that information regarding the risky road conditions would not necessarily improve the expected system travel time. When there is no toll, free information surprisingly makes congestion worse. When information is not free, congestion may be reduced if both toll and information are properly priced. We also examine the distributional effects of information provision across travelers with different VOTs. Travelers with low VOTs who do not use information are not affected by the price of information. Travelers with intermediate VOTs always benefit from information provision regardless of its price. Finally, travelers with high VOTs are better off when the information price exceeds a threshold.",0968-090X,Not found
A flow-based integer programming approach to design an interurban shared automated vehicle system and assess its financial viability,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103092,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Shared automated vehicles (SAV) are expected to become part of on-demand transport systems in the future. In an interurban context, SAV systems may potentially contribute to significantly improve the availability and quality of public transport. In this paper, we propose a flow-based integer programming approach to design and assess the financial viability of a SAV interurban system. An integer programming model, based on profit maximization and allowing vehicle pooling, was developed to optimize the fleet size and vehicle movements of a typical working day. This model and its optimal results were the basis for assessing the financial viability of an interurban transport network in the central area of Portugal. Different levels of demand were tested and three different fleet compositions were considered: cars, minibuses, and a mixed fleet of both. The results showed that a mixed fleet of vehicles is the best option for profit maximization. The optimal share of each vehicle type, in this fleet composition, asymptotically converges to approximately 1/3 of cars and 2/3 of minibuses, as demand increases. The introduction of a SAV system in such a region for interurban trips can replace up to 18 private vehicles per SAV vehicle, and should be done with sequential expansions to guarantee a profit at the different stages. The break-even point, for the conditions of the case study, is between 1.5 and 2 passengers per vehicle, for a fleet of cars, and between 4 and 5 passengers per vehicle, for a fleet of minibuses.",0968-090X,Not found
Injecting knowledge in data-driven vehicle trajectory predictors,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103010,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Vehicle trajectory prediction tasks have been commonly tackled from two distinct perspectives: either with knowledge-driven methods or more recently with data-driven ones. On the one hand, we can explicitly implement domain-knowledge or physical priors such as anticipating that vehicles will follow the middle of the roads. While this perspective leads to feasible outputs, it has limited performance due to the difficulty to hand-craft complex interactions in urban environments. On the other hand, recent works use data-driven approaches which can learn complex interactions from the data leading to superior performance. However, generalization, i.e., having accurate predictions on unseen data, is an issue leading to unrealistic outputs. In this paper, we propose to learn a “Realistic Residual Block” (RRB), which effectively connects these two perspectives. Our RRB takes any off-the-shelf knowledge-driven model and finds the required residuals to add to the knowledge-aware trajectory. Our proposed method outputs realistic predictions by confining the residual range and taking into account its uncertainty. We also constrain our output with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to satisfy kinematic constraints. Using a publicly available dataset, we show that our method outperforms previous works in terms of accuracy and generalization to new scenes.

Towards reducing the number of crashes during hurricane evacuation: Assessing the potential safety impact of adaptive cruise control systems,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103188,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Ensuring safer mobility for evacuee drivers during a hurricane evacuation has always been a major concern for traffic managers. That concern has grown further, particularly after recent hurricanes, which forced millions of people to evacuate, causing significant congestion and a high number of traffic crashes. Though several strategies have been deployed to manage the heavy traffic demand during a hurricane evacuation, current approaches seem to have less impact on traffic safety. In a situation where people are ordered to evacuate to a safer place involving long hours of driving, perception related errors are inevitable. In such conditions, advanced driving assistance system or vehicle automation can have a positive impact. In this study, we assess the safety impact of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems during an evacuation. We develop a microscopic simulation model of evacuation traffic in SUMO and calibrate it using real-world traffic data collected during the evacuation period of hurricane Irma for a segment in the Interstate highway in Florida. To evaluate the safety impact of ACC systems, we adopt two surrogate measures: time to collision (TTC) and deceleration rate to avoid a collision (DRAC). Our simulation experiments show that, during the evacuation, about 49.7% of traffic collisions can be reduced at a 25% market penetration of ACC equipped vehicles. Our result has potential implications for hurricane evacuation management since a modest decrease in the number of crashes can help reduce the massive delays most commonly experienced during a major evacuation.",0968-090X,Not found
An integrated intersection design for promoting bus and car traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103211,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Signal priority and exclusive bus lanes are common measures used to promote bus travel at signalized intersections. However, these bus priority measures create significant damage to the car traffic especially at intersections with heavy bus and car traffic. For this reason, bus priority is not welcome at busy intersections. We examine a novel intersection approach design that can solve the above dilemma. The design integrates a bus lane, bus signal priority, and a midblock pre-signal for sorting different car traffic streams in tandem in the approach. Car capacity gains from the use of pre-signal can potentially recover the car capacity lost to bus lane and signal priority schemes. This paper first presents how the pre-signal and main signal can be timed to realize bus signal priority, and where the pre-signal should be placed. Models are then formulated for estimating the expected bus delay and car capacity under the integrated design. They are compared against three alternative designs, including a conventional intersection design without bus priority or pre-signal. Numerical results unveil that the integrated design produces not only significant bus delay savings, but also higher car capacities in most instances. Even greater car capacity gains are observed with higher bus frequencies. Moreover, the benefits are fairly robust when real-world operating features, such as bus arrival time prediction error, are considered. Thus, the integrated design can potentially promote both bus and car traffic at congested intersections.",0968-090X,Not found
Improving the accuracy and efficiency of online calibration for simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103195,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment models have important applications in real-time traffic management and control. The efficacy of these systems rests on the ability to generate accurate estimates and predictions of traffic states, which necessitates online calibration. A widely used solution approach for online calibration is the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which – although appealing in its flexibility to incorporate any class of parameters and measurements – poses several challenges with regard to calibration accuracy and scalability, especially in congested situations for large-scale networks. This paper addresses these issues in turn so as to improve the accuracy and efficiency of EKF-based online calibration approaches for large and congested networks. First, the concept of state augmentation is revisited to handle violations of the Markovian assumption typically implicit in online applications of the EKF. Second, a method based on graph-coloring is proposed to operationalize the partitioned finite-difference approach that enhances scalability of the gradient computations.

Estimation of walking patterns in a touristic area with Wi-Fi packet sensors,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103219,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"We propose a methodology for using the records from Wi-Fi packet sensors to model route choice and time spent at different locations within a tourist area. In contrast to other route choice problems, in tourist areas it is often the case that “the route is the goal,” so we expect route choice behavior to be less destination oriented. Data were collected from Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto, Japan, which is highly frequented by tourists. We utilized Wi-Fi packet sensors, which avoid the need for mobile applications but provide only spot data. Based on the data, we first discuss the extraction of tourist trip chains and the construction of a simplified time-space network with “stay” and “move” links. The network and link attributes are based on the location of the sensors as well as map data. Recursive Logit (RL) models are then employed to formulate tourists’ route choice behavior. The existence of different kinds of “points of interests” (POIs) is shown to explain route choice as well as the time spent on roads with shops, restaurants and sightseeing spots.",0968-090X,Not found
Toward human-vehicle collaboration: Review and perspectives on human-centered collaborative automated driving,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103199,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The last decade witnessed a great development of automated driving vehicles (ADVs) and vehicle intelligence. The significant increment of machine intelligence poses a new challenge to the community, which is the collaboration between human drivers and vehicle autonomy. As vehicle autonomy is gaining more control authority, the roles that human drivers can play in the future need to be further clarified. In this study, literature review and perspectives on the human behaviors and cognition (HBC) for ADVs toward human-autonomy (H-A) collaboration are proposed. First, the H-A collaboration basics and key factors are reviewed. Then, the HBC issues in driver behavior modeling and understanding are discussed. Specifically, two key factors are reviewed, which are human trust and situation awareness (SA). Next, HBC in two H-A collaboration-enabled vehicle control methods, namely, shared control and take-over control, are analyzed. It is shown that the human-centered collaboration strategy that integrates driver states will largely increase the acceptance of the ADVs. Then, the HBC issues in the design of human-machine-interface (HMI) for future autonomous and collaboration-enabled ADVs are discussed.

A bi-level cooperative operation approach for AGV based automated valet parking,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103140,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"In urban areas, the number of cars has increased significantly in recent years, resulting in frequent traffic congestion in parking lots. Automated valet parking (AVP) system based on automated guided vehicles (AGVs) can relieve human from parking and improve efficiency to a certain extent due to their fully automatic control and operation. However, with the expansion of the scale of the whole parking lot, the current AGV based AVP system is facing the disadvantage of long-time queue congestion and even deadlock. In this paper, we systematically consider the traffic congestion faced by the AGV based AVP system and introduce a bi-level cooperative operation approach. The global cooperative parking space allocation is considered in the upper-level, and the cooperative driving of multiple AGVs in the conflict zone is resolved in the lower-level. The upper-level problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, and a global cooperative allocation method is obtained by using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the lower-level, with the modified planning based cooperative driving method, multiple AGVs can drive efficiently without collision and deadlock in the conflict zone. Experiment results show that the proposed cooperative operation approach can significantly alleviate the congestion problem in the AGV based parking lot and improve the AVP system’s efficiency.",0968-090X,Not found
A linear Lagrangian model predictive controller of macro- and micro- variable speed limits to eliminate freeway jam waves,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103121,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Variable speed limits (VSLs) are a common traffic control measure to resolve freeway jam waves. State-of-the-art model predictive control (MPC) approaches of VSLs are developed based on Eulerian Lighthill-Whitham and Richards (LWR) models, where the decision variables are flows between road segments. It is difficult to implement constraints on speeds that are necessary in typical real-world speed limit systems, because converting flow to speed results in nonlinear and non-convex optimization formulations. In this paper, we develop a new MPC of VSLs based on a discrete Lagrangian LWR model, in which the decision variables are average speeds of vehicle groups. This allows formulating speed constraints as control constraints rather than state constraints in the MPC problem. The optimization of vehicle groups speeds is formulated as a linear programming problem which can be solved efficiently. We further integrate the presented MPC to a hierarchical VSL control framework leveraging connected vehicles. The presented MPC decides the optimal target speed of each vehicle group led by a connected automated vehicle (CAV) at the upper macroscopic level with a prediction horizon of 20 min. At the lower microscopic level, CAVs randomly distributed in mixed traffic are regarded as actuators of the upper layer. Microscopic CAV accelerations are optimized in a short horizon of the order 5–10 s so that the human-driven vehicles following them reach the target speed from the upper layer in an efficient and smooth manner. The presented MPC and the hierarchical control approach are tested in microscopic simulation environments. Simulation results show that (i) the presented MPC resolves freeway jam waves efficiently with reasonable safety constraints implemented, and (ii) the presented hierarchical control approach can effectively resolve jam waves in a single-lane freeway, even though the penetration rate of CAVs is as low as 5%.",0968-090X,Not found
Deep survival modelling for shared mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103213,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"With an increased focus on minimising traffic externalities in metropolitan areas, a growing interest in environmentally friendly mobility systems has emerged, such as electric car-sharing systems. However, increasing demand and larger service areas often make it difficult to keep cars available where and when customers need them. This problem can be alleviated by predicting for how long cars stay vacant at given pick-up/drop-off locations. To maximise their usage, shared fleet operators relocate the cars to more desired locations. In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting time to pick-up for shared cars in a probabilistic way by applying time-to-event modelling through survival analysis. Both statistical and machine learning approaches to survival regression are investigated. In addition, we propose the use of Gaussian copulas in order to model the correlation among vacant vehicles and to obtain more refined event-based predictions. First, an exploratory analysis is done to investigate the effect of various features on car vacancy time, which can provide significant insights into vacancy times and their influencing factors. Second, the Cox proportional hazards model (CPH), a linear survival model, is compared to DeepSurv, a neural-network-based survival model. To predict survival times, a two-step approach is formulated: in the upper level, a classification model is used to classify cars based on vacancy time duration and, in the lower level, time-to-event modelling is applied to each class using independent survival analysis models. Our empirical results using data from Copenhagen demonstrate that the DeepSurv model leads to a stronger fit compared to CPH. Moreover, we were able to verify that the proposed two-step approach can result in an improvement of over 15% in performance compared to a standard one-step approach. Lastly, we demonstrate the benefits of survival models for relocation optimisation.",0968-090X,Not found
A discrete-continuous multi-vehicle anticipation model of driving behaviour in heterogeneous disordered traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103144,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This study proposes a multi-vehicle anticipation-based discrete-continuous choice modelling framework for describing driver behaviour in heterogeneous disordered traffic (HDT) conditions. To incorporate multi-vehicle anticipation, the concept of an influence zone around a vehicle (subject vehicle) is introduced. Vehicles within the influence zone can potentially influence the subject vehicle’s driving behaviour. Further, driving decisions are characterized as combination of discrete and continuous components. The discrete component involves the decision to accelerate, decelerate, or maintain constant speed and the continuous component involves the decision of how much to accelerate or decelerate. A copula-based joint modelling framework that allows dependencies between discrete and continuous components is proposed. Such a joint modelling framework recognizes that the discrete and continuous decisions are made simultaneously, and common unobserved factors influence both decisions. Additionally, truncated distributions are employed for the continuous model components to avoid the prediction of unrealistically high acceleration or deceleration values. The parameters of the proposed model are estimated using a trajectory dataset from Chennai, India. The empirical results underscore (a) the importance of considering multi-vehicle anticipation for describing driving behaviour in HDT conditions, and (b) the efficacy of the joint discrete-continuous system for modelling driving behaviour. Further, not all traffic environment variables found to influence the discrete decisions were found influential on continuous decisions and vice versa. Moreover, the influence of several variables was found to be stronger on the decision to accelerate or decelerate than on the decision of how much to accelerate or decelerate.",0968-090X,Not found
A stochastic behaviour model of a personal mobility under heterogeneous low-carbon traffic flow,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103163,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The study proposes a mathematical framework to explain the stochastic behavioural patterns of personal mobility (PM) devices under low-carbon heterogeneous traffic conditions in shared lanes. We create a set of anticipation factors in a stochastic PM behaviour model to tackle sensitivities to both space headway and relative speed against intra- and inter-modes. The proposed behaviour model involves a deterministic and a stochastic force. In the deterministic force, the anticipation factors are used in an optimal velocity model and a full velocity difference model. In the stochastic force, the Langevin equation is used to capture PMs’ stochastic characteristics against movements of other PMs, pedestrians, and bicycles, and the effect of lateral interactions. We carried out real-world circular experiments of mixed sustainable modes to verify the performance of the proposed models. Five models’ performances are compared under four different traffic conditions, including bike-mixed, pedestrian-mixed, low-speed, and high-speed conditions. We confirmed that newly created anticipation factors play a significant role in all models under all conditions to partially influence the following PM devices’ behaviour from the leading two different sustainable modes. The validation results illustrate the excellence of the proposed method. Consequently, behavioural uncertainty is well captured by the stochastic PM devices following models under all traffic conditions, although it requires more parameters than the deterministic PM behavioural models. The proposed method paves the way for the stochastic CF model’s applicability to describe PM devices’ behavioural dynamics under mixed traffic conditions using anticipation factors. Besides, it lays the foundation stone of PM devices’ dynamics in a shared lane to construct effective regulations and safety standards.",0968-090X,Not found
A hidden Markov model for the estimation of correlated queues in probe vehicle environments,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103128,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Queue length estimation is critical for traffic signal control and performance measures. With the development of connected vehicle technologies and the popularization of ride-hailing services, probe vehicle data are now being collected on a large scale. Some studies have shown that queue lengths can be estimated using only probe vehicle data. The relevant literature usually assumes the queue lengths in different traffic signal cycles are independent and identically distributed or treats the queues independently. However, in the real world, the queue lengths in different cycles might be correlated. For instance, when there exists an overflow queue, the queue length in the following cycle is correlated with the queue length in the previous cycle. In fact, the correlation of different cycles can provide additional information and thus improve the queue length estimation accuracy. In this paper, we model such queueing processes in probe vehicle environments using a hidden Markov model (HMM), where the queue length in each cycle is a hidden state, and the observed pattern of probe vehicles is an observation. Based on the HMM, we propose two novel cycle-by-cycle queue length estimation methods. In the case where the parameters of the HMM are unknown, we also provide an algorithm that can estimate the parameters from historical probe vehicle data. Validation results show that the proposed cycle-by-cycle queue length estimation methods outperform the existing methods, and the parameter learning algorithm can estimate the parameters adequately.",0968-090X,Not found

In addition, the proposed control law is robust: the stop-and-go wave can be dampened and there is no collisions among vehicles even if there is noise on the information each vehicle receives from the higher level traffic control center.

This is of high importance in a new logistics concept, the Physical Internet, which is expected to considerably improve the way logistics are handled in the current supply chain management. To optimise the aforementioned requirements, a rich vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery including numerous attributes is modelled and solved. A mathematical formulation is proposed and implemented in CPLEX to solve the problem. Given the complexity of the problem, solving large instances with exact methods is very time-consuming. Therefore, a multi-threaded meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing is developed. A set of new operators coupled with a restart strategy and memory are developed to help improve the performance. Computational results on a generated data-set showed that the proposed meta-heuristic is superior to the CPLEX solver in terms of solvability and computational time.

Flight time prediction for fuel loading decisions with a deep learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103179,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Under increasing economic and environmental pressure, airlines are constantly seeking new technologies and optimizing flight operations to reduce fuel consumption. However, the current practice on fuel loading, which has a significant impact on aircraft weight and fuel consumption, has yet to be thoroughly addressed by existing studies. Excess fuel is loaded by dispatchers and (or) pilots to handle fuel consumption uncertainties, primarily caused by flight time uncertainties, which cannot be predicted by current Flight Planning Systems (FPS). In this paper, we develop a novel spatial weighted recurrent neural network model to provide better flight time predictions by capturing air traffic information at a national scale based on multiple data sources, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METAR), and airline records. In this model, a spatial weighted layer is designed to extract spatial dependences among network delay states (i.e. average flight delay at each airport and average flight delay of each Origin-Destination (OD) pair for a specific time interval). Then, a new training procedure associated with the spatial weighted layer is introduced to extract OD-specific spatial weights and then integrate into one model for a nationwide air traffic network. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used after the spatial weighted layer to extract the temporal behavior patterns of network delay states. Finally, features from delays, weather, and flight schedules are fed into a fully connected neural network to predict the flight time of a particular flight. The proposed model was evaluated using one year of historical data from an airline’s real operations. Results show that our model can provide a more accurate flight time predictions than baseline methods, especially for flights with extreme delays. We also show that, with the improved flight time prediction, fuel loading can be optimized and resulting reduced fuel consumption by 0.016%–1.915% without increasing the fuel depletion risk.",0968-090X,Not found

These models capture patterns in location and time sequences in trajectory data and their dependencies to predict next locations and travel times simultaneously. Using Bluetooth vehicle trajectory data from Brisbane, Australia, we compare the prediction performance of the proposed models with several existing approaches including hidden Markov model and other LSTM-based models. The results show that the proposed models produce higher prediction accuracy for both location and time prediction tasks, with the sequential LSTM yielding the best performance. Compared to the conventional next location prediction problem, which considers location sequences only without travel time consideration, the study finds that jointly modelling location and travel time sequences actually improves the next location prediction performance itself, potentially because travel time observations capture the information on traffic conditions in the network, which may affect drivers’ location choices.

Understanding vehicles commuting pattern based on license plate recognition data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103142,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Commuting vehicles are one of the most important vehicles on the road network, especially during morning and evening peak hours. Analysis of commuting vehicles can lay foundation for policy formulation, urban planning, business decision-making. A large number of license plate recognition (LPR) detectors installed on the road network have accumulated a large amount of LPR data that contain the spatio-temporal information on vehicles. Therefore, using the LPR data, the commuting behavior of vehicles can be mined and analyzed. This study takes the LPR data of Hangzhou, China as an example, a series of algorithms are used to extract a total of nine features reflecting the commuting travel behavior using the one-month LPR data, and then the factor analysis method is used to integrate the nine extracted features into three factors. The commuting behavior is characterized from three perspectives: the stability of the vehicle travel behavior during the high frequency travel time period on working days, the stability of the vehicle travel behavior during the non high frequency travel time period, the stability of the origin and destination (OD) of a vehicle during the high frequency travel time period. Based on these three factors, three methods, including the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm (DBSCAN), the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (ISODATA), and the fast search and find of density peaks clustering algorithm, are used to identify commuting pattern vehicles and their results are compared. Finally, the decision tree algorithm is used to extract the commuting rule and identify commuting vehicles from the collected data. After that, The influence of different high frequency travel time period on commuting rule extraction and commuting pattern vehicle recognition is carefully analyzed. The influence of randomness on the results is also tested. The proposed commuting pattern vehicle recognition algorithm is proved to be robust. The detection frequency and the first and last detected times of commuting vehicles and non commuting vehicles are then analyzed. 78.0% of commuting vehicles were first detected between 06:30 AM and 10:30 AM on each workday on average. And 77.8% of commuting vehicles were last detected between 03:30 PM and 09:30 PM on each workday on average. However, for non commuting vehicles, the phenomenon that start or end the travel during the high frequency travel time period is not obvious. This study lays a foundation for travel policy formulation. For instance, it can provide a reference for the determination of the restricted periods when implementing the travel restriction policy. In addition, the identification of commuting vehicles is extremely useful for public transit network design and optimization, and it can help the decision-making process of a customized commuter bus. In addition, these strategies are expected to reduce the use of private cars and encourage travelers to switch to public transportation.",0968-090X,Not found
Forming coordination group for coordinated traffic congestion management schemes,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103113,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"It has been well known that properly coordinating travelers’ route choices will help mitigate urban traffic congestion. Accordingly, coordinated routing mechanisms (CRMs), functioned as coordinated network congestion management schemes, have been developed in recent years. They often employ game theory models to strategically coordinate the route decisions of a group of travelers en route with the aim to reduce network traffic congestion. However, existing studies do not provide the solution about how to form the traveler groups, such as who and how many travelers the CRMs should involve. This issue may jeopardize the efficiency and scalability of the CRMs in practical applications. To make up this gap, this study seeks to develop the clustering aided network modeling approaches to form the coordination groups (CGs), which have the proper members and sizes for supporting the merits of the congestion management schemes. Specifically, we define coordination potential as an index to indicate the potential benefit for coordinating travelers’ route decisions on network congestion reduction. Then we develop rigorous approaches to understand the mathematical features and further quantify the coordination potential between two travelers, and among multiple travelers. Built upon that, we form the CGs through a well-designed adaptive centroid-based clustering algorithm (ACCA). It secures a local optimal clustering solution, balancing the intra-cluster and inter-cluster CP, so that we can ensure a small system performance loss as we implement a CRM on each CG. The efficiency of the CG formation approach is evaluated by the CG-CRM scheme, which partitions the travelers into multiple CGs and independently coordinates the travelers’ route choices in each CG by a CRM. The numerical experiments built upon both Sioux Falls and Hardee city networks confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the CG formation approach. Mainly, the CG-CRM outperforms the independent best response routing mechanism in system performance. As compared to the CRM working on a single group involving all travelers, the CG-CRM requires significantly less computation load with a minor compromise on the system performance. This merit becomes more apparent under high penetration and congested traffic condition. Therefore, we claim that the CG formation approach will significantly help the implementation of the coordinated congestion mitigation schemes in practice.",0968-090X,Not found
Deep survival analysis of searching for on-street parking in urban areas,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103173,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Searching for parking is a significant contributor to urban road congestion leading to additional costs for the driver emerging from the increased time spent traveling and fuel consumption. The present work attempts to model the duration for searching for parking space monitored with smartphone sensing using the widespread parametric and semi-parametric survival models, as well as random survival forests and deep learning survival models. The available dataset consists of more than 48,000 driving trips conducted in the Region of Attica, Greece, and is enriched with exogenous variables, such as population density and land use in each trips’ destination area. Findings reveal that the time of day in which the trip was performed, as well as trip duration and length, significantly affect parking searching duration. In addition, the land use of the destination area appears to be a significant factor for predicting parking searching duration.

TrajGAIL: Generating urban vehicle trajectories using generative adversarial imitation learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103091,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Recently, an abundant amount of urban vehicle trajectory data has been collected in road networks. Many studies have used machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in vehicle trajectories to predict location sequences of individual travelers. Unlike the previous studies that used a discriminative modeling approach, this research suggests a generative modeling approach to learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and, thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This research proposes TrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for the urban vehicle trajectory generation. In TrajGAIL, learning location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation learning problem in a partially observable Markov decision process. The model is trained by the generative adversarial framework, which uses the reward function from the adversarial discriminator. The model is tested with both simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model obtained significant performance gains compared to existing models in sequence modeling.",0968-090X,Not found
Mixed traffic flow of human driven vehicles and automated vehicles on dynamic transportation networks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103159,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Improving the system performance of a traffic network by dynamically controlling the routes of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is an appealing profit that CAVs can bring to our society. Considering that there may be a long way to achieve 100% CAV penetration, we discuss in this paper the mixed traffic flow of human driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs on a transportation network. We first propose a double queue (DQ) based mixed traffic flow model to describe the link dynamics as well as the flow transitions at junctions. Based on this mixed flow model, we develop a dynamic bi-level framework to capture the behavior and interaction of HDVs and CAVs. This results in an optimal control problem with equilibrium constraints (OCPEC), where HDVs’ route choice behavior is modeled at the lower level by the instantaneous dynamic user equilibrium (IDUE) principle and the CAVs’ route choice is modelled by the dynamic system optimal (DSO) principle at the upper level. We show how to discretize the OCPEC to a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and discuss its properties and solution techniques. The non-convex and non-smooth properties of the MPEC make it hard to be efficiently solved. To overcome this disadvantage, we develop a decomposition based heuristic model predictive control (HMPC) method by decomposing the original MPEC problem into two separate problems: one IDUE problem for HDVs and one DSO problem for CAVs. The experiment results show that, compared with the scenario that all vehicles are HDVs, the proposed methods can significantly improve the network performance under the mixed traffic flow of HDVs and CAVs.",0968-090X,Not found
Deploying autonomous mobile lockers in a two-echelon parcel operation,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103155,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"In this study, Autonomous Mobile Lockers (AMLs) are introduced into current city logistics networks to reduce traffic congestion and save cost. The proposed system consists of couriers working with AMLs that visit the couriers in the field and transfer parcels between the couriers and the depot. Couriers can continue their tours without having to make repeated returns to the depot. At the same time, the AMLs can enlarge the coverage of each depot and allow a reduction in the number of depots, saving on rent. We propose a mixed integer programming model to solve the AML-Courier 2-Echelon Location Routing Problem in order to determine the tours of AMLs and couriers. We adapt and modify a hybrid Clark and Wright heuristic, the performance of which is examined for larger problem sizes, and introduce an enhanced version to improve the routes constructed. The results show the efficiency of the proposed heuristics for large problem sizes in terms of solution quality and execution time. Finally, the sensitivity of the best found solutions to some important parameters is analysed and a comparison with a single-echelon model made to establish the benefit of AML use.",0968-090X,Not found
Empirical study on car-following characteristics of commercial automated vehicles with different headway settings,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103134,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"A recent study (Li, 2020) analytically predicted tradeoffs between automated vehicle (AV) following characteristics on safety, mobility, and stability using a parsimonious linear car-following model. This work aimed to verify the key theoretical findings in the above study with empirical experiments using commercial AVs, e.g., vehicles with adaptive cruise control (ACC) functions. We collect high-resolution trajectory data of multiple commercial AVs following one another in a platoon with different headway settings. Parsimonious linear AV-following models that capture the first-order parameters on safety, mobility, and stability aspects are estimated with the data. The estimation results of the key parameters validate several theoretical predictions predicted by Li (2020). Specifically, it was found that as the time lag setting increases, the corresponding safety buffer decreases, indicating that AV safety could be improved with less pursuit of AV mobility or, conversely, AV mobility improvement may come at a cost of more stringent safety requirements. Also, as the time lag setting increases, AV string stability increases, indicating that stop-and-go traffic potentially could be dampened by compromising AV mobility. With this, one possible explanation to the observed string instability of commercial AV following control (i.e., ACC function) is that automakers may prefer to ensure a relatively short headway (and thus better user experience on vehicle mobility) at a cost of compromising string stability. It was also found that as the time lag increases, the cycle period of traffic oscillations gets longer, and the oscillation amplification gets smaller, which supports the tradeoff between mobility and stability. On the other hand, field experiments revealed issues beyond the predictivity of a simple linear model. That is, vehicle control sensitivity factors vary across different speed and headway settings, and the model estimation results for key parameters are not consistent over different speed ranges. This opens future research needs for investigating nonlinearity and stochasticity in the AV following modeling.",0968-090X,Not found
Using autonomous vehicles or shared cars? Results of a stated choice experiment,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103117,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"With the development of vehicle automation and sharing economy, a mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles can be expected in the next few decades, which means the conventional vehicles, carsharing, autonomous vehicles (AV) and shared AVs will coexist, affecting the way of travel. AVs, especially combined with shared use, may contribute to reduce or solve some of the present most intractable urban problems such as traffic congestion, crashes and wasted use of urban spaces. Given the emerging trend of new mobility options, understanding the decision of people in owning a private human-driven vehicle or private AV versus using a shared AV or joining car sharing would have important indications for policy makers to reduce car ownership in general. Therefore, this paper is devoted to gain insight into individuals’ propensity for purchasing an autonomous vehicle or using shared (autonomous) cars. Based on the data collected using a stated choice experiment, we estimated a random parameter error component model to identify the possible heterogeneity between individuals in the preference and possible correlations between various mobility alternatives. Results show substantial heterogeneity exists among individuals in their preferences. People in general prefer to keep their current car or buy an AV rather than to use shared cars, and shared AVs are more favorable than the traditional car sharing. Regarding the shared AVs, people are not only concerned about the operational costs and hourly rate, but also vehicle availability and access time. Moreover, younger people are more willing to accept these new mobility options.",0968-090X,Not found
Stated choices and simulated experiences: Differences in the value of travel time and reliability,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103145,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Surveys with stated choice experiments (SCE) are widely used to derive values of time and reliability for transport project appraisal purposes. However, such methods ask respondents to make hypothetical choices, which in turn could create a bias between choices made in the experiment compared to those in an environment where the choices have consequence. In this paper, borrowing principles of experimental economics, we introduce an incentive compatible driving simulator experiment, where participants are required to experience the travel time of their chosen route and actually pay any toll costs associated with the choice of a tolled road. In a first for the literature, we use a within respondent design to compare both the value of travel time savings (VTT) and value of travel time reliability (VOR) across a typical SCE and an environment with simulated consequence. Given the importance of VTT and VOR to transport decision making and the difficulty in estimating VOR using revealed preference data, our results are noteworthy and emphasise that more research on this topic is imperative.

CLACD: A complete LAne-Changing decision modeling framework for the connected and traditional environments,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103162,128,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This study develops a Complete LAne-Changing Decision (CLACD) modeling framework that explains both the mandatory and discretionary lane-changing behaviors, incorporates both the successful and failed lane-changing attempts, and describes lane-changing behaviors in both the traditional and connected environments. The connected environment provides real-time and valuable information about surrounding vehicles and downstream situations (e.g., congestion ahead) that drivers cannot foresee. Such information can be particularly useful for complex driving maneuvers like discretionary lane-changing (DLC), which requires information about surrounding traffic speeds and subsequent gaps available on the adjacent lanes. DLC modeling efforts in the connected environment appear to be nascent, primarily because of: (a) the novelty of the connected environment (and the consequent scarcity of the relevant data), and (b) the lack of a behaviorally sound DLC model even for the traditional environment (that is, without driver-aid messages). Moreover, the existing models omit failed DLC attempts by motorists that are likely to create traffic disruptions and have a significant impact on traffic safety. To overcome these challenges, this study develops a DLC model (i.e., CLACD model) for the traditional environment, which is extended for the connected environment. An integrated approach is employed to model DLC behavior by combining the target lane selection using the utility theory approach and the gap acceptance behavior using a game theory approach. To collect high-quality vehicle trajectory data in the connected environment, the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator was used. The CLACD models (for both the traditional and connected environments) are calibrated using NGSIM and the driving simulator data, and the CLACD models’ performances were rigorously assessed using various performance indicators. Results reveal that the CLACD models can effectively capture the observed DLC decisions with high accuracy. The performance of CLACD models is compared with the performance of two alternative models described in the literature, revealing that the CLACD models outperform the alternatives. A sensitivity analysis suggests a consistent trend of the CLACD models, which agrees with past research. Furthermore, the CLACD model shows a realistic prediction of traffic flow patterns compared with the utility theory model. By incorporating failed DLC attempts into the CLACD models, the performance and realism of CLACD models have been significantly improved.",0968-090X,Not found
Variable speed limits in the link transmission model using an information propagation method,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103184,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Traffic management on (smart) motorways is becoming increasingly important to extract the most out of the limited capacity that is available, especially during peak periods. Accurate modelling of traffic management measures in traffic flow simulation is therefore paramount to make accurate short, and/or long-term predictions, to aid offline and online applications. In this work we propose a novel macroscopic network loading model that supports variable speed limits (VSL). Most existing aggregate network loading models that support VSL impose speed limits instantaneously across the entire road section, ignoring the fact that only vehicles passing the speed limit sign are aware of the new limit (either by a driver seeing the signal, or in case of autonomous/connected vehicles via infrastructure-to vehicle-technology), this leads to a discrepancy between model and reality that one ideally would want to avoid. Another challenge that arises is that current state-of-the-art macroscopic network loading models, such as the link transmission model (LTM), do not track the internal state of the link while constructing their solution. This is especially useful in large-scale (macroscopic) simulations where its increased efficiency is valued highly. Unfortunately, this desirable property makes modelling traffic management measures such as VSL much more challenging. Virtually all existing methods to date rely on tracking the link’s internal state to support VSL. Therefore, very few methods exist that offer proper support for VSL in LTM. At the same time, the methods that do exist have various limitations. In this work we propose a continuous-time LTM model that address these limitations, yields exact solutions, and supports VSL. The proposed solution method is an extension of the event-based LTM of Bliemer and Raadsen (2019) and Raadsen and Bliemer (2019) which can be considered a special case with a single speed limit. Three case studies are provided to demonstrate feasibility and general applicability of the proposed method and solution algorithm.",0968-090X,Not found
Informed scenario-based RRT<sup>∗</sup> for aircraft trajectory planning under ensemble forecasting of thunderstorms,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103232,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Thunderstorms represent a major hazard for flights, as they compromise the safety of both the airframe and the passengers.

During an iterative process, the so-called SB-RRT, the SB-RRT∗ and the Informed SB-RRT∗ find safe trajectories by meeting a user-defined safety threshold. Additionally, the last two techniques converge to solutions of minimum flight length. Through parallelization on graphical processing units the required computational times are reduced substantially to become compatible with near real-time operation. The proposed methods are tested considering a kinematic model of an aircraft flying between two waypoints at constant flight level and airspeed; the test scenario is based on a realistic weather forecast and assumed to be described by an ensemble of equally likely members.

Modeling consumer affinity towards adopting partially and fully automated vehicles – The role of preference heterogeneity at different geographic levels,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103276,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"An adequate understanding of consumer affinity towards automated vehicles (AVs) is necessary to more reliably forecast the potential impacts of AVs on transportation system. The road to fully automated driving systems pass through partially automated driving systems. This study contributes by simultaneously analyzing consumer affinity towards partially (Level 3/4 automation) connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and fully AVs (FAVs) (Level 5 automation), and how it relates to sustainable travel behavior, user valuation of different vehicle attributes, (electric) vehicle ownership, and safety concerns. Unique data for over 3500 households from the 2017 California Vehicle Survey are harnessed. With an on-average positive correlation between consumer affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs (Kendall’s τ b of 0.506), significant contrasts are also observed. Compared to around 64% of the households with positive affinity towards partially CAVs, only 35% were willing to consider buying a FAV in future. Around 30% of the households had negative affinity for FAVs but positive affinity for partially CAVs. A comprehensive simulation-assisted joint bivariate ordered discrete outcome modeling framework is used, considering preference heterogeneity at different geographic/ecological levels, from the region to household level, and further within and across the choices for partially CAVs and FAVs. Participation in carshare, rideshare programs, and more transit trips per member were independently associated with a greater affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs. Ownership of a plug-in electric vehicle was associated with a 19.9% and 9.6% increase in the likelihood of highest affinity levels towards partially CAVs and FAVs, respectively. Some evidence is found that consumers may possibly use shared AVs, but not necessarily in combination with ride sharing. Simultaneous correlations between affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs and most valued vehicle attributes, safety concerns, and sociodemographic factors are quantified. Methodologically, the results underscore the importance of considering preference heterogeneity at different geographic/ecological levels. Captured through random parameters, the associations of several factors with consumer affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs varied in magnitude and direction. In addition, statistically significant interactive effects (opposite and counterbalancing) of the latent unobserved factors underlying several random parameters were observed. The presence of multilayered preference heterogeneity highlights the personalized and complex nature of behavioral phenomenon underlying user acceptance of AVs. By reflecting the users’ preferences towards CAVs and FAVs and characterizing the taste/preference heterogeneity at multiple levels, the findings can be integrated in larger travel forecasting models to more accurately predict the future-use and ownership patterns of CAVs and FAVs by various sociodemographic cohorts.",0968-090X,Not found

Lane-change-aware connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at a signalized intersection with multi-lane roads,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103182,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Trajectory smoothing is an effective concept to control connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic to reduce traffic oscillations and improve overall traffic performance. However, smoother trajectories often lead to greater gaps between vehicles, which may incentivize human driven vehicles (HVs) from adjacent lanes to make cut-in lane changes. Such cut-in lane changes may compromise the expected performance from CAV trajectory smoothing. To figure out the reasons behind the issue, this paper designs a mixed traffic framework at a signalized intersection with multi-lane roads considering detailed trajectory control, car following and lane changing maneuvers all together. Based on the framework, this paper proposes a decentralized lane-change-aware CAV trajectory optimization model including discretionary lane change restraining and mandatory lane change yielding strategies. Riding comfort and traffic mobility are considered as a joint objective. And the complex non-linear lane-change-aware constraints are linearized to convert the proposed problem to a quadratic optimization problem. The linearization allows the investigated problem to be easily fed into a commercial solver. Numerical experiments are conducted to study the performance of the proposed model and to compare it with other models (e.g., a cooperative lane change model and a trajectory optimization model without the lane-change-aware mechanism) in different scenarios. First, results show that the HV lane changes cause reduction of half or more expected benefits of trajectory smoothing along a multi-lane segment adjacent to a signalized intersection. Then, we find that the proposed model outperforms the other models. Especially, the proposed model yields extra benefits in the system joint objective (10–25%), riding comfort (10–25%), travel time (1–8%), fuel consumption (3–15%) and safety (5–25%) compared with the trajectory optimization model without the lane-change-aware mechanism when CAV market penetration rate is not high. Sensitivity analyses on road segment lengths, signal cycle lengths, traffic saturation rates and through-vehicle rates show that the proposed model yields better system performance under most scenarios, e.g., 20% extra benefit at a short road segment length, 30% extra benefit at a long signal cycle length, 25% extra benefit at a high traffic saturation rate, and 25% extra benefit at a high through-vehicle rate.",0968-090X,Not found
Scalable low-rank tensor learning for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103226,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Missing value problem in spatiotemporal traffic data has long been a challenging topic, in particular for large-scale and high-dimensional data with complex missing mechanisms and diverse degrees of missingness. Recent studies based on tensor nuclear norm have demonstrated the superiority of tensor learning in imputation tasks by effectively characterizing the complex correlations/dependencies in spatiotemporal data. However, despite the promising results, these approaches do not scale well to large data tensors. In this paper, we focus on addressing the missing data imputation problem for large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data. To achieve both high accuracy and efficiency, we develop a scalable tensor learning model—Low-Tubal-Rank Smoothing Tensor Completion (LSTC-Tubal)—based on the existing framework of Low-Rank Tensor Completion, which is well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic data that is characterized by multidimensional structure of location × time of day × day. In particular, the proposed LSTC-Tubal model involves a scalable tensor nuclear norm minimization scheme by integrating linear unitary transformation. Therefore, tensor nuclear norm minimization can be solved by singular value thresholding on the transformed matrix of each day while the day-to-day correlation can be effectively preserved by the unitary transform matrix. Before setting up the experiment, we consider some real-world data sets, including two large-scale 5-min traffic speed data sets collected by the California PeMS system with 11160 sensors: 1) PeMS-4W covers the data over 4 weeks (i.e., 288 × 28 time points), and 2) PeMS-8W covers the data over 8 weeks (i.e., 288 × 56 time points). We compare LSTC-Tubal with some state-of-the-art baseline models, and find that LSTC-Tubal can achieve competitively accuracy with a significantly lower computational cost.

Energy-efficient timetabling and rolling stock circulation planning based on automatic train operation levels for metro lines,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103209,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"We investigate the energy-efficient train timetabling and rolling stock circulation planning problem for metro lines based on flexible selections of train operation levels, which involve running levels (various running times and speed profiles) and dwell levels (various dwell times at stations). The travel demand of passengers is involved in the energy-efficient train timetabling problem via service patterns, i.e., different operation headways are used in peak and off-peak hours to satisfy the passenger demand. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation is presented to optimize train timetables and circulation plans of rolling stocks simultaneously with the aim of minimizing the headway deviations relating to service patterns, the headway variations among neighboring train services, the needed depot movements for rolling stocks, and the overall energy consumption. To increase the regularity (i.e., the consistency of operation level selections of train services) of train timetables and to improve the computational efficiency, two extensions of the energy-efficient timetabling formulation are proposed, i.e. the energy-efficient train timetabling models with pre-fixed selections and optimal identical (or consistent) selections of the operation levels. The proposed MINLP formulations are transformed into mixed integer linear programming formulations, which could be effectively solved, e.g., by Cplex and Gurobi solvers. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed models, we perform computational experiments based on the real-world data of the Beijing Yizhuang line. The numerical results illustrate that the energy consumption of the daily train timetable obtained by the proposed energy-efficient train timetabling model with flexible selection of operation levels is reduced by 9.90% when compared with that of the train timetables without operation level selections. Moreover, the energy savings of the energy-efficient train timetables with optimal identical selection and pre-fixed selection of operation levels are 7.67% and 5.75%, respectively. However, the computation time of the energy-efficient train timetabling models with operation level selections is significantly longer than that without operation level selections.",0968-090X,Not found

Specifically, we use a set covering formulation for the master problem and decompose the pricing problem such that each gate is the basis for an independent pricing problem to be solved for assignment patterns with negative reduced costs. We use a combination of an approximation algorithm based on the submodularity of the underlying set and dynamic programming algorithms to solve the independent pricing problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of submodularity property to efficiently solve pricing problems and improve the performance of column generation algorithm. We show that the dynamic programming algorithm is pseudo-polynomial when there are integer inputs.

To deal with this problem, this paper presents an intelligent control method based on the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for the heavy haul train running on the long and steep downhill section. The aim of the optimal train control problem in the paper is to enhance the train operation performance in regard to the operational safety, maintenance costs and running efficiency. In the train control model, the characteristics of the heavy haul train, the speed limits and constraints on the air-refilling time of the train pipe are taken into consideration. Then the train control process on the long and steep downhill section is described as a Markov decision process for the application of the reinforcement learning (RL) technique. Further, the critical elements of RL are designed and an intelligent control method on the basis of the DQN algorithm is developed to address the optimal train control problem in this paper.

Modeling go-around occurrence using principal component logistic regression,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103262,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"A go-around is an aborted approach of an aircraft. We model go-around occurrence using Principal Component Logistic Regression (PCLR). This entails go-around detection, feature engineering, and model estimation. As a case study, we consider John F. Kennedy (JFK) International Airport arrivals, and model go-around occurrence based on information available when the subject flight is five nautical miles from its landing runway threshold. The PCLR model is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for analyzing data that suffer from multi-collinearity. The model provides a representation of the empirical relationship between go-around occurrence and Principal Components (PCs) covariates, which encompass flight approach features, aircraft characteristics, flight lead-trail spacing, surface operation, go-around clustering effect, airport and weather conditions. We use factor loading analysis to reveal the relationship between variables and the PCs they formed. Coefficient estimates of PCs are also transformed back to the scale of the original variables by matrix operations. A counterfactual analysis is employed to assess the importance of different features, and reveals that the stability of an approach, flight lead-trail spacing, departure traffic, and ceiling are the most salient factors affecting go-around occurrence.",0968-090X,Not found
When the automated driving system fails: Dynamics of public responses to automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103271,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Automated vehicles (AVs) will be at the stage of human–machine cooperative driving probably for a long term and their control is shared by two drivers: the human driver and the automated driving system (ADS). ADS failures are a major contributor to the disengagements of AV testing on public roads and influence human–ADS interactions. The impact of ADS failures (malfunctions or limits) was only examined in the driving simulator environment and mainly on self-reported trust in the ADS or AVs. Utilizing simulators to investigate the influence of ADS failures might lack ecological validity. Participants in this environment might find it hard to imagine the risk of ADS failures and the criticality of taking immediate manual control. We conducted a field study with a real Level 3 AV and a large-scale test track. We invited participants (N = 261) to experience the AV and an ADS malfunction as passengers in a naturalistic driving environment, exposing almost half the participants to the malfunction. Witnessing the malfunction caused participants’ reductions in six psychological responses to AVs and ADS (trust, positive affect, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and behavioral intention) and increased negative affect. This finding highlights the importance of mitigating the detrimental influences of ADS malfunctions. Trust repair deserves consideration in maintaining adequate human–machine cooperation in AVs after ADS malfunctions.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimation of urban zonal speed dynamics from user-activity-dependent positioning data and regional paths,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103183,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Over the past few decades, the digitalization of services and infrastructures has led to the emergence of a broad set of new information sources to characterize human mobility. These sources usually offer valuable significant population penetration rates but may also suffer from important temporal sparsity. Data generated by user activity, such as social networks or mobile phone data, especially fit this description. Although this temporal sparsity might prevent estimating individual travel speeds, we state that such low-frequency positioning data enable estimating the average urban traffic speed dynamics when considering an adequate network partitioning. In this sense, this article proposes a new method, based on the division of the urban area of a given city into regions and on the analysis of a limited set of basic characteristics of individual vehicle trips, such as the regional path. Our solution first involves estimating robust travel times from travelers sharing similar trip features and then jointly analyzing these travel times to deduce the underlying regional traffic speeds, using regression analysis. We apply this methodology on a set of trips derived from a large GPS dataset of vehicle tracks covering the city of Lyon. These data are purposely downsampled to reduce the sampling rate and reproduce bias and temporal features that are proper to sparser but larger-scale, mobility data sources dependent on user’s communication activities. Controlling the data downsampling process allows us to evaluate the impacts of the progressive information loss on the speed estimation, while the raw GPS data provide the ground truth speed reference against which to compare our results. Provided that the amount of observed individual trips is sufficient, the analysis returns satisfying speed estimation results, both at low and high downsampling levels. Thus, we successfully demonstrate that it is possible to estimate zonal traffic speeds from degraded trip data without evaluating individual travel speeds.",0968-090X,Not found
Day-to-day dynamic origin–destination flow estimation using connected vehicle trajectories and automatic vehicle identification data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103241,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Dynamic vehicular origin–destination (OD) flow is a fundamental component of traffic network modeling and its estimation has long been studied. Although ideal observing conditions and behavioral assumptions are often indispensable for estimation, day-to-day traffic recurrences and variations are seldom utilized to improve the estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a new method to recover day-to-day dynamic OD flows using both connected vehicle (CV) trajectories and automatic vehicle identification (AVI) observations. The method involves two modules: the first module provides reliable prior OD flows given limited observations, while the second module seeks the optimal estimates based on the prior OD flows. In the first module, linear projection is extended to consider temporal and spatial variation of the CV penetration rate, and non-negative Tucker decomposition (NTD) is adopted to address the data sparsity issue caused by the low CV penetration rate. In the second module, a self-supervised learning model called the latency-constrained autoencoder (LCAE) is established to search for the optimal OD flows according to the priors with given robust latent features. To avoid local minima and ensure consistency between estimates, a novel algorithm called adaptive sub-sample correction (ASC) is proposed and integrated into the optimization process of LCAE, which can iteratively correct the most inconsistent samples based on the day-to-day traffic flow characteristics. The proposed method is examined on an empirical urban arterial network, a calibrated simulation network, and a synthetic large-scale grid network. Our results indicated that the proposed method requires very few AVI detectors and CV trajectories to achieve competitive estimation performance against two benchmark models. Furthermore, general robustness to several factors with respect to observing conditions and data quality was investigated, and satisfactory scalability was also demonstrated in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational cost.",0968-090X,Not found

A novel Radar-Nearest-Neighbor (Radar-NN) method is developed to determine the nearest neighbors of a pedestrian by treating him/her as a radar and detecting the surrounding environment within a limited circular receptive field. Bidirectional flow scenarios are adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and the lane formation phenomenon can be successfully reproduced. The simulation results coincide with that of experiments and are superior to the work of Ma et al. in pedestrian trajectories, distributions, as well as fundamental diagrams.

Optimizing matching time intervals for ride-hailing services using reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103239,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Matching trip requests and available drivers efficiently is considered a central operational problem for ride-hailing services. A widely adopted matching strategy is to accumulate a batch of potential passenger-driver matches and solve bipartite matching problems repeatedly. The efficiency of matching can be improved substantially if the matching is delayed by adaptively adjusting the matching time interval. The optimal delayed matching is subject to the trade-off between the delay penalty and the reduced wait cost and is dependent on the system’s supply and demand states. Searching for the optimal delayed matching policy is challenging, as the current policy is compounded with past actions. To this end, we tailor a family of reinforcement learning-based methods to overcome the curse of dimensionality and sparse reward issues. In addition, this work provides a solution to spatial partitioning balance between the state representation error and the optimality gap of asynchronous matching. Lastly, we examine the proposed methods with real-world taxi trajectory data and garner managerial insights into the general delayed matching policies. The focus of this work is single-ride service due to limited access to shared ride data, while the general framework can be extended to the setting with a ride-pooling component.",0968-090X,Not found
Real-time spatiotemporal prediction and imputation of traffic status based on LSTM and Graph Laplacian regularized matrix factorization,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103228,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Accurate prediction of traffic status in real time is critical for advanced traffic management and travel navigation guidance. There are many attempts to predict short-term traffic flows using various deep learning algorithms. Most existing prediction models are only tested on spatiotemporal data assuming no missing data entries. However, this ideal situation rarely exists in real world due to sensor or network transmission failure. Missing data is a nonnegligible problem. Previous studies either remove time series with missing entries or impute missing data before building prediction models. The former may cause insufficient data for model training, while the latter adds extra computational burden and the imputation accuracy has direct impacts on the prediction performance. In this study, we propose an online framework that can make spatiotemporal predictions based on raw incomplete data and impute possible missing values at the same time. We design a novel spatial and temporal regularized matrix factorization model, namely LSTM-GL-ReMF, as the key component of the framework. The Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model is chosen as the temporal regularizer to capture temporal dependency in time series data and the Graph Laplacian (GL) serves as the spatial regularizer to utilize spatial correlations among network sensors to enhance prediction and imputation performance. The proposed framework integrating with the LSTM-GL-ReMF model are tested and compared with other state-of-the-art matrix factorization models and deep learning models on three uni-variate and multi-variate spatiotemporal traffic datasets.

We further apply it to predict the development of COVID-19 in China in two scenarios, i.e., i) assuming that different types of traffic restriction policies are conducted and ii) assuming that the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak is in Beijing, so as to illustrate the potential usage of the model in generating various policy insights to help the containment of the further spread of COVID-19. We find that the most effective way to prevent the coronavirus from spreading quickly and extensively is to control the routes linked to the epicenter at the beginning of the pandemic. But if the virus has been widely spread, setting restrictions on hub cities would be much more efficient than imposing the same travel ban across the whole country.

Robust electric transit route network design problem (RE-TRNDP) with delay considerations: Model and application,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103255,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Electric bus networks are steadily gaining ground as the prominent option for urban public transport. However, in contrast to conventional transit systems operated by diesel buses, electric bus networks are particularly vulnerable with respect to energy supply, both in terms of power level availability and the unobstructed access to charging points. Indeed, power fluctuations can prevent buses from adequately recharging at designated points, affecting extended areas of operation. Similarly, queue formation at terminal stops can lead to poor schedule adherence and excessive delays. In this context, this study addresses research gaps by presenting a realistic and flexible design framework for fully electric public transport networks, tackling both the route network and the charging infrastructure design. To handle the uncertainty associated with power supply, Robust Optimization (RO) is employed for solving the charging infrastructure location problem while maintaining computational tractability. Queuing delays due to charging are also modeled and minimized. To address the integrated design of route networks and wireless chargers, RO is coupled with Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization within a bi-level methodological framework. Different scenarios for power supply variability are considered. Results show that depending on policy priority, the cost of robustness significantly changes.",0968-090X,Not found
Compartmental model and fleet-size management for shared mobility systems with for-hire vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103236,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"There have been conflicting results in the literature regarding the congestion impacts of shared mobility systems with for-hire vehicles (FHVs). To the best of our knowledge, there is no physically meaningful and mathematically tractable model to explain these conflicting results or devise efficient management schemes for such mobility systems. In this paper, we attempt to fill the gap by presenting a compartmental model for passenger trip and vehicle dynamics in shared mobility systems with FHVs and discussing the impacts of different fleet-size management schemes. To develop the compartmental model, we first divide passenger trips into four compartments: planned, waiting, traveling, and completed. We describe the dynamics of the waiting trips by the point queue model, and those of the traveling trips by an extended bathtub model. As the traditional bathtub model for vehicular trips, the extended bathtub model is derived in a relative space with respect to individual trips’ distances to their destinations. However, different from the traditional bathtub model, vehicular dynamics and trip dynamics in the extended bathtub model are not overlapping, as the dynamics of FHVs are controlled by the fleet-size management scheme; but they are related, as traveling trips travel with occupied FHVs, and empty FHVs supply seats to waiting trips. Within this modeling framework, the matching process between waiting passengers and FHVs is modeled at the aggregate level, such that the passenger trip flow from the waiting compartment to the traveling compartment equals the minimum of the waiting trips’ demand of seats and the supply of seats determined by the completion rate of traveling trips and the fleet-size management scheme. In addition to the pooling ratio, the deadhead miles, the detour miles caused by pooling services, and other extra miles associated with the matching process are captured by another exogenous parameter, namely, the extra mileage ratio. With these assumptions and simplifications, the resulting compartmental model is a deterministic, coupled queueing model, which can be written as a system of differential equations. We also present the sufficient and necessary condition on the fleet-size management scheme for the model to be well-defined. With the parsimonious, closed-form compartmental model, we demonstrate theoretically that limiting the wait time leads to a fleet-size management scheme equivalent to that of the privately operated vehicles (POVs), i.e., the POV scheme. In such a system, the completion rate depends on the extra trip mileage ratio, as well as the pooling ratio. With 100% autonomous FHVs, the optimal fleet size that minimizes the total costs occurs at the maximum flow-rate and the free-flow speed. With mixed POVs and FHVs, we extend the compartmental model and numerically solve for the optimal fleet sizes under different market penetration rates. This study reconciles the conflicting results in the literature. We find that, with a low pooling ratio, the overall system’s performance can be deteriorated or improved, depending on the fleet-size management scheme: with the POV scheme, the system could become more congested; but with an appropriate fleet-size cap, the system’s performance can be substantially improved. A major policy implication of this study is that implementing a cap for the FHV fleet size is a viable measure to mitigate the congestion effects of extra deadhead and detour miles caused by FHVs.",0968-090X,Not found
Hierarchical integrated machine learning model for predicting flight departure delays and duration in series,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103225,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Flight delays may propagate through the entire aviation network and are becoming an important research topic. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical integrated machine learning model for predicting flight departure delays and duration in series rather than in parallel to avoid ambiguity in decision making. The paper analyses the proposed model using various machine learning algorithms in combination with different sampling techniques. The highly noisy, unbalanced, dispersed, and skewed historical high dimensional data provided by an international airline operating in Hong Kong was used to demonstrate the practical application of the model.

Lane-level routable digital map reconstruction for motorway networks using low-precision GPS data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103234,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The construction of routable digital maps based on trajectory data has attracted a lot of attention, especially in recent years, with the ease and cheapness of collecting the required data. Such maps, if they are constructed at lane-level, have many applications in traffic analysis, especially the study of driving behavior based on floating car data. In this paper, we present a three-step automatic method based on QuickBundles for the node detection in the road network, a dissimilarity matrix based on Fréchet distance for road centerline construction, and the Gaussian Mixture Method for lane estimation. The results are a smooth, segment-based centerline unbiased by GPS density distribution over lanes with accurate road width as well as compatible and highly accurate estimation of lanes. The accuracy, connectivity, compatibility, validity, and robustness of the proposed method have been tested in various ways. The results of this paper show that this method, while being low cost, can construct accurate lane-level routable digital maps that can be used as a platform for extracting longitudinal and lateral driving behavior, especially drivers' lane-changing maneuvers. Due to the unique features of the proposed method, the width of the lanes remains constant along the entire length of the road segments. In addition, the validation of the method based on traffic metrics shows that the constructed maps can be used to obtain reliable estimates of the speed and volume of traffic flow in different lanes.

Period-to-period toll adjustment schemes for mixed traffic with time-varying electric vehicle penetration,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103237,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"As electric vehicle (EV) penetration increases, the mixed traffic of EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) will be prevalent in roadway systems for a long time. Meanwhile, EV incentive policies, adjusted adaptively as a response to EV market growth, will perturb the mixed traffic pattern periodically. Such periodic perturbation will cause mixed traffic to evolve from disequilibrium to a new equilibrium. This equilibration is theoretically indeterminate due to the non-uniqueness of mixed traffic equilibria and the dynamic interaction between operational policy and underlying mixed traffic. The non-unique mixed-traffic equilibrium in the previous period influences the traffic stationary state and traffic evolution trajectory in the next period, which is also non-unique. Thereby, the indeterminacy in the equilibration process affects the long-term mixed traffic performance that should be factored into the period-to-period adjustment of EV incentive policies. This effect calls for the study of mixed traffic equilibration as a theoretical foundation for long-term policymaking, which has not received significant attention. This paper explores the properties of mixed traffic equilibria and proposes a mixed traffic evolution model considering time-varying EV penetration. The mixed traffic evolution model is then integrated into a control framework to support the period-to-period adjustment of EV-promoting tolling policy.

To extend the energy-efficient timetabling from one single line to multiple interlinked lines, we propose a bi-level model incorporating the operator’s decision on a regular timetable and passengers’ path choice in a URT network. The objective of energy consumption and timetable constraints of the upper level are linearized and formulated as mixed-integer linear programming. The lower level captures the user equilibrium based path choice behavior responding to the timetable. We develop a heuristic algorithm for the bi-level model that produces near-optimal timetable solutions in a relaxation process.

Ridesharing user equilibrium with nodal matching cost and its implications for congestion tolling and platform pricing,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103233,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Ridesharing (RS) has been modeled as a specific multimodal equilibrium where solo and RS vehicles have different travel cost structures. An extended network structure that incorporates three types of traffic flows (i.e., solo drivers, RS drivers, and RS riders) has been useful in RS related network design problems and policy making. However, the extended network structure did not model the matching cost between drivers and riders at each node explicitly, leading to unreasonable or undesirable phenomena. For instance, RS drivers may drop off passengers at one node, proceed to the next link, and then pick up passengers again. This frequent pick-up and drop-off phenomenon needs to be fixed before any efficient policies can be proposed. This paper aims to develop a two-layer extended network that allows to model nodal cost whenever a pickup or a drop-off happens. Search friction of drivers and waiting time of riders will be formulated as well. Accordingly, bi-level network design problems are formulated for congestion tolling and platform pricing. For congestion tolling, we apply a differential toll scheme and analyze its impact on optimal tolls. For platform pricing, we propose two objectives: maximization of social welfare and maximization of the platform revenue, and compare their impact on system performances.

The system provides crowding predictions on trains and platforms, communicates this information to passengers, and takes into account their response to it. It is demonstrated through a case study that providing predictive information to passengers can potentially reduce denied boarding and lead to better utilization of train capacity.",0968-090X,Not found
TLQP: Early-stage transportation lock-down and quarantine problem,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103218,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The advent of COVID-19 is a sensible reminder of the vulnerability of our society to pandemics. We need to be better prepared for finding ways to stem such outbreaks. Except from social distancing and wearing face masks, restricting the movement of people is one important measure necessary to control the spread. Such decisions on the lock-down/reduction of movement should be made in an informed way and, accordingly, modeled as an optimization problem. We propose the Early-stage Transportation Lock-down and Quarantine Problem (TLQP), which can help to decide which parts of the transportation infrastructure of a country should be restricted in early stages. On top of the network-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, we establish a decision recommendation framework, which considers the lock-down of cross-border traffic, internal traffic, and movement inside individual populations. The combinatorial optimization problem aims to find the best set of actions which minimize the social cost of a lock-down. Given the inherent intractability of this problem, we develop a highly-efficient heuristic based on the Effective Distance (ED) path and the Cost-Effective Lazy Forward (CELF) algorithm. We perform and report experiments on the global spread of COVID-19 and show how individual countries may protect their population by taking appropriate measures against the threatening pandemic. We believe that our study contributes to the orchestration of measures for dealing with current and future epidemic outbreaks.",0968-090X,Not found
On the deployment of V2X roadside units for traffic prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103238,129,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In this paper, we evaluate the ability of connected roadside infrastructure to provide traffic predictions on highways based on the motion of connected vehicles. In particular, we establish metrics to quantify the amount of traffic prediction that is available from roadside units via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. We utilize analytical and numerical tools to evaluate these metrics as a function of (i) the location of the roadside units along the road, (ii) the communication range of the roadside units, and (iii) the penetration rate of connected vehicles on the road. We show that considerable amount of traffic predictions can be achieved even with sparsely distributed roadside units as distant as two thousand meters and with connected vehicle penetration rate as low as 2%. Based on the proposed metrics, we develop strategies for deploying roadside units along highways so that traffic prediction efficiency is maximized. Ultimately, the results of this paper may serve as a guideline for evaluation and deployment of connected roadside infrastructure.",0968-090X,Not found
Design of an arterial signal progression plan for multi-path flows with only intersection turning counts,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103322,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Most congested urban arterials, connecting multiple major intersections with heavy turning flows, are likely to comprise multiple high-volume path flows in addition to its through traffic. Hence, such arterials, if designed with state-of-the-art models for progressing mainly through traffic flows, cannot achieve the expected level of performance, because those heavy path flows involving turning movements will inevitably suffer from overflows at their turning bays and consequently trigger a mutual blockage between the turning and through traffic flows. Although some recent advances on multi-path signal progression (Yang et al., 2015; Arsava et al., 2016) offer a viable design alternative for arterials accommodating such traffic patterns, their required data such as the arterial’s O-Ds or path volume information cannot be collected with state-of-the-practice traffic sensors, or mathematically estimated at the accuracy level sufficient for design of control strategies. As such, this study proposes a model with the optimized phase sequence and offsets to produce a progression band for each candidate path along the target arterial with only each intersection's volume counts, based on the set of “local bands” for all local paths constituted by each link’s upstream flow-in and downstream flow-out movements. Such identified local progression bands are then optimally connected between two neighboring links to form the progression band for traffic flows on each path to progress over multiple arterial links under the objective of maximizing the total weighted progression bands. To ensure the effectiveness of the produced progression bands, the proposed model has accounted for all factors and geometric constraints that may cause their mutual impedance in design of the offsets and phase sequences. The results of extensive numerical experiments with respect to delay and the number of stops per vehicle (reduced by 5.8% and 9.9%, respectively, compared to the benchmark model) within the entire network have shown the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0968-090X,Not found
Graph to sequence learning with attention mechanism for network-wide multi-step-ahead flight delay prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103323,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The primary objective of this study is to predict network-wide multi-step-ahead flight delay. A novel graph-to-sequence learning architecture with attention mechanism (AG2S-Net) is developed to predict the multi-step-ahead hourly departure and arrival delay of the entire network. The proposed AG2S-Net consists of a graph convolution neural network, a bi-LSTM neural network, and a sequence-to-sequence framework with embedded attention mechanism. Five-year flight data of 75 airports and 242 links are collected from the National Airspace System to illustrate the procedure. First, K-means clustering algorithm is applied to classify the hourly flight delay states of the entire network into four typical delay patterns, which are further used as explanatory variables in prediction model. Then, the network-wide multi-step-ahead flight delay prediction model is built with the proposed AG2S-Net. The result indicates that the model achieves better performance on large-scale airports than small-scale airports. The delay pattern variables and weather variables can greatly improve the prediction performance. In addition, compared with several benchmark methods, the AG2S-Net performs the best for all three airport types in terms of the lowest RMSE and MAE values. Finally, the graph network analysis further reveals that the proposed AG2S-Net can capture the hidden correlations between airports without links and collect information from more airports in the same community to enhance the prediction performance. The results of this study could provide insightful suggestions for aviation authorities and airport regulators to develop effective air traffic control strategies for alleviating flight delays and improving operation efficiency of the entire network.",0968-090X,Not found

Our approach learns the spatiotemporal state-value function using a batch training algorithm with deep value networks. The optimal repositioning action is generated on-demand through value-based policy search, which combines planning and bootstrapping with the value networks. For the large-fleet problems, we develop several algorithmic features that we incorporate into our framework and that we demonstrate to induce coordination among the algorithmically-guided vehicles. We benchmark our algorithm with baselines in a ride-hailing simulation environment to demonstrate its superiority in improving income efficiency measured by income-per-hour. We have also designed and run a real-world experiment program with regular drivers on a major ride-hailing platform.

Online distraction detection for naturalistic driving dataset using kinematic motion models and a multiple model algorithm,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103317,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Detecting distracted driving is important for developing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and improving road safety. Most of the existing research analyzes drivers directly via video analysis techniques or by measuring cognitive load, however these approaches often require additional sensors to be installed in vehicles or equipped to drivers. Given that most distractions may have a direct influence on drivers’ control of vehicles, this paper proposes a new method to utilize available vehicle kinematic data for detecting distracted driving. The proposed method predicts vehicle kinematics by fusing multiple state–space models that capture different driving motion patterns under normal driving. An online monitoring scheme is developed by using Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts, which detects abnormal mean shifts of lateral speeds and prediction errors of lane positions to provide warnings of distracted driving.

Unravelling System Optimums by trajectory data analysis and machine learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103318,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This work investigates network-related trajectory features to unravel trips that contribute most to system under-performance. When such trips are identified, feature analysis also permits determining the best alternatives in terms of routes to bring the system to its optimum. First, we define a combination of network-related trajectory features that helps us unravel the critical trips which contribute the most to the network under-performance, based on the literature review and a factor selection process. Second, based on supervised learning methods, we propose a two-step data-driven methodological framework to reroute a part of the users and make the system close to its optimum. The learning models are trained with trajectory features to identify which users should be selected, and which alternative routes should be assigned, thanks to the data and features obtained from two reference dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) simulations, under User-Equilibrium (UE) and System-Optimum (SO). We only focus on trajectory features that are accessible in real time, such as network features and regular travel time information, so that the methods proposed can be implemented without requiring cumbersome network monitoring and prediction. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the methods proposed through microscopic DTA simulations. The results show that by targeting 20% of the users according to our selection model and moving them onto paths predicted as optimal alternative paths based on our rerouting model, the total travel time (TTT) of the system is reduced by 5.9% in comparison to a UE DTA simulation.

Social welfare maximizing fleet charging scheduling through voting-based negotiation,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103304,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"As an alternative to traditional taxi services, Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft are playing an increasingly important role in the paradigm shifting from car ownership to mobility as a service. We consider an electric vehicle fleet charging scheduling problem in the TNC setting where taxi drivers, as freelancers, have their individual preferences regarding when and where to charge their vehicles. In this setting, obtaining social welfare maximizing schedules is particularly difficult as drivers may behave strategically in competing over shared charging resources to advance their own benefits rather than the system wide social welfare. We propose a negotiation mechanism which allows drivers to collectively evolve an incumbent schedule into a socially beneficial one through an iterative voting process. The proposed mechanism provides a platform which enables multilateral negotiation among a large number of drivers. We prove that, given the design of the proposed mechanism, drivers’ best response strategy is to truthfully vote their best valued candidate schedules according to the acceptance quota prescribed by the scheduler at each voting round. In addition, experiment results show that the mechanism achieves on average 93% efficiency compared with optimal solutions and scales well to larger problem instances.",0968-090X,Not found
Trajectory planning for connected and automated vehicles at isolated signalized intersections under mixed traffic environment,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103309,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Trajectory planning for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has the potential to improve operational efficiency and vehicle fuel economy in traffic systems. Despite abundant studies in this research area, most of them only consider trajectory planning in the longitudinal dimension or assume the fully CAV environment. This study proposes an approach to the decentralized planning of CAV trajectories at an isolated signalized intersection under the mixed traffic environment, which consists of connected and human-driven vehicles (CHVs) and CAVs. A bi-level optimization model is formulated based on discrete time to optimize both the longitudinal and lateral trajectories of a single CAV given signal timings and the trajectory information of surrounding vehicles. The upper-level model optimizes lateral lane-changing strategies. The lower-level model optimizes longitudinal acceleration profiles based on the lane-changing strategies from the upper-level model. Minimization of vehicle delay, fuel consumption, and lane-changing costs are considered in the objective functions. A Lane-Changing Strategy Tree (LCST) and a Parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search (PMCTS) algorithm are designed to solve the bi-level optimization model. CAV trajectories are planned one by one according to their distance to the stop bar. A rolling horizon scheme is applied for the dynamic implementation of the proposed model with time-varying traffic conditions. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed trajectory planning model compared with the benchmark cases without CAV trajectory planning. The average fuel consumption and lane-changing numbers of CAVs can be reduced noticeably, especially with high traffic demand. The delay of CAVs is reduced by ~2 s on average, which is limited due to the fixed signal timing plans. The trajectory planning of CAVs also reduces the delay and the fuel consumption of CHVs and the mixed traffic, especially with high penetration rates of CAVs. The sensitivity analysis shows that the control zone length of 200 m is sufficient to ensure the satisfactory performance of the proposed model.",0968-090X,Not found
Data-driven trajectory prediction with weather uncertainties: A Bayesian deep learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103326,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Trajectory prediction is an essential component of the next generation national air transportation system. Reliable trajectory prediction models need to consider uncertainties coming from multiple sources. Environmental factor is one of the most significant reasons affecting trajectory prediction models and is the focus of this study. This paper propose an advanced Bayesian Deep Learning method for aircraft trajectory prediction considering weather impacts. A brief review of both deterministic and probabilistic trajectory prediction methods is given, with a specific focus on learning-based methods. Next, a deterministic trajectory prediction model with classical deep learning methods is proposed to handle both spatial and temporal information using a nested convolution neural network, recurrent neural network, and fully-connected neural network. Following this, the deterministic neural network model is extended to be a Bayesian deep learning model to consider uncertainties where the posterior distributions of parameters are estimated with variational inference for enhanced efficiency. Both mean prediction and confidence intervals are obtained giving the last on-file flight plans and weather data in the region. The proposed methodology is validated using air traffic and weather data from the Sherlock data warehouse. Data pre-processing procedures for big data analytics are discussed in detail. Demonstration and metrics-based validation are performed during severe convective weather conditions for several air traffic control centers.

Requiem on the positive effects of commercial adaptive cruise control on motorway traffic and recommendations for future automated driving systems,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103305,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promise to significantly improve road traffic. To a certain extent, this situation is similar to the expectations at the end of the last century about the positive effects that the introduction of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems would have had on motorway traffic. The parallelism is interesting because ACC equipped vehicles represent the first level of vehicle automation and are now widely available on the market. In this light, studying ACC impacts can help to anticipate potential problems related to its widespread application and to avoid that AVs and CAVs will lead to the same problems. Only a few test-campaigns had been carried out studying the ACC impacts under real-world driving conditions in quantitative terms. To bridge this gap, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has organized a number of experimental campaigns involving several ACC-equipped vehicles to study different implications of their widespread. In this context, the present paper summarizes the outcomes of a test campaign involving 10 commercially available ACC-equipped vehicles. The test campaign has been executed in two different test-tracks of the ZalaZONE proving ground, in Hungary. The tests have been carried out at low-speeds (30–60 km/h) and have involved platoons of vehicles of different brands and different powertrains, which were tested in a variety of vehicle orders and with different settings of their ACC systems. Test results have been used to derive information about the properties of the different ACC systems, to study their string stability, to study the effect of ACC systems on traffic flow, and to draw inference about the possible implications on energy consumption and traffic safety. Results confirm the previous findings in terms of string instability of the ACC and highlight that in the present form, ACC systems will possibly lead to higher energy consumption and introduce new safety risks when their penetration in the fleet increases. However, they also highlight that the materialization of the above findings for AVs depends on the operational logic that manufacturers will adopt during the implementation phase. Therefore, results suggest that functional requirements to guarantee string stability and in general to not disrupt the normal flow of traffic should be introduced both for ACC and for any automated system that will be placed on the market in the future.",0968-090X,Not found
"Predicting time-varying, speed-varying dilemma zones using machine learning and continuous vehicle tracking",10.1016/j.trc.2021.103310,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This paper proposes an innovative framework of predicting driver behavior under varying dilemma zone conditions using artificial intelligence-based machine learning. The framework utilizes multiple machine learning techniques to process vehicle attribute data (e.g., speed, location, and time-of-arrival) collected at the onset of the yellow indication, and eventually predicts drivers’ stop-or-go decision based on the data. A linear SVM was used to extract through vehicles from all approaching vehicles detected from radar sensors. A hierarchical clustering method was utilized to classify different traffic patterns by time-of-day. Finally, driver behavior prediction models were developed using three machine learning techniques (i.e., linear SVM, polynomial SVM, and ANN) widely adopted for binary classification problems. Model validation results showed that all the prediction models perform well with high prediction accuracies. The ANN model, which showed the best performance among the three, was selected to represent dilemma zone boundaries. Results show that the dilemma zone start- and end-points would both locate further from the stop bar with higher approaching speeds. Furthermore, the dilemma zone end-point would be more sensitive to the approaching speed than the start-point is. As a result, the dilemma zone length would become longer with higher approaching speeds. Results also showed that the dilemma zone length and location would vary by time-of-day regardless of the speed of approaching vehicles. The analysis showed that the dilemma zone length would be longer and its location would be much further from the stop bar for vehicles arriving during rush hours, as compared to those arriving during non-rush or nighttime hours. This indicates that drivers’ decision location to stop or go (when they are faced with a dilemma zone situation) is distributed farther from the intersection stop bar during rush hours. The proposed method shows an effective way of predicting driver behavior on signalized intersections. It is expected for the transportation agencies to use the method to improve intersection signal operations more effectively and safely.",0968-090X,Not found

The demand for safe and efficient mobility of people and goods is growing rapidly, in line with the growth in population in US urban centers. In response, new technologies to meet these urban mobility demands are also rapidly maturing in preparation for future full-scale deployment. As surface congestion increases and the technology surrounding unmanned aerial systems (UAS) matures, more people are looking to the urban airspace and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) as a piece of the puzzle to promote mobility in cities. However, the lack of coordination between UAS stakeholders, federal UAS safety regulations, and researchers developing UAS algorithms continues to be a critical barrier to widespread UAS adoption. FADS takes into account federal UAS safety requirements, UAM challenge scenarios, contingency events, as well as stakeholder-specific operational requirements. FADS formalizes these requirements, through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) representations, and a trajectory planning optimization for multi-rotor UAS fleets guarantees robust and continuous-time satisfaction of the requirements and mission objectives. The intuitive FADS user interface makes it easy to plan missions in a variety of environments; we demonstrate this through several rural and urban environment-based case studies.

Although a few studies have investigated the opinion of people who have physically experienced AVs, the understanding regarding how the experienced users can integrate AV-based services into real life is limited. To address this gap, the present study examines the travel characteristics of autonomous taxi trips and the determinants of continuous use intention. The data used in this study were collected in Guangzhou, China where paid autonomous taxi service have been publicly accessible and operated for one year. The analysis of the autonomous taxi trips revealed that this novel mobility choice has been accepted and extensively used by experienced users. In addition, five market segments were identified according to the supplement and alternative travel mode to autonomous taxi trips. Results indicate a possible mode shift from public transport to autonomous taxis. The role of a safety steward on board was also identified. Findings suggest that takeover action influences the acceptable time for fully autonomous driving and the preference for autonomous taxis. Certain factors—service satisfaction, psychological ownership, and concern for the equality of safety—for autonomous taxi use are considered in this study. On this basis, an extended technology acceptance model is proposed to explain the continuous use intention of autonomous taxis. The maintenance of a positive attitude toward use, which underlines the simplicity and usefulness of autonomous taxis and the improvement of service quality, is essential for experienced users. Furthermore, the approaches that establish psychological ownership and alleviate the concern for the equality of safety can also enhance the continuous use intention. Interestingly, the effect of concern for the equality of safety on continuous use intention is larger when experienced users do not or seldom encounter takeovers.

Freeway accident detection and classification based on the multi-vehicle trajectory data and deep learning model,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103303,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The freeway accident detection and classification have attracted much attention of researchers in the past decades. With the popularity of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) on mobile phones and onboard equipment, increasing amounts of real-time vehicle trajectory data can be obtained more and more easily, which provides a potential way to use the multi-vehicle trajectory data to detect and classify an accident on freeways. The data has the advantages of low cost, high penetration, high real-time performance, and being robust to the outdoor environment. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method for accident detection and classification based on the multi-vehicle trajectory data. Different from the existing methods using GNSS positioning data, the proposed method not only uses the position information of the related vehicles but also tries to capture the development tendencies of the trajectories of accident vehicles over a period of time. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network model is developed to recognize an accident from the normal driving of vehicles and also identify the type of the accident, and the six types of traffic accidents are considered in this study. To train and test the proposed model, the simulated trajectory data is generated based on PC-Crash, including the normal driving trajectories and the trajectories before, in, and after an accident. The results indicate that the detection accuracy of the proposed method can reach up to 100%, and the classification accuracy can reach up to 95%, which both outperform the existing methods using other data. In addition, to ensure the robustness of the detection accuracy, at least 1 s of duration and 5 Hz of frequency for the trajectory data should be adopted in practice.

Transferable traffic signal control: Reinforcement learning with graph centric state representation,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103321,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an alternative approach for optimizing the traffic signal control system. However, there is a restricted exploration problem encountered when a signal control model is trained with a predefined demand scenario in the traffic simulation. With the restricted exploration, the model learns a policy based only on partial experiences in the search space, which yields a partially-trained policy. Partially-trained policy fails to adapt to some unexperienced (‘unexplored’, ‘never-before-seen’) dataset that have different distributions from the training dataset. Although this issue has critical effects on training a signal control model, it has not been considered in the literature. Therefore, this research aims to obtain a transferable policy to enhance the model’s applicability on unexperienced traffic states. The key idea is to represent the state as graph-structured data, and train it using a graph neural network (GNN). Since this approach enables to learn the relationship between the features resulting from the spatial structure of the intersection, it is able to transfer the already-learned knowledge of the relationship to the unexperienced data. In order to investigate the transferability, an experiment is conducted on five unexperienced test demand scenarios. For the evaluation, the performance of the proposed GNN model is compared with the conventional DQN model that is based on vector-valued state. At first, the models are trained with only a single dataset (training demand scenario). Then, they are tested with different unexperienced dataset (test demand scenarios) without additional trainings. The results show that the proposed GNN model obtains a transferable policy so that it adapts better to the unexperienced traffic states, while the conventional DQN model fails.",0968-090X,Not found

Ramp metering control under stochastic capacity in a connected environment: A dynamic bargaining game theory approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103282,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This paper presents a dynamic predictive and cooperative ramp metering approach that considers stochastic breakdowns at merging bottlenecks. A stochastic microscopic model is used to estimate traffic state parameters based on speed, location, and travel time information from connected vehicles. Traffic state predictions are obtained on a lane by lane basis using an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) that fuses fixed detector measurements with the model; the AKF then produces multiple step ahead predictions. The ramp metering problem in this paper is modeled as a stochastic distributed model predictive control (SDMPC) approach. The SDMPC problem is solved based on a bargaining game approach where each controller, a player in the game, receives traffic state and control decision information from other controllers to solve the local optimization problem based on expected local costs and constraints. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for three aspects of efficiency: short-term and long-term equity and effectiveness compared to multiple control scenarios.

Minimum entropy rate-improved trip-chain method for origin–destination estimation using smart card data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103307,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Smart card (SC) data has become one of the major data sources for transit passengers’ behavior analysis, network modeling, and control optimization. Origin–destination (O–D) estimation has been recognized as a requisite step before utilizing the smart card data to investigate transit passengers’ spatiotemporal dynamics or conduct other SC data-based transit modeling. In the recent decade, the extant literature has proposed various trip-chain-based methods for transit O-D estimation using SC data. However, one problem of the conventional trip-chaining estimation approach has been noticed but not paid enough attention to: O-D estimation of single transactions cannot be conducted since the trip-chain method generally requires at least two trip records per day to proceed with. Such a flaw in the classic trip-chain approach might lead to a considerable amount of data loss and inaccurate O-D estimation. This paper improved the existing trip-chain O-D estimation method by introducing a new framework based on the Minimum Entropy Rate (MER) criterion. The proposed MER-based method adopts a similar mechanism of noise reduction in information theory. The basic idea of our approach is to infer the alighting location of single trips using alternative stops that preserve passengers’ travel regularity exhibiting in their mobility sequences. Our enhanced approach can estimate alighting stops for single trips with decent accuracy, thus preventing a potential massive data loss.

A framework for railway transit network design with first-mile shared autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103223,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Providing a railway transit system (RTS) in less populated areas is a challenging task for transportation agencies due to its high construction and operating costs. With the advent of automation, shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as an integral part of public transit services has the potential to enhance the design of transit systems. In this paper, we present a joint optimization framework of railway transit network design and SAV first-mile service that minimizes the total cost of the combined RTS-SAV services and commuters’ waiting time, while serving a dynamic travel demand in the network. The proposed model optimizes the SAV fleet size and the RTS alignment while enabling vehicle relocations to tackle the vehicle imbalance issue in the SAV service. Due to the non-linear and mixed-integer formulation, we develop a fixed-point algorithm for this joint RTS-SAV problem where we transform the original problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Our results indicate that the joint RTS-SAV services can be constructed and operated at a lower cost than either of the RTS or SAV services alone. Furthermore, the resulting joint RTS-SAV services are underpinned by a shorter railway alignment and larger fleet size rather than a multi-link extension. Additionally, the joint RTS-SAV services is robust to the variation in total demand, with respect to the railway alignment, SAV utilization and commuters’ waiting time.",0968-090X,Not found
Energy and flow effects of optimal automated driving in mixed traffic: Vehicle-in-the-loop experimental results,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103168,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of an anticipative car-following algorithm in reducing energy use of gasoline engine and electric Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), without sacrificing safety and traffic flow. We implement a Vehicle-in-the-Loop (VIL) testing environment in which experimental CAVs driven on a track interact with surrounding virtual traffic in real-time. We explore the energy savings when following city and highway drive cycles, as well as in emergent highway traffic created from microsimulations. Model predictive control handles high level velocity planning and benefits from communicated intentions of a preceding CAV or estimated probable motion of a preceding human driven vehicle. A combination of classical feedback control and data-driven nonlinear feedforward control of pedals achieve acceleration tracking at the low level.

The boundary between random and non-random passenger arrivals: Robust empirical evidence and economic implications,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103267,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"In this paper, we investigate the influence of train headways on passenger platform wait times using automated data from the London Underground metro system. For high frequency services, the literature suggests that passenger arrivals are random and that under perfectly random conditions with all other factors held constant, wait times are equivalent to half of the headway between trains. We test this hypothesis using large-scale smart card and vehicle location data, which enables the extraction of access times from total passenger journey times as well as the precise measurement of train headways. Using a semiparametric regression modelling framework, we generate non-linear estimates of the relationship between access times and headway while conditioning for other service supply and demand factors. Marginal platform wait times are then derived numerically via an exposure–response model framework which accounts for potential confounding between the walking and waiting components of access times, thus enabling quantification of the unbiased impact of headways on wait times. For three lines in central London, we observe that marginal wait times transition from greater than half of the headway to approximately one third of the headway as train frequencies decrease. The transition occurs in the range between 2-3 min headways, lower than earlier estimates in the literature. A series of numerical simulations illustrate the importance of waiting time sensitivity in the optimisation of public transport services. In comparison with the standard wait time assumption, our exercise reveals that the degree of density economies is milder than what the literature suggests, and this may neutralise some of the economic justifications of high public transport subsidies.",0968-090X,Not found
Offline map matching using time-expanded graph for low-frequency data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103265,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Map matching is an essential preprocessing step for most trajectory-based intelligent transport system services. Due to device capability constraints and the lack of a high-performance model, map matching for low-sampling-rate trajectories is of particular interest. Therefore, we developed a time-expanded graph matching (TEG-matching) that has three advantages (1) high speed and accuracy, as it is robust for spatial measurement error and a pause such as at traffic lights; (2) being parameter-free, that is, our algorithm has no predetermined hyperparameters; and (3) only requiring ordered locations for map matching. Given a set of low-frequency GPS data, we construct a time-expanded graph (TEG) whose path from source to sink represents a candidate route. We find the shortest path on TEG to obtain the matching route with a small area between the vehicle trajectory. Additionally, we introduce two general speedup techniques (most map matching methods can apply) bottom-up segmentation and fractional cascading. Numerical experiments with worldwide vehicle trajectories in a public dataset show that TEG-matching outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and speed, and we verify the effectiveness of the two general speedup techniques.",0968-090X,Not found
A link-to-link segment based metamodel for dynamic network loading,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103286,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Dynamic network loading (DNL) is a core part of simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models, which describes how traffic propagates on a transportation network and usually maps a set of route departure rates to a set of route travel times. Due to the incorporation of different intra- and inter-link dynamics such as queuing, spillback, etc., DNL becomes complex, resulting in models with undesirable analytical properties (e.g., discontinuity, non-differentiability, and lack of closed-form) and requiring intensive computational efforts. Moreover, as DNL is applied repeatedly in simulation-based DTA algorithms, it often is the computational bottleneck of large-scale traffic assignment and related optimization problems. In this research, we address these problems by proposing a link-to-link segment-based Kriging metamodel for dynamic network loading. The proposed Kriging model calculates route travel time, link travel time, and link flow. It systematically approximates the traditional DNL model while being faster and maintaining some desirable analytical properties. Both temporal and spatial proximity information and the route segment incidence information are incorporated in the metamodel formulation. The models are trained using maximum likelihood estimation with different dataset sizes. In the experiments, the proposed Kriging metamodels performed better than a state-of-the-art neural network model, achieving an average error of 1.64% and 5.32% in the Nguyen Dupuis (ND) network and the Sioux Falls (SF) network, respectively, along with at least 43 times, sometimes as high as over 1300 times, improvement in computational speed. The results, however, suggest a tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy and the size of the training dataset. With balanced route demand, the model’s performance was reasonable even under congested traffic conditions. The MAPE values were at most 3% and 18% in the ND network and the SF network, respectively, for different level of congestion demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0968-090X,Not found

Learning how to dynamically route autonomous vehicles on shared roads,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103258,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Road congestion induces significant costs across the world, and road network disturbances, such as traffic accidents, can cause highly congested traffic patterns. If a planner had control over the routing of all vehicles in the network, they could easily reverse this effect. In a more realistic scenario, we consider a planner that controls autonomous cars, which are a fraction of all present cars. We study a dynamic routing game, in which the route choices of autonomous cars can be controlled and the human drivers react selfishly and dynamically. As the problem is prohibitively large, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn a policy for controlling the autonomous vehicles. This policy indirectly influences human drivers to route themselves in such a way that minimizes congestion on the network. To gauge the effectiveness of our learned policies, we establish theoretical results characterizing equilibria and empirically compare the learned policy results with best possible equilibria. We prove properties of equilibria on parallel roads and provide a polynomial-time optimization for computing the most efficient equilibrium. Moreover, we show that in the absence of these policies, high demand and network perturbations would result in large congestion, whereas using the policy greatly decreases the travel times by minimizing the congestion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs deep reinforcement learning to reduce congestion by indirectly influencing humans’ routing decisions in mixed-autonomy traffic.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling network equilibrium of competitive ride-sourcing market with heterogeneous transportation network companies,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103277,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The ride-sourcing market (RSM) consists of three parts: ride-sourcing platforms or transportation network companies (TNCs) that set the price for passengers and wage of drivers, passengers requesting on-demand ride services, and drivers offering the services. This paper proposes an origin–destination (OD) competitive network equilibrium model for RSM with heterogeneous TNCs. A finite-dimensional variational inequality is adopted to formulate the RSM competitive network equilibrium model based on the non-cooperative game theory. It assumes that each TNC and individual drivers aim to maximize profits or earnings, while passengers of demand regions seek utility maximization. The monotonicity of equilibrium optima is analytically derived, and the sensitivity analysis of parameters is theoretically conducted and numerically illustrated. The managerial insights are gained both for the government and TNCs. The analytical findings include: (a) market equilibrium price increases and market equilibrium travel quantity decreases in either the transaction cost, driver cost, or TNC cost; (b) market equilibrium price decreases in the number of light-asset TNCs, while the market equilibrium travel quantity increases in it; and (c) raising RSM entry requirements improves the market equilibrium price and reduces travel demand on RSM.

Yield and port performance shipping allocation model for revamp service deployments under a dynamic trading landscape,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103279,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Uncertain trading landscape and subsequent dynamic changes in shipping patterns push ship liners to continuously revamp their service networks in a search for greater utilisation, yield, and profitability.

Impacts of subjective evaluations and inertia from existing travel modes on adoption of autonomous mobility-on-demand,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103281,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"As autonomous vehicle (AV) technology advances, it is important to understand its potential demand and user characteristics. Literature from stated preference surveys find that attitudes and current travel behavior are as or more important than demographics in determining intention to purchase or use AVs. Yet to date no study has looked at how attitudes and use of existing modes both simultaneously affect AV adoption. In this study, we conduct a stated preference survey in Singapore to investigate how the subjective evaluation of existing travel modes (attitudes) and inertia based on previous use of existing modes affect the adoption of an autonomous mobility-on-demand service (AMOD). Using a sample size of 2,003 individuals and 11,613 choice observations, we estimate a mixed logit discrete choice model incorporating latent variables capturing subjective evaluations of existing travel modes (determined through confirmatory factor analysis), a two-part formulation of modal inertia, and other trip-specific and socio-demographic variables. Results show that subjective evaluation and use of existing modes both affect the adoption of AMOD. Specifically, people with a positive evaluation of ridehailing and those who are current ridehailing users are more likely to choose AMOD. Additionally, those who are current car drivers are more likely to choose AMOD, while users of public transit were less likely to choose AMOD. Given that ridehailing is the closest existing mode to our hypothetical AMOD service, our results might suggest that how AVs are implemented and their similarity to existing modes may be critical to the formation of attitudes and direction of inertia impacting adoption.

A multi-hop control scheme for traffic management,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103278,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"We propose a multi-hop control scheme (MHCS) that aims to route traffic through a set of designated intermediate checkpoints (ICs). Because travelers are allowed to freely choose routes for each “hop” that connects real (origin and destination) and ICs, MHCS promises to keep intervention at a more tolerable level, compared to conventional route-based control schemes. The MHCS problem has a natural bi-level structure: the upper level attempts to minimize congestion by adjusting the hopping ratios, which are then used in the lower level problem to route travelers according to user equilibrium conditions. Accordingly, we formulate the problem as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), establish its solution existence, and propose to solve it using a sensitivity analysis based algorithm. We examine sixteen heuristic rules for choosing ICs. Results based on five hundred experiments suggest that selecting the most used and most congested nodes at system optimum as the ICs delivered the largest travel time savings. Based on this finding, a set of efficient ICs are identified and adopted to test the potential of a full-scale scheme. The results from numerical experiments indicate that these checkpoints are highly effective in reducing traffic congestion at a reasonable cost of control and unfairness. In particular, they outperform, by a large margin, other choices such as most congested nodes at user equilibrium.",0968-090X,Not found
Learning ride-sourcing drivers’ customer-searching behavior: A dynamic discrete choice approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103293,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Ride-sourcing drivers spend a significant portion of their service time being idle, during which they can move freely to search for the next customer. Such customer-searching movements, while not being directly controlled by ride-sourcing platforms, impose great impacts on the service efficiency of ride-sourcing systems and thus need to be better understood. To this purpose, we design a dynamic discrete choice framework by modeling drivers’ customer search as absorbing Markov decision processes. The model enables us to differentiate three latent search movements of idle drivers, as they either remain motionless, cruise around without a target area, or reposition toward specific destinations. Our calibration takes advantage of large-scale empirical datasets from Didi Chuxing, including the transaction information of five million passenger requests and the trajectories of 32,000 affiliated drivers. The calibration results uncover the variations of drivers’ attitudes in customer search across time and space. In general, ride-sourcing drivers do respond actively and positively to the repetitive market variations when idle. They are comparatively more mobile at high-demand hotspots while preferring to stay motionless in areas with long time of waiting being expected. Our results also suggest that drivers’ search movements are not confined to local considerations. Instead, idle drivers show a clear tendency of repositioning toward the faraway hotspots, especially during the evening when the demand cools down in the suburb. The discrepancies between full-time and part-time drivers’ search behavior are also examined quantitatively.",0968-090X,Not found

Estimating the route-level passenger demand profile from bus dwell times,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103273,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This paper explores the feasibility of estimating the demand profile of a bus route consisting of boarding flows, alighting flows, passenger loads, and origin–destination (OD) flows using dwell times as the main data source. Dwell times can be obtained from Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data, or door opening and closing records. This data is often more obtainable than the direct demand information based on passenger counts or fare collection information. A flexible Bayesian framework allowing for various dwell time models is employed to infer the passenger demand profile conditional on the observed bus dwell times. We model passenger flows by stop-specific arrival rates and a conditional alighting probability matrix. A modified gravity model is used to further explain the alighting probability matrix and to reduce the number of unknown parameters. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling is implemented to draw the posterior distribution for the parameters of interest. The methodology is validated by three lines of a bus system where alighting times are the main activity time. For these lines dwell time as well as passenger count data are available. The case study shows that accurate estimates of alighting flows and passenger loads can be derived by the proposed framework with dwell times only but that room remains for improving the accuracy of boarding flows and OD flows. Additional boarding counts of a few bus runs, which can be easily integrated into the observation block of the estimation framework, raise the estimation accuracy of boarding and OD flows to an acceptable level. We therefore conclude that the proposed methodology can help “data-poor” bus operators to overcome demand estimation problems for transit planning and operation.",0968-090X,Not found
Book-ahead &amp; supply management for ridesourcing platforms,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103266,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Ridesourcing platforms recently introduced the “schedule a ride” service where passengers may reserve (book-ahead) a ride in advance of their trip. Reservations give platforms precise information that describes the start time and location of anticipated future trips; in turn, platforms can use this information to adjust the availability and spatial distribution of the driver supply. In this article, we propose a framework for modeling/analyzing reservations in time-varying stochastic ridesourcing systems. We consider that the driver supply is distributed over a network of geographic regions and that book-ahead rides have reach time priority over non-reserved rides. First, we propose a state-dependent admission control policy that assigns drivers to passengers; this policy ensures that the reach time service requirement would be attained for book-ahead rides. Second, given the admission control policy and reservations information in each region, we predict the “target” number of drivers that is required (in the future) to probabilistically guarantee the reach time service requirement for stochastic non-reserved rides. Third, we propose a reactive dispatching/rebalancing mechanism that determines the adjustments to the driver supply that are needed to maintain the targets across regions. For a specific reach time quality of service, simulation results using data from Lyft rides in Manhattan exhibit how the number of idle drivers decreases with the fraction of book-ahead rides. We also observe that the non-stationary demand (ride request) rate varies significantly across time; this rapid variation further illustrates that time-dependent models are needed for operational analysis of ridesourcing systems.",0968-090X,Not found
Electric vehicle routing with charging/discharging under time-variant electricity prices,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103285,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with the energy grid has become an important area of research due to the increasing EV penetration in today’s transportation systems. Under appropriate management of EV charging and discharging, the grid can currently satisfy the energy requirements of a considerable number of EVs. Furthermore, EVs can help enhance the reliability and stability of the energy grid through ancillary services such as energy storage. This paper proposes the EV routing problem with time windows under time-variant electricity prices (EVRPTW-TP) which optimizes the routing of an EV fleet that are delivering products to customers, jointly with the scheduling of the charging and discharging of the EVs from/to the grid. The proposed model is a multiperiod vehicle routing problem where EVs can stop at charging stations to either recharge their batteries or inject stored energy to the grid. Given the energy costs that vary based on time-of-use, the charging and discharging schedules of the EVs are optimized to benefit from the capability of storing energy by shifting energy demands from peak hours to off-peak hours when the energy price is lower. The vehicles can recover the energy costs and potentially realize profits by injecting energy back to the grid at high price periods. EVRPTW-TP is formulated as an optimization problem. A Lagrangian relaxation approach and a hybrid variable neighborhood search/tabu search heuristic are proposed to obtain high quality lower bounds and feasible solutions, respectively. Numerical experiments on instances from the literature are provided.

Spatial-temporal pricing for ride-sourcing platform with reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103272,130,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Ever since the emergence of ride-sourcing services, the spatial–temporal pricing problem has been a hot research topic in both the transportation and management fields. The difficulty lies in simultaneously obtaining the optimal multivariable solution for spatial pricing and sequential solution for dynamic pricing, considering the heterogeneity, dynamics, and imbalance of on-demand ride supply/demand. Due to this problem's complexity, most studies have simplified the modeling setting and omitted the complicated matching and waiting process between drivers and passengers. To go beyond the existing models, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning enhanced agent-based modeling and simulation (RL-ABMS) system to reveal the complex mechanism in the ride-sourcing system and tackle the problem of spatial–temporal pricing for a ride-sourcing platform. The reinforcement learning approach proximal policy optimization (PPO) is implemented in the RL-ABMS system, where two feed-forward neural networks are built as critic and actor. The critic judges the goodness of the current state, and the actor generates the optimal pricing strategy.Compared with the fixed pricing strategy, the experimental results on a real-world urban network show that dynamic pricing raises the platform's profit to 1.25 times, and spatial–temporal pricing even raises it to 1.85 times. Besides, the number of idle drivers/vehicles has significantly dropped under the spatial–temporal pricing strategy, which indicates that our proposed strategy has a remarkable effect on coordinating supply and demand in the ride-sourcing market.",0968-090X,Not found

First, to cluster high-dimensional OD matrices, we deploy geographical window-based structural similarity index (GSSI) as proximity measure in the DBSCAN algorithm that captures both OD structure and network related attributes. Second, to address the issue of multi-density data points, we propose clustering on individual subspaces. Third, we develop a simple two-level approach to identify optimum DBSCAN parameters. Finally, as proof-of-concept, the proposed framework is applied on proxy OD matrices from real Bluetooth data (B-OD) from Brisbane City Council region. The OD matrix clusters, typical travel patterns, and typical B-OD matrices are estimated for this study region. The analysis reveals nine typical travel patterns. The methodology was also found to perform better when GSSI was used instead of Euclidian distance as a proximity measure, and two-level DBSCAN instead of K-medoids, Spectral, and Hierarchical methods. The framework is generic and applicable for OD matrices developed from other data sources and any spatiotemporal context. DBSCAN is chosen for this study because it does not require a pre-determined number of clusters, and it identifies outliers as noise.",0968-090X,Not found
Trajectory-based flight scheduling for AirMetro in urban environments by conflict resolution,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103355,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The demand on the public transportation in many cities has been increasing with the diversity of commuters’ activities that require the regular travelling across the urban and suburb areas. However, the public transport systems still suffer from the traffic congestion and detour, which will then reduce the efficiency. Accordingly, extensive efforts have been made for decades to optimize the operations of metro ground traffic with trains, subways, and buses (2D public transportation). On the other hand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in the event-triggered tasks, such as delivery, rescue and surveillance in urban environments, and they have a great potential to relieve the pressure in 2D ground public transportation. Inspired from metro systems, AirMetro is a new concept proposed for future 3D public air transportation service, which carries the passengers commuting from a point to the destination, routinely and periodically. In this paper, the flight scheduling problem for AirMetro is studied based on the flight route of UAVs. The low-altitude airspace in urban environments is divided into several layers by altitude, and AirMetro is conducted in the allocated airspace as the public lanes. First, a pipeline-based route planning algorithm is proposed for the gridded urban environments to further reduce the length of a flight route generated by A* algorithm. The UAV is not required to pass through the centre of a cube in the pipeline-based algorithm when compared with the A* algorithm. This can then potentially result in a shorter flight route. As for resolving the conflict among UAVs, a minimum influence-based approach is developed to delay the flight and reduce the influence of adjustment on the follow-up flights of the UAV. By further introducing a modified simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm, the delay of flight can be further reduced by optimizing the UAV sequence conducting the conflict resolution. Results of the case studies demonstrate that the trajectory-based flight scheduling method can improve the flight efficiency by ensuring the flight safety of UAVs and reducing the average delay of UAVs as well in AirMetro.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic activity chain pattern estimation under mobility demand changes during COVID-19,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103361,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the activity engagement and travel behavior of city residents have been impacted by government restrictions, such as temporary city-wide lockdowns, the closure of public areas and public transport suspension. Based on multiple heterogeneous data sources, which include aggregated mobility change reports and household survey data, this paper proposes a machine learning approach for dynamic activity chain pattern estimation with improved interpretability for examining behavioral pattern adjustments. Based on historical household survey samples, we first establish a computational graph-based discrete choice model to estimate the baseline travel tour parameters before the pandemic. To further capture structural deviations of activity chain patterns from day-by-day time series, we define the activity-oriented deviation parameters within an interpretable utility-based nested logit model framework, which are further estimated through a constrained optimization problem. By incorporating the long short-term memory method as the explainable module to capture the complex periodic and trend information before and after interventions, we predict day-to-day activity chain patterns with more accuracy. The performance of our model is examined based on publicly available datasets such as the 2017 National Household Travel Survey in the United States and the Google Global Mobility Dataset throughout the epidemic period. Our model could shed more light on transportation planning, policy adaptation and management decisions during the pandemic and post-pandemic phases.",0968-090X,Not found
Decentralised cooperative cruising of autonomous ride-sourcing fleets,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103336,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"As transportation network companies and automobile manufacturers continue to invest in the development of self-driving vehicles, it can be expected that autonomous taxi (a-taxi) fleets will become a major component of on-demand transport services in the foreseeable future. The majority of existing automated fleet management systems focus on central dispatch strategies that rely on real-time information and communication. This paper proposes a novel decentralised cooperative cruising method for offline operation of a-taxi fleets, which serves as a contingency plan during a full communication shutdown. The proposed method acts as an emergency plan for the system to continue serving passengers with the objective of maximising the total number of served passengers by the fleet. The method uses historical trip data to estimate PageRank centralities of roads as a proxy of long-term likelihood of finding waiting passengers over a series of trips. The proposed method uses this metric to (i) compute weighted shortest paths for vacant a-taxi cruising route planning, and (ii) partition the network into homogeneous regions for effective cruising destination choice (mission planning). The movements of vacant a-taxis between regions are modelled as a Markov chain such that a transition probability matrix is computed to achieve the optimal spatial distribution of vacant a-taxis to maximise the total expected pick-ups by the fleet, estimated based on bilateral meeting functions. Compared to benchmark strategies which select destinations randomly and cruise along the shortest travel time path, the proposed method shows significant improvements in service performances for different fleet sizes.",0968-090X,Not found
Impact of trust and travel experiences on the value of travel time savings for autonomous driving,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103354,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Autonomous driving is expected to strongly influence the value of travel time savings (VTTS) which is crucial for the assessment of the impact of automated vehicles (AVs). However, no consensus has been reached yet about the size and direction of the effect of AVs on VTTS. This high uncertainty around the VTTS is most likely due to high heterogeneity in preferences for travel time. Our hypothesis is that a key role in the heterogeneity of the VTTS for AVs is played by psychological factors. We focus in particular on Travel Experiences (besides individual preference for activities conducted during travelling) and Trust in travel time preferences for AVs. For this purpose, an online survey with a stated choice experiment and psychometric scales was conducted. Besides currently available transport modes, also a privately-owned AV (PAV) and a shared AV (SAV) were included in the choice sets. The data was analysed using a hybrid choice model. T-test and confidence intervals of the estimated VTTS are computed to assess if the VTTS are statistically significant and statistically different among user groups. Results confirm that both psychological factors have significant positive effect on VTTS for AVs. Gender, age, level of education and experience with similar systems were found to affect the VTTS directly and indirectly through their impact on the individual attitudes. Significant differences are found among some potential user groups, in particular in terms of trust to technology and anticipated travel experiences. For example, men are found to trust the technology more than women and also to have potentially higher technology affinity. However, our results show that they also perceive higher marginal disutility for travel time in both PAV and SAV. A comparison between a mixed logit model and the hybrid choice model reveals that capturing the indirect effect of the socio-economic characteristics of individuals through the effect of these factors on attitudes allows differentiating between the VTTS for different user groups. Lastly, implications for policy and technology deployment strategies are discussed based on the findings.",0968-090X,Not found
Adoption and frequency of use of ride-hailing services in a European city: The case of Madrid,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103359,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"New app-based mobility services are revolutionizing urban transport. Particularly, ride-hailing has experienced a worldwide boom in the last decade since it provides a convenient, on-demand door-to-door service for urban trips. In parallel, an increasing number of studies have been conducted, mainly analyzing individuals’ behavior towards this transport option, mobility patterns, as well as ride-hailing effects on urban sustainability. Nevertheless, the majority of these contributions focus on US cities, while almost no efforts have been devoted to other geographic areas, such as Europe. Cities in this continent present some particular characteristics that make them a case worth investigating, such as a higher presence of public transport modes or a great public concern on environmental issues. The aim of this paper is to explore travel behavior towards ride-hailing services in a European city. Based on the information collected from a survey campaign in the city of Madrid (Spain), we estimate a Generalized Heterogeneous Data Model approach to identify the key factors motivating ride-hailing adoption and frequency of use. The paper identifies a higher adoption of ride-hailing services among young, well-educated, wealthy individuals, who are familiar with new technologies. More interestingly, the research suggests a noticeable role played by environmental consciousness in ride-hailing frequency of use, compared to US cities. Particularly, individuals with lower environmental consciousness are more car-oriented, which is also linked to a more intense use of ride-hailing. By contrast, individuals with a higher environmental consciousness tend to reduce their use of ride-hailing, which reflects their propensity towards public transport in a transit-intensive background.",0968-090X,Not found
How are sentiments on autonomous vehicles influenced?

Although the topic has been discussed extensively by many researchers and experts, it is beneficial to complement current studies by explaining the AV-related sentiment variations leveraging the unique social media features. Different from traditional survey-based studies, this study relies on tweets to understand the sentiments on AVs. A comprehensive model framework is proposed to categorize sentiments, recognize critical dates with sentiment changes, and explain sentiment variations. The results indicate that the general sentiment is positive towards AVs, but social media users have sentiment biases towards different AV terms. Significant sentiment changes are often linked with major social events related to AVs, and the general public is more sensitive to social events than the most active users. A wide range of policy insights are discussed based on the results of the analyses, including policies related to safety, pricing, unemployment, and AV adoption rate. Possible challenges and the corresponding strategies are also discussed.

A mixed-equilibrium model of individual and household activity–travel choices in multimodal transportation networks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103337,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper develops a novel household-oriented activity-based mixed-equilibrium model for estimating individual and household activity–travel choices in multimodal transportation networks with interactions between private car and public transit modes. In the novel model, household members with heterogeneous errors of perception on the time-dependent utility of different activity types make daily joint/solo activity–travel choices in a mixed-equilibrium manner, which maximizes either perceived household utility or perceived individual utility. A logit-based stochastic choice model is developed to capture the mixed equilibrium with heterogeneous errors of perception and used to predict the choices of alternative joint activity–travel paths (JATPs) on a supernetwork platform. Based on this stochastic JATP choice model, the mixed-equilibrium model is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem and solved using a modified diagonalization method. This converts the time-dependent activity–travel scheduling problem into an equivalent static traffic assignment problem on JATPs. The conditions required for the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the equivalent VI problem in terms of a JATP flow pattern are also identified. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model’s merits and its applications for examining the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.",0968-090X,Not found
Predictive classification and understanding of weather impact on airport performance through machine learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103119,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,Efficient airport operations depend on appropriate actions and reactions to current constraints. Local weather events and their impact on airport performance may have network-wide effects. The classification of expected weather impacts enables efficient consideration in airport operations on a tactical level. We classify airport performance with recurrent and convolutional neural networks considering weather data. We are using London–Gatwick Airport to apply our developed approach. The weather data is derived from local meteorological reports and airport performance is derived from both flight plan data and reported delays. We show that the application of machine learning approaches is an appropriate method to quantify the correlation between decreased airport performance and the severity of local weather events. The developed models could achieve prediction accuracy higher than 90% for departure movements. We see our approach as one key element for a deeper understanding of interdependencies between local and network operations in the air transportation system.,0968-090X,Not found
The dynamic bike repositioning problem with battery electric vehicles and multiple charging technologies,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103327,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The bike-repositioning problem (BRP) primarily involves determining the routes and loading instructions for a fleet of vehicles that transport bikes between stations in a bike sharing system (BSS), to mitigate the mismatch between the demand for and supply of public bikes. However, the use of fossil-fueled vehicles for this repositioning task generates pollutants and greenhouse gases, which harm the environment. The use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) instead of fossil-fueled vehicles for repositioning bikes can mitigate this negative environmental impact. On the other hand, user demand for bikes is dynamic during the daytime. Therefore, this study addresses the dynamic BRP with battery electric vehicles. Multiple charging technologies are available at charging stations to allow repositioning vehicles to recharge en-route at different speeds and costs. The objective is to solve the problem by minimizing the weighted sum of the penalty costs of unmet user demand and the charging costs of repositioning vehicles. A rolling horizon framework is adopted to incorporate the revealed inventory levels at bike stations, the BEV load of bikes, and the battery energy levels of BEVs at regular intervals. An artificial bee colony algorithm with an embedded dynamic programming method for computing the loading instructions is proposed to generate solutions. Computational experiments are conducted on a real-world BSS, and three aspects of the problem properties are analyzed: the horizon settings, the various penalties for failed rentals and returns, and the charging-related settings. The results provide practical insights into the use of BEVs for daily bike-repositioning tasks in BSSs.",0968-090X,Not found
Variational embedding of a hidden Markov model to generate human activity sequences,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103347,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Although human trajectory data that are collected passively from location-based services (LBS) are regarded as a substitute for household travel surveys that entail a larger cost, the reality is that the data cannot be utilized directly for transportation planning and policy making without imputing missing qualitative information. Deep learning technologies have been widely used to infer the hidden features of passively collected mobile data. A deep neural network, however, is so deterministic that the probabilistic aspect of activity inference cannot be accommodated. In the present study, a stochastic approach (VAE-HMM) was devised to generate human activity chains by incorporating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hidden Markov model (HMM). Whereas an original HMM clusters data in the observational space, the proposed approach conducts clustering in a latent space with a smaller dimension. The VAE contributes by both reducing the input dimensionality and by sidestepping the overfit to sample data. The variational inference (VI) method was used to estimate the parameters of VAE-HMM within a Bayesian framework. Data drawn from spatio-temporal, demographic, socio-economic, and individual-specific sources were chosen as input variables to feed the model.

A multi-task memory network with knowledge adaptation for multimodal demand forecasting,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103352,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Travel demand forecasting is useful for both trip and service planning, and thus is of great importance. Most existing studies focus on demand forecasting for a single mode, while much less attention has been paid to multimodal demand forecasting. This paper develops a multimodal demand forecasting approach, which can learn and utilize information/knowledge from different public transit modes and thus improve the demand prediction of the travel mode with sparse observations (e.g., station-sparse mode). In particular, this study focuses on improving the passenger demand prediction accuracy of the station-sparse mode(s) with the help of the station-intensive mode (i.e., the mode with more sufficient knowledge and intensive station distribution over space). We propose a novel Knowledge Adaptation with Attentive Multi-task Memory Network (KA2M2) in order to utilize closely-related demand patterns from the station-intensive mode for demand forecasting of the station-sparse mode(s). Specifically, we first design a memory-augmented recurrent network for enhancing the ability to capture the long-and-short term demand information and storing the extracted temporal knowledge of each transit mode. Then, we develop and integrate an attention-based knowledge adaptation module to adapt relevant information from the station-intensive source to the station-sparse source(s). The experimental results on a real-world dataset collected from the Greater Sydney area covering four public transport modes (bus, train, light rail, and ferry) demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a number of baseline methods and state-of-the-art models. Our findings also illustrate that incorporating information/knowledge from multimodal trip records can enhance the demand forecasting accuracy for station-sparse modes.",0968-090X,Not found
Constraint-tree-driven modeling and distributed robust control for multi-vehicle cooperation at unsignalized intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103353,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper proposes a multi-vehicle cooperation method based on the virtual platoon concept for unsignalized intersections. The method consists of two levels, i.e. constraint-tree-driven modeling (CTM) strategy for the supervision level and distributed robust control (DRC) method for the execution level. After projecting the approaching vehicles to a virtual lane, the CTM strategy determines the conflict-free passing sequence and driving mode and forms multiple local virtual platoons (LVP). A constraint tree is then constructed, in which constraints with a unified equality formation are utilized to describe the geometry topology of all vehicles, regardless of leader or member. Then, a class of robust control is proposed to render each vehicle to follow its prescribed constraint. The control is designed based on third-order nonlinear vehicle dynamics. The uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness performance of the entire system and string stability of LVP have been proven by leveraging the Lyapunov stability theory. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method functions well under time-varying traffic volume. Furthermore, the proposed method significantly improves the fuel economy, driving comfort and safety under low traffic volume compared with baseline methods.",0968-090X,Not found

However, the extent to which network-level macroscopic traffic models may be ready for practical implementation remains to be ascertained. This paper aims to shed light on this matter by reviewing the 50-year history of macroscopic modeling of urban networks and assessing remaining gaps and opportunities for further development of both theory and applications. To this end, the existing literature’s chronology is mapped onto three eras of development, and the corresponding theories, assumptions, and limitations are outlined and discussed in two streams, equilibrium relations and traffic dynamics. Among the topics pertaining to equilibrium relations, the highlighted gaps include the lack of empirical studies on the hysteresis and bifurcation phenomena, the existence of multi-modal NMFD (3D-NMFD) in different traffic conditions, the factors that might affect the (3D-) NMFD shape, the accuracy of speed-NMFDs in particular different bus speed NMFDs, and the passenger-oriented NMFDs. Research gaps pertaining to traffic dynamics include the analytical solution of trip-based models, the FIFO violation in the delay-based models, the definition of outflow and entrance functions, the notion of active network length, the trip length distribution, and the path flow distribution. Future research directions targeting topics that might shape the potential next era include the practical implementation of NMFD-based control strategies, the application of NMFD in quality of service assessments, and NMFD in the presence of new technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).",0968-090X,Not found

However, most existing studies on flight delay modeling do not consider en-route congestion explicitly. In this study, we propose a new flight delay model, Multi-layer Air Traffic Network Delay (MATND) model, to capture the impact of en-route congestion on flight delays over an air traffic network. This model is developed by a data-driven approach, taking aircraft tracking data and flight schedules as inputs to characterize a national air traffic network, as well as a system-level model approach, modeling the delay process based on queueing theory. The two approaches combined make the network delay model a close representation of reality and easy-to-implement for what-if scenario analysis. The proposed MATND model includes 1) a data-driven method to learn a network composed of airports, en-route congestion points, and air corridors from aircraft tracking data, 2) a stochastic and dynamic queuing network model to calculate flight delays and track their propagation at both airports and in en-route congestion areas, in which the delays are computed via a space–time decomposition method. Using one month of historical aircraft tracking data over China’s air traffic network, MATND is tested and shows to give an accurate quantification of delays of the national air traffic network. “What-if” scenario analyses are conducted to demonstrate how the proposed model can be used for the evaluation of air traffic network improvement strategies, where the manipulation of reality at such a scale is impossible.

Demand-responsive passenger flow control strategies for metro networks considering service fairness and passengers’ behavioural responses,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103335,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper presents a methodology for developing demand-responsive passenger flow control strategies for oversaturated metro networks. A stated preference-off-revealed preference survey was conducted to capture passengers’ behavioural responses to the passenger flow control strategies, and revealed significant behavioural change intentions in terms of departure times and mode choices. Currently, such behavioural responses are often ignored, leading to deviations in estimating the size of a target group and performance of a proposed strategy. To address this issue, in this study, a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) approach was developed to optimise demand-responsive passenger flow control strategies. The proposed MPEC model highlights the importance of balancing the operational efficiency of a metro system with service fairness perceived by passengers. In particular, a nested logit-based stochastic user equilibrium problem was included to accommodate potential changes in demand patterns driven by candidate passenger flow control strategies. Two empirical cases based on the Guangzhou and Beijing metros were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm. The results show that the inclusion of service fairness considerations does not contradict the pursuit of efficiency. Instead, dual emphases on service fairness and passengers’ behavioural responses help create a win–win situation for both metro operators and passengers. In the Guangzhou and Beijing metros, the highest section load rate decreased from 126.6% to 105.7% and from 122.98% to 106.87%, respectively, under the optimal passenger flow control strategies.

Multi-party ride-matching problem in the ride-hailing market with bundled option services,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103287,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"As demands for convenient and comfortable mobility grow, transportation network companies (TNCs) begin to diversify the ride-hailing services they offer. Modes that are offered now include ride-pooling (RP), non-ride-pooling (NP), and a third “bundled” option, which combines RP and NP. This emerging bundled option allows riders to be served via either RP or NP mode, whichever becomes available first. This paper examines the added complexity that a ride-hailing service platform faces when it introduces a third bundled option. Incorporating the predicted pooling information in the near future, a ride-matching problem is dedicated to matching vehicles with riders under various scenarios over a number of matching iterations. We formulate the multi-period ride-matching problem using an integer linear programming model with multiple objectives and to make dispatching decisions based on certain matching criteria. The complexity of the problem requires resolution via a two-stage Kuhn-Munkres (2-KM) algorithm, whose robustness is verified by computational tests.

Explanatory variables considered are the accumulation and the stopped fraction of vehicles of each mode. Firstly, a multi-modal mean speed MFD is considered by assuming that the mean speed of each mode can be expressed in terms of accumulations of all modes. The quality of multi-modal MFD fits is compared to the uni-modal ones, where the mean speed of a given mode is assumed to be a function of the accumulation of that mode only. Secondly, the classical two-fluid model is extended to multi-modal networks. An analysis on the ergodicity assumption in the context of stopped fraction is also presented. This work also introduces a network-level dynamic model that uses the stopped fraction of vehicles. This so-called extended trip-based model simulates the stop-and-go pattern of the vehicles thereby reproducing the evolution of network congestion.

Joint routing and pricing control in congested mixed autonomy networks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103338,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Routing controllability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) has been shown to reduce the adverse effects of selfish routing on the network efficiency. However, the assumption that CAV owners would readily allow themselves to be controlled externally by a central agency for the good of the system is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and pricing control scheme that aims to incentivize CAVs to seek centrally controlled system-optimal (SO) routing by saving on tolls while user equilibrium (UE) seeking human-driven vehicles (HVs) are subject to a congestion charge. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization program where the upper level optimizes the dynamic toll rates using the network fundamental diagram (NFD) and the lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model (SBDTA) considering different combinations of SO-seeking CAVs. We apply a feedback-based controller to solve for the optimal spatially differentiated distance-based congestion charge from which SO-seeking CAVs are exempt; but UE-seeking HVs are subject to the charge for entering the city center. To capture the distinct microscopic behavior of CAVs in the mixed autonomy traffic, we also implement an adaptive link fundamental diagram (FD) within the SBDTA model. The proposed joint control scheme encourages CAV owners to seek SO routing resulting in less total system travel time. It also discourages UE-seeking HVs from congesting the city center.

Identification and prediction of urban airspace availability for emerging air mobility operations,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103274,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Emerging Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations are expected to introduce novel air traffic networks in metropolitan areas in order to provide on-demand air transportation services and alleviate ground congestion. Yet, metropolitan regions are typically characterized by complex and dense terminal airspace structure that accommodates arrival and departure traffic from large metroplex airports. Therefore, UAM operations are expected to be initially integrated into urban airspace without interfering with conventional operations and compromising current safety and efficiency levels. This paper presents a data-driven approach to identify and predict available urban airspace that is procedurally separated from conventional air traffic towards supporting UAM integration. We use historical aircraft tracking and meteorological data to learn the spatial distribution of air traffic in the terminal airspace and create a probabilistic traffic model to predict active traffic patterns and their spatial confidence regions given current operational conditions. We demonstrate the approach for the city of Sao Paulo and its closest commercial airport, Congonhas (CGH), in Brazil. The results show that leveraging the traffic flow dynamics to allocate the urban airspace dynamically is beneficial to increase UAM accessibility by more than 5% from 3000 ft. Moreover, airspace availability is found to be highly sensitive to the applied separation requirements, emphasizing the importance of leveraging advanced technologies to progressively make such requirements less stringent.",0968-090X,Not found

Inspection technology innovations have enabled us to investigate the conditions of a group of multiple roadway facilities almost simultaneously, using instrumented vehicles that can travel at the same speed as traffic.

Evacuation traffic prediction is critical to plan for effective traffic management strategies. However, due to the complex and dynamic nature of evacuation participation, predicting evacuation traffic demand long ahead of the actual evacuation is a very challenging task. Real-time information from various sources can significantly help us reliably predict evacuation demand. In this study, we use traffic sensor and Twitter data during hurricanes Matthew and Irma to predict traffic demand during evacuation for a longer forecasting horizon (greater than 1 h). We present a machine learning approach using Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM-NN), trained over real-world traffic data during hurricane evacuation (hurricanes Irma and Matthew) using different combinations of input features and forecast horizons. We compare our prediction results against a baseline prediction and existing machine learning models. Results show that the proposed model can predict traffic demand during evacuation well up to 24 h ahead. The proposed LSTM-NN model can significantly benefit future evacuation traffic management.",0968-090X,Not found
Automated flight planning of high-density urban air mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103324,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is an emerging concept for transporting people and cargo in urban, rural, regional, and interregional settings using revolutionary new aircraft. Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a part of AAM, focused on transport passengers in low-altitude urban airspace, has attracted extensive attention among industry, government, academia, and the public. Compared to existing commercial flights, AAM operations are expected to be at higher density; thus, an AAM system needs to be scalable, safe, and autonomous. Third-party service providers are recommended for offering air traffic management and information sharing services given the anticipated high density of UAM operations. To this end, we propose an Automated Flight Planning System (AFPS) that could be employed by such service providers. In the AFPS, a Low-Altitude Airspace Management System (LAMS) is proposed to automatically generate a route network with the capability of avoiding obstacles and obstructions in low-altitude airspace. The main components of this tool are the generation of a 3D map with LiDAR data, construction of a nodal network based on the map by using the visibility graph method, and initiation of 3D shortest paths. Given the requests of flight operations, i.e., origin, destination, departure time, the Low-Altitude Traffic Management System (LTMS) will design pre-departure conflict-free 4D trajectories and provide flexibilities of en-route maneuvering by taking system cost and equity among operators into consideration. In this study, a flight-level assignment strategy is proposed to solve the trajectory deconfliction problem in LTMS. In addition, a Nash Social Welfare Program (NSWP) is introduced to maintain fairness among different operators if the service is provided to multiple operators of UAM. A case study of the Tampa Bay area in Florida is used to demonstrate the operability of the proposed AFPS, and animations are built to visualize the optimized conflict-free operations of UAM in the study area.",0968-090X,Not found
Impacts of long-term service disruptions on passenger travel behaviour: A smart card analysis from the Greater Copenhagen area,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103198,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Disruptions in public transport are a major source of frustration for passengers and result in lower public transport usage. Previous studies on the effect of disruptions on passenger travel behaviour have mainly focused on shorter disruptions, while the few studies on impacts of long-term disruptions have had limited focus on individual passenger behaviour. This paper fills the gap in research by proposing a novel methodology based on smart card data for analysing the impacts of long-term planned disruptions on passenger travel behaviour. We use k-means clustering to group passengers based on their travel behaviour before and after the closure. We can thus observe how different passenger groups changed travel behaviour after the disruption. We compare these observations to a group of reference lines without disruption to account for general trends. Using hierarchical clustering of daily travel patterns, we are able to in-depth analyse the reactions of certain passenger groups to the disruption. We apply the method on a 3-month closure of a rail line in the Greater Copenhagen area. The results suggest that, in particular, passengers with an everyday commuting behaviour have decreased after the disruption. The proposed methodology enables explicit analysis of the impact of disruptions on diverse passengers segments, while the specific results are useful for public transport agencies when planning long-term maintenance projects.",0968-090X,Not found
Connected automated vehicle control in single lane roundabouts,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103308,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper introduces a methodology to optimize the trajectory of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in roundabouts using a two-dimensional point-mass model. We formulate an optimization problem that includes vehicle dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints with explicit representation of vehicle paths. The objective function of the problem minimizes the distance of CAVs to their destinations and their acceleration magnitudes. The methodology also involves a customized solution technique that convexifies the collision-avoidance constraints and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to decompose the convexified problem into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem only includes vehicle dynamics constraints while the second sub-problem projects the solutions of the first sub-problem onto a collision-free region. The first sub-problem is then transformed into a quadratic problem by redefining its decision variables along vehicle paths. The transformation allows solving this sub-problem with several vehicle-level problems in a distributed architecture. Moreover, we show that iterating between the two sub-problems leads to convergence to the optimal solutions of the convexified problem. The methodology is applied to a case study roundabout with different demand levels. The results show that the trajectory optimization reduced the total travel times and average delays respectively by 9.1% to 36.8% and 95.8% to 98.5% compared to a scenario with human-driven vehicles.",0968-090X,Not found
A clustering-based quantitative analysis of the interdependent relationship between spatial and energy anomalies in ADS-B trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103331,131,2021-10-01,2021,10,"As air traffic demand grows, robust, data-driven methods are required to ensure that aviation systems become safer and more efficient. The terminal airspace is identified as the most critical airspace for both individual flight-level and system-level safety and efficiency. As such, developing data-driven anomaly detection methods to analyze terminal airspace operations has been an active area of research. With the expansion of ADS-B technology, open-source flight tracking data has become more readily available to enable larger-scale analyses of aircraft operations. Generally, the methods developed to detect anomalies in ADS-B trajectory data detect anomalies in either the spatial or energy dimension. These methods distinctly use either spatial metrics or energy metrics, derived from ADS-B trajectory data. Motivated by the limited number of approaches that simultaneously consider both spatial and energy metrics, this paper introduces the concepts of spatial anomalies and energy anomalies and performs a novel investigation into the relationships and interdependencies, if any exist, between the two types of anomalies. To enable this analysis, spatial and energy anomalies are detected in ADS-B trajectory data (and associated derived metrics) using HDBSAN and DBSCAN clustering algorithms, respectively. Four months of ADS-B trajectory data associated with arrivals at San Francisco International Airport is extracted, cleaned and processed. The results that stem from this investigation indicate that if an aircraft is not spatially conforming to an identified set of air traffic flows representing standard spatial operations, then this aircraft is more likely to experience non-conformance to standard operations in its energy metrics. Additionally, this research reveals underlying differences between trajectories that are spatially nominal and energy-anomalous and those trajectories that are spatially anomalous and energy-anomalous. Focusing solely on energy anomalies does not provide insight into potential spatial-related decisions that may have been made to result in off-nominal energy behavior.",0968-090X,Not found
Operational analysis of an innovative semi-autonomous on-demand transportation system,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103373,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Semi-autonomous transportation systems are an intermediate step towards full automation of transportation systems. They use and benefit from the technological advances brought by automation while being already implementable at larger scale under the current regulations and within the existing urban environment. In this paper, we present a new type of semi-autonomous transportation system referred to as Multi-Layered Personal Transit System (MuLPeTS). It consists of convoys composed of one human-driven lead vehicle guiding several autonomous small capacity trailers in which the passengers travel. These trailers can detach from a convoy and travel autonomously in a protected environment before attaching later to another convoy. The interest of this transportation concept is threefold: (i) this assembly of vehicles is able and allowed to move in mixed-traffic conditions whereas fully autonomous driving is still largely restricted; (ii) a trailer can travel autonomously in the vicinity of stations to pick-up and drop-off passengers while the convoy it was previously part of continues its route without further delay; and (iii) passengers complete their entire journey on board a single trailer, that is they avoid the need to transfer. We analyze how this new type of transportation system relates to existing alternatives and propose an operational concept for it, in which we account for passenger assignment, lead vehicle routes and trailer movements, including empty trailer relocation. We extensively test this concept within a purpose-built simulation environment to evaluate the performance of this kind of system based on real-world data instances. The results highlight the most promising operational policies and characterize favorable system configurations.",0968-090X,Not found
An extended Kalman filter approach for real-time state estimation in multi-region MFD urban networks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103384,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The problem of traffic state estimation for large-scale urban networks modeled with MFD dynamics is studied here. Given a network partitioned in a number of regions, aggregated traffic dynamics describe the vehicle accumulation in each region, as well as transfer flows to and from neighboring regions. Considering that MFD accumulation-based models have been integrated in perimeter control approaches, this work tackles the real-time estimation problem when limited data is available. An estimation engine is developed according to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) theory; it seeks to estimate the real state of the multi-region dynamic system based on traffic sensors’ measurements. First, a stochastic model is presented for the dynamics of the process (plant). Then, the EKF estimation scheme is described based on a simpler aggregated model of dynamics and some real-time measurements. Estimation accuracy is investigated through detailed micro-simulation of downtown Barcelona by studying a realistic configuration of real-time measurement availability through loop detector data; however, the developed methodology is generic. The state vector we seek to estimate, as well as the available measurements configuration, can be altered according to the application. The proposed methodology is tested both in macro- and micro-simulation; resulting estimated traffic states (i.e., regional accumulations, demands, and distribution of outflows) are compared to actual ones obtained from the stochastic plant. The developed algorithm can be utilized by closed-loop online urban traffic management strategies to feed the estimated traffic state back to the controller.",0968-090X,Not found

Staggered work schedules for congestion mitigation: A morning commute problem,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103391,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"In urban networks, traffic congestion can be curbed by deconcentrating the temporal distribution of the travel demand. In this paper, we propose an optimal staggered work schedules problem to minimize the network total travel time and prevent the schedule delay in the trips of commuters over morning peaks in a bicentric network. The objective is to optimize the work start times of individual firms with minimum deviations from their initial schedules while taking into account that commuters choose their departure time selfishly to minimize their travel cost. We formulate the optimal work schedule problem in a bicentric network as a multi-objective optimization program that simultaneously minimizes the total travel time and the schedule deviation for the firms while satisfying near-equilibrium temporal conditions. The time-varying congestion dynamics are modeled using macroscopic fundamental diagrams. We solve the optimization problem for a test network and analyze the sensitivity of the Pareto solution to the policy parameters of the model. We assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method using an individual-level trip-based macroscopic simulation model.

Charging station location problem: A comprehensive review on models and solution approaches,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103376,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Charging infrastructure planning has a strategic impact on promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs) and other alternative fuel vehicles. Importantly, decision makers need to answer the question on the number and location of charging stations in a way to satisfy customer recharging demand and meet certain restrictions imposed by real-life considerations. In this context, we consider the charging station location problem (CSLP), which belongs to the category of facility location problems and seeks to optimize the locations of charging stations. A growing body of literature has developed on this subject in recent years. Various approaches have been proposed to model the problem taking into account different features, constraints, decisions and performance measures as well as the dynamic and stochastic components inherent to the problem. Moreover, efficiently solving CSLP, particularly when applied to real-life case-studies, might be challenging in practice. Considerable effort has thus been made by researchers to develop innovative solution methods based on exact or heuristic approaches to obtain good quality solutions within short computation times. Therefore, we provide in this paper a comprehensive review on the literature relevant to CSLP, with a particular focus on modeling and solving the problem.

Equality of opportunity in travel behavior prediction with deep neural networks and discrete choice models,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103410,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Although researchers increasingly adopt machine learning to model travel behavior, they predominantly focus on prediction accuracy, ignoring the ethical challenges embedded in machine learning algorithms. This study introduces an important missing dimension - computational fairness - to travel behavior analysis. It highlights the accuracy-fairness tradeoff instead of the single dimensional focus on prediction accuracy in the contexts of deep neural network (DNN) and discrete choice models (DCM). We first operationalize computational fairness by equality of opportunity, then differentiate between the bias inherent in data and the bias introduced by modeling. The models inheriting the inherent biases can risk perpetuating the existing inequality in the data structure, and the biases in modeling can further exacerbate it. We then demonstrate the prediction disparities in travel behavior modeling using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and the 2018–2019 My Daily Travel Survey in Chicago. Empirically, DNN and DCM reveal consistent prediction disparities across multiple social groups: both over-predict the false negative rate of frequent driving for the ethnic minorities, the low-income and the disabled populations, and falsely predict a higher travel burden of the socially disadvantaged groups and the rural populations than reality. Comparing DNN with DCM, we find that DNN can outperform DCM in prediction disparities because of DNN’s smaller misspecification error. To mitigate prediction disparities, this study introduces an absolute correlation regularization method, which is evaluated with synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate the prevalence of prediction disparities in travel behavior modeling, and the disparities still persist regarding a variety of model specifics such as the number of DNN layers, batch size and weight initialization. Since these prediction disparities can exacerbate social inequity if prediction results without fairness adjustment are used for transportation policy making, we advocate for careful consideration of the fairness problem in travel behavior modeling, and the use of bias mitigation algorithms for fair transport decisions.",0968-090X,Not found

Last-Mile Transportation Systems (LMTS), which have recently emerged, provide on-demand shared transportation. In this paper, we investigate the fleet sizing and allocation problem for the on-demand LMTS. Specifically, we consider the perspective of a last-mile service provider who wants to determine the number of servicing vehicles to allocate to multiple last-mile service regions in a particular city. In each service region, passengers demanding last-mile services arrive in batches, and allocated vehicles deliver passengers to their final destinations. The passenger demand (i.e., the size of each batch of passengers) is random and hard to predict in advance, especially with limited data during the planning process. The quality of fleet-allocation decisions is a function of vehicle fixed cost plus a weighted sum of passenger’s waiting time before boarding a vehicle and in-vehicle riding time. We propose and analyze two models – a stochastic programming model and a distributionally robust optimization model – to solve the problem, assuming known and unknown distribution of the demand, respectively. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the models and discuss insights and implications into the optimal fleet sizing and allocation for the on-demand LMTS under demand uncertainty.",0968-090X,Not found
A chance-constrained programming model for airport ground movement optimisation with taxi time uncertainties,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103382,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Airport ground movement remains a major bottleneck for air traffic management. Existing approaches have developed several routing allocation methods to address this problem, in which the taxi time traversing each segment of the taxiways is fixed. However, taxi time is typically difficult to estimate in advance, since its uncertainties are inherent in the airport ground movement optimisation due to various unmodelled and unpredictable factors. To address the optimisation of taxi time under uncertainty, we introduce a chance-constrained programming model with sample approximation, in which a set of scenarios is generated in accordance with taxi time distributions. A modified sequential quickest path searching algorithm with local heuristic is then designed to minimise the entire taxi time. Working with real-world data at an international airport, we compare our proposed method with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Then, a space–time network-based modeling framework is proposed to integrate human mobility into network location design problems. We construct a probabilistic network structure to quantify human’s presence probability at different locations and time. Then, a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model is proposed to maximize the spatial and temporal coverage of individual targets.

Recognising the intractability of peak-traffic instances of this problem by direct application of the MIP formulation, a novel application of data-splitting algorithm (DS-ASP) is proposed to the case of two runways scenario. DS-ASP divides the given set of flights into several disjoint subsets, and then optimises each of them using 0–1 MIP while ensuring the optimality of the entire set. Computational results show a significant reduction in average solution time (by more than 92% in some scenarios) compared to direct use of a commercial solver while achieving optimality in all of the instances.

Through wireless communication and advanced sensing capabilities, CAVs can detect the surrounding traffic environment and share real-time vehicular information with each other and the infrastructure, and individual trajectories of CAVs can be precisely controlled. This paper proposes a real-time learning and control framework for signalized intersection management, which includes both signal optimization and CAV trajectory control. The proposed framework integrates perception, prediction, planning, and optimization components and aims at improving efficiency mixed connected automated traffic in terms of traffic throughput and delay. This framework applies the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to implicitly learn traffic patterns and driver behavior and then estimate and predict the microscopic traffic conditions that are only partially observable. Then it utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve signal optimization problems by learning from the dynamic interactions between vehicles and the traffic environment. Under the proposed framework, the vehicular trajectories of CAVs can be controlled to maximize the utilization of the green time and reduce the start-up lost time by using a highly efficient trajectory planning algorithm. The CAV platooning operation, in coordination with traffic signals, is also implemented such that CAVs can pass the intersection efficiently. Simulations are performed at a signalized intersection a signalized intersection with multi-lane approaches, high traffic demand, and standard ring-barrier control, and results show that the proposed DRL-TP3 framework can significantly improve the throughput and reduce the average delay across different CAV market penetration rates (MPRs).

Estimation of transfer walking time distribution in multimodal public transport systems based on smart card data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103332,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Transfers are a major contributor to travel time unreliability for journeys in public transport. Thus, connections between services in the public transport network must be reliable. To plan such reliable transfers from e.g. busses to trains, it is crucial to know the necessary walking times from stops to platforms. This paper presents an innovative approach for estimation of walking time distributions from bus stops to train platforms based on a matching of smart card data and automatic vehicle location data. The observed times from bus stop to rail platform turns out to have a large variance, due to two reasons: differences in passenger walking speeds, and passengers who are doing activities during the transfer. To account for these variations a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model is applied, where the time for passengers walking directly and passengers doing activities during the transfer follows separate distributions. The proposed methodology is applied to 129 stations in the Eastern part of Denmark, where the tap-in devices are located at the train platform. Results from two stations with different characteristics are presented in details along with justifications and analyses of model accuracy.

We define two areas around the airport, aiming to efficiently schedule incoming traffic. A four-dimensional (4D) trajectory negotiation/synchronization process between the air traffic control officer (ATCO) and the aircraft is performed in the pre-sequencing area, while the aircraft are still in the en-route phase of flight. On the other hand, in the dynamic-trajectories area, the ATCO, with the help of a ground support tool, generates dynamic arrival routes that automatically adapt to the current traffic demand. These arrival routes allow the aircraft to fly neutral continuous descent operations (CDOs, descents with idle thrust and no speed-brakes usage) and to ensure a separation throughout the arrival procedure. We choose a mixed-integer-programming approach to generate the arrival routes, while we formulate and solve an optimal control problem to generate a set of candidate CDOs per aircraft. Results show that, with a sufficient look-ahead time, it is possible to assign a required time of arrival (RTA) within each aircraft-arrival time window that would allow to efficiently schedule traffic even in the most challenging and dense scenarios.

The evaluation considers the operational cost and average passenger level-of-service trade-offs as well as distributional differences in waiting times. Two case studies are used to evaluate such trade-offs under different fleet compositions; (1) a simple circular network feeder service; (2) a case based on a real-world coordinated branched service in Stockholm, combining fixed-line services on the trunk portion with a flexible feeder service on the branches. Results for the circular network indicate that there are benefits in utilizing an on-demand operational policy for the lowest and highest demand levels tested. When fixed service capacity is exceeded, it is found that there are potential benefits in on-demand operations with respect to average level-of-service, as well as delivering a more even distribution of passenger waiting times. Results for the real-world case show that combining DRT on branches with fixed services on the trunk improves the overall median waiting times for all DRT scenarios and provides substantial improvements for passengers on the trunk, at the cost of more variable, and less equitable waiting times on the branches. For larger fleet sizes, generalized travel costs are reduced with and without rebalancing and level-of-service provided to branch-to-branch passengers is improved considerably by rebalancing idling vehicles to branch end-stops. The case studies demonstrate the usefulness of the simulation framework in evaluating trade-offs between fixed and on-demand service design variables and their effects on disaggregate level-of-service provided for stop-based feeder services.",0968-090X,Not found

Clustering such dynamically growing data is challenging for an offline method because it is memory and time intensive to re-train the model every time new data come in. If the model is not re-trained, false alarms or missed detections may increase since the model cannot reflect changes in data patterns. To address this problem, we propose a novel incremental anomaly detection method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify common patterns and detect outliers in flight operations from digital flight data. It is a probabilistic clustering model of flight operations that can incrementally update its clusters based on new data rather than to re-cluster all data from scratch. It trains an initial GMM model based on historical offline data. Then, it continuously adapts to new incoming data points via an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm. To track changes in flight operation patterns, only model parameters need to be saved, not the raw flight data. The proposed method was tested on three sets of simulation data and two sets of real-world flight data. Compared with the traditional offline GMM method, the proposed method can generate similar clustering results with significantly reduced processing time (57 %–99 % time reduction in testing sets) and memory usage (91 %–95 % memory usage reduction in testing sets). Preliminary results indicate that the incremental learning scheme is effective in dealing with dynamically growing data in flight data analytics.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrating stochastic programs and decision trees in capacitated barge planning with uncertain container arrivals,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103383,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"In this paper, we propose an approach that combines optimization techniques with machine learning to improve capacitated barge planning with uncertain container arrivals. The main idea is to use the predictions of a decision tree in the scenario generation of a 2-stage stochastic program to plan the barge calls (i.e. visits) of a barge operator. The predictions of container arrivals help to generate more accurate scenarios, which in turn leads to more informed decisions and less costs. The approach is tested with an iterative method of periodic planning and simulation for a one year duration so that the long term performance is evaluated. A computational experiment is conducted using the historical data of an inland terminal and the Port of Rotterdam. The results show that the proposed approach improves total costs up to 2.07% over the traditional stochastic approach, and up to 4.57% over the current method used in industry.",0968-090X,Not found
Robust minimum fleet problem for autonomous and human-driven vehicles in on-demand ride services considering mixed operation zones,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103390,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"In this paper, we envision an emerging Mixed Operation Zone (MOZ) where both autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) are present for on-demand ride services. This paper aims to size and operate a fleet of AVs and HVs in the presence of MOZs and to investigate the impact of MOZs on on-demand ride services. Considering the demand uncertainty, we propose a demand-oriented robust minimum fleet problem (RMFP) and employ a two-stage robust optimization (RO) to model the decision-making. Fluctuant demand is bounded by distribution-free uncertainty sets. For the convenience of solving RO models, we reformulate the second-stage recourse problem with an equivalent mathematical programming formulation. A tailored column-and-constraint generation algorithm is developed to solve the RMFP exactly. The algorithm is proved to converge in a finite number of iterations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the instances based on a real-world on-demand ride service in Chengdu.

Optimal time-differentiated pricing for a competitive mixed traditional and crowdsourced event parking market,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103409,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"An event-based parking pricing problem, the Crowdsourced Event Parking Market Pricing Problem, is proposed wherein parking lot owners and others who are willing to rent out privately owned spaces compete to attract drivers who are looking for available parking spaces. Each parking location owner’s problem is modeled as a bi-level program, where the upper-level parking garages, individuals and consolidators (the players) compete for customers, setting their prices to maximize revenue given the response of the lower-level followers. The lower-level followers choose their parking locations based on the utilities they derive from the spaces, which is a function of the proximity of the spaces to their destinations, parking fees and crowdedness. Prices are set as a function of the time of reservation. Reservation-time based pricing enables price differentiation for late comers either in the form of lower prices to attract last-minute customers when excess spaces are anticipated or higher-pricing if few spaces are expected to remain empty. A multi-period, stochastic Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) formulation of the Crowdsourced Event Parking Market Pricing Problem is presented, and a diagonalization method with embedded gradient ascent approach for solution of individual player Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints (MPECs) is proposed for its solution. Both supply- and demand-side uncertainties are explicitly modeled. Solutions provide competitive parking prices set by reservation time for each parking facility, whether the facility involves a large parking garage or single parking space owner. Numerical experiments were conducted to illustrate the proposed concepts and assess the potential impact of crowdsourced parking spaces on the parking market. The results show that social welfare increases by more than 5% when crowdsourced parking locations account for 7% of the parking market. Results from additional numerical experiments show that ignoring stochasticity results in revenue loss for all parking owners. The developed techniques aim to facilitate existing and new parking facility owners to participate in crowdsourced event-parking markets.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-models machine learning methods for traffic flow estimation from Floating Car Data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103389,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Traffic flow measurement is very important for traffic management systems. However, the existing traditional measurement approaches are highly time-consuming and expensive to continuously gather the required data and to maintain the corresponding equipment, such as loop detectors and video cameras. On the other hand, many services on the web propose to estimate automobile travel time taking into account traffic conditions thanks to crowd sourced data (Floating Car Data). This work proposes to reconstruct, from estimated travel time, traffic flows using machine learning method. In particular, we evaluate the capacity of Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR) to address this issue. After obtaining estimated travel time on a given route, a clustering process shows that travel duration profiles in each day can be associated to different “types of day”. Then, different regressors are trained in order to estimate traffic flows from travel duration. In the “multi-model” variant, we trained a Regressor for each type of day. Conversely, in the “single model” variant, only one Regressor is trained (the type of day is not taken into account). This is an innovative work to estimate and reconstruct the traffic flow in transportation networks with machine learning method from aggregated Floating Car Data (FCD). A series of experiments are conducted to compare the estimated traffic flows, obtained by the proposed single model and multi-model, and the real ones from actual sensors. The obtained results show that both single model and multi-models can capture the tendency of real traffic flows. Furthermore, the performance can be improved by regulating parameters in GPR machine learning model, such as half width of sample window and sample size (a whole week or only weekdays), and multi-models can highly increase the performance compared with the single model. Therefore, the proposed GPR machine learning and FCD based new method can replace those traditional loop detectors for the measurement of traffic flow.",0968-090X,Not found

To date, only a few studies have been conducted that compare how potential air taxi demand across cities varies. This study calculates a measure of air taxi demand for commuters for the 40 most populous combined statistical areas (CSAs) in the U.S. by using: (1) cell phone data to identify regular commuters in cities, (2)census data to associate household income characteristics with commuters, and (3)a mode choice model calibrated from a stated preference survey to predict the number of commuters that would use an air taxi. Air taxi commuter demand is concentrated in a handful of CSAs; the CSAs for New York City, LosAngeles, and Washington, D.C., generate 33percent of the overall air taxi demand. Results are sensitive to location of existing vertiports, existing ground infrastructure and congestion levels on competing modes, and current commute patterns. A resultant set of online maps of potential air taxi routes allows readers to visualize how air taxi commuter routes differ across CSAs.

The whole day path planning problem incorporating mode chains modeling in the era of mobility as a service,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103360,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The growing popularity of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has led researchers to realize that it can be used for the optimal management of the transportation system of a city. This study is to solve the whole day multimodal path planning problem considering user-specific modal preference, which can be used on the recommended system of the MaaS platform. The mathematical formulations of the whole day multimodal shortest hyperpath problem are proposed while accounting for individual constraints, such as the time window, multicriteria, and park-and-ride demands, to develop customized travel schemes. The primary obstacle involves consideration of the travelers’ modal preferences to develop an optimal whole day journey. The dynamic discrete choice model (DDCM) that accounts for unobservable heterogeneity is proposed to characterize dynamic mode choice behavior and generate a set of feasible mode chains. The conditional choice probability estimator and expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm are used in conjunction to estimate the dynamic model. In this way, the posterior probability can be adapted to the conditional choice probability estimation. The label correcting concept is used to develop a user-constrained shortest hyperpath algorithm that can solve the multimodal shortest hyperpath problem and calculate the Pareto set of the whole day travel schemes according to the feasible mode chains and different constraints. The proposed techniques are verified by utilizing household travel survey data and multimodal network data in Nanjing (China). Two unobserved states of travelers, namely time- and cost-sensitive, are identified based on the BIC value. The adjusted rho-squared value, accuracies of predicted mode chains, along with the aggregate validation results, confirm the model’s effectiveness.

Terminal area control rules and eVTOL adaptive scheduling model for multi-vertiport system in urban air Mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103385,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"On the one hand, vertiports in economically developed areas will present the operation mode of multi-vertiport, and the contradiction between the development of urban air mobility and limited operating resources is very serious. On the other hand, unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have different operating processes and limited battery energy supply. Long flight times in the terminal area pose a risk of exhaustion and great safety challenges. Given the terminal area of the multi-vertiport system (MVS-TA), this paper investigates the adaptive control system (ACS), which includes the design of the operating environment and the integrated scheduling model. The design of the operating environment is the basis of adaptive management, which consists of the concept of multi-ring structure and the junction control rules based on backpressure policy. Considering the power constraint and dynamic priority, an integrated model including path planning model and distributed sequencing model is constructed to solve the cooperative scheduling problem of approach-departure flights. Results from numerical analyses reveal that: First, in the case of large flight flow, ACS can achieve the efficiency and safety of MVS-TA operation better than the traditional control system. Secondly, the flight density into the terminal area has a greater impact on ACS performance relative to flight volume. With a density of less than 120 flights/hour, the operating efficiency of MVS-TA under ACS varies within 10.3% with the number of flights or density.",0968-090X,Not found
"Generating a synthetic probabilistic daily activity-location schedule using large-scale, long-term and low-frequency smartphone GPS data with limited activity information",10.1016/j.trc.2021.103408,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Household travel survey data is a critical input to travel behavior modeling, and it also can be used to generate trip schedules for activity-based traffic simulation. With emerging information and communication technology (ICT) tools like smartphones, the collection of passive datasets for travelers’ real-time information becomes available. Smartphone GPS survey apps have emerged to be a popular tool for conducting household travel surveys. Most existing studies employ high-frequency smartphone GPS data and collect accurate activity information. However, their study periods are still rather short, ranging from a few days to a few weeks. For a long-term GPS survey, the issues of missing activity information and sparse GPS data are inevitable and must be addressed carefully. This paper uses 7-month low-frequency smartphone GPS data collected from over 2000 participants, who report 5 most frequently visited locations weekly. The essential goal is to develop a synthetic model of daily activity-location scheduling to capture data with both known and unknown activities. To handle missing activity data, this research develops a new probabilistic approach, which measures the probability of visiting a place by three scores, global visit score (GVS), temporal visit score (TVS), and periodical visit score (PVS). Three different levels of activity-location schedule are modeled respectively. The first level handles only those data with known activities, while data with unknown activities are disregarded. The second takes unknown activities into account but combines all types of them into a single category. The third one models each location with unknown activities separately. These models are able to generate activity-location schedule in different levels of detail for activity-based traffic simulator. After developing activity-location schedule models, both individual and aggregated validation processes are performed with simulation. The validation result shows that the simulated proportion of activity types and activity duration are close to the survey data, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. This research sheds a light on building sustainable and long-term travel survey using GPS data with missing activity information.

The ensemble approach to forecasting: A review and synthesis,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103357,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Ensemble forecasting is a modeling approach that combines data sources, models of different types, with alternative assumptions, using distinct pattern recognition methods.

Uncertainties are systematically accounted for. Outputs of ensemble models can be presented as a range of possibilities, to indicate the amount of uncertainty in modeling.

Assessing bikeability with street view imagery and computer vision,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103371,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Studies evaluating bikeability usually compute spatial indicators shaping cycling conditions and conflate them in a quantitative index.

Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging the usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with experiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore and Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability comprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of bikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are adequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they outperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability and potentially can be used independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper exposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining both SVI and non-SVI approaches.

Doubly generalized logit: A closed-form discrete choice model system with multivariate generalized extreme value distributed utilities,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103315,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"In this study, we generalize our previous q-generalized multinomial logit model (Nakayama & Chikaraishi, 2015), in which the heteroscedastic variance and flexible shape of the utility distribution are considered, by allowing for statistical dependency of alternatives. This is achieved by introducing the q-generalization of McFadden’s multivariate Gumbel distribution. Thus, the logit model is doubly generalized; 1) each utility follows the generalized extreme value distribution that includes the Gumbel, Weibull, and Fréchet distributions; and 2) the utility distribution is multivariate, and therefore, a nested or cross-nested structure and dependency of alternatives are allowed. The proposed doubly generalized logit model system allows for deriving new closed-form discrete choice models such as the q-generalized nested logit model and q-generalized cross-nested logit (CNL) model. Furthermore, the model system includes conventional logit models such as the multinomial logit, nested logit, and CNL models as special cases as well as the new generalized logit models, while retaining a closed-form expression.

A probabilistic model based optimization for aircraft scheduling in terminal area under uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103374,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Air traffic management relies strongly on the accuracy of prediction, while uncertainties such as weather, navigation accuracy, pilot operations, etc. may weaken the performance of predictive tools and cause potential safety issues or reduced capacity. Among all controlled airspace, the Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) is one of the most complex areas in which flight safety can be easily affected by unpredictable disturbances. This paper addresses an aircraft scheduling problem under uncertainty with the aim of providing a robust schedule for arrival flights. Uncertainty quantification and propagation along the routes are realized in a trajectory model that formulates the time information as random variables. Conflict detection and resolution are performed at waypoints of a predefined network based on the predicted time information from the trajectory model. By minimizing the expected number of conflicts, consecutively operated flights can be well separated. Apart from the proposed model, two other models - the deterministic model and a model that incorporates separation buffers - are presented as benchmarks. A meta-heuristic simulated annealing algorithm combined with a time decomposition sliding window is proposed for solving a case study of the Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport. Further, a simulation framework based on the Monte-Carlo approach is implemented so as to evaluate the optimized solutions obtained from the three models. Statistical comparison among the results shows instability of the model that incorporates the separation buffers, in contrast, the proposed model has absolute advantages in both stability and the conflict absorbing ability when uncertainty arises.",0968-090X,Not found

Like other measurement apparatuses, these sensors are subject to failure, which can affect the reliability of the OD estimations. In this paper, we propose a novel model that allows us to solve the NSLP for OD demand estimation by identifying the most reliable locations to install sets of sensors with consideration for a nonhomogeneous Poisson process to account for time-dependent sensor failure. The proposed model does not rely on the assumption that true OD demand information is known. We introduce two separate objective functions to minimize the maximum possible information loss (MPIL) associated with OD demand on sensor-equipped links and OD pairs during the lifetimes of the sensors. Both objective functions are formulated to incorporate the possibility of sensor failure into the calculated OD demands. We use stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) to address the stochasticity of traffic route selection. We then employ the weighted sums method (WSM) and an ε-constraint to incorporate the objective functions into an integrated formulation. Two sensor types with different time-dependent failure rates are considered to identify the optimal locations for sets of sensors for OD demand estimation purposes while addressing the available budget constraints. We also address the problem of scheduled/routine maintenance of existing sensors by introducing an additional sensor deployment phase that focuses on maintaining the reliability of information by repairing or replacing failed sensors, installing additional sensors or a combination of both. The numerical results from the proposed model demonstrate how the deployment of more advanced sensors with lower failure rates can effectively improve the reliability of the information obtained from sensors. We also evaluate the use of different weights for the WSM’s objective functions to explore alternative combinations of sensor configurations.

Joint design of shared-bike and transit services in corridors,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103366,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The prevalence of shared bikes in many cities is a double-edged sword to the local mass transit services. Some transit patrons may switch to cycling, causing declines in the transit ridership. Others may benefit from using bikes instead of walking to access transit. The complicated interactions between the two modes entail the necessity of designing them jointly. Unfortunately, the literature has focused on either the design of a single mode or joint designs idealized by assuming a uniform demand pattern. The latter class of works has limited practical values. This paper develops a continuum approximation (CA) model for optimizing the hybrid design of shared-bike and transit services in a corridor under spatially heterogeneous demand patterns. The model minimizes the generalized system cost considering various route options that patrons can choose from, including transit routes with walking or biking access and bike-only routes. The methodological challenges that arise due to patrons’ route choices in the heterogeneous operating environment are overcome by incorporating a route assignment model into the CA modeling framework. We propose a bi-level algorithm to solve the model, where the upper level optimizes the hybrid design by exploiting some analytical properties of the CA model, and the lower level calculates the route assignment equilibrium. Numerical experiments show that the optimal hybrid design outperforms the conventional transit design for a wide range of operating conditions. The cost saving can be over 20%. Under certain conditions, the hybrid design can even reduce the total operating cost, making bike-sharing profitable for transit agencies.

A novel concept of a virtual zone is utilized to capture vehicle relocation range and client walking or biking distance constraints in one-way carsharing systems. The vehicle imbalance problem is further addressed by combining a long-term pricing strategy and real-time vehicle relocations in a two-stage stochastic programming model. In the first stage, the tactical decisions including fleet size and trip price are optimized, while anticipating the operational costs from the second stage. The second stage optimizes operational decisions under uncertain demand including vehicle relocations conditional on the tactical decisions in stage one. The model aims to maximize the profit of a carsharing company considering the fleet costs calculated in stage one and the expected operational costs and revenue obtained in stage two. A dedicated gradient search algorithm is developed to solve the two-stage stochastic programming and results are compared to a genetic algorithm and an iterated local search algorithm. The proposed model and corresponding solution approach are applied to a large-scale network with 50 zones and over 1000 vehicles in Suzhou, China. The application allows us to attain additional operational insight.

The experiment was conducted with two automated vehicles equipped with Mobileye sensors and Wi-Fi modules. The car-following performance of CACCu, in comparison with ACC and human driving (as the ego vehicle), was evaluated in the real-traffic scenarios constructed using NGSIM vehicle trajectory data. Over the 6 test runs for each control method, it was found that CACCu reduced 10.8% acceleration Root Mean Square (RMS), 60.8% spacing error RMS and 6.2% fuel consumption from ACC’s, indicating advantages of CACCu in control accuracy, ride comfort and energy efficiency. Compared with human driving, CACCu also reduced 17.6% acceleration and 13.4% fuel consumption. More importantly, the CACCu was able to efficiently avoid the traffic disturbance amplifications that frequently happened to ACC and human driving, which means the string stability has been significantly improved by the CACCu.",0968-090X,Not found
Improved Benders decomposition for stochastic yard template planning in container terminals,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103365,132,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Recent trends in pursuing green ports have had positive effects on terminal operators constructing more eco-friendly decision schemes. A yard template in a container port not only determines the scheduling of the terminal handling equipment by container allocation, but also affects the carbon emissions from yard trucks caused by loading and unloading operations, due to the differing degree of yard road congestion. Moreover, the uncertainty regarding the number of transporting containers makes it challenging to construct a robust yard template for a container terminal. Motivated by research pointing to the need to alleviate the exhaust pollution generated by port handling equipment, this paper presents a two-stage stochastic programming model for yard template planning, with the aim of minimizing the maintenance and manpower costs of activating yard cranes for container handling and of reducing the carbon dioxide emitted from yard trucks. More specifically, the paper considers the impact of road congestion on carbon dioxide emissions from the perspective of the increase in transportation time caused by yard truck interruptions. The uncertainty regarding the number of transport containers is reflected by taking into account numerous scenarios in which different numbers of containers are loaded onto (discharged from) vessels that visit the port periodically. In addition, an improved Benders decomposition-based solution method is designed to solve the proposed model with large-scale problem instances. Several experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the model and the efficiency of the method. The numerical results demonstrate that yard template planning that considers road congestion can effectively reduce the carbon emissions of yard trucks in loading and unloading operations.",0968-090X,Not found
Analyzing pedestrian individual and interaction collision avoidance dynamics in traditional scenarios,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103445,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Revealing the behavioral mechanism of crowd dynamics is crucial for explaining the self-organized phenomena and making a quick emergent response for crowd management. Various approaches have been proposed to analyze self-organized phenomena of crowd dynamics, but the essential mechanisms of complicated and heterogeneous collision avoidance behaviors are still not clear. To deeply investigate the microscopic behaviors, the geometrical characteristics of Voronoi diagrams and velocity obstacles are explored and a unified spatial tessellation and velocity obstacle approach is proposed. The personal space is divided into four regions, and a velocity graph that is a subgraph of Delaunay triangulation will be established to describe the relationship between pedestrians. In a velocity graph, a link represents that a pedestrian’s speed is towards a Voronoi edge of its neighbor. According to the experimental pedestrian trajectory data, the collision avoidance probability is relevant to some parameters, such as spatial conflict time, and minimal velocity difference. Results show that the probability is related to the distance to velocity obstacle boundary and relaxation time by Sigmoid function. Besides, the behavior dynamics in each region is analyzed, and it is determined by the deviation angles between Voronoi nodes and neighbor locations. This approach can be potentially applied to pedestrian behavioral analysis and crowd management.",0968-090X,Not found
Connected and automated vehicle distributed control for on-ramp merging scenario: A virtual rotation approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103451,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This study proposes a rotation-based connected automated vehicle (CAV) distributed cooperative control strategy for an on-ramp merging scenario. By assuming the mainline and ramp line are straight, we firstly design a virtual rotation approach that transfers the merging problem to a virtual car following (CF) problem to reduce the complexity and dimension of the cooperative CAVs merging control. Based on this concept, a multiple-predecessor virtual CF model and a unidirectional multi-leader communication topology are developed to determine the longitudinal behavior of each CAV. Specifically, we exploit a distributed feedback and feedforward longitudinal controller in preparation for actively generating gaps for merging CAVs, reducing the voids caused by merging, and ensuring safety and traffic efficiency during the process. To ensure the disturbance attenuation property of this system, practical string stability is mathematically proved for the virtual CF controllers to prohibit the traffic oscillation amplification through the traffic stream. Moreover, as a provision for extending the virtual CF application scenarios of any curvy ramp geometry, we utilize a curvilinear coordinate to model the two-dimensional merging control, and further design a local lateral controller based on an extended linear-quadratic regulator to regulate the position deviation and angular deviation of the lane centerlines. For the purpose of systematically evaluating the control performance of the proposed methods, numerical simulation experiments are conducted. As the results indicate, the proposed controllers can actively reduce the void and meanwhile guarantee the damping of traffic oscillations in the merging control area.",0968-090X,Not found
Real-time turning rate estimation in urban networks using floating car data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103457,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Real-time information about the dynamic variation of turning rates at intersections is essential for achieving a more efficient traffic control and management system. Limitations in obtaining measurements of turning movements have drawn attention to the need for alternative methods for estimation of turning rates. In a large-scale urban network, characteristics such as disparate signal plans and various intersection layouts make defining a generic model for the entire network challenging. For this reason, most of the proposed methods are impractical for real-field implementation. The application of existing optimization-based methods is also limited by computational complexity, the need for pre-defined assumptions and insufficient stationary traffic measurements (e.g. loop detectors and plate recognition cameras) in urban networks. In this study, we take advantage of probe vehicles to propose a hybrid method that noticeably reduces the need for stationary measurements in the network. This hybrid method consists of two core stages: signal processing, and physical data-driven modeling to consecutively estimate turning rates. In the signal processing phase, we use wavelet transformation to extract fundamental components of inferred floating car turning rates. These components are then used as inputs to a turning rate estimation model. Using these decomposed components of floating car turning rates instead of raw input helps to balance the effect of low and high-frequency signal components and leads to a more accurate estimation. Investigation of the proposed method in a microscopic simulation environment reveals the ability of the hybrid model to detect turning rate variations even when a severe incident occurs.",0968-090X,Not found
Anticipation in a velocity-based model for pedestrian dynamics,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103464,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Lane formation in bidirectional pedestrian streams is based on a stimulus–response mechanism and strategies of navigation in a fast-changing environment. Although microscopic models that only guarantee volume exclusion can qualitatively reproduce this phenomenon, they are not sufficient for a quantitative description. To quantitatively describe this phenomenon, a minimal anticipatory collision-free velocity model is introduced. Compared to the original velocity model, the new model reduces the occurrence of gridlocks and reproduces the movement of pedestrians more realistically. For a quantitative description of the phenomenon, an order parameter is used to describe the formation of lanes at transient states and to show that the proposed model compares relatively well with experimental data. Furthermore, the model is validated by the experimental fundamental diagrams of bidirectional flows.",0968-090X,Not found

In this paper, we propose to use vessel and develop optimal vessel routing network to collect macro-marine debris on the nearshore surface. Due to the integrated force of winds and ocean currents, debris constantly changes floating location in the ocean. Advanced remote sensing technology and General National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) software are employed to identify debris locations and track the drifting trajectory, respectively. In order to balance collecting efficiency and vessel emission reduction, we propose a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model for vessel routing to minimize travel time and carbon emission, considering time window at debris location, vessel capacity, low/medium/high vessel speed, and cost including carbon tax. A novel pheromone heuristic adaptive large neighborhood search (PHALNS ) algorithm combined with archived multi-objective simulated annealing (AMOSA) mechanism is developed to solve the proposed model. The Yangtze River Estuary region is taken as a numerical example to verify the proposed model and algorithm. Six criterions are introduced to evaluate the best collection time, and the proposed algorithm is also compared with NSGA II algorithm. The results show that low carbon emission and cost effective could be achieved simultaneously, and vessel speed has larger impact than the route scheme.",0968-090X,Not found

As the urban mobility revolution approaches, we must investigate (i) the collective behavior of LAAT aircraft in cities, and (ii) ways of controlling LAAT systems. Future LAAT systems exemplify a new class of modern large scale engineering systems — networked control systems. They are spatially distributed, consist of many interconnected elements with control loops through digital communication networks such that the system signals can be exchanged among all components through a common network. Therefore, a decentralized controller design in framework of the unilateral event-driven paradigm is considered. Inspired by controlled urban road networks, in this paper we first establish the concept of Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) for LAAT systems and develop a collective and aggregate aircraft traffic flow model. Then, based on that, we design an adaptive boundary feedback flow control which is robust to various anomalies in technical devices and network communication links for LAAT systems.",0968-090X,Not found
Resiliency of on-demand multimodal transit systems during a pandemic,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103418,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of the public transit ridership led to significant budget deficits due to dramatic decreases in fare revenues. Additionally, public transit agencies are facing challenges of reduced vehicle capacity due to social distancing requirements, additional costs of cleaning and protective equipment, and increased downtime for vehicle cleaning. Due to these constraints on resources and budgets, many transit agencies have adopted essential service plans with reduced service hours, number of routes, or frequencies. This paper studies the resiliency during a pandemic of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS), a new generation of transit systems that combine a network of high-frequency trains and buses with on-demand shuttles to serve the first and last miles and act as feeders to the fixed network. It presents a case study for the city of Atlanta and evaluates ODMTS for multiple scenarios of depressed demand and social distancing representing various stages of the pandemic. The case study relies on an optimization pipeline that provides an end-to-end ODMTS solution by bringing together methods for demand estimation, network design, fleet sizing, and real-time dispatching. These methods are adapted to work in a multimodal setting and to satisfy practical constraints. In particular, a limit is imposed on the number of passenger transfers, and a new network design model is introduced to avoid the computational burden stemming from this constraint. Real data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is used to conduct the case study, and the results are evaluated with a high-fidelity simulation. The case study demonstrates how ODMTS provide a resilient solution in terms of cost, convenience, and accessibility for this wide range of scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found
Truck body type classification using a deep representation learning ensemble on 3D point sets,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103461,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of commercial vehicles is essential for facilitating strategic pavement design, freight planning, and policy making. Hence, transportation agencies have been increasingly interested in collecting truck body configuration data due to its strong association with industries and freight commodities, to better understand their distinct operational characteristics and impacts on infrastructure and the environment. The rapid advancement of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has facilitated the development of non-intrusive detection solutions that are able to accurately classify truck body types in detail. This paper proposes a new truck classification method using a LiDAR sensor oriented to provide a wide field-of-view of roadways. In order to enrich the sparse point cloud obtained from the sensor, point clouds originating from the same truck across consecutive frames were grouped and combined using a two-stage vehicle reconstruction framework to generate a dense three-dimensional (3D) point cloud representation of each truck. Subsequently, PointNet – a deep representation learning algorithm – was adopted to train the classification model from reconstructed point clouds. The model utilizes low-level features extracted from the 3D point clouds and detects key features associated with each truck class. Finally, model ensemble techniques were explored to reduce the generalization error by averaging the results of seven PointNet models and further enhancing the overall model performance. The optimal number of models in the ensemble was determined through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis with the consideration of the average correct classification rate (CCR), the variability of the prediction results, and the computation efficiency. The developed model is capable of distinguishing passenger vehicles and 29 different truck body configurations with an average CCR of 83 percent. The average correct classification rate of the developed method on the test dataset was 90 percent for trucks pulling a large trailer(s).",0968-090X,https://github.com/liyiqiao22/Roadside-LiDAR-Truck-Classification-Data-Samples

A ‘Driver’s Risk Field’ (DRF) function has been previously shown to be able to predict manual driving behaviour in several simulated scenarios. In this paper, we tested if the DRF-based risk estimate ( r ˆ ) could predict manual driving behaviour and the driver’s perceived risk during automated driving. To ensure that the participants perceived realistic levels of risk, the experiment was conducted in a test vehicle. Eight participants drove five laps manually and experienced 12 different laps of automated driving on a test track. The test track consisted of three sections (which were sub-divided into 12 sectors): curve driving (9 sectors), parked car (1 sector), and 90-degree intersections (2 sectors). If the driver verbally expressed risk or performed a takeover, that particular sector was labelled as risky. The results show that the DRF risk estimate ( r ˆ ) predicted manual driving behaviour ( ρ s t e e r i n g = 0 . 69 , ρ s p e e d = 0 . 64 ), as well as correlated with the driver’s perceived risk in curve driving (r 2 = 0.98) and while negotiating a car parked outside the lane boundary (r 2 = 0 . 59 ).

Location selection for hydrogen fuel stations under emerging provider competition,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103426,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Individual hydrogen-based mobility with fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) is a promising avenue for green house gas reduction in the transportation sector. With a rise in popularity of FCEVs and increased governmental grants and funding, investments in hydrogen refueling stations gain attractiveness for fuel station providers. However, as uncertainty around adoption rates and emerging competition between station providers persists, careful location selection becomes crucial for providers willing to invest in hydrogen fuel stations. We formulate a location problem for hydrogen fuel stations as a competitive flow-capture location–allocation model. In contrast to prior formulations, no prior knowledge of competitor locations is required as we expect competitors to choose locations simultaneously in an emerging competitive environment. We solve the arising competitive model formulation as an integer programming game (IPG). In a real-world scenario, we identify optimal locations for the two largest competing fuel station providers in Munich, Germany. Within this study, providers who acknowledge the existence of their competitor can realize an increase in profit of 17% (averaged across different scenarios of FCEV market penetration & customer preferences). Central coordination (e.g., through conditional subsidies from policymakers) or cooperation between the competitors (e.g., through provider associations) could further increase overall profits by 28%, however this increase in profitability comes at the cost of overall customer travel distance (increased by up to 10% in case of cooperation between providers) as the average detour a customer has to take to refuel increases.",0968-090X,Not found
Asking the Wizard-of-Oz: How experiencing autonomous buses affects preferences towards their use for feeder trips in public transport,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103454,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to have a significant impact on the entire transport sector. With respect to public transportation, autonomous buses---as a means of small and flexible on-demand services---have the potential of increasing the accessibility of people and lower operational costs. As such services are not currently available, their acceptance by their prospective riders and their potential to boost public transportation are yet to be identified. The present study aims at shedding light on these issues by combining a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with a two-stage stated preference (SP) study. The participants of the study had the opportunity to try an ostensible autonomous bus, in the form of a feeder service, over a period of two to four weeks (Wizard-of-Oz experiment). Furthermore, they were confronted with the same hypothetical mode choice tasks, including two autonomous bus alternatives (SP experiment), before and after the Wizard-of-Oz experiment. The study took place in two cities in Germany, namely Berlin and Braunschweig. In this paper, we analyze the mode choices of the pooled sample of participants using a Mixed Logit model with random parameters in order to tackle respondents' heterogeneity of preferences. By estimating the model using the answers from the before and after experiments, we show that there is a positive effect in favor of the autonomous bus service for the feeder trip.

Mobility pattern recognition based prediction for the subway station related bike-sharing trips,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103404,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The free-floating bike-sharing (BS) system plays an important role in connection with the public transit system. However, few studies have addressed the impacts of the subway network on the BS system and integrated the features quantitatively into the BS trip prediction framework. Based on the observation of the close relationship between the BS and the urban rail transit, our study focuses on the trip forecasting of the BSs around the subway stations. Firstly, the subway station related sites are investigated based on the BS dataset in Beijing, China. Secondly, multiple categories of features are extracted, including the subway station related site categories by clustering, the BS site mobility patterns by tensor decomposition, as well as other features (e.g., temporal, POI, meteorological, and air quality information). Finally, a three-layer ensemble learning model based method (i.e., the SAP-SF method) under the stacking strategy is proposed with integrations of multiple features and the several selected machine learning algorithms. It is applied to the simultaneous prediction of the hourly return numbers for a large-scale BS system involving a total of 280 sites in Beijing. The output performance is also examined by comparing the results with those obtained from the benchmark models. It is indicated that the features of subway station related site categories and site mobility patterns jointly contribute to the improvement of BS trip prediction. The accuracy can be increased layer by layer and is superior to the single machine learning algorithm. The research finding can provide useful information for system administrators to perform service level checks and to rebalance BSs around subway stations.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimization of network sensor location for full link flow observability considering sensor measurement error,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103460,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Full link flow observability problem is to identify the minimum set of links to be installed with traffic sensors in a vehicular traffic network, so that unobserved link flows can be fully inferred from the observed link flows based on the correlation between links. Inevitably, the observed link flows are subject to measurement errors, which will accumulate and propagate in the inference of unobserved link flows. This study aims to identify the minimum observed link set for the installation of counting sensors to reach full link flow observability, while minimizing the effect of sensor measurement errors on the inference of unobserved link flows. We propose a network sensor location model considering the propagation of measurement errors in the link flow inference process. Mathematically, we formulate the problem as min–max and min-sum integer linear programs. The objective function attempts directly to minimize the accumulated inference errors caused by the propagation of sensor measurement errors. When the sensors have the uniform measurement error, it is equivalent to minimizing the maximum or cumulative number of observed links required for the link flow inference of each or all unobserved links. The genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to solve the proposed optimization model, and the results commend the optimal sensor location scheme with the minimum inference error for full link flow observability.

Modeling Melburnians—Using the Koopman operator to gain insight into crowd dynamics,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103437,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Describing and forecasting city traffic is challenging, given the array of factors influencing the movement of pedestrians and vehicles. Faced with this complexity, research has focused on machine learning as a way to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns, based on past sensor data. While the methods can accurately forecast high-dimensional observations, it is often hard to explain the models and their predictions. In many cases, only the predictive performance of an otherwise black box model is evaluated. An accurate but explainable alternative is provided by the Koopman operator, an emerging methodology for data-driven identification of high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we showcase the method by analyzing pedestrian traffic data from Melbourne, Australia. We formulate our computations in the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition framework, where we approximate the Koopman operator in a function basis computed with time delay embedding and the Diffusion Map algorithm. The model captures the distinct temporal patterns of 11 traffic sensors simultaneously. Because the dynamics become linear in the operator-theoretic perspective, we can decompose the model into its spectral components. Importantly, these components facilitate interpretation and can increase scientific understanding of the underlying system and the model’s operations. For the Melbourne data, we show that the spectral components connect to the underlying state space geometry and indicate the model’s stability over a prediction horizon. Our study showcases how the Koopman operator framework offers explainable and accurate data-driven predictions in a real-world traffic system.

Flow-aware platoon formation of Connected Automated Vehicles in a mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103442,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) bring promise of increasing traffic capacity and energy efficiency by forming platoons with short headways on the road. However at low CAV penetration, the capacity gain will be small because the CAVs that randomly enter the road will be sparsely distributed, diminishing the probability of forming long platoons. Many researchers propose to solve this issue by platoon organization strategies, where the CAVs search for other CAVs on the road and change lanes if necessary to form longer platoons. However, the current literature does not analyze a potential risk of platoon organization in disrupting the flow and reducing the capacity by inducing more lane changes. In this research, we use driving model of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles and human-driven vehicles that are validated with field experiments and find that platoon organization can indeed drop the capacity with more lane changes. But when the traffic demand is well below capacity, platoon organization forms longer CAV platoons without reducing the flow. Based on this finding, we develop the Flow-Aware platoon organization strategy, where the CAVs perform platoon organization conditionally on the local traffic state, i.e., a low flow and a high speed. We simulate the Flow-Aware platoon organization on a realistic freeway network and show that the CAVs successfully form longer platoons, while ensuring a maximal traffic flow.",0968-090X,Not found

Heuristics were used for optimal real-time vehicle routing in sizable real-world networks accommodating various service types and scopes. In this case study, total user costs were reduced by 18.6% when rides were coordinated with mainline fixed-route transit.

A two-part model combining a binary logit model and a partial proportional odds model was utilized to investigate the change of individuals’ positions on AVs over time, controlling for their socio-demographic characteristics, travel behavior characteristics, and built environment attributes. We find that the percentage of population unfamiliar with AVs has declined over the years, which is probably due to a greater exposure to the information about AVs. All other variables being equal, individuals’ interest in AVs has not changed over time while their concerns have increased across time. The findings suggest that information campaigns or educational programs that introduce the advantages of AV adoption with a focus on the safety aspects of AVs could potentially alter public attitudes, which could help achieve greater market penetration.",0968-090X,Not found

On the other hand, work zones (WZs) have become common areas on highway systems as a result of the increasing construction and maintenance activities. The near future will therefore bring the coexistence of CAVs and WZs which makes their interaction inevitable. WZs expose all vehicles to a sudden and complex geometric change in the roadway environment, something that may challenge many of CAV navigation capabilities. WZs however also impose a space contraction resulting in adverse traffic impacts, something that legitimately calls for benefiting from the highly efficient CAV functions.

An improved learning-based LSTM approach for lane change intention prediction subject to imbalanced data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103414,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Lane change intention prediction is an essential component for motion planning of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this work, we aim to achieve this task by using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. One critical challenge on this task is that the dataset used for training such a network is usually highly imbalanced due to the fact that the size of left/right lane change data is much smaller than that of the lane keeping data. The imbalanced dateset would lead to trivial output of LSTM model. To deal with this problem, we propose a hierarchical over-sampling bagging method based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). With the proposed method, more diverse and informative instances of minority classes can be generated for training LSTM model. Furthermore, we also propose a sampling technique to keep the temporal information and make the proposed method applicable to sequential data. Moreover, to further improve the prediction performance, we also take the interactions between neighboring vehicles into account by concatenating their trajectories when constructing features. We evaluate our method against several baseline algorithms over two benchmark datasets and the empirical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in terms of the indexes of prediction time, F1, and G-mean.",0968-090X,Not found

Several comprehensive survey papers in recent years have summarised the deep learning applications in the transportation domain. However, the system dynamics of the transportation network vary greatly between the non-congested state and the congested state — thereby necessitating the need for a clear understanding of the challenges specific to congestion prediction. In this survey, we present the current state of deep learning applications in the tasks related to detection, prediction, and alleviation of congestion.

Modelling risk perception using a dynamic hybrid choice model and brain-imaging data: Application to virtual reality cycling,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103435,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Road risk analysis is one of the key research areas in transport, where the impact of perceived risk on choices, especially in a dynamic setting, has been long recognised. However, due to the lack of dynamic data and the difficulty in capturing risk perception, existing studies typically resort to static and stated approaches to infer the experienced level of risk of individuals. In this paper, we aimed to address this research gap through developing a hybrid choice model that jointly employed dynamic data on cycling behaviour in virtual reality and neural data to evaluate how the fluctuations in momentary risk perception influence the behaviour of cyclists. The results of the developed model confirm our hypotheses, demonstrating that cyclists reduce their speed when approaching a junction as the potential for a collision with passing cars increases. Moreover, the latent component allowed us to establish a link between the neural data, the amplitude of alpha brainwaves, and objective risk measures. In line with our hypothesis, we found that decreased alpha amplitude is associated with higher perceived risk, which in turn increases the likelihood of braking. The implications of our study are manifold. On the one hand, it shows the ability of virtual reality to elicit complex cyclists’ behaviour and the feasibility of a joint collection of dynamic neural and choice data. On the other hand, we demonstrated the potential of the employment of neural data in a hybrid model framework as an indicator of risk that allowed us to gain a better understanding of cycling behaviour and associated neural processing. These promising findings pave the way for future studies that aim to explore the advantages of neuroscientific inputs in the choice models.",0968-090X,Not found
An agent-based model for air transportation to capture network effects in assessing delay management mechanisms,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103358,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This article presents some of the results on the implementation of a decentralised delay management process that we call 4D trajectory adjustments (4DTA) obtained with Mercury, a stochastic agent-based model. The model operates within a strong agent paradigm at the level of individual flights and passengers. It includes a realistic cost model for the airlines, allowing us to have a good tactical choice model and excellent estimation of airspace user costs. Due to the inclusion of different stakeholders, including passengers, and various processes – like aircraft turnaround or passenger reaccommodation – it is able to catch European-wide network effects that are inaccessible to other models. It was used to study the 4DTA process, a blend of ‘wait for passengers and tactical speed adjustments’, which is shown to have a significant impact on the system. Thanks to the detailed output of the model, we are able to breakdown the effect for different classes of flights and passengers, and show that important trade-offs exist in terms of delays and costs. In particular, the introduction of such mechanism could be detrimental to non-connecting passengers, especially at secondary airports.",0968-090X,Not found
Freeway network design with exclusive lanes for automated vehicles under endogenous mobility demand,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103440,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Automated vehicles (AV) have the potential to provide cost-effective mobility options along with overall system-level benefits in terms of congestion and vehicular emissions. Additional resource allocation at the network level, such as AV-exclusive lanes, can further foster the usage of AVs rendering this mode of travel more attractive than legacy vehicles (LV). However, it is necessary to find the crucial locations in the network where providing these dedicated lanes would reap the maximum benefits. In this study, we propose an integrated mixed-integer programming framework for optimal AV-exclusive lane design on freeway networks which accounts for commuters’ demand split among AVs and LVs via a logit model incorporating class-based utilities. We incorporate the link transmission model (LTM) as the underlying traffic flow model due to its computational efficiency for system optimum dynamic traffic assignment. The LTM is modified to integrate two vehicle classes namely, LVs and AVs with a lane-based approach. The presence of binary variables to represent lane design and the logit model for endogenous demand estimation results in a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program formulation. We propose a Benders’ decomposition approach to tackle this challenging optimization problem. Our approach iteratively explores possible lane designs in the Benders’ master problem and, at each iteration, solves a sequence of system-optimum dynamic traffic assignment problems in an attempt to find fixed-points representative of logit-compatible demand splits. The proposed approach is implemented on three hypothetical freeway networks with single and multiple origins and destinations. Our numerical results reveal that the optimal lane design of freeway network is non-trivial while accounting for endogenous demand of each mode.",0968-090X,Not found
"Spatiotemporally heterogeneous willingness to ridesplitting and its relationship with the built environment: A case study in Chengdu, China",10.1016/j.trc.2021.103425,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The capability of ridesplitting service to address current urban transportation problems has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. Given that ridesplitting needs an adequate user base to realize “sharing”, its success highly depends on a comprehensive understanding of people’s willingness of using it. However, previous studies mainly focused on the ridesplitting willingness based on questionnaire surveys at the individual level, which may help transportation network companies find potential users, but lacked studies on people’s ridesplitting willingness from the perspective of the built environment and time-space integration, because the macro urban elements are difficult to be perceived by individuals and thus hard to reflect in questionnaires. Thus, this study estimates the ridesplitting willingness rate of different areas in a city at different times of the day by building a model on the shared order rate and shareability from the real-world DiDi Chuxing dataset, using Chengdu, China, as a case study. The spatial lag model (SLM) is further utilized to exam the relationship between the willingness rate, built environment and transportation-related variables. Results revealed the ridesplitting willingness rate has a significant spatiotemporal pattern between the urban centre and urban periphery and can be divided into morning peak, noon plateau, afternoon valley, night peak, and midnight valley. SLM models indicate that the ridesplitting willingness rate has a significant spatial dependency on its vicinity areas at the origin of the daytime periods or at the destination at night. The distance to urban centre, the distance to railway station, travel demand, accessibility to public transit, land use mixture, and the trip purpose are found to be the most relevant variables with the willingness rate, while the points of interest (POIs) are almost irrelevant. The findings of this study can be helpful to the future promotion of this sustainable service and formulation of policy to improve service quality.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal station locations for en-route charging of electric vehicles in congested intercity networks: A new problem formulation and exact and approximate partitioning algorithms,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103447,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This paper addresses a new electricity-charging station location problem for congested intercity or regional networks, in which electric vehicles with a limited driving range require recharges for their long-distance trips. When the distribution of charging stations does not sufficiently cover all used routes, some drivers may take a detour to find charging opportunities (or switch to another transportation mode). The goal of this station location problem is to find, under a limited construction budget, an optimal set of charging station locations such that all vehicles finish their trips by choosing a self-optimal route with necessary charging opportunities while the overall network congestion caused by possible detours is minimized. The problem is written as a bi-level mixed nonlinear integer programming model, where the upper level of the model is set to regulate the selection of station locations subject to the construction budget while the lower level is used to characterize the equilibrium flow pattern of electric vehicles with the charging requirement. Selected exact and approximate algorithms, namely, the branch-and-bound algorithm and the nested partitions algorithm are adopted to solve this station location problem. While both algorithms imply a divide-and-conquer strategy, the branch-and-bound algorithm poses a deterministic, exact procedure that utilizes the bounding mechanism to prune impossible solution subspaces, whereas the nested partitions algorithm performs a stochastic search and selection process in terms of the optimality probability for near-optimal solutions. To get numerical insights on the algorithmic performance and solution behavior, we test these algorithms through a couple of benchmark network instances. A performance comparison of the algorithms indicates that, the branch-and-bound algorithm can quickly obtain the global optimum when the driving range is relatively low, while the nested partitions algorithm can find optimal solutions or extremely near-optimal solutions in all cases and typically spend on average only one fourth of the computing time of the branch-and-bound algorithm. The network flow solutions clearly show, compared to gasoline vehicle drivers, how an insufficient driving range or number of charging stations may significantly reduce the number of feasible paths and force electric vehicle drivers to choose more costly paths, which thus reshapes flow patterns and possibly increases congestion levels.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling decentralized mandatory lane change for connected and autonomous vehicles: An analytical method,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103441,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Mandatory lane change (MLC) is the core of lane-specific motion planning for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).

This problem was rigorously formulated and solved by an analytical method that significantly decreases computational time and renders the methodology suitable for practical implementations. To evaluate the performance of the proposed DC-MLC framework, we built a CAV testing environment by referring to the next generation simulation program (NGSIM) US 101 dataset. A series of numerical experiments were conducted under the built CAV testing environment. The results showed that the proposed DC-MLC framework could achieve safe, traffic-efficient, and comfortable MLC maneuvers.

Optimal quality incentive scheme design in contracting out public bus services,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103427,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Designing appropriate quality incentives in contracting out public bus services is essential to ensure that cost savings are not pursued at the expense of deteriorating quality. This study investigates a practical incentive design problem that links additional rewards and penalties to quality indicators of bus services. A leader–follower game model is proposed in which the transit authority (leader) determines the quality baseline of each bus service as well as the marginal reward for outperformance and penalty for underperformance. Subject to a given amount of budget, the transit authority has to guarantee a minimum profit margin for each transit operator so that they have enough incentives to improve the service quality. As a response, the profit-maximizing transit operators (followers) determine the level of service quality by weighing the marginal revenue and cost involved. A tailored solution approach is devised by exploiting the model properties. Motivated by Singapore’s recent trial, a case study is presented to demonstrate how the transit authority can determine the performance baseline as well as the reward-penalty levels for a large bus network and evaluate the amount of public funds needed to achieve a targeted quality outcome. Our analysis also cautions that quality deterioration may surprisingly occur in a few bus services after introducing the incentive scheme. This may be attributed to an unreasonably strict quality baseline and/or an inefficient operator running that service. It is thus suggested that the authority should figure out the real contributing factors and fine-tune the incentive scheme accordingly.",0968-090X,Not found

A representation for jointly distributed continuous link travel times across the entire network with time-varying distributions and correlation structures is presented, and the crucial characteristics and methodological difficulties of the problem are discussed. The paper presents a generalized 2-stage path and strategy finding solution approach that can serve for finding both exact and approximate solutions with the tuning of a risk-level tolerance parameter. The first stage of the solution approach generates eligible paths, where the risk-level parameter is used to eliminate paths that are likely to be inefficient. The second stage finds reliable trajectory-adaptive strategies, using the eligible paths only, based on one or multiple reliability-based optimality conditions. Thus, the approach allows the user to determine the optimal strategy for one or multiple groups of travelers with different reliability preferences. Numerical experiments show that the average running time of the algorithm reduces super-linearly with the increase of the risk-tolerance parameter ∊ , while incurring some loss to the objective function relative to the exact solution. Thus, the heuristic can offer significant benefits in reducing the run time of the solution algorithm, while finding adaptive strategy solutions that consistently maintain better objective function values compared to the a priori (i.e., non-adaptive) solutions.",0968-090X,Not found

This paper focuses on providing a 3-dimensional (3D) simulation framework using a game-theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts using scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. In the proposed method, the human pilot interactive decision-making process is incorporated into airspace models which can fill the gap in the literature where the pilot behavior is generally assumed to be known a priori. The proposed human pilot behavior is modeled using a dynamic level-k reasoning concept and approximate reinforcement learning. The level-k reasoning concept is a notion in game theory and is based on the assumption that humans have various levels of decision making. In the conventional “static” approach, each agent makes assumptions about his or her opponents and chooses his or her actions accordingly. On the other hand, in the dynamic level-k reasoning, agents can update their beliefs about their opponents and revise their level-k rule. In this study, Neural Fitted Q Iteration, which is an approximate reinforcement learning method, is used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with 3D maneuvers.

Since the sequences of mixed traffic are combinatory, to reduce the training dimension and alleviate communication burdens, we decomposed mixed traffic into multiple subsystems where each subsystem is comprised of human-driven vehicles (HDV) followed by cooperative CAVs. Based on that, a cooperative CAV control strategy is developed based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, enabling CAVs to learn the leading HDV’s characteristics and make longitudinal control decisions cooperatively to improve the performance of each subsystem locally and consequently enhance performance for the whole mixed traffic flow. For training, a distributed proximal policy optimization is applied to ensure the training convergence of the proposed DRL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulated experiments are conducted, which shows the performance of our proposed model has a great generalization capability of dampening oscillations, fulfilling the car following and energy-saving tasks efficiently under different penetration rates and various leading HDVs behaviors.",0968-090X,Not found
Real-time decentralized traffic signal control for congested urban networks considering queue spillbacks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103407,133,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This paper proposes a decentralized network-level traffic signal control method addressing the effects of queue spillbacks. The method is traffic-responsive, does not require data communication between intersections’ controllers, uses lane-based queue measurements, and is acyclic. Each traffic controller operating at an intersection aims at maximizing the effective outflow rate locally and independently with the goal of maximizing global throughput of the entire network. At each intersection, the signal control method estimates and adopts the maximum possible phase time in which all active movements discharge at their full capacity. This is modeled using a shockwave based queue length estimation model while capturing the spillback at the downstream links. The method demands real-time data including, the queue lengths, the arrival flows, and the downstream queue lengths in all the lanes at the control decision times. The proposed method results in a feasible solution in all conditions in the entire network with any scale within a short amount of time. A stability concept for the traffic network is defined, and asymptotic stability of the controlled traffic network are verified.

Metropolitan areas are now seeking ways to mitigate emission and are heading towards sustainable ways of using clean/green energy sources by integrating and implementing new technology and science innovations into the transport systems. This study explores consumer preferences for installing photovoltaic solar cells on electric vehicles. In this paper, we have applied a double hurdle model to account for the low market penetration of electric cars in Australia and dealt with the high non-purchase choice. Data are obtained from nearly 1,900 individuals from eight major cities in Australia to explore consumer preferences regarding electric vehicles with photovoltaic solar cells option.

Optimization-based path-planning for connected and non-connected automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103487,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"A path-planning algorithm for connected and non-connected automated road vehicles on multilane motorways is derived from the opportune formulation of an optimal control problem. In this framework, the objective function to be minimized contains appropriate respective terms to reflect: the goals of vehicle advancement; passenger comfort; and avoidance of collisions with other vehicles and of road departures. Connectivity implies, within the present work, that connected vehicles can exchange with each other (V2V) real-time information about their last generated short-term path. For the numerical solution of the optimal control problem, an efficient feasible direction algorithm (FDA) is used. To ensure high-quality local minima, a simplified Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm is also conceived to deliver the initial guess trajectory for the start of the FDA iterations.

The proposed MPC-based approach is embedded within the Aimsun microsimulation platform, which enables the evaluation of a plethora of realistic vehicle driving and advancement scenarios under different vehicles mixes. Results obtained on a multilane motorway stretch indicate higher efficiency of the optimally controlled vehicles in driving closer to their desired speed, compared to ordinary manually driven vehicles. Increased penetration rates of automated vehicles are found to increase the efficiency of the overall traffic flow, benefiting manual vehicles as well.

Moreover, the likely effects of the introduction of such vehicles may not be necessarily positive. Thus, a careful analysis of their various impacts through well designed tools is needed. Main tools for transportation systems analysis are based on methods for travel demand assignment to a transportation network, commonly used to support transportation project assessment and evaluation. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a modelling approach to multi vehicle type assignment is proposed, in this approach the user choice proportions among vehicle types available to users are the results of an explicit choice behaviour model instead of input data as in all existing papers on multi-vehicle assignment. This approach is applied for analysing assignment to transportation networks including Fixed-Point models for equilibrium assignment and Deterministic and Stochastic Process models for day-to-to dynamic assignment. Second, statistical methods are introduced to study the bifurcation of SP models, in order to account for the stochasticity of such models. In particular, the Hartigan’s Dip statistic, which measure the degree of unimodality of a distribution, showed to be the most effective one in identifying bifurcation in SP models. Fixed-point stability and bifurcation analysis are carried out too, and some simple numerical examples are also discussed. Reported results show that innovative vehicles with less impact on congestion than traditional ones may not have a positive effect on equilibrium stability since negative effect of reducing route choice dispersion may be compensate the positive effects on congestion.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic optimal congestion pricing in multi-region urban networks by application of a Multi-Layer-Neural network,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103485,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Traffic management by applying congestion pricing is a measure for mitigating congestion in protected city corridors.

This work uses real-time dynamic pricing’s influence and predicts pricing functions to aim for a system optimal traffic distribution. The framework models a large-scale network where every region is considered homogeneous, allowing for the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) application. We compute Dynamic System Optimum (DSO) and Dynamic Route Choice (DRC) of the macroscopic model by formulating a linear optimization problem and utilizing the Dijkstra algorithm and a Multinomial Logit model (MNL), respectively.

Unveiling route choice strategy heterogeneity from smart card data in a large-scale public transport network,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103467,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"We contribute to the understanding of public transport passenger route choice behavior by developing and applying methods that capture behavioral strategies by making use of smart card data. We begin by proposing the classification of possible route choice behavioral strategies in two groups: disaggregated strategies and aggregated strategies. In the former, the alternatives correspond to itineraries, which are fixed sequences of stops and public transport lines. In the latter, common line alternatives are considered, which are combinations of itineraries defined under given criteria. Almost all route choice models use consideration sets composed only of itineraries, while public transport assignment models for strategic analysis mostly use a version of the common lines approach. We postulate that this dichotomy is inappropriate and that, instead, heterogeneity exists in the route choice strategy, both between users and across contexts. With the aim of verifying this hypothesis, we first propose an indicator function constructed as the difference between expected and observed trips for a given behavioral assumption. We apply then the indicator to a case study based on smart card data from the city of Santiago, Chile, from which we find evidence of heterogeneity. We identify individuals that follow either an aggregated or a disaggregated strategy, as well as others who seem to be using a combination of both strategies. We further analyze the heterogeneity hypothesis using an integrated discrete choice and latent class approach, which we apply to the same case study. This approach involves estimating path-size logit models built with alternatives from disaggregated and aggregated strategies, as well as a latent class model built from a combination of both. It also addresses methodological challenges related to the definition of the consideration set and the correction of endogeneity. Results confirm the heterogeneity hypothesis, suggesting that the mean probability that passengers belong to the class that uses a disaggregated strategy for route choice is 51.2%, and that this heterogeneity markedly occurs between individuals, not within their choices. We also find that the latent class considering aggregated alternatives appear to prefer bus over metro, while the latent class considering disaggregated alternatives prefer metro over bus. The fact that waiting time is relatively more burdensome for the aggregated strategy class is in line with this class’s preference for common lines. Walking time and bus crowding are more burdensome for the disaggregated strategy class, in line with their observed modal preferences.",0968-090X,Not found

In this suggestion-based control framework, the CAVs are considered to provide suggestion commands to the HDVs to follow. These suggestion commands are the velocities the CAVs want the HDVs to follow to improve their own, as well as the group’s fuel economy. The host CAV thus needs to find its own fuel-efficient control solution, as well as the suggestion commands to be provided to its preceding HDV. We assume the CAVs can communicate with the HDVs via Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication, and the Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) information are available to the CAVs through Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication. The suggested velocity commands are held constant for a predefined time to allow the driver in the HDV to reach the suggested velocity. We also consider that the suggested velocity commands are non binding, i.e., a driver can choose not to follow the suggested velocity. For this control framework to function, we present a velocity prediction model based on experimental data that captures the response of a HDV to different suggested-commands, and a robust approach to ensure collision avoidance. The velocity prediction’s accuracy is also validated with the experimental data (on a table-top drive simulator), and the results are presented in this paper.

A practical approach to assignment-free Dynamic Origin–Destination Matrix Estimation problem,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103477,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Dynamic traffic models require dynamic inputs, one of the main ones being the Dynamic Origin–Destinations (OD) matrices describing the variability over time of the trip patterns across the network. The Dynamic OD Matrix Estimation (DODME) is a challenging problem since no direct observations are available, and therefore one should resort to indirect estimation approaches. Among the most efficient approaches, the one that formulates the problem in terms of a bi-level optimization problem has been widely used. This formulation solves at the upper level a nonlinear optimization problem that minimizes some distance measures between observed and estimated link flow counts at certain counting stations located in a subset of links in the network, and at the lower level a traffic assignment that estimates these link flow counts assigning the current estimated matrix. The variants of this formulation differ in the analytical approaches that estimate the link flows in terms of the traffic assignment and their time dependencies. Since these estimations are based on a traffic assignment at the lower level, these analytical approaches, although numerically efficient, imply a high computational cost. The advent of ICT applications has made available new sets of traffic-related measurements enabling new approaches; under certain conditions, the data collected allows to estimate the most likely used paths, from which a de facto assignment matrix can be computed. This allows extracting empirically similar information to that provided by the dynamic traffic assignment that is used in the analytical approaches. This paper explores how to extract such information from the recorded commercial data, proposes a new constrained non-linear optimization model to solve the DODME problem, with a reduced number of variables linearly depending on network size instead of quadratically.

The paper first presents a state-of-the-art overview for freeway TSE with mixed sensing, focusing on a few critical issues such as filtering methods, Eulerian and Lagrangian formulation for traffic flow modeling/sensing/estimation, OMPE, and fusion of disparate sensing data, to determine the strengths and weaknesses of various technical paths, and figure out a viable roadmap for future studies. Three representative approaches to the design of freeway traffic state estimators using mixed sensing data are then investigated, which are based on a first-order, a second-order traffic flow model, and a speed-uniformity assumption, respectively. The paper intends to check if the gradual richness of mobile sensing data (in the era of connected vehicles) would compensate the deficiency of first-order models (as compared to second-order models) for TSE; if OMPE would still be essential for TSE in the mixed sensing case compared to the fixed sensing case; if the increasing usage of mobile sensing data would reduce the necessity of OMPE for TSE? The designed traffic state estimators have been evaluated thoroughly using NGSIM data, with the above questions answered.",0968-090X,Not found
Comfortable and energy-efficient speed control of autonomous vehicles on rough pavements using deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103489,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Rough pavements cause ride discomfort and energy inefficiency for road vehicles. Existing methods to address these problems are time-consuming and not adaptive to changing driving conditions on rough pavements. With the development of sensor and communication technologies, crowdsourced road and dynamic traffic information become available for enhancing driving performance, particularly addressing the discomfort and inefficiency issues by controlling driving speeds. This study proposes a speed control framework on rough pavements, envisioning the operation of autonomous vehicles based on the crowdsourced data. We suggest the concept of ‘maximum comfortable speed’ for representing the vertical ride comfort of oncoming roads. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed to learn comfortable and energy-efficient speed control strategies. The DRL-based speed control model is trained using real-world rough pavement data in Shanghai, China. The experimental results show that the vertical ride comfort, energy efficiency, and computation efficiency increase by 8.22%, 24.37%, and 94.38%, respectively, compared to an optimization-based speed control model. The results indicate that the proposed framework is effective for real-time speed controls of autonomous vehicles on rough pavements.",0968-090X,Not found
Fundamental diagrams of commercial adaptive cruise control: Worldwide experimental evidence,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103458,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Experimental measurements on commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are becoming increasingly available from around the world, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the traffic flow characteristics that arise from this technology. This paper adds new experimental evidence to this knowledge base and presents a comprehensive empirical study on the ACC equilibrium behaviors via the resulting fundamental diagrams. We find that, like human-driven vehicles, ACC systems display a linear equilibrium spacing-speed relationship (within the range of available data) but the key parameters of these relationships can differ significantly from human-driven traffic depending on input settings. At the minimum ACC headway setting, equilibrium capacities in excess of 3500 vehicles per hour are observed, together with an extremely fast equilibrium wave speed of 100 kilometers per hour. These fast waves are unfamiliar to human drivers, and may pose a safety risk. The results also suggest that ACC jam spacing can be much larger than in human traffic, which reduces the network storage capacity.",0968-090X,Not found
DDP-GCN: Multi-graph convolutional network for spatiotemporal traffic forecasting,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103466,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Traffic speed forecasting is one of the core problems in transportation systems. For a more accurate prediction, recent studies started using not only the temporal speed patterns but also the spatial information on the road network through the graph convolutional networks. Even though the road network is highly complex due to its non-Euclidean and directional characteristics, previous approaches mainly focused on modeling the spatial dependencies using the distance only. In this paper, we identify two essential spatial dependencies in traffic forecasting in addition to distance, direction and positional relationship, for designing basic graph elements as the fundamental building blocks. Using the building blocks, we suggest DDP-GCN (Distance, Direction, and Positional relationship Graph Convolutional Network) to incorporate the three spatial relationships into deep neural networks. We evaluate the proposed model with two large-scale real-world datasets, and find positive improvements for long-term forecasting in highly complex urban networks.

On the estimation of traffic speeds with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks given probe data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103448,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This paper studies Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for the accurate estimation of space–time traffic speeds given sparse data on freeways. Several aspects are highlighted which are crucial for the large-scale application of DCNNs to empirical probe data. (i) A methodology is proposed that allows to effectively train DCNNs on variable-sized space–time domains given empirical data prone to a varying penetration rate. Therefore, space–time domains are decomposed into small unified grids, which are processed separately. Second, in order to cope with varying penetration rates of available probe data, the network input is designed as two input matrices: grid-based speed data and grid occupancies. (ii) Using empirical probe data collected during 43 congestion scenarios on a freeway of 143 km length a shallow encoding–decoding CNN and a deep CNN are trained to reconstruct heterogeneous congestion types, such as moving and stationary congestion. It is demonstrated that for training only data of a single sparse data source is needed but no complete Ground Truth (GT), and still heterogeneous congestion types are reconstructed accurately. (iii) The estimation accuracy of a shallow encoding–decoding CNN and a DCNN, based on the U-net, are compared with traditional methods such as the ASM and PSM. An unseen complex congestion scenario is studied with all approaches and the estimation results are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.

A context-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework for automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103453,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"With the unprecedented shift towards automated urban environments in recent years, a new paradigm is required to study pedestrian behaviour. Studying pedestrian behaviour in futuristic scenarios requires modern data sources that consider both the Automated Vehicle (AV) and pedestrian perspectives. Current open datasets on AVs predominantly fail to account for the latter, as they do not include an adequate number of events and associated details that involve pedestrian and vehicle interactions. To address this issue, we propose using Virtual Reality (VR) data as a complementary resource to current datasets, which can be designed to measure pedestrian behaviour under specific conditions. In this research, we focus on the context-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework for automated vehicles at mid-block unsignalized crossings. For this purpose, we develop a novel multi-input network of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and fully connected dense layers. In addition to past trajectories, the proposed framework incorporates pedestrian head orientations and distance to the upcoming vehicles as sequential input data. By merging the sequential data with contextual information of the environment, we train a model to predict the future pedestrian trajectory. Our results show that the prediction error is reduced by considering contextual information extracted from the crossing environment, as well as the addition of time-series behavioural information to the model. To analyse the application of the methods to real AV data, the proposed framework is trained and applied to pedestrian trajectories extracted from an open-access video dataset. Finally, by implementing a game theory-based model interpretability method, we provide detailed insights and propose recommendations to improve the current automated vehicle sensing systems from a pedestrian-oriented point of view.",0968-090X,https://github.com/jiachenli94/Awesome-Interaction-Aware-Trajectory-Prediction

A virtual procedure for real-time monitoring of intervisibility between conflicting agents at intersections using point cloud and trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103486,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"A new procedure is developed for effectively monitoring intervisibility between conflicting agents in real-time at intersections. Dense light detection and ranging (Lidar) point clouds and time-stamped trajectory data are used to model static intersection environment and emulate traffic participants’ dynamic motion states, respectively. The proposed procedure reads trajectory data in sequence according to their timestamps. An agent-based approach that enables the application of multi-core parallel computing is applied to estimate conflict points and identify conflicting agents in pairs. Then, a linear elevation array is created from the Lidar point cloud data, based on which the elevation of each trajectory point is obtained in a real-time manner. Meanwhile, three-dimensional bounding cuboids are generated at each path point to represent digital twins of agents. Once a pair of conflicting agents are identified, a hybrid approach is triggered to examine whether the agents’ line-of-sights are occluded by either static (e.g., tree trunk) or dynamic obstacles (e.g., cars). Accordingly, virtual warning signals can be generated. The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated through controlled experiments. The procedure was also tested in two virtual scenarios. The mean processing time at each frame is less than 0.1 s as achieved with limited computational power. With implementation of parallel computing technique, processing time is not sensitive to number of agents within the intersection.

Do autonomous vehicles drive like humans? A Turing approach and an application to SAE automation Level 2 cars,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103499,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Fully automated vehicles (AVs) are set to become a reality in future decades and changes are to be expected in user perceptions and behavior. While AV acceptability has been widely studied, changes in human drivers’ behavior and in passengers’ reactions have received less attention. It is not yet possible to ascertain the risk of driver behavioral changes such as overreaction, and the corresponding safety problems, in mixed traffic with partially AVs. Nor has there been proper investigation of the potential unease of car occupants trained for human control, when exposed to automatic maneuvers. The conjecture proposed in this paper is that automation Level 2 vehicles do not induce potentially adverse effects in traditional vehicle drivers’ behavior or in occupants’ reactions, provided that they are indistinguishable from human-driven vehicles. To this end, the paper proposes a Turing approach to test the “humanity” of automation Level 2 vehicles. The proposed test was applied to the results of an experimental campaign carried out in Italy: 546 car passengers were interviewed on board Level 2 cars in which they could not see the driver. They were asked whether a specific driving action (braking, accelerating, lane keeping) had been performed by the human driver or by the automatic on-board software under different traffic conditions (congestion and speed). Estimation results show that in most cases the interviewees were unable to distinguish the Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the human driver by observing random responses with a 95% significance level (proportion of success statistically equal to 50%). However, in the case of moderate braking and lane keeping at >100 km/h and in high traffic congestion, respondents recognized AI control from the human driver above pure chance, with 62–69% correct response rates. These findings, if confirmed in other case studies, could significantly impact on AVs acceptability, also contributing to their design as well as to long-debated ethical questions. AI driving software could be designed and tested for “humanity”, as long as safety is guaranteed, and autonomous cars could be allowed to circulate as long as they cannot be distinguished from human-driven vehicles in recurrent driving conditions.",0968-090X,Not found
An Integrated Simulation Environment to test the effectiveness of GLOSA services under different working conditions,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103455,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system is a Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) that is supposed to reduce the energy consumption and travel time associated with a vehicle trip by providing an optimal speed profile to avoid unnecessary stops at an intersection, based on Traffic Light Signals (TLSs) information. It is expected that GLOSA solutions will be widely deployed on transportation networks, thanks to the rapid spread of increasingly effective and pervasive communication technologies. Thus, appropriate methodologies and tools should be adopted to test sustainability objectives and evaluate the effects of such systems on the performance of traffic networks. In this perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced testing approach of GLOSA services based on an Integrated Simulation Environment that combines custom models developed in Matlab/Simulink with the SUMO traffic simulation environment, allowing both the traffic environment and vehicle dynamics to be represented with a suitable level of detail. The proposed approach can be used to cover several aspects which, in the existing technical literature, are: ( i ) not considered (traffic signal phase condition); ( i i ) rarely considered (electric engine); ( i i i ) considered in a non-integrated way (traffic condition, TLS cycle duration, communication distance and minimum speed). Indeed, the considered factors pertain to different subsystems of the mobility environment (network and vehicles), and the proposed testing framework allows an equally detailed simulation of all, thus enhancing the accuracy of the results. To show the validity of the proposed approach, this study considers one controlled vehicle, equipped with a GLOSA system, travelling along a single route through a city centre including many TLSs. The simulation analysis deals with different levels of considered factors, assessed through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to mobility and environmental indicators. Numerical results confirm that the proposed Integrated Simulation Environment can give valuable insights and suggestions to design a GLOSA system aiming to enhance both mobility and environmental performance.

Then, a risk aware decision making algorithm was proposed to find a strategy with the minimum expected risk using deep reinforcement learning.

A single-layer approach for joint optimization of traffic signals and cooperative vehicle trajectories at isolated intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103459,134,2022-01-01,2022,1,"A joint control approach that simultaneously optimizes traffic signals and trajectories of cooperative (automated) vehicle platooning at urban intersections is presented in this paper. In the proposed approach, the signal phase lengths and the accelerations of the controlled platoons are optimized to maximize comfort and minimize travel delay within the signal cycle, subject to motion constraints on speeds, accelerations and safe following gaps. The red phases are initially considered as logic constraints, and then recast as several linear constraints to enable efficient solutions. The proposed approach is solved by mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques after linearization of the objective function. The generated outputs of the MILP problem are the optimal signal timings and the optimal accelerations of all vehicles. This joint control approach is flexible in incorporating multiple platoons and traffic movements under different traffic demand levels and it does not require prespecified terminal conditions on position and speed at the signal cycle tail. The performance of the proposed control approach is verified by simulation at a standard four-arm intersection under the balanced and unbalanced vehicle arrival rates from different arms, taking the released traffic movement numbers, turning proportions, signal cycle lengths and the controlled vehicle numbers into account. The simulation results demonstrate the platoon performance of the joint controller (such as split, merge, acceleration and deceleration maneuvers) under the optimal signals. Based on the simulation results, the optimal patterns of trajectories and signals are explored, which provide insights into the optimal traffic control actions at intersections in a cooperative vehicle environment. Furthermore, the computational performance of the proposed control approach is analyzed, and the benefits of the proposed approach on the average travel delay, throughput, fuel consumption, and emission are proved by comparing with the two-layer approaches using the car following model, the signal optimization models, and the state-of-the-art approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal pricing for bidirectional wireless charging lanes in coupled transportation and power networks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103419,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on transportation and power networks. Using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, EVs can operate as additional energy storage sources that make the power grid more efficient and reliable. With their onboard battery, EVs can relocate energy supply spatially and temporally. In this study, we envision that the future deployment of bidirectional charging lanes is capable of transferring power wirelessly and bidirectionally in regional road networks. Additionally, in this study, these futuristic bidirectional charging lanes are controlled by a government agency that manages both transportation and power systems. The government agency attempts to minimize total system costs by using an electricity pricing scheme to buy energy from and sell energy to EVs, which can be modeled as a bi-level optimization problem. In this study, we developed a new user equilibrium (UE) model to depict the equilibrium conditions in a road network in which bidirectional charging lanes are deployed. When traveling between their origin and destination, EV drivers are assumed to select routes and decide on battery charging/discharging plans to minimize their trip costs while ensuring the completion of their trips without running out of range. Trip costs consist of trip travel time and the purchase price of electricity minus the benefits of discharging energy to the power grid. Having established UE conditions, we next formulated the equilibrium conditions of a transportation network coupled with an electricity network as a non-linear complementarity system, which formed our lower-level problem. In such a network, the agency tries to provide energy to both networks with the objective of minimizing total system costs. To formulate the agency’s decision-making process, an additional layer of optimization is added on top of the coupled networks, which is our upper-level problem. This layer minimizes the total travel time and the price of electricity paid to EVs and generators. Next, to efficiently solve the model, a meta-heuristic solution algorithm based on gray wolf optimizer and manifold sub-optimization was developed. The model and the solution algorithm were evaluated based on three different numerical examples. Numerical results demonstrate that bidirectional charging lanes have significant potential to reduce peak load and charging costs associated with EVs.",0968-090X,Not found

Because APSs can shuttle back and forth through the intersection, the routing problem for APSs is modeled first.

Passenger-oriented traffic management integrating perimeter control and regional bus service frequency setting using 3D-pMFD,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103529,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Public buses and private vehicles are two main transportation modes for urban road traffic. It has strong flow interactions between the two traffic modes. From data analysis, the vehicle density of a traffic mode not only determine its flow, but also affect the flow of the other mode. With such mixed vehicle flows, the application of traditional traffic management that controls each vehicle flow system separately is limited. Thus, it is beneficial to control both bus and private vehicle flows in an integrated way. Under such bi-modal traffic management, the network efficiency cannot be reflected by vehicle flows since the occupancies of the traffic modes are greatly different. It leads to that the control objective should be necessarily based on passengers. To do so, we adopt bi-modal passenger-based macroscopic fundamental diagram (3D-pMFD) to capture the relations among vehicle accumulations and the total passenger flow in a network. From this aggregate perspective, a passenger-oriented traffic control strategy is proposed by integrating the perimeter control and the regional bus service frequency setting. The characteristics of both traffic modes, especially the operation strategy of buses, are taken into account in the model to describe the bi-modal traffic flow dynamics. A control framework comprised of optimization and simulation is established using model predictive control. The corresponding passenger-based optimization problem is solved by a modified genetic algorithm. With multiple data collected from the network of Shenzhen City in China, numerical experiments are designed to verify the validity and efficiency of the proposed integrated control strategy. Results show that: (1) the proposed strategy can maintain a high level of passenger flow during peak hour with a relatively high demand; (2) the interest of private vehicles is guaranteed even if buses are more recommended in the control strategy; (3) the crowding degree in a bus is reduced properly, which is able to improve the attraction of buses during peak hours; and (4) the proposed passenger-oriented objective results in a comprehensively good performance of the bi-modal network system.",0968-090X,Not found

Furthermore, the earnings and reservation wages of ride-sourcing car drivers are heterogeneous and follow continuous distributions. We mathematically prove the existence and stability of the stationary point of the model and the equivalence between the stationary point and the equilibrium point. Numerical results show that there may be multiple stationary points in the system, which show a positive correlation characteristic. The evolution trajectories of the system from different initial points may converge to different stationary points, and a lager (smaller) initial number of users using a service platform can result in more (fewer) users and higher (lower) profits of the service platform at the stationary state. When the two platforms provide the same service level to users, setting the same price level may not make their profits simultaneously maximum at the stationary state.

However, they raise a lot of concerns for their impact on congestion, Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), and competition with transit. There are also questions about their long-term survival because of inherent inefficiencies in their operations. Considering the popularity of the MoD services, increasing ride-pooling is an important means to address these concerns. Shareability depends not only on riders’ attitudes and preferences but also on operating models deployed by providers. The paper introduces an advance requests operating model for ride pooling, users may request rides in advance of their desired departure times. A platform with efficient algorithms for request matching, vehicle routing, rebalancing, and flexible user preferences is developed. Data from Chengdu, China, and New York, United States are used to evaluate the performance of the advance requests system.

The sensitivity of the results to user preferences in terms of the level of service (time to be served and excess trip time), willingness to share and place requests in advance, and traffic conditions are explored. The results suggest that significant benefits in terms of sustainability, level of service, and fleet utilization can be realized when advance requests are along with an increased willingness to share.

Subline frequency setting for autonomous minibusses under demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103492,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Over the last years, there have been initiated several pilots with autonomous minibusses. Unlike regular bus services, autonomous minibusses serve a limited number of stops and have more flexible schedules since they do not require bus drivers. This allows the operation of a line through a flexible combination of sublines, where a subline serves a subset of consecutive stops in the same order as the original line. This paper studies the subline frequency setting (SFS) problem under uncertain passenger demand. We present a frequency setting model that assigns autonomous minibusses to sublines in order to exploit the available resources as much as possible and minimize the operational and passenger waiting time costs. Passenger waiting time costs may depend on the combination of several lines whose frequencies cannot be perfectly aligned for each passenger journey. We present a new estimation of the expected waiting time for passengers to improve the accuracy of the passenger waiting time costs in the case of sublines. Our SFS model is originally formulated as a MINLP and reformulated as a MILP that can be solved to global optimality. Further, we explicitly consider the uncertainty of passenger demand in the optimization process by formulating a stochastic optimization model. The performances of our stochastic and deterministic models that assign minibusses to sublines are tested under various passenger demand scenarios in the 14-stop autonomous minibus line in Eberbach, Germany and a fictional bus line with 20 bus stops. Results show potential improvements in operational costs in the range of 10%–40% depending on the passenger demand profile.",0968-090X,Not found
Double-type player games and proportional cross-evaluation allocation method for collaborative logistics,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103517,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"In collaborative logistics, multiple shippers may collaborate with each other by consolidating their transportation requests and negotiate a contract with a single carrier to serve the requests at a favorable tariff. In this collaboration, agents of one type (the shippers) cannot increase their payoffs without the participation of an agent of the other type (the carrier). One key issue for such collaboration is the cost allocation among the shippers. Motivated by this real need, we introduce a new class of games called double-type player games and propose a cost/payoff allocation method for them. Each double-type player game has two types of players or agents: service requestors and service providers. We prove that the core of any game in this class is not empty and apply the concept of cross-evaluation originating from data envelopment analysis to generate a fair cost/payoff allocation among the players in such a game. More particularly, we propose a new and simple method called proportional cross-evaluation method for generating an allocation in the semi-core with some important properties. It is based on self-evaluation and peer-evaluations of the contribution of each player to the grand coalition. As applications, this method is applied to the cost allocation of double-type player games appearing in shipper collaboration in both truckload transportation and less-than-truckload transportation. It is compared with several popularly used allocation methods by numerical experiments.

Learning-based restoration sequence ordering for multi-site traffic signal failure,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103522,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Traffic signal failures could result in significant local and system-level performance degradation. Sequencing the restoration of failed signals with limited resources is a challenging problem—capturing dynamic changing transportation system performance following a feasible solution requires tedious computation, and the short time frame for restoring failed signals makes these decisions time-sensitive and should be determined in a timely manner. Feasible Signal Restoration Sequence Ordering (SRSO) problem, as a critical building block to optimize the restoration sequence, has not been well-studied in the existing literature, nor have solutions to address the computational burden issue. In this work, a machine learning model based on Structural Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) is proposed to predict system performance, i.e., aggregated accumulated total delay, following a given restoration sequence, to address the computational burden of the simulation-based performance evaluation. Spatio-temporal (ST) graph representation is leveraged in this methodology to take the topological information, i.e., how adjacent movements interact with each other, into consideration. Although microscopic simulation is used to obtain the ground truth performance, which is still time-consuming for a group of signal failure scenarios, a trained machine learning model can surrogate the tedious computation in the decision-making process in a timely manner. The challenges to build this machine learning model effectively and efficiently are two-folds. First, a transportation system is a typical dynamic system whose behavior is constrained by the topology of the network. Therefore, both spatial and temporal interactions between road sections should be captured to predict system performance effectively. Second, in the context of signal failure, system performance is exposed to a disrupted control strategy, which makes it even more challenging to predict system performance effectively. The original SRNN model could address the first challenge, and the movement feature representation and its integration to the SRNN model proposed in this work could address the second. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the operability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. It is demonstrated that the signal restoration sequence could impact system performance during and after the restoration process significantly. Then, both Aggregated Accumulated Total Delay (AATD) prediction accuracy and the performance of restoration sequence ordering is evaluated for the case study network. Outcomes of the case study show that the learning-based model can help identify sequences ranked in top 8% of optional sequences referring to ground truth information. Furthermore, in terms of the fine-tune of the learning rate, the Cosine-Annealing-LR strategy leads to both lower loss value, better ordering performance, and shorter delay experienced in the restoration process, compared to the Step-LR strategy.",0968-090X,Not found
Transitional behavioral intention to use autonomous electric car-sharing services: Evidence from four European countries,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103516,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Electric car-sharing services (ECS) have been promoted as a solution to combat negative urban mobility externalities and are expected to be facilitated by fleets of autonomous vehicles. There is little evidence regarding the behavioral intention to use autonomous ECS (AECS), especially on the transition from using ECS. This paper investigates the behavioral intention to use AECS using psychological constructs partially from the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and an additional one expressing safety concern. A novel behavioral intention model is presented to capture the transitional behavioral intention to use two adjacent generations of sharing mobility services. Results of structural equation models applied to a survey sample of 2154 respondents from France, Italy, Netherlands, and Spain show that the introduction of AECS is very likely to be accepted by ECS users. Hedonic motivation is found to be a much stronger predictor of behavioral intention to use AECS as opposed to safety concern, while performance expectancy and social influence are strong drivers of intention to use ECS and have indirect effects on the intention to use AECS. Multigroup analysis indicates heterogeneous behavioral intention across countries. The multi-faceted empirical results generate insights into the deployment and management of AECS in various contexts.",0968-090X,Not found
Traffic congestion propagation inference using dynamic Bayesian graph convolution network,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103526,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Congestion, whether recurrent or non-recurrent, propagates through the road network. The process of congestion propagation from a particular road to its neighbors can be regarded as a kind of message passing with a directed relationship. Existing methods have created a solid foundation for characterizing congestion propagation; however, they are either built upon simplified assumptions in traffic flow theory or predefined relationships among road sections, which would lead to downgraded accuracy in practice. This paper proposes a dynamic Bayesian graph convolutional network (DBGCN), which integrates Bayesian inference into a deep learning framework. Therefore, the rules of congestion propagation in the network can be actively learned from the observed data instead of predefining them based on prior knowledge. Experimental results on 971 testbeds in a regional road network in Beijing demonstrate that DBGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art models in inferring the congestion propagation spatiotemporal coverage and reveals variations in congestion propagation patterns according to the road network structure. Furthermore, the proposed model can simulate the congestion propagation process in customized scenarios by learning the latent congestion propagation rules. The results in different scenarios show that the change of congestion source location leads to distinct congestion magnitude, and the propagation of congestion will eventually stop at the road sections with strong shunting effect.",0968-090X,https://github.com/jwwthu/GNN4Traffic

E-scooter sharing and bikesharing systems: An individual-level analysis of factors affecting first-use and use frequency,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103515,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Shared micromobility modes have increasingly penetrated the mobility environment of cities in the U.S. and the world over. At the same time, to best integrate these emerging modes within the fabric of the existing (and larger) transportation ecosystem, it is critical to understand how individuals may respond and “who” the likely users of these relatively new modes may be. In this paper, we develop a model to analyze first-use and use frequency of two micromobility modes: E-scooter sharing systems (ESS) and Bike sharing systems (BSS). The model employs psycho-social constructs, built environment attributes, as well as individual-level demographics as determinants. In doing so, we explicitly recognize the role played by awareness/first-use of new technologies as a cognitive antecedent to subsequent frequency decisions. The main data source for this analysis is drawn from a 2019 survey of Austin, Texas area residents. Our results highlight the importance of considering psycho-social attitudes to both gain better insights into the behavioral process leading up to ESS/BSS adoption/use as well as ensure an accurate data fit. In particular, there are distinctive pathways of adoption/use frequency for each of the ESS and BSS modes, but also complementary processes and behavioral spillover effects at play that warrant a joint modeling of the ESS and BSS modes. Our results suggest that addressing safety concerns of micromobility modes should be the top priority of providers and public agencies. Efforts solely directed toward extoling the “green” virtues of micromobility modes is likely to have limited returns.",0968-090X,Not found
Analysis of cooperative driving strategies at road network level with macroscopic fundamental diagram,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103503,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Cooperative driving, especially the passing order, is the critical link to improve the traffic efficiency of the road network by using automated vehicles (AVs).

In this paper, we will focus on the performance of the passing orders derived from different cooperative driving strategies on the network traffic through a series of simulation experiments. Meanwhile, we will compare the impacts of the passing order at intersections and the car-following gap in straight links on the network traffic efficiency. The experiments results show that the passing order has a dominant impact on the network traffic efficiency, and a better order can significantly raise the curve of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD); due to the inevitable conflicts in the two-dimensional traffic, the choice of the car-following gap within a reasonable range has a relatively small improvement on the network traffic efficiency.

Shared-phase-dedicated-lane based intersection control with mixed traffic of human-driven vehicles and connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103509,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) are expected to coexist in the near future. CAV-dedicated lanes and phases have been explored to handle the uncertainty in the driving behavior of HVs in the mixed traffic environment. However, CAV-dedicated phases could significantly sacrifice HV benefits. This study proposes a shared-phase-dedicated-lane (SPDL)-based traffic control model at an isolated intersection with CAV dedicated lanes in the mixed traffic environment. In the proposed model, left-turn and through CAVs share CAV-dedicated lanes and cross the intersection during the shared phases with HVs. A three-level optimization model is developed. At the upper level, a standard NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) ring barrier structure is used for the signal optimization and barrier durations are optimized by dynamic programming to minimize the total vehicle delay. At the middle level, phase sequences and phase durations are optimized by enumeration for the given barrier from the upper level and the minimum vehicle delay is fed to the upper level. At the lower level, CAV platooning in the buffer zone and trajectory planning in the passing zone are conducted based on the signal timings of the barrier from the middle level and the travel time of CAVs is fed to the middle level. A rolling-horizon scheme is designed for the dynamical implementation of the proposed model with time-varying traffic conditions. The proposed model is applicable to intersections with more than two lanes in each approach and without shared lanes by left-turn and through HVs, which are commonly seen critical intersections in urban traffic control. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the SPDL-based control over the blue-phase-based control in previous studies in terms of average vehicle delay and intersection capacity.

Deep reinforcement learning based path stretch vector resolution in dense traffic with uncertainties,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103463,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"With the continuous growth in the air transportation demand, air traffic controllers will have to handle increased traffic and consequently, more potential conflicts. This gives rise to the need for conflict resolution advisory tools that can perform well in high-density traffic scenarios given a noisy environment. Unlike model-based approaches, learning-based approaches can take advantage of historical traffic data and flexibly encapsulate environmental uncertainty. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that is capable of resolving conflicts, in the presence of traffic and inherent uncertainties in conflict resolution maneuvers, without the need for prior knowledge about a set of rules mapping from conflict scenarios to expected actions. The conflict resolution task is formulated as a decision-making problem in a large and complex action space. The research also includes the development of a learning environment, scenario state representation, reward function, and a reinforcement learning algorithm inspired from Q-learning and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithms. The proposed algorithm, with two stages decision-making process, is used to train an agent that can serves as an advisory tool for air traffic controllers in resolving air traffic conflicts where it can learn from historical data by evolving overtime. Our findings show that the proposed model gives the agent the capability to suggest high quality conflict resolutions under different environmental conditions. It outperforms two baseline algorithms. The trained model has high performance under low uncertainty level (success rate ≥ 95 % ) and medium uncertainty level (success rate ≥ 87 % ) with high traffic density. The detailed analysis of different impact factors such as environment’s uncertainty and traffic density on learning performance are investigated and discussed. The environment’s uncertainty is the most important factor which affects the performance.

A reservation and allocation model for shared-parking addressing the uncertainty in drivers’ arrival/departure time,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103484,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Various solutions have been proposed to alleviate the shortage of parking places, including parking reservation systems and shared-parking systems. In such systems, drivers submit their parking requests in advance, especially their arrival and departure time. Then, the systems will reserve a proper parking spot for a driver if his/her parking request is accepted. However, the driver may arrive earlier or depart later, which may cause service failure. In shared-parking systems, the distributions of commuters’ arrival/departure time have fixed patterns and may be learned based on historical data. Given the distributions of drivers’ arrival/departure time, this paper proposes a Chance-constraint optimization model to solve the reservation and allocation problem for the shared-parking platform. This model aims to maximize the parking utilization level (i.e., the expectation of total occupied parking hours) and keep the service failure rate below a threshold value. We propose a rule-based mixed-integer linear programming to seek a satisfying solution to this model.

Study of automated shuttle interactions in city traffic using surrogate measures of safety,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103465,135,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Driving automation is happening at a rapid pace, with different driver assistance systems already available in mass-market cars. However, this rapid development in driving automation leads to concerns and questions about their impact on safety. While previous studies have been restricted to incident reports and simulation tools, the safety of automated vehicles (AVs) has not been clearly demonstrated independently from their developers and proponents. Instead of crashes, which are extremely rare events, this study uses surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) to analyze the interactions between road users and low-speed automated shuttles that circulated in Montreal and Candiac, in Canada, during two pilot projects in mid and late 2019. Cameras were placed at seven intersections along the routes of the shuttles. More than 70 hours of footage were processed to extract the road user trajectories using computer vision techniques and compute various safety indicators: speed and acceleration at the road user level, time headway, time-to-collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET) and the speed difference at the interaction level. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to compare the distributions of these indicators for interactions involving automated shuttles or motorized vehicles following similar paths. Multivariate regression was used to identify the relationship between the safety indicators and various factors. The results indicate that these automated shuttles behave generally more safely: their speeds and accelerations are lower and their interactions are characterized by higher TTC and PET values, and lower speed differences. However, small headway times at one site with high-speed differences between the shuttles and other following vehicles raise concerns that warrant further research into the suitable context for these vehicles.",0968-090X,https://github.com/FinestStone/AV-Interactions-City-Traffic
Dynamic demand estimation on large scale networks using Principal Component Analysis: The case of non-existent or irrelevant historical estimates,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103504,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Calibrating DTA models is complex due to the involved indeterminacy, non-linearity, and dimensionality, restricting the application of conventional calibration approaches, especially for larger networks. For this, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is slowly establishing itself as the new state of the art because it can greatly tackle two well known challenges—i.e. problem dimensionality and non-linearity. PCA application limits the optimization search space in a lower dimension space, defined by orthogonal Principal Components, evaluated upon a set of historical estimates. In this paper, we solve practical implementation problems for PCA-based calibration techniques. Specifically, we formulate a data-assimilation framework to propose multiple OD historical data-set generation methods which allows the use of PC-based algorithms in case the historical data is irrelevant or unavailable, often the case for large-scale DTA models. Furthermore, we propose a simplified problem formulation that leverages properties of the novel data-set generation framework and helps for faster and more efficient calibration. The methodology is implemented using the PC-SPSA algorithm, which combines PCA with the popular Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm, commonly used to calibrate smaller networks. The approach is tested on a large-scale case study of the Munich metropolitan urban network, with encouraging calibration results. The proposed data-assimilation framework can account for spatial, temporal, and day-to-day variations in the demand. Different methods and combinations are tested and compared. The results suggest that all these correlations should be used in order to avoid over-fitting issues. Furthermore, the implementation properties of PCA and PC-SPSA are also explored using different sensitivity analyses to assess the toll and benefits of using PCA i.e., ease in SPSA hyper-parameter, role of historical data-set generation parameters and the algorithm’s performance against different target demand fluctuations. The analysis shows encouraging results for PC-SPSA robustness and helps establishing simplified guidelines for implementing such PCA-methods practically on large-scale DTA models.",0968-090X,Not found

Specifically, a first-layer transformation operator employs the station extraction function to simplify the type of stations. After that, a second-layer transformation operator with a path filter function is designed to eliminate the non-effective connection structure. Therefore, a streamlined hierarchical topology network (SHTN) is generated.

Reliable location of automatic vehicle identification sensors to recognize origin-destination demands considering sensor failure,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103551,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Locating automatic vehicle identification (AVI) sensors to recognize Origin-Destination (OD) demand has been attracting extensive attentions in academia and industry. Although most scholars determined OD demand after deriving unique route flow based on AVI sensors, this traditional method does not necessarily obtain the smallest number of sensors to ensure the uniqueness of OD demand. Moreover, the sensors can fail in reality, which results in missing some information of observed links, thus the uniqueness of OD demand cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a new AVI sensor location model considering sensor failures to ensure the uniqueness of OD demand directly, without determining route flows. Typically, given the observation order of AVI sensors, this method can minimize the number of sensors to determine OD demand uniquely, in the meanwhile satisfying certain reliability given sensors’ failure. Moreover, under budget constraints, we develop a sensor location model to estimate OD demand under sensor failures, which maximizes information value of the differentiated OD pairs. Then we design several greedy heuristic algorithms to solve these two sensor location problems. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed models and algorithms can effectively determine the AVI sensor locations to recognize the OD demand and its uniqueness in the event of uncertain sensor failures.",0968-090X,Not found

This valuable data source can shed more light on tracking individual driving behaviors to detect crashes. This study delves into the possibility of detecting crashes using BSMs in controlled high-fidelity driving simulator experiments. To this end, two driving simulator scenarios were designed to simulate Run-off-Road (ROR), and Rear-End (RE) crashes. Twenty-four professional truck drivers were recruited to drive the scenarios. In each scenario, crash and non-crash cases were identified from vehicles’ trajectories, resulting in four study cases. Drivers’ behaviors were quantified by characterizing two Kinematic-based Surrogate Measures of Safety (K-SMoS), namely Absolute value of Derivative of Instantaneous Acceleration (ADInstAccel) and Absolute value of Derivative of Steering (ADSteering). Extreme defensive driving volatilities under crash and non-crash cases were modeled by extreme value analysis of K-SMoS and fitting their associated Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions under Bayesian inference. Accordingly, for each K-SMoS, the crash detection was formulated as a binary classification between two K-SMoS GEV continuous distributions under crash and corresponding non-crash conditions. Qualitative uncertainty analysis of joint posterior density distributions of GEVs’ parameters revealed a higher uncertainty of extreme driving behaviors in crash conditions. Regardless, notable relative increases in the central tendency of extreme K-SMoS in crash compared to non-crash conditions were found, implying the possibility of crash detection by tracking extreme drivers’ behaviors using trajectory-level observations. This visual inference was affirmed by the result of binary classification of GEV distributions associated with K-SMoS. Depending on the crash type and K-SMoS, 71% to 81% accuracy in crash detection was obtained, where ADSteering outperformed ADInstAccel in terms of the discriminative ability. Besides, using sensitivity–specificity analysis, the optimal threshold of 1.24 (rad/s) and 1.31 (m/s3), respectively, for ADSteering and ADInstAccel, were identified to detect crashes.

We also show that the traffic conditions at a link level are also reproduced realistically from our network-level calibration, and that our approach outperforms the traditional link-level OD calibration by comparing with the Aimsun OD adjustment in addition to SPSA. Furthermore, we demonstrate via different realistic network studies that the proposed approach is computationally efficient compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach. Our result shows that the proposed approach can be applied effectively regardless of the topology of the network, and that the model parameters do not have significant influence on the optimization results. Our calibration results show that just a few iterations are needed to calibrate the OD demand in the proposed approach even for the large-scale complex network underpinned by a bi-modal MFD derived from multiple real data sources.",0968-090X,Not found
A business class for autonomous mobility-on-demand: Modeling service quality contracts in dynamic ridesharing systems,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103520,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"With the popularization of transportation network companies (TNCs) (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), even major car manufacturers are increasingly considering themselves as autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) providers rather than individual vehicle sellers. However, matching the convenience of owning a vehicle requires providing consistent service quality, taking into account individual expectations. Typically, different classes of users have different service quality (SQ) expectations in terms of responsiveness, reliability, and privacy. Nonetheless, AMoD systems presented in the literature do not enable active control of service quality in the short term, especially in light of unusual demand patterns, sometimes allowing extensive delays and user rejections. This study proposes a method to control the daily operations of an AMoD system that uses the SQ expectations of heterogeneous user classes to dynamically distribute service quality among riders. Additionally, we consider an elastic vehicle supply, that is, privately-owned freelance AVs (FAVs) can be hired on short notice to help providers meeting user service-level expectations. We formalize the problem as the dial-a-ride problem with service quality contracts (DARP-SQC) and propose a multi-objective matheuristic to address real-world requests from Manhattan, New York City. Applying the proposed service-level constraints, we improve user satisfaction (in terms of reached service-level expectations) by 53% on average compared to conventional ridesharing systems, even without hiring additional vehicles. By deploying service-quality-oriented on-demand hiring, our hierarchical optimization approach allows providers to adequately cater to each segment of the customer base without necessarily owning large fleets.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic incentive schemes for managing dockless bike-sharing systems,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103527,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Balancing supply and demand for a dockless bike-sharing system is difficult as users are allowed to pick up and return bikes anywhere within a large service area. One strategy to help manage the amount of dockless bikes scattered within a service area is to offer monetary rewards for users who would be willing to pick up bikes scattered around some central location or to return their bikes at this central location. We develop a modeling framework to analyze the effectiveness of using dynamic incentive schemes for balancing the amount of bikes in the system to minimize the expected operating cost. Using an extensive set of numerical experiments, we illustrate specific operation environments under which these dynamic incentive schemes would be most effective for reducing the operating cost of the system. We find that the use of dynamic pickup and return rewards can generate very substantial cost reductions in an operating environment with a high traffic intensity of bike return outside the central location and a high overall traffic intensity of bike returns relative to bike pickups in the system. We also find that return rewards are generally more cost-effective than pickup rewards.",0968-090X,Not found
A control strategy for merging a single vehicle into a platoon at highway on-ramps,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103511,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"An important topic of research regarding cooperative platoons is merging vehicles into a platoon at highway on-ramps. This paper proposes a control strategy for the merging of a single cooperative automated vehicle into a platoon of vehicles at highway on-ramps. The proposed strategy can handle large differences in initial positions and velocities, sensor noise, and disturbances caused by the platoon leader. Furthermore, the required controller transitions are designed such that the switch between regular platooning and the merging maneuver can easily be made by all vehicles. The proposed strategy is validated using simulations. In the simulation environment communication delays, sensor noise, and disturbances of the platoon leader have been included. The proposed strategy is compared to a traditional strategy and shows a clear improvement in terms of noise handling.

Gaussian process latent class choice models,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103552,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"We present a Gaussian Process – Latent Class Choice Model (GP-LCCM) to integrate a non-parametric class of probabilistic machine learning within discrete choice models (DCMs). Gaussian Processes (GPs) are kernel-based algorithms that incorporate expert knowledge by assuming priors over latent functions rather than priors over parameters, which makes them more flexible in addressing nonlinear problems. By integrating a Gaussian Process within a LCCM structure, we aim at improving discrete representations of unobserved heterogeneity. The proposed model would assign individuals probabilistically to behaviorally homogeneous clusters (latent classes) using GPs and simultaneously estimate class-specific choice models by relying on random utility models. Furthermore, we derive and implement an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to jointly estimate/infer the hyperparameters of the GP kernel function and the class-specific choice parameters by relying on a Laplace approximation and gradient-based numerical optimization methods, respectively. The model is tested on two different mode choice applications and compared against different LCCM benchmarks. Results show that GP-LCCM allows for a more complex and flexible representation of heterogeneity and improves both in-sample fit and out-of-sample predictive power. Moreover, behavioral and economic interpretability is maintained at the class-specific choice model level while local interpretation of the latent classes can still be achieved, although the non-parametric characteristic of GPs lessens the transparency of the model.",0968-090X,https://github.com/gsfeir/GP-LCCM
Data-driven distributionally robust generation of time-varying flow corridor networks under demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103546,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Flow corridors are novel long tube-shaped, high-density airspace structure (like freeways in sky) which could achieve a very high throughput, while allowing traffic to flexible deployment and shift as necessary. In current research, the design of flow corridor networks cannot capture either the dynamic nature of traffic or the uncertainty in demand variations, which may fail to ensure satisfactory efficiency and reliability. In order to propose more efficient and reliable flow corridor networks for practice operations, this paper is devoted to propose a data-driven framework for the robust generation of time-varying flow corridor networks under demand uncertainty. Specifically, a delay-based method is proposed firstly for optimal design of a static flow corridors network which could be more effective in absorbing frequent flight delays from today’s air transportation system. Next, a multi-objective combinational optimization model is presented with its fast approximate evolutionary algorithm for generating time-varying flow corridor networks. Finally, to handle uncertainties in traffic operations over time, the data-driven Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach is employed to ensure the efficiency and reliability of the proposed networks. The framework is applied to the Chinese airspace to design a robust national-wide time-varying flow corridor network for numerical test. The numerical test results confirm that the proposed time-varying networks outperform previous designs in the average alleviated delays, average occupancy, and activation time with only a small trade-off in the number of served flights.",0968-090X,Not found
Path-oriented synchronized transit scheduling using time-dependent data,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103505,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"With the emergence of innovations associated with public transport (PT) services, such as Mobility-as-a-Service, demand responsive transit, and autonomous vehicles, the door-to-door PT journey is achievable via multiple transfers between and within different PT modes. As such, seamless transfers between different modes of public transportation become an increasingly important factor for the attractiveness of PT services. At the same time, recent developments in travel time prediction methodologies offer new, reliable data sources for the optimization of PT operations. This work, with the consideration of these two elements, develops a mixed integer linear programming model for the PT schedule synchronization problem. The novelty is threefold. First, a novel concept of path-oriented scheduling is proposed. The path transfer time is explicitly formulated and minimized to provide a seamless travel experience considering that the emerging multimodal mobility inevitably induces multiple transfers. Second, time-dependent travel time data is also utilized in the model, which allows us to harness new and more representative data sources for improving PT services. Third, in order to complement the increase in computational complexity as a result of the utilization of time-dependent travel time data, three novel valid inequalities (VIs) are derived. Numerical studies show that the use of time-dependent travel time data is beneficial in terms of reducing path transfer times, when compared to using the mean historical travel times. The numerical study also reveals a tradeoff between the maximum allowable path transfer time and trip time. Using simulation studies on three bus lines in Copenhagen, we demonstrate that the valid inequalities could reduce the computation time by 8.5% on average, where the maximum reduction of computation time could reach 54.0%. The proposed valid inequalities are benchmarked against two classes of valid inequalities in the literature. It is found that the proposed valid inequalities could outperform those in the literature. We also found that further improvement in computational performance can be attained by using a combination of the proposed valid inequalities.",0968-090X,Not found

To be successful, it will require an integrated approach able to balance efficiency and safety while leveraging common resources and information. In this work we focus on future urban air-taxi services, and present the first methods and algorithms to efficiently operate air-taxi at scale. Our approach is twofold. First, we use a passenger-centric perspective which introduces traveling classes, and information sharing between transport modes to differentiate quality of services. This helps smooth multimodal journeys and increase passenger satisfaction. Second, we provide a flight routing and recharging solution which minimizes direct operational costs while preserving long term battery life through reduced energy-intense recharging.

This paper contributes to this knowledge gap by examining the regional/metropolitan dimension in the factors influencing the frequency of ride-hailing use and the demand for pooled and autonomous vehicle (AV) rides in Australia. Through individual-level survey data, we found that there is indeed a divide between factors affecting not only the frequency of using ride-hailing in the status quo but also in the future adoption of new services of pooled and AV-based services. Using the hybrid discrete choice model, we identify several latent psychological constructs that influence the use of ride-hailing services, namely being pro-technology, pro-pooling, pro-AV, anti-driving and security-cautious traits. Moreover, the results of multivariate models point to different observed and latent characteristics influencing the adoption of pooled and AV ride-hailing services for various trip purposes. In line with the literature, it was found that the socio-demographic characteristics that affect the frequency of use or adopting pooled and AV services in future include gender, age, income, education attainment, employment status, car ownership, and the current travel behaviour. We also found that ride-hailing in Australia has played more as a substitution role for public transport, private car and taxi than as a complementary role or feeder of the public transport system, both in the metropolitan and regional areas.",0968-090X,Not found
A simulation-optimization framework for traffic disturbance recovery in metro systems,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103525,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper analyses how train delays propagate in a metro network due to disturbances and disruptions when different recovery strategies are implemented. Metro regulators use traffic management policies to recover from delays as fast as possible, return to a predefined schedule, or achieve an expected regularity of train arrivals and departures. We use as a metro traffic simulator SIMSTORS, which is based on a Stochastic Petri Net variant and simulates a physical system controlled by traffic management algorithms. To model existing metro networks, SIMSTORS has been mainly used with rule-based traffic management algorithms. In this work, we enhance traffic management strategies. We integrate SIMSTORS and the AGLIBRARY optimization solver in a closed-loop framework. AGLIBRARY is a deterministic solver for managing complex scheduling and routing problems. We formulate the real-time train rescheduling problem by means of alternative graphs, and use the decision procedures of AGLIBRARY to obtain rescheduling solutions. Several operational issues have been investigated throughout the use of the proposed simulation–optimization framework, among which how to design suitable periodic or event-based rescheduling strategies, how to setup the traffic prediction horizon, how to decide the frequency and the length of the optimization process. The Santiago Metro Line 1, in Chile, is used as a practical case study. Experiments with this framework in various settings show that integrating the optimization algorithms provided by AGLIBRARY to the rule-based traffic management embedded in SIMSTORS optimizes performance of the network, both in terms of train delay minimization and service regularity.",0968-090X,Not found
A joint behavioral choice model for adoption of automated vehicle ride sourcing and carsharing technologies: Role of built environment &amp; sustainable travel behaviors,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103557,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Rapid advancements in vehicle automation and a shift towards collaborative consumption trends will disrupt future urban mobility systems. We present a joint model of consumers’ affinity towards shared automated vehicles (SAVs) with two distinct yet related configurations: automated vehicle (AV) carsharing and AV ride sourcing. Compact and walkable built environment is known to support active travel and shared mobility but the potential impacts of built environment on adoption of automated shared mobility are largely unknown. Besides sociodemographic, sustainable travel, and technology-related factors, we examine the role of neighborhood-level walkability (composite measure of land-use, pedestrian-oriented urban design, and transit accessibility) in shaping public’s opinion about AV carsharing and AV ride sourcing technologies. Detailed travel behavior and stated preference/taste data for over 2700 individuals from the most recent 2019 Puget Sound Travel Survey are complemented with neighborhood-level high-resolution data on built environment fabric. Two dependent variables of interest include individual’s level of interest in AV carsharing and AV ride sourcing programs. A novel and comprehensive geo-additive heterogeneous copula-based joint behavioral model is developed - revealing complex stochastic dependence patterns between users’ interest in AV ride sourcing and carsharing programs and different layers of systematic and random taste heterogeneity. Results show that improving neighborhood walkability can be an effective way to increase public’s interest in using automated ride sourcing and carsharing services. Findings also highlight the opportunity to enable SAV adoption by harnessing the synergies between green (transit) travel, technology use for work/non-work purposes, use of existing mobility-on-demand (MOD) services, and affinity towards automated MOD services. Results are translated to potential policies for designing proactive behavioral and built environment interventions for accelerating SAV adoption with an enhanced sensitivity towards the needs of distinct and more vulnerable population groups (e.g., older, unemployed, and/or less educated individuals).

Road network vulnerability analysis considering the probability and consequence of disruptive events: A spatiotemporal incident impact approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103549,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper proposes a new data-driven impact area vulnerability analysis approach that considers both the probability of impact of incidents and their resulting effects on an impact area. Multi-year observed travel time and incident data are deployed to investigate the underlying traffic propagation dynamics. These datasets contain a wealth of information that reflects the occurrences of link closure/disruption by space and time and the network-wide impacts stemming from these disruptions. A novel approach is developed to identify the resulting spatial and temporal impacts of non-recurrent incidents. Rather than focusing solely on the travel time changes of the link subject to incident, this approach captures all aspects of the impacts of incidents by monitoring the dynamic propagation of congestion patterns in the set of links that are in the vicinity of the link subject to incident (i.e., impact area). These spatial and temporal dimensions of the impacts are subsequently used in a new vulnerability analysis. The performance of the developed approach was examined using historical travel time and incident data from the City of Calgary, Canada. The results indicate that the recorded temporal impact of incidents is not representative enough of the true impact of incidents because the dynamic spatial propagation of the effect of incidents on the impact area is overlooked. The proposed approach is capable of capturing the enduring spatiotemporal impact of incidents in a large-scale road network. The primary improvement of the developed vulnerability index is its ability to model multi-dimensional aspects of non-recurrent travel delays caused by non-current incidents in a road network.",0968-090X,Not found

An analytical model for quantifying the efficiency of traffic-data collection using instrumented vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103558,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Emerging instrumented vehicles (IVs), when equipped with high-precision positioning devices (e.g., DGPS) and ranging sensors (e.g., radar, LIDAR, cameras), are capable of generating high-quality traffic data. This study evaluates the efficiency of such data-collection procedures; this remains largely unknown because variable penetration rates of IVs rarely arise in the real world. We propose an analytical model that establishes a quantitative relationship between the ratio of collected trajectory points to total traffic trajectory points (RCT) and the IV penetration rate, according to stochastic geometry theory. With this, the data-collection efficiency (DCE) of IVs can be effectively evaluated. A simulation approach is developed to generate IV data and thereby validate the proposed analytical model, using a comprehensive set of traffic scenarios; these data consist of eight micro-trajectory datasets from the next-generation simulation (NGSIM) program and four typical sensor IV deployments. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the model perfectly reflects the simulated IV data for all traffic scenarios. In addition, an analytical comparison of the DCEs for fixed sensors, probe vehicles, and IVs reveals that IVs are the most efficient method for collecting traffic data in road networks.

A scenario-based distributed model predictive control approach for freeway networks,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103261,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"In this paper a scenario-based Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) approach based on a reduced scenario tree is developed for large-scale freeway networks. In the new scenario-based DMPC approach, uncertainties in a large-scale freeway network are distinguished into two categories: global uncertainties for the overall network and local uncertainties applicable to subnetworks only. We propose to use a reduced scenario tree instead of using a complete scenario tree. A complete scenario tree is defined as a scenario tree consisting of global scenarios and all the combinations of the local scenarios for all subnetworks, while a reduced scenario tree is defined as a scenario tree consisting of global scenarios and a reduced local scenario tree in which local scenarios are combined within each subnetwork, not among subnetworks. Moreover, an expected-value setting and a min–max setting are considered for handling uncertainties in scenario-based DMPC. In the expected-value setting, the expected-value of the cost function values for all considered uncertainty scenarios is optimized by scenario-based DMPC. However, in the min–max setting, the worst-case of the cost function values for all considered uncertainty scenarios is optimized by scenario-based DMPC. The results for a numerical experiment show that the new scenario-based DMPC approach is effective in improving the control performance while at the same time satisfying the queue constraints in the presence of uncertainties.

Examining braking behaviour during failed lane-changing attempts in a simulated connected environment with driving aids,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103531,136,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This study examines braking behaviour of drivers assisted with driving aids in a connected environment compared to when they are driving without it during failed lane-changing attempts that often exerts more pressure on the immediate follower in the target lane in the form of hard decelerations, which increases crash risk. To achieve this aim, the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator is utilised, where 78 participants faced a failed-lane-changing attempt of a lane-changer from the adjacent lane into two randomised driving conditions: (a) baseline (without driving aids); and (b) connected environment (with driving aids). A descriptive analysis of braking profiles reveals decreased decelerations among drivers in the connected environment, compared to when they are driving in the baseline condition. To model braking behaviour, more specifically the time taken by drivers to reduce their initial speeds to the minimum speeds, a grouped random parameters hazard-based duration model is developed. Factors found to significantly impact the braking behaviour are initial speed, spacing, maximum deceleration, driving condition, driver age, and gender. The developed model reveals that drivers’ braking times may increase or decrease in the connected environment compared to those in the baseline condition. However, a majority of drivers in the connected environment tend to reduce speeds earlier with a lower deceleration rate, exhibiting smoother speed reductions and larger safety margins. A decision tree analysis reveals that middle-aged and male drivers take longer to reduce their speeds in the baseline condition but shorter in the connected environment. This study concludes that followers in the connected environment respond to failed lane-changing attempts more swiftly, thereby increasing safety margins.",0968-090X,Not found

A bi-level formation control framework is utilized to plan collision-free motion for vehicles, where relative target assignment and path planning are performed in the upper level, and trajectory planning and tracking are performed in the lower level. The collision-free multi-vehicle path planning problem considering lane preference is decoupled into two sub problems: calculating assignment list with non-decreasing cost and planning collision-free paths according to given assignment result. The Conflict-based Searching (CBS) method is utilized to plan collision-free paths for vehicles based on given assignment results.

Robust liner ship routing and scheduling schemes under uncertain weather and ocean conditions,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103593,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Since sailing along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) through the Arctic Ocean comes into reality, commercial shipping developments including opening new liner services along this route have been put on the agenda. However, uncertainties within weather and ocean conditions in this region, especially during temperature-varying seasons, may cause failure to on-time arrivals, resulting unignorable or even unaffordable monetary losses. As a result, these uncertainties will inevitably affect cargo shippers’ willingness of choosing this being-explored route, even if on average its shipping time is much shorter than that of the traditional Asia-Europe shipping lines. In this context, the present paper describes a liner ship routing and scheduling problem considering schedule-sensitive demand and late-arrival penalty for operating incoming NSR shipping lines in the future. By using two types of uncertainty sets, bounded and budget-bounded uncertainty sets, we construct and solve two robust counterparts of this problem. The deterministic model and bounded robust model can be seen as special cases of the budget-bounded robust model when the uncertainty budget is set to null and full, respectively. A multifaceted case study of planning liner shipping routes and schedules along the NSR is conducted to validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed models and identify the effects of uncertainty bounds and budgets on the solution performance. The following facts and conclusions are revealed from the optimization results of the case study: The budget-bounded robust model functions the best in the worst condition; low revenue rate and high demand sensitivity are the major factors for excluding a candidate port from the route; the order of a visited port in the route decides the weight of its uncertainty budget on the entire shipping line; setting the uncertainty budget in a decelerative way will enhance the scheduling robustness of solutions.",0968-090X,Not found

Our research uses Topic Modeling to extract information from open-ended questions and compare its performance with closed-ended responses.

Imputing qualitative attributes for trip chains extracted from smart card data using a conditional generative adversarial network,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103616,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Travel Diary Survey (TDS) collects comprehensive attributes such as sociodemographic attributes, trip purpose, and trip chain attributes of the trips taken by a small portion of the general population every few years. Meanwhile, smart cards (SC) gather all transit passenger time-space movements on a daily basis, which represent trip chain attributes. However, qualitative attributes such as sociodemographic attributes and trip purpose are unknown. This study proposed a novel method to estimate the trip purpose and sociodemographic attributes of SC data by using a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). With an efficient network structure that considers the spatial and sequential dependencies of a trip chain, the proposed CGAN is able to impute the sociodemographic attributes and trip purpose of SC data by mimicking the TDS data using adversarial training. Also, unlike the other generative models, the proposed CGAN can fully leverage the large-scale SC data in training, which allow sidestepping overfit to the TDS data. Evaluation results show that CGAN outperforms other generative models, i.e., Bayesian networks, Gibbs sampler, conventional CGAN, and a conditional variational autoencoder. Considerable performance improvement was achieved by both network structure that can consider spatial and sequential dependencies, and modeling framework that utilize the large-scale SC data. Several metrics were employed to evaluate fidelity, diversity, and creativity, and these verified that the existing generative models tend to overfit the marginal or bivariate distributions of training data. The proposed method addresses the incompleteness of passively collected mobile data. The imputed SC data representing comprehensive travel attributes is valuable for an activity-based model and behavior analysis, because it provides travel information that is more dynamic, continuous, and extensive.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimating economic losses from cyber-attacks on shipping ports: An optimization-based approach,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103423,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"The Maritime Transportation System (MTS) accounts for more than 80% of global merchandise trade in volume and roughly one-sixth of the Total Gross Output of the United States.

To capture the costs of the physical disruption, we extend Boland et al’s Dynamic Discretization Discovery (DDD) algorithm to capture capacity constraints and enable delay modeling to accommodate commodities arriving late due to disruption. Economic loss functions for seven commodity categories based on the willingness to pay literature are used to compute delay costs so that stakeholders can estimate the range of economic and operational impacts within a disruption profile. Results based on data for cyber-attacks on landlord port and terminal operator assets provided by Port Everglades, FL illustrate impacts at $80,000 and $1.2M on average during one week in October 2017 and at $141,000 and $2.8M for May 2017 respectively. The runtime performance of our enhanced DDD algorithm improves on the state of the art by an order of magnitude and on larger problem sizes based on real-world port networks.",0968-090X,Not found
A computer vision framework using Convolutional Neural Networks for airport-airside surveillance,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103590,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Modern airports often have large and complex airside environments featuring multiple runways, with changing configurations, numerous taxiways for effective circulation of flights and tens, if not hundreds, of gates. With inherent uncertainties in gate push-back and taxiway routing, efficient surveillance and management of airport-airside operations is a highly challenging task for air traffic controllers. An increase in air traffic may lead to gate delays, taxiway congestion, taxiway incursions as well as significant increase in the workload of air traffic controllers. With the advent of Digital Towers, airports are increasingly being equipped with surveillance camera systems. This paper proposes a novel computer vision framework for airport-airside surveillance, using cameras to monitor ground movement objects for safety enhancement and operational efficiency improvement. The framework adopts Convolutional Neural Networks and camera calibration techniques for aircraft detection and tracking, push-back prediction, and maneuvering monitoring. The proposed framework is applied on video camera feeds from Houston Airport, USA (for maneuvering monitoring) and Obihiro Airport, Japan (for push-back prediction). The object detection models of the proposed framework achieve up to 73.36% average precision on Houston airport and 87.3% on Obihiro airport. The framework estimates aircraft speed and distance with low error (up to 6 meters), and aircraft push-back is predicted with an average error of 3 min from the time an aircraft arrives with the error-rate reducing until the aircraft’s actual push-back event.",0968-090X,Not found
A physics-informed reinforcement learning-based strategy for local and coordinated ramp metering,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103584,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"This paper proposes a physics-informed reinforcement learning(RL)-based ramp metering strategy, which trains the RL model using a combination of historic data and synthetic data generated from a traffic flow model. The optimal policy of the RL model is updated through an iterative training process, where in each iteration a new batch of historic data is collected and fed into the training data set. Such iterative training process can evaluate the control policy from reality rather than from a simulator, thus avoiding the RL model being trapped in an inaccurate training environment. The proposed strategy is applied to both local and coordinated ramp metering. Results from extensive microscopic simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy (i) significantly improves the traffic performance in terms of total time spent savings; (ii) outperforms classical feedback-based ramp metering strategies; and (iii) achieves higher improvements than an existing RL-based ramp metering strategy, which trains the RL model merely by a simulator. We also test the performance of two different learning algorithms in the simulation experiment, namely a conventional tabular approach and a batch-constrained deep RL approach. It is found that the deep RL approach is not as effective as the conventional tabular approach in the proposed strategy due to the limited amount of training data.",0968-090X,Not found
Data fusion for estimating Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram in large-scale urban networks,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103555,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Since the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) has been introduced, many studies have investigated the existence and characteristics of the MFD using empirical and simulation data. MFD is a powerful and efficient model for monitoring and managing large-scale urban networks. However, estimating the MFD for large-scale networks faces important challenges; monitoring resources are often limited in such networks. Furthermore, common sensors that are used to collect traffic data (i.e., loop detectors and probe vehicles), have limitations of their own. For instance, loop detectors are fixed sensors and cannot provide accurate density measurements. On the other hand, to estimate the MFD using probe vehicle data, the probe penetration rate must be known a priori. Given that the individual sensors cannot provide complete and accurate traffic measurements, combining the traffic data from multiple sources may improve the estimation of the MFD. The aim of this study is to combine two traffic data sources to estimate the MFD for a large-scale urban network, where the distribution of probe vehicles across the network is not necessarily homogeneous. The two traffic data sets used in this study are probe vehicle data with an unknown penetration rate, and full-scale approximate traffic data which is produced based on loop detector data. We compare the results of the fusion method with the results of a baseline method, which only uses loop detector measurements. The average flow and density estimations resulting from the Bayesian fusion method outperform the baseline method. We observe a particularly significant improvement in average density estimations, which reaffirms that loop detectors cannot accurately measure the average density.",0968-090X,Not found
Predictive energy-efficient driving strategy design of connected electric vehicle among multiple signalized intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103595,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Signalized intersections dominate traffic flow in urban areas, resulting in increased energy consumption and travel delay for the vehicles involved. To mitigate the negative effect of traffic lights on eco-driving control of electric vehicles, a multi-intersections-based eco-approach and departure strategy (M-EAD) is proposed to improve vehicle energy efficiency, traffic throughput, and battery life, while maintaining acceptable driving comfort. M-EAD is a two-stage control scheme that includes efficient green signal window planning and speed trajectory optimization. In the upper stage, the traffic light green signal window planning is formulated as a shortest path problem, which is solved using an A* algorithm for travel delay reduction. In the lower stage, the speed optimization problem is solved by resorting to a receding horizon framework, in which the energy consumption and battery life losses are minimized using an iterative dynamic programming algorithm. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation with randomized traffic signal parameters is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed M-EAD strategy. The results show the various advancements of the proposed M-EAD strategy over two benchmark methods, constant speed and isolated-intersection-based eco-approach and departure strategies in terms of energy efficiency, travel time, and battery life in stochastic traffic scenarios.

A novel method of predictive collision risk area estimation for proactive pedestrian accident prevention system in urban surveillance infrastructure,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103570,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Road traffic accidents, especially vehicle–pedestrian collisions in crosswalk, globally pose a severe threat to human lives and have become a leading cause of premature deaths. In order to protect such vulnerable road users from collisions, it is necessary to handle possible conflict in advance and warn road users, not post-facto. A breakthrough for proactively preventing pedestrian collisions is to recognize pedestrian’s potential risks based on vision sensors such as CCTVs. In this study, we propose a predictive collision risk area estimation system at unsignalized crosswalks. The proposed system applied trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians from video footage after preprocessing, and then predicted their trajectories by using deep LSTM networks. With use of predicted trajectories, this system can infer collision risk areas statistically, further severity of levels is divided as danger, warning, and caution. In order to validate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed system, we applied it and assessed the severity of potential risks in two unsignalized spots with different mobility environment in Osan City, Republic of Korea. As a result, the ratio of dangerous scenes is higher in Spot A (0.115) than in Spot B (0.077) when applying the best performance model in each spot, and we found that the risk situation varies depending on the mobility environment.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimating key traffic state parameters through parsimonious spatial queue models,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103596,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"As an active performance evaluation method, the fluid-based queueing model plays an important role in traffic flow modeling and traffic state estimation problems. A critical challenge in the application of traffic state estimation is how to utilize heterogeneous data sources in identifying key interpretable model parameters of freeway bottlenecks, such as queue discharge rates, system-level bottleneck-oriented arrival rates, and congestion duration. Inspired by Newell’s deterministic fluid approximation model, this paper proposes a spatial queue model for oversaturated traffic systems with time-dependent arrival rates. The oversaturated system dynamics can be described by parsimonious analytical formulations based on polynomial functional approximation for virtual arrival flow rates. With available flow, density and end-to-end travel time data along traffic bottlenecks, the proposed modeling framework for estimating the key traffic queueing state parameters is able to systematically map various measurements to the bottleneck-level dynamics and queue evolution process.

"Optimal prices for ridesourcing in the presence of taxi, public transport and car competition",10.1016/j.trc.2022.103591,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Ridesourcing platforms have acquired an important role as an alternative travel mode in almost all major cities in the world. These new mobility applications offer benefits for users over traditional taxi and public transport alternatives. However, there is mounting evidence that ridesourcing worsens traffic congestion. Given this potential negative impact and the complicated relationship between travel modes, it is unclear how policymakers should respond to the appearance of this new transport option. In this paper, we present a social welfare maximization model with four modes (automobile, taxi, buses and ridesourcing services) to derive the optimal first-best and second-best fares, considering the congestion externality generated by each mode. We apply this model to Santiago, Chile, using available parameter estimates to derive optimal fares with a novel inverse demand system (Inverse Product Differentiation Logit model). The results indicate that ridesourcing fares should be 29% higher per ride in the first-best scenario and 59% higher in the second-best scenario compared to current levels. However, our second-best scenario (in which buses and taxis have fares given by current levels and there is no congestion pricing for cars) reaches only 18% of the welfare gains from a first-best scenario. Sensitivity analysis shows that these results are not sensitive to several key assumptions, however they are sensitive to the parametrization of the flow-delay function in the second-best scenario. Our simulations also show that the optimal surcharge should be slightly higher if the average occupancy rate for ridesourcing services increases. This result is due to the higher overall use of this service, as the average fare per passenger decreases when more passengers ride together.",0968-090X,Not found
"Navigating to safety: Necessity, requirements, and barriers to considering safety in route finding",10.1016/j.trc.2021.103542,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Automotive navigation systems are one of the driver assistance technologies with the primary objective of directing drivers to their desired destinations. Although recent versions of automotive navigation systems help users minimize their travel time, there are certain situations in which the shortest route is not necessarily the safest one. Navigating through local roads that carry higher risks of crashes—roads with poor geometric designs, drainage problems, lack of illumination, wildlife crossing danger, and interruptions in traffic flow—is an example of the unintended consequences of routing to ensure minimum travel time. This study is designed to examine the safety of the fastest routes suggested by navigation systems. Road network connecting five metropolitan areas in Texas, including more than 29,000 road segments, is studied. The results of comparing the safest and shortest route between pairs of origins and destinations showed that the shortest route can differ from the safest, where taking a route to decrease travel time by 8% was associated with a 23% higher risk of being involved in a crash. The findings indicate the safest route varies according to different weather conditions. To incorporate safety in route-finding, a centralized, predictive algorithm is introduced for static and dynamic safe route-finding that can complement the existing navigation systems. The requirements for implementing such a system are identified as: (1) availability of real-time traffic flow and incident data for dynamic route-finding systems, (2) more accurate crash prediction models, and (3) a methodology for dealing with the tradeoffs between travel time and safety to find the optimal route.",0968-090X,Not found

Does LSTM outperform 4DDTW-KNN in lane change identification based on eye gaze data?,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103583,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Lane change identification based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks has received increasing attention. The most commonly known disadvantage of the approach is the “black box” nature. This study, to improve the interpretability, proposed a novel method for identifying lane changes. The philosophy was to measure the similarity of the glance behavior during the maneuver. The glance behavior in the same maneuver is more similar, while that in different maneuvers is different. First, a driving simulator was used to collect driving behavior data. The eye gaze time series were captured by the eye tracker. The median of the eye gaze sequence of 3 s before the initial moment of lane change was obtained. With the median as the center, the driver's visual field plane was divided into several grids with the side length of 600 pixels. A sliding space-time cuboid algorithm was proposed to extract the scanning path. Second, four-dimensional dynamic time warping (4DDTW) distance was used to measure the similarity of the scanning paths. Third, the K nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm was used to classify the driving maneuver into the lane-keeping (LK), the right lane change (RLC), and the left lane change (LLC) based on the 4DDTW distance of the scan paths. LSTM was also used to classify the driving maneuver into LK, RLC, and LLC. The performances of 4DDTW-KNN and LSTM were compared. The accuracies of 4DDTW-KNN and LSTM were 86.50% and 86.33%, respectively.

Multi-agent reinforcement learning for Markov routing games: A new modeling paradigm for dynamic traffic assignment,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103560,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"This paper aims to develop a paradigm that models the learning behavior of intelligent agents (including but not limited to autonomous vehicles, connected and automated vehicles, or human-driven vehicles with intelligent navigation systems where human drivers follow the navigation instructions completely) with a utility-optimizing goal and the system’s equilibrating processes in a routing game among atomic selfish agents. Such a paradigm can assist policymakers in devising optimal operational and planning countermeasures under both normal and abnormal circumstances. To this end, we develop a Markov routing game (MRG) in which each agent learns and updates her own en-route path choice policy while interacting with others in transportation networks. To efficiently solve MRG, we formulate it as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and devise a mean field multi-agent deep Q learning (MF-MA-DQL) approach that captures the competition among agents. The linkage between the classical DUE paradigm and our proposed Markov routing game (MRG) is discussed. We show that the routing behavior of intelligent agents is shown to converge to the classical notion of predictive dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) when traffic environments are simulated using dynamic loading models (DNL). In other words, the MRG depicts DUEs assuming perfect information and deterministic environments propagated by DNL models. Four examples are solved to illustrate the algorithm efficiency and consistency between DUE and the MRG equilibrium, on a simple network without and with spillback, the Ortuzar Willumsen (OW) Network, and a real-world network near Columbia University’s campus in Manhattan of New York City.",0968-090X,Not found

Shared parking for ride-sourcing platforms to reduce cruising traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103562,137,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Ride-sourcing platforms create cruising traffic that exacerbates road congestion in large cities. This paper considers shared parking services for ride-sourcing vehicles to reduce the cruising traffic. We propose a novel business model that integrates shared parking services into the ride-sourcing platform. In the proposed business model, the platform (a) provides app-based interfaces to connect passengers, drivers and garage operators (private or commercial garages); (b) matches passengers to ride-sourcing vehicles for ride services; (c) matches idle vehicles to vacant parking spaces to reduce cruising traffic; and (d) determines the ride fare, driver payment, and parking rates to maximize its profit. We model the integrated platform as a three-sided market (i.e., passenger, driver and garage) that involves two matching processes: passenger-driver matching and driver-garage matching. An economic equilibrium model is proposed to characterize the incentives of passengers, drivers, garage operators, and the ride-sourcing platform. Optimal pricing strategies and the corresponding market outcomes are derived by solving the platform’s profit maximization problem. Based on the model, we show that integrated parking and ride-sourcing service can offer a Pareto improvement: in certain regime, it leads to higher passenger surplus, higher driver surplus, higher garage surplus, higher platform profit, and reduced cruising traffic. Further, we investigate the impacts of matching efficiency between drivers and garages on the proposed business model. We show that a higher matching efficiency always leads to increased platform profit and driver surplus, but it may not necessarily benefit passengers or garage operators in all cases. The above insights are validated through realistic numerical studies for San Francisco.",0968-090X,Not found

Integrating robustness from a passenger’s point of view makes the task even more challenging. With numerous different definitions of robustness in the literature, a standard way to evaluate the robustness of a public transport system is to simulate its performance under a large number of possible scenarios. Unfortunately, this is computationally very expensive. In this paper, we therefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation by using regression models from machine learning. Training of these models is based on carefully selected key features of public transport systems and passenger demand. The trained model is then able to predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only its key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that approximates the robustness in constant time. Such an oracle can be used as black box to increase the robustness of public transport schedules. We provide a first proof of concept for the special case of robust timetabling, using a local search framework.

Ego-efficient lane changes of connected and automated vehicles with impacts on traffic flow,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103478,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) enabled by wireless communication and vehicle automation are believed to revolutionize the form and operation of road transport in the next decades. This paper addresses traffic flow effects of CAVs, and focuses on their lane-changing impacts on the mixed traffic flow of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). At present technical paths towards the development and deployment of CAVs are still uncertain. With CAV technologies getting matured, CAVs are supposed to provide rides of higher efficiency than HVs, beyond improved safety and comfort. In heavy traffic, this would only be achievable via agile and flexible lane changes of CAVs, because longitudinal acceleration would be unhelpful or even impossible in mixed traffic. Such lane changes are expected to be ego-efficient in that they serve solely CAVs’ interests without much considering surrounding vehicles, as long as safety constraints are not violated. As road resources are limited, the growth of the CAV population adopting such ego-efficient lane-changing strategies would probably lead to renowned “Tragedy of the Commons”. In this context, this paper considers three important prospective questions: A: How to determine an ego-efficient lane-changing strategy for CAVs? B: With increasingly more CAVs introduced each adopting the ego-efficient lane-changing strategy, what is the impact on traffic flow? C: How to determine a system-efficient lane-changing strategy for CAVs? These forward-looking issues are addressed from the perspectives of microscopic traffic simulation and reinforcement learning. Without any constraint on the lane-changing incentive, the developed lane-changing strategy was found to be beneficial for CAVs and the entire traffic flow only if the market penetration rate (MPR) of CAVs is less than 50%. With an appropriate constraint placed, however, the lane-changing strategy was found to become consistently beneficial for the entire traffic flow at any MPR. These findings suggest that CAVs may not simply be a magic cure for traffic problems that the society is currently facing, unless some upper-level coordination may be proposed for CAVs to benefit not only themselves but also the entire traffic. This is also consistent with what “Tragedy of the Commons” suggests.",0968-090X,Not found

The paper then shows that policy P 0 , specified in Smith (1980, 2015), is capacity-maximising for a general network with vertical queueing delays. Then link exit prices, co-ordinated with green-times and also red times, are considered. It is shown that using prices (instead of delays) in the P 0 control policy maximises the capacity of a general steady state network, with zero queues. This steady state capacity-maximisation ＋ zero-queue result is then extended to dynamic networks in two ways; an equilibrium extension and a day-to-day stability extension. The equilibrium extension shows that P 0 -with-prices maximises network capacity with zero queues in a dynamic network and the stability extension shows that a smoothed version of the P 0 -with-prices policy, called P 0 f , is able to deliver some stability as well as zero queue capacity maximisation. A simple example network has been given to illustrate several of the control-with-prices policies. It is shown that a biased version of P 0 -with-prices, P h -with-prices, yields, for this simple network, higher utility than P 0 -with-prices itself.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated fleet assignment and scheduling for environmentally friendly electrified regional air mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103567,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Regional air mobility refers to the transportation of passengers aboard small aircraft over short distances. These operations are challenging due to low passenger volumes, competing transportation modes, and high operating costs. Nevertheless, the recent convergence of new technologies for electric propulsion and autonomy brings the promise of step-changes in both operating efficiency and sustainability. The next challenge is to define concepts of operations that best use these advanced aircraft. We develop a modeling and optimization environment to address this challenge by first estimating the passenger demand for regional air mobility, and then by concurrently optimizing the fleet assignment and scheduling of these operations. This helps identify the optimum fleet composition and the network of routes that best serve this demand. The contribution of this research is the formulation of the optimization as a half-leg half-itinerary mixed-integer linear program using a hierarchical multi-objective approach that provides insights about trade-offs between profitability and emissions. We demonstrate the ability of this environment to solve large fleet assignment and scheduling problems to near optimality by applying it to the United States Northeast Corridor using a fleet of electric and hybrid-electric regional aircraft. Results highlight that the transition to an electrified fleet allows serving twice the number of communities currently served, while reducing the carbon emissions per passenger by fifty percent. With improving battery specific energy density, many more untapped markets can be served profitably and sustainably, and many smaller communities can get connected to the rest of the National Airspace System.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling aggressive driving behavior based on graph construction,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103654,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The occurrence of aggressive driving behavior is a random process among time-varying transversion. For modeling aggressive driving behavior, previous studies have typically relied on summative statistics (e.g. means and S.D.) as the inputs which fall short in extracting features of driving behaviors that are in a time-series pattern. The raw data are used to extract the pieces of the graph. Each graph represents a specific driving trip that includes driver characteristics, environment information, and driving behavior variables. Graphs of trips were constructed based on the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study data. 17 variables related to aggressive driving are extracted and converted into elements (pieces as described in the paper) in the construction graphs. Regression models are used for verifying the performance of using graph construction as the input in modeling. The result shows that a 5-sec time window is suitable for aggressive driving behavior modeling. 11 variables (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, lateral displacement, gender, age, distracted, drowsy, weather, horizontal alignment, time-to-collision) are selected for graph construction based on their significance. Both summative statistics and graph construction are applied. The result shows that graph construction achieves better performance over models based on summative statistic inputs (mean plus standard deviation, and mean only). Based on weights of variables, time-to-collision is found to be the factor which affects aggressive driving most. This method can be used in real-world applications to improve driving safety by alerting drivers of aggressive behavior identified in real time with Advanced Driver Assistance System applications.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimization on hybrid energy vessel routing and energy management for floating marine debris cleanup,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103649,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Marine debris pollution is increasingly threatening the marine environment and human health. The most effective way to remove macro-debris floating offshore is to send vessels to collect it. We employ advanced remote sensing technology to locate debris and vessels equipped with a hybrid energy system composed of photovoltaic, battery packs and diesel to collect debris. In order to establish an effective collection mechanism in an economical and eco-friendly manner, we propose a two-stage optimization approach of vessel routing and energy management strategy. In the first stage, a mixed integer linear programming is to minimize the vessel travel time for removing debris, which is reduced to the vessel routing problem with time window considering discrete speed. Advanced remote sensing technology and trajectory prediction software are used to locate debris at sea. An adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm with pheromone heuristic rule is tailored to solve the problem. A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize the power flow for the hybrid energy system in the second stage. The objective is to minimize the total cost, taking into account of the constraints of power load balance, battery charge and discharge state and output limit of each energy source. The proposed models and algorithm are validated by a group of numerical examples with different sizes. Compared with VRP Spreadsheet Solver and CPLEX solver, our proposed algorithm not only has obvious advantages in both time and results, but also has cubic function fitting property in time complexity within 100 data. We also compare the optimal power flow and total cost under three illumination intensity scenarios and analyze the optimal power flow for each energy. We find that in optimal power flow, diesel can charge the battery only if it supplies power to vessel load. The results show that compared with the pure diesel system, the hybrid energy system has an overwhelming advantage in terms of total cost and carbon emissions, which can be reduced by 65.78% and 82.69%, respectively. We also find no change in the cost savings of hybrid vessels when considering battery and diesel life-cycle carbon emissions.",0968-090X,Not found
A novel hierarchical cooperative merging control model of connected and automated vehicles featuring flexible merging positions in system optimization,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103650,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Merging sections on freeways are typical bottlenecks for traffic efficiency and safety. The connected and automated vehicles (CAV) technology has great capability in improving traffic performance of merging bottlenecks. Current approaches of system optimal cooperative merging control assume single fixed merging point (CMC-SMP) for on-ramp vehicles to reduce the complexity of their models. Non-fixed merging positions have the potential to further improve merging operations but may lead to the computational explosion. To solve this core contradiction, this study proposes a novel hierarchical system optimal cooperative merging control model considering flexible merging positions (CMC-FMP) to realize safe and efficient merging processes. The upper-level – the tactical planning model is formulated as a non-convex mixed integer quadratically constrained programming, aiming at minimal total travel time in the control zone. It optimizes not only the merging sequence but also vehicles’ critical states in merging processes, such as the state of on-ramp vehicles when they merge. The lower-level - the motion planning model generates feasible trajectories and the next step actions for every vehicle. A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based decomposition algorithm (MCTS-DA) is further designed to improve the computational efficiency of the tactical planning model. Meanwhile, solutions of MCTS-DA are proved to have good optimality compared to the direct solving method. A batch-based scheme is developed to realize real-time control. The results reveal that the average delays of CMC-FMP are remarkably lower than those of CMC-SMP. Especially in low on-ramp ratio scenarios, the difference in improvement can reach 64%. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis indicates that large safe merging margins and short merging sections are disadvantageous for traffic efficiency for the merging flow controlled by CMC-FMP.",0968-090X,Not found
Trustworthy safety improvement for autonomous driving using reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103656,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Reinforcement learning (RL) can learn from past failures and has the potential to provide self-improvement ability and higher-level intelligence. However, the current RL algorithms still suffer from challenges in reliability, especially compared to the rule/model-based algorithms that are pre-engineered, human-input intensive, but widely used in autonomous vehicles. To take advantages of both the RL and rule-based algorithms, this work aims to design a decision-making framework that leverages RL and use an existing rule-based policy as its performance lower bound. In this way, the final policy remains the potential of self-learning, while guaranteeing a better system performance compared with the integrated rule-based policy. Such a decision-making framework is called trustworthy improvement RL (TiRL). The basic idea is to make the RL policy iteration process synchronously estimate the given rule-based policy’s value function. AV will then use the RL policy to drive only in the cases where the RL has learned a better policy, i.e., a higher policy value. This work takes highway safe driving as the case study. The results are obtained through more than 42,000 km driving in stochastic simulated traffic, and calibrated by naturalistic driving data. The TiRL planner is given two typical rule-based highway-driving policies for comparison. The results show that the TiRL can outperform the given arbitrary rule-based driving policy. In summary, the proposed TiRL can leverage the learning-based method in stochastic and emergent scenarios, while having a trustworthy safety improvement from the existing rule-based policies.",0968-090X,Not found
An online hybrid mechanism for dynamic first-mile ridesharing service,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103585,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper leverages the “Mechanism Design” theory to design the ridesharing-based transit feeder service with mixed scheduled and on-demand passenger requests. An online hybrid mechanism is proposed with four incentive objectives: promoting passengers to participate by satisfying their mobility preferences, inducing passengers to truthfully reveal their mobility preferences, incentivizing the service provider to be financially sustainable, and incentivizing more regular commuters to early schedule the service. We propose and prove four properties, “preference-based individual rationality”, “preference-based incentive compatibility”, “financial sustainability”, and “scheduling preferability” to achieve the four incentive objectives, respectively. This online hybrid mechanism is comprised of a dynamic re-optimization methodology for re-matching and re-routing and a hybrid real-time pricing mechanism discriminative against different passenger types. In order to obtain the large-scale solutions for the online hybrid mechanism, this paper improves the solution pooling approach (SPA), which was originally proposed in our previous work for a static offline mechanism, to adapt for the online hybrid mechanism. The improved SPA successfully sustains the “preference-based individual rationality”, “financial sustainability”, and “scheduling preferability” properties.

Integrating public transit signal priority into max-pressure signal control: Methodology and simulation study on a downtown network,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103614,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Max-pressure signal control has been analytically proven to maximize the network throughput and stabilize queue lengths whenever possible. Since there are many transit lines operating in the metropolis, the max-pressure signal control should be extended to multi-modal transportation systems to achieve more widespread usage. The standard max-pressure controller is more likely to actuate phases during high-demand approaches, which may end up ignoring the arrival of buses, especially in bus rapid transit. In this paper, we propose a novel max-pressure signal control that considers transit signal priority of bus rapid transit systems to achieve both maximum stability for private vehicles and reliable transit service. This study revises the original max-pressure control to include constraints that provide priority for buses. Furthermore, this policy is decentralized which means it only relies on it relies only on the local conditions of each intersection. We set the simulation on the real-world road network with bus rapid transit systems. Numerical results show that the max-pressure signal control which considers transit signal priority can still achieve maximum stability compared with other signal control integrated with transit signal priority. Furthermore, the max-pressure control reduces private vehicle travel time and bus travel time compared to the current signal control.",0968-090X,Not found
How many are enough?: Investigating the effectiveness of multiple conflict indicators for crash frequency-by-severity estimation by automated traffic conflict analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103653,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Traffic conflict techniques are a viable alternative to crash-based safety assessments and are particularly well suited to evaluating emerging technologies such as connected and automated vehicles for which crash data are sparsely available. Recently, the use of multiple traffic conflict indicators has become common in methodological studies, yet it is often difficult to determine which conflict indicators are appropriate given the application context, and the net benefit, in terms of improved crash prediction accuracy, of considering additional conflict indicators. Addressing these concerns, this study investigates the potential benefits of multiple conflict indicators for conflict-based crash estimation models by using a multivariate extreme value modeling framework (with Gumbel-Hougaard copulas) to estimate crash frequency by severity. The selected conflict indicators include Modified Time-To-Collision (MTTC), Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Collision (DRAC), Proportion of Stopping Distance (PSD) and expected post-collision change in velocity (Delta-V). The proposed framework was applied to estimate the total, severe (Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 3; MAIS3+), and non-severe (MAIS < 3) rear-end crash frequencies at three four-legged signalized intersections in Brisbane, Australia. Rear-end traffic conflicts were extracted from video data using state-of-the-art Computer Vision analytics. Results show that the prediction performance improvements are not necessarily proportional to the number of conflict indicators used in extreme value models. MTTC and DRAC, combined with the severity indicator Delta-V, were the most suitable predictors of rear-end crashes at signalized intersections. Results suggest that instead of adding more and more conflict indicators, careful selection of compatible conflict indicators (considering their functional differences and empirical correlations) is the best way to enhance the predictive performance of conflict-based models.",0968-090X,Not found
Characterizing the adoption and frequency of use of a pooled rides service,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103632,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Pooled-ride services have a significant potential for reducing traffic externalities and enhancing transportation systems in the urban environment. These services and their users’ characteristics still need further inspection and exploration. We investigated factors encouraging the shift from the currently used modes to pooled-ride-services, the choice between different pooled services vehicles types, and the frequency of use of pooled-rides, using data collected via a large-scale online survey conducted in Mexico City, Mexico (CDMX) for a start-up that organizes pooled rides, Jetty. We modeled the pooled-ride-service adoption process as a function of the users’ sociodemographics, latent travel attitudes, accessibility to public transportation, trip characteristics, reasons to use the service, and users’ activities during the trips. We estimated hybrid choice models and binary logit models, which show that users’ sociodemographic and travel attitudes are the main factors impacting the shift from different modes to pooled rides. Service-related characteristics such as multi-tasking, trip fare, and avoiding parking problems also impact the shift decision. On the other hand, the frequency of service use is mainly impacted by trip characteristics such as total trip distance, and the headway at the user’s home location nearest Metro stations.

Designing van-based mobile battery swapping and rebalancing services for dockless ebike-sharing systems based on the dueling double deep Q-network,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103620,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Ebike-sharing (electric bicycle-sharing) systems are gaining popularity as ebikes provide riders with transportation convenience when people have limited accessibility to other travel modes. Compared to traditional bike-sharing systems, ebike-sharing systems are more complicated as the platform needs to handle battery recharging issues as well as the imbalance between supply and demand. However, previous studies have not discussed how to address the two issues effectively. In this paper, we consider a dockless ebike-sharing system with removable ebike batteries and introduce vans to such a system to solve recharging and rebalancing problems simultaneously. In other words, during the operational horizon, van drivers can choose among rebalancing tasks, battery swapping tasks, and half-rebalancing-half-swapping tasks. This paper utilizes the Markov decision process to depict the highly dynamic ebike-sharing system with a platform player (agent) and a representative van driver player (agent). In such a system, van drivers choose their tasks to maximize their income, and the platform allocates spatiotemporal subsidies with predefined subsidy amounts to incentivize van drivers and optimize the profit. To efficiently solve the dynamic optimization problem with mixed agents, we apply the dueling double deep Q-network method which is an advanced reinforcement learning approach. We conduct numerical studies based on a real-world dataset in New York City, and evaluate the performance of the proposed operational services under different schemes. Our results show that the proposed van-based services for battery swapping and rebalancing could help increase the platform's profit and van drivers' earnings, and improve system performance. Additionally, it is also proved that the platform, van drivers, and the overall ebike-sharing system all benefit from spatiotemporal subsidies.",0968-090X,Not found
Managing public transit during a pandemic: The trade-off between safety and mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103592,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"During a pandemic such as COVID-19, managing public transit effectively becomes a critical policy decision. On the one hand, efficient transportation plays a pivotal role in enabling the movement of essential workers and keeping the economy moving. On the other hand, public transit can be a vector for disease propagation due to travelers’ proximity within shared and enclosed spaces. Without strategic preparedness, mass transit facilities are potential hotbeds for spreading infectious diseases. Thus, transportation agencies face a complex trade-off when developing context-specific operating strategies for public transit. This work provides a network-based analysis framework for understanding this trade-off, as well as tools for calculating targeted commute restrictions under different policy constraints, e.g., regarding public health considerations (limiting infection levels) and economic activity (limiting the reduction in travel). The resulting plans ensure that the traffic flow restrictions imposed on each route are adaptive to the time-varying epidemic dynamics. A case study based on the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that a well-planned subway system in New York City can sustain 88% of transit flow while reducing the risk of disease transmission by 50% relative to fully-loaded public transit systems. Transport policy-makers can exploit this optimization-based framework to address safety-and-mobility trade-offs and make proactive transit management plans during an epidemic outbreak.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal information perturbation for traffic congestion mitigation: Gaussian process regression and optimization,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103647,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Information perturbation is an information provision strategy which strategically alters the traffic information sent to drivers, aiming to mitigate network congestion caused by selfish routing decisions. Previous works have integrated information perturbation into coordinated routing mechanisms and theoretically proved that the system performance improvement due to information perturbation is more significant than the corresponding average user optimality loss. However, they do not give direct guidance as to which perturbation level should be implemented to manage the competing effects of system performance improvement and user optimality loss most efficiently. Accordingly, the goal of this work is to uncover the optimal perturbation that should be included in the information sent to vehicles under a coordinated routing scheme under some known network condition. The optimal perturbation problem considers the tradeoff between system performance improvement and user optimality loss due to perturbation, while ensuring that no exorbitant individual user optimality loss occurs. The relationships used in the optimization models are obtained through gaussian process regression, which are trained using the output of computer experiments. We pay special attention to the input features of these models, which impact the system performance and user optimality loss in our model the most—namely the perturbation, demand, and routing competition levels. We model route competition levels through a new parameter called weighted concentration, and present a novel approach for sampling weighted competition values for a single demand level. We present several candidate gaussian process specifications which are used in the optimization, including single and multiple output. Finally, we demonstrate the merit of our methodology through a sensitivity analysis using the Sioux Falls network as a test case. Here, we find that our optimization approach can find robust solutions (in terms of their proximity to local optimums) relatively high rate, with a satisfied solution time.",0968-090X,Not found
Planning for modular-vehicle transit service system: Model formulation and solution methods,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103627,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper studies the optimal planning of public transit services with modular vehicles. In the modular service operation, the vehicle is comprised of smaller modular units/pods, which can be assembled/dissembled at some specially designed transit stations. The planning decisions are to determine the locations of the specially constructed stations enabling station-wise assembling/dissembling of modular units. Meanwhile, the capacity of these stations, i.e., the maximum number of modular units that can be accommodated, will also be determined. The optimal vehicle formation at these stations will be considered for the multi-period passenger demand to evaluate the system performance. Aiming to minimize the total cost of the operator and passengers, we formulate this problem into a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Two solution methods are proposed to solve the problem. One is to transform the formulated MINLP into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using various linearization reformulation techniques, which can be solved by using many existing solution methods for MILP. Despite that this method ensures exact solutions, its solution efficiency is compromised. To solve a practical large-size problem, we propose another solution method applying surrogate model-based optimization approaches. A case study in the context of a proposed Singapore dynamic autonomous road transit (DART) line is conducted. Numerical experiments have been carried out to test the validity of the model formulation and the solution performance of the proposed solution methods. The advantage of the modular-vehicle transit service in significantly reducing the operating cost and passengers’ travel time costs has been demonstrated as well.

This paper models impacts of time-dependent order cancellation behaviour on the driver–rider matching efficiency and examines ridesourcing platform operation strategies, where taxi is the alternative to the ridesourcing mode. A time-dependent matching model is developed to characterize the complex interaction among participants (drivers and riders) considering ridesourcing order cancellation behaviour, where the impact of the cancelled orders on the numbers of drivers and riders is explicitly modelled. In particular, we formulate the time-dependent order cancellation rates before and after the matching stage (i.e., cancellation of unconfirmed and confirmed orders). Under the proposed model, a platform profit maximization problem is formulated and three pricing strategies are examined. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the dynamic pricing (i.e., customer/rider fare and driver wage) can well accommodate time-dependent system inputs (e.g., demand rates) and thus enable the platform to increase profit via better market segmentation. We also investigate the objective of maximizing the number of completed trips and examine the trade-off between the platform profit and the number of completed trips. In addition, we show that the relaxation of upper bounds of the ridesourcing fare and order cancellation penalty can increase the ridesourcing platform’s profit and indirectly improve the utilization rate of taxis as well as the taxi company’s profit.",0968-090X,Not found

Continuum approximation (C.A.) is used to reduce the computation burden by formulating the design problem with respect to a few decision variables. We compare the performance of the proposed transit system with (i) the typical fixed-route system, (ii) the homogeneous flexible-route grid system, and (iii) the flexible-route grid system with local routes, in hypothetical settings. It is found through our numerical examples that the integration of the three proposed features (i.e. flexible transit, local tubes, and hybrid structure), as compared to counterparts with only two or fewer features, yields lower combined agency and user costs under the assumed low heterogeneous demand distribution.

In order to measure reliability during the service planning phase, a key piece of information is the long-term prediction of the density of the travel time, which conveys the uncertainty of travel times. This work empirically compares probabilistic models for the prediction of the conditional probability density function (PDF) of the travel time and proposes a simulation framework taking as input the latter distributions to approximate the expected secondary delays, a measure of the reliability of public transport services. Two types of probabilistic models, namely similarity-based density estimation models and a smoothed logistic regression for probabilistic classification model, are compared on a dataset of more than 41,000 trips and 50 bus routes of the city of Montréal. A similarity-based density estimation model using a k -nearest neighbors method and a log-logistic distribution predicted the best estimate of the true conditional PDF of the travel time and generated the most accurate approximations of the expected secondary delays on this dataset.

The proposed model reveals information on two parameters: the actual defect arrival rate and the probability of not finding any defects, namely, the zero-inflation rate. Then, we study optimizing the track maintenance based on this model. We demonstrate that a temporal threshold-type inspection policy is optimal, and we derive this threshold under imperfect inspections. Furthermore, we implement a Gibbs sampler for drawing inferences on the posterior distribution of the aforementioned Poisson process parameters from data.

Therefore, several researchers suggest approaches for generating Virtual Vehicle Trajectories (VVT) given some partially observed traffic data. However, the traditional VVT generation approaches, being originally developed for travel time estimations, usually consider a simplified description of vehicle kinematics, hindering their applicability in emission modelling. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach for generating VVT, which facilitates their use in emission modelling. We empirically evaluate our method by comparing it to the traditional approaches.

Ridesharing and fleet sizing for On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103594,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper considers the design of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS) that combine fixed bus/rail routes between transit hubs with on-demand shuttles that serve the first/last miles to/from the hubs. The design problem aims at finding a network design for the fixed routes to allow a set of riders to travel from their origins to their destinations, while minimizing the sum of the travel costs, the bus operating costs, and rider travel times. The paper addresses two gaps in existing tools for designing ODMTS. First, it generalizes prior work by including ridesharing in the shuttle rides. Second, it proposes novel fleet-sizing algorithms for determining the number of shuttles needed to meet the performance metrics of the ODMTS design. Both contributions are based on Mixed-Integer Programs (MIP). For the ODMTS design, the MIP reasons about pickup and dropoff routes in order to capture ridesharing, grouping riders who travel to/from the same hub. The fleet-sizing optimization is modeled as a minimum flow problem with covering constraints. The natural formulation leads to a dense graph and computational issues, which is addressed by a reformulation that works on a sparse graph. The methodological contributions are evaluated on a real case study: the public transit system of the broader Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The results demonstrate the substantial potential of ridesharing for ODMTS, as costs are reduced by about 26% with respect to allowing only individual shuttle rides, at the expense of a minimal increase in transit times. Compared to the existing system, the designed ODMTS also cuts down costs by 35% and reduces transit times by 38%.",0968-090X,Not found

A centralized algorithm is then proposed to dispatch idle drivers to arriving passenger orders and determine whether to advise passengers to use a combined mode of ride-sourcing and public transit services (if yes, the algorithm also needs to recommend an appropriate transportation hub). In particular, our proposed algorithm contains a reinforcement learning approach that estimates the long-term expected rewards, and an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) that matches idle drivers and waiting passengers in real-time based on both immediate revenue and the estimated long-term rewards.

Unlike traditional sensors that can observe both CVs and non-connected vehicles (NCVs), CV-enabled infrastructures, known as roadside units (RSUs), can only identify CVs on roads through vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. They can, however, provide critical traffic information, including traces of the historical trajectories of CVs and possibly the desired path to a destination, thereby inferring partial information on links that are not directly covered by RSUs. RSUs have an “area” rather than a “point” coverage capability. This allows them to simultaneously monitor more than one link. We mathematically developed four variant formulations for the path flow reconstruction problem to optimally locate either a network’s RSU or a mix of the network’s RSUs and automatic vehicle identification (AVI) sensors. The first two models assume 100% market penetration of CVs and the first model determines the links that should be directly covered by RSUs in a road network. While the desired path to a destination is assumed to be unknown. This model determines an upper bound for the number of RSUs required to fully reconstruct path flows by using each RSU to directly cover a link. To consider the coverage and range of the RSU (where RSU can cover more than one link) and to minimize the total cost, Model II optimizes the locations of traditional AVI sensors and RSUs. This allows the model to capitalize on the RSUs’ area and indirect coverage features to fully reconstruct path flow in a road network. Model III considers the gradual deployment of CVs and thus the prevailing mixed traffic environment consisting of both CVs and NCVs. Accordingly, this model relaxes the assumption of a 100% penetration rate of CVs and maximizes the path flow information gain subject to a budget constraint in a mixed traffic environment. Finally, Model IV explores the infrastructure to infrastructure (I2I) communication capability among RSUs, further maximizing the traffic flow information gain of CVs while guaranteeing full path flow reconstruction. The results suggest that fewer RSUs than AVI sensors are required to reach full path flow reconstruction in a road network. The level of unique path flow information obtained from RSUs is also considerably higher than what can be obtained from AVI sensors. It is demonstrated that, in mixed traffic conditions, the coverage range of RSUs and their cost compared to AVI sensors can significantly affect the deployment of either type of sensing devices for maximized path flow information gain.",0968-090X,Not found
Managing lane-changing of algorithm-assisted drivers,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103586,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Theoretical models of vehicular traffic ascribe the fundamental cause of velocity oscillations and stop-and-go waves to suboptimal or unpredictable human driving behavior. In this paper we ask: if vehicles were controlled or assisted by algorithms, and hence driven “optimally,” would these phenomena simply go away? If they do not, how should a regulator manage algorithm-assisted vehicular traffic for a smooth flow? We study these questions in the context of a mandatory lane-changing scenario from the perspective of an algorithm-assisted driver on a curtailed lane that has to merge to an adjacent free lane with a relatively dense platoon. In a stylized model of algorithm-assisted driving, we liken the blocked-lane driver to a rational self-interested agent, whose objective is to minimize her expected travel time through the blockage, deciding (a) at what velocity to move, and (b) whether to merge to the free lane if an adequate gap arises. Moving at higher velocities reduces travel time, but also reduces the probability of finding a large enough gap to merge. We analyze the problem via dynamic programming, and we show that the optimal policy has a surprising structure: in the presence of uncertainty on adequate-sized gaps in the target lane, it may be optimal for the blocked-lane driver, in certain parameter regimes, to oscillate between high and low velocities while attempting to merge. Hence, traffic oscillations can arise not just due to suboptimal or unpredictable human driving behavior, but also endogenously, as the outcome of a driver’s rational, optimizing behavior. We provide theoretical support for this finding by drawing similarities to bang–bang control. As velocity oscillations are known to be detrimental to a smooth traffic flow, we provide sufficient conditions such that traffic oscillations, due to such optimizing behavior, do not arise. Finally, we investigate the fundamental flow-density and travel time-density diagrams through traffic micro-simulations performed in SUMO. We establish that the proposed approach exhibits consistently near-optimal performance, in a broad variety of traffic conditions.",0968-090X,Not found
Network traffic instability with automated driving and cooperative merging,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103626,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Connected and/or automated vehicles (CAVs or AVs) have been shown to dampen stop-and-go waves in mixed autonomy traffic, thus improving string stability. However, their effects on network traffic instability due to turning and merging maneuvers are less known. In this paper, we characterize such effects using the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD). We first revisit and extend the theoretical two-ring network, and then develop an integrated modeling and simulation framework that explicitly accounts for different microscopic traffic models of human-driven vehicles (HVs), AVs, and CAVs. Results suggest that network traffic instability resulting from turning and merging maneuvers persists even if vehicles become automated and cooperative. When the turning probability is low, the presence of CAVs does not induce a significant change in the bifurcation point of the NFD. Scatter in both link fundamental diagrams (FDs) and NFDs, however, reduces resulting in higher and more stable network flows. When the turning probability is high, AVs without cooperation turn out to worsen network traffic stability, giving rise to an NFD that undergoes bifurcation long before the theoretical critical network density is reached. This is in contrast to the case with CAVs that perform cooperative merging. Results also suggest that, whenever the penetration rate of CAVs is too low or too high, making HVs connected is not as effective in delaying the bifurcation of the NFD as when the penetration rate is moderate. We further compare cooperative merging with adaptive signal control and adaptive driver routing to demonstrate its benefits in improving network flows. Simulation experiments on a real motorway segment in Sydney, Australia are also performed to confirm our findings.",0968-090X,Not found
Damping behavior analysis for connected automated vehicles with linear car following control,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103617,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Connected automated vehicles (CAVs), built upon advanced vehicle control and communication technology, can improve traffic throughput, safety, and energy efficiency. Previous studies on CAVs control focus on instability and stability properties of CAV platoons; however, these analyses cannot reveal the damping platoon oscillation characteristics, which are important for enhancing CAV platoon reliability against variant continuous perturbations. To this end, this research seeks to characterize the damping oscillations of CAVs through exploiting the platoon's unforced oscillatory, i.e., damping behavior. Inspired by the mechanical vibration theory, the proposed approach is applied to a CAV platoon with linear car-following control formulated as Helly's model and the predecessor-following communication topology. The proposed approach is applied to a CAV platoon with the linear car-following control formulated as Helly's model and the predecessor-following communication topology. Numerical analysis results show that a periodic perturbation with the resonance frequency of the CAV platoon will amplify the oscillation and lead to the severest oscillatory traffic. Our analysis highlights the importance of preventing platoon oscillations from resonance in ensuring CAV platooning reliability.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperative signal-free intersection control using virtual platooning and traffic flow regulation,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103610,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The emerging technologies of connectivity and automation enable the potential for signal-free intersection control. In this context, virtual platooning is posited to be an innovative, decentralized control strategy that maps two-dimensional vehicle movements onto a one-dimension virtual platoon to enable intersection operations. However, the effectiveness of virtual platooning-based control can be limited or degraded by parametric inaccuracies and unparameterized disturbances in vehicle dynamics, heavy traffic congestion, and/or uncoordinated platoons in multi-lane intersections. To explicitly address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid cooperative intersection control framework consisting of microscopic-level virtual platooning control and macroscopic-level traffic flow regulation for traffic environments with connected autonomous vehicles. In virtual platooning control, vehicles approaching an intersection are organized into coordinated independent virtual platoons to avoid potential conflicts triggered by platoon formation changes. Through coordination, vehicles in a platoon are grouped into compatible passing sets to maintain desired safe spacing when proceeding through the intersection. We propose a distributed adaptive sliding mode controller (DASMC) which uses the backstepping control method and model reference adaptive control method to address parametric inaccuracies, and the sliding mode control method to consistently suppress the negative effects of the unparameterized disturbances. Each vehicle approaching the intersection utilizes the kinematic information from neighboring vehicles to implement the DASMC in a distributed manner such that vehicles within the same virtual platoon can achieve consensus safely. However, virtual platooning control cannot preclude excessive traffic from approaching the intersection, which can cause undesired spillbacks and degrade intersection control performance. To address this issue, traffic flow regulation is integrated with the virtual platooning control using an iterative feedback loop mechanism. In each iteration of the iterative feedback loop, a constrained finite-time optimal control (CFTOC) problem is solved to determine the optimal input flow permitted to proceed through the intersection, and the virtual platooning control provides feedback on the queue status to the CFTOC to initiate the next iteration. The effectiveness of the proposed intersection control framework is evaluated through numerical experiments. The results indicate that the proposed virtual platooning DASMC controller can mitigate the effects of parametric inaccuracies and unparameterized disturbances to achieve consensus for approaching vehicles, as well as guarantee string stability. Further, the proposed framework can alleviate traffic spillbacks and travel delays effectively through traffic flow regulation.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimate the limit of predictability in short-term traffic forecasting: An entropy-based approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103607,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Accurate short-term traffic forecasting is the cornerstone for Intelligent Transportation Systems. In the past several decades, many models have been proposed to continuously improve the predictive accuracy. A key but unsolved question is whether there is a theoretical bound to the accuracy with which traffic can be predicted and whether that limit can be directly estimated from data. To answer this question, we use core concepts in information theory to derive the limit of predictability in short-term traffic forecasting. Theoretical analysis proves that conditional differential entropy poses a rigorous lower bound of negative-log-likelihood (NLL) for probabilistic models. And the continuous form of Fano’s theorem further gives a loose lower bound of mean-square-error (MSE) for deterministic models. Based on the special properties of traffic dynamics, two assumptions are made in the estimate of entropy metrics: cyclostationarity (traffic phenomena show strong periodicity) and localized spatial correlation (due to kinematic wave propagation). They allow formulating the limit of predictability as a function of longitudinal space and time-of-day which finds the most uncertain locations and periods solely from data. Experiments on univariate traffic accumulation forecasting and network-level speed forecasting show that the selected models, including some state-of-the-art deep learning models, indeed cannot outperform the estimated lower bounds but just approach them. The limit of predictability depends on time-of-day, network locations, observation range, and prediction horizon. The results reveal that the stochastic nature of traffic dynamics and improper assumptions on the prior distribution of output are two major factors that restrict the predictive performance. In summary, the proposed method estimates a trustworthy performance boundary for most traffic forecasting models. These conclusions are helpful for further studies in this domain.",0968-090X,Not found
Predictive and prescriptive performance of bike-sharing demand forecasts for inventory management,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103571,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Bike-sharing systems are a rapidly developing mode of transportation and provide an efficient alternative to passive, motorized personal mobility. The asymmetric nature of bike demand causes the need for rebalancing bike stations, which is typically done during nighttime. To determine the optimal starting inventory level of a station for a given day, a User Dissatisfaction Function (UDF) models user pickups and returns as non-homogeneous Poisson processes with piece-wise linear rates. In this paper, we devise a deep generative model directly applicable in the UDF by introducing a variational Poisson recurrent neural network model (VP-RNN) to forecast future pickup and return rates. We empirically evaluate our approach against both traditional and learning-based forecasting methods on real trip travel data from the city of New York, USA, and show how our model outperforms benchmarks in terms of system efficiency and demand satisfaction. By explicitly focusing on the combination of decision-making algorithms with learning-based forecasting methods, we highlight a number of shortcomings in literature. Crucially, we show how more accurate predictions do not necessarily translate into better inventory decisions. By providing insights into the interplay between forecasts, model assumptions, and decisions, we point out that forecasts and decision models should be carefully evaluated and harmonized to optimally control shared mobility systems.",0968-090X,Not found
Prediction of train arrival delays considering route conflicts at multi-line stations,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103606,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Multi-line stations (MLSs) are the intersections of different railway lines; they are crucial for delay propagation in railway networks. Therefore, the precise prediction of train arrival delays at the MLSs can efficiently support train operation rescheduling plans and reduce delay propagation in the railway network. The arrival routes of trains at the MLSs are critical factors for managing train arrival delays, since there may be latent route conflicts with forward arrival/departure trains. However, route conflicts will not occur at single-line stations (SLSs) that are traversed by only one railway line. Existing train delay prediction studies have considered the ways that trains arrive at/depart from stations as black boxes, but have not considered the latent route conflicts from a microscopic view. This study considers the arrival routes of predicted trains and route conflicts with forward trains, for contemplating the gap (not considering the route conflicts from other railway lines) in the existing studies. The influencing factors are separated into three categories according to the data attributes, namely, route-related variables, delay-related variables, and environment-related variables. Then, an architecture called LLCF-net is proposed, with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) block for route-related variables, two long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for delay-related variables, and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) block for environment-related variables. Compared with the methods in exiting studies, this architecture showed the best performance for both two MLSs—GuangzhouSouth(GZS) and ChangshaSouth (CSS)—on the Chinese high-speed railway network, regardless of the consideration of route-related variables. In addition, LLCF-net is proven to have a strong predictive effectiveness and a robust performance for different delay lengths.",0968-090X,Not found
Online parking assignment in an environment of partially connected vehicles: A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103624,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The advent of connected vehicles (CVs) provides new opportunities to address urban parking issues due to the widespread application of online parking assignment (OPA) services. However, before CVs fully replace non-connected vehicles (NCVs), it is envisioned that CVs and NCVs will coexist for a long time. This brings challenges for OPA because of the availability constraints imposed by the uncertain arrivals and departures of NCVs. This paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework to generate efficient OPA strategies with partial observations of parking demand. Specifically, we create two agents, one for measuring the impact of NCVs and the other for exploring the parking characteristics of CVs. A value decomposition method is adopted to solve the multi-agent learning problem, and a modified exploration strategy is designed to direct agent training and avoid unnecessary trials. To verify the performance of the proposed approach, we derive the baselines of the total time expenditure in a parking area based on the widely adopted first-come-first-served strategy and a hypothetical system optimum strategy, respectively. Also, we present a dynamic assignment model with forecasting as a comparison of the proposed approach with the same demand information. Two typical parking scenarios are selected to conduct comparative experiments with actual operating data. The experimental results show that the proposed learning-based approach can effectively allocate parking resources. Provided with user parking information of CVs short in advance, our approach can achieve up to 15% improvement in assignment performance compared with other baselines.",0968-090X,Not found
Charging operations in battery electric bus systems considering fleet size variability along the service,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103609,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper analyzes the new operations induced by the energy range limitation in battery electric bus (BEB) systems to ensure the service provision along the whole day. An operating model has been developed to estimate the number of resources to be deployed (extra vehicles and charging facilities) for two charging schemes: charging at bus garage facility and opportunity charging at on-street chargers. Firstly, the model calculates the entrance and exit time of buses in service assuming an unlimited battery capacity, caused by demand and headway variations in different time periods along day. Then, based on the previous results, the model estimates the moment when vehicles will run out of energy and proposes a charging schedule as well as new vehicle movements between chargers, bus garage and routes to maintain the targeted headway. Consequently, the model is able to calculate the number of resources needed and the total cost for a given route and battery size, allowing cost and performance comparison to diesel and hybrid powertrains. The estimated results in two bus routes in Barcelona indicate that the purchasing cost of BEB vehicles (670,000 euros/veh for articulated, 500,000Euros/veh for standard vehicles, both depreciated over a lifetime of 15 years), battery packs (231 Euro/kWh purchased, depreciated over a lifetime of 10 years), as well as the investment in chargers, are still high to clearly justify their cost-competitiveness against diesel or hybrid counterparts. Nevertheless, if the acquisition cost of both vehicles and battery pack are only reduced by 9%, the BEB technology may present cost savings for transit agencies. It only happens if the fleet size is as large as the corresponding to diesel and hybrid technologies. Opportunity charging is resulted to be more cost- efficient than charging at bus garage for small battery packs, routes with acceptable time headway adherence and, specially, when fast chargers are located very close to terminal stops. Nevertheless, when the real bus route design and operation do not fulfill these standards, charging scheme at bus garage is preferable.",0968-090X,Not found
Research on delay propagation mechanism of air traffic control system based on causal inference,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103622,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"In the air traffic control (ATC) system, delays are tightly coupled among airports. Understanding the interactions of these delays is a prerequisite for accurate prediction. However, most researches in this field depend on correlation methods, and few studies apply causal discovery methods. The latest approach uses the cause-and-effect diagram discovery algorithm PCMCI to mine the causal dependencies between time series. In the application context of the ATC system, not all delays have the propagation effect because of a series of optimization measures by airports and airlines. This paper proposes an extreme event measurement mechanism to solve the above problem by setting the airport thresholds adaptively through a complete search of the parameter space. The improved method allows for a more accurate exploration of the time lag delay propagation relationship between airports. The experimental simulation results show that the algorithm in this paper can extract time lag causality in nonlinear, multidimensional time series considering the ATC system characteristics. In addition, we use the causality of airport delays to construct an extreme delay propagation network (EDPN), use complex network theory and related metrics to analyze the network at the system level, and propose a new critical airport identification metric. In the case study of the U.S. aviation system, we find that small airports have a weak ability to mitigate extreme delays and are more likely to propagate delays to other airports in addition to their own impacts; Larger airports have strong mitigation and robustness to extreme delays but suffer from overload operations. These findings are helpful to explain the interactions of delay processes, and can provide specific theoretical support in improving system operation efficiency and developing delay propagation mitigation measures.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimization of pricing and relocation in the competitive carsharing market: A multi-leader-follower game model,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103613,138,2022-05-01,2022,5,"One-way carsharing, as a shared mobility service, is attracting increasing attention due to its flexibility and social benefits. Spurred by this trend, an increasing number of companies have been formed, which promotes the expansion of the carsharing market. In the presence of intensifying competitive pressure, it has become imperative for companies to determine their optimal operational strategies by adjusting their pricing and relocation strategies to ensure financially sustainable service operations. Indeed, the most urgent issue that must be addressed is the modeling of an integrated framework combining the pricing and relocation strategies of operators in a competitive market. To solve this problem, a game-theoretical multi-leader–follower model is proposed to maximize the profit of each company involved and minimize the disutility of travelers, the Nash equilibrium solution of which is obtained by developing a diagonalization algorithm framework. Specifically, in each iteration, a bilevel model is solved to obtain the best response, which is the most favorable outcome for a certain company given competing companies’ strategies. The upper level aims to determine the pricing and relocation strategy of each company, while the lower level assigns trip demand by solving a stochastic user equilibrium problem. The proposed method is applied to a hypothetical case study and a realistic example in the context of Quanzhou city, China, and its performance is demonstrated by extensive sensitivity analysis. The results show that the total profits of the market rise with the number of companies increasing, but the average profit and price drop.

Real-time dispatching of operating buses during unplanned disruptions to urban rail transit system,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103696,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Unplanned disruptions to urban rail systems can result in widespread confusion and severe delays, and running bus bridging service is a common solution. Currently, transit operators usually adopt experience-based response strategy in such a way that spare buses from bus terminals and parking lots are used to run bus bridging services. Such a response approach can be effective when there are spare buses available at nearby terminals/parking lots. However, in case spare buses are not available or enough, it could be beneficial to dispatch running buses from nearby operating bus lines to ensure efficient response while incurring minimal inconvenience to on-board passengers. While this approach could reduce metro users’ delays, it causes extra delays and dissatisfaction to affected bus riders. In this study, we investigate the optimal bus dispatching problem for responding to unplanned disruptions of urban rail transit system with two bus fleet sources: (1) spare buses at terminals and parking lots, and (2) running buses from nearby operating bus lines. To obtain the optimal dispatching scheme, we develop an integer programming model, which achieves a balance between the delays of metro users and that of bus riders. Considering of the high uncertainty of bus headways which could affect the performance of the above deterministic model, we further develop a robust optimization model to obtain more reliable bus dispatching schemes. Case studies based on the data sets in Shanghai are conducted. The results demonstrate that our approach can be carried out in real-time, and employing running buses from operating bus lines shows great potential in reducing affected users’ delays.

Impacts of this approach on operations, fuel efficiency, and safety are compared to traditional LMS using a calibrated simulation model of a site where traditional LMS is present. High fidelity simulation runs of drive cycles were conducted using the Autonomie® model to estimate fuel efficiency effects. The simulation results showed that starting at a lower penetration of 20% CAVs, an average throughput improvement of 3.5% was observed, increasing to a maximum of 14.2% for full penetration of CAVs. The drive cycle simulations revealed a reduction of 47% to 60% in fuel consumption with the CAV based application. Both lane change and rear-end conflicts were also observed to reduce. Likewise, volatility represented by acceleration-deceleration variation, was reduced by an average of 18.2% and 17.6% under varying penetrations of CAVs. Volatility represents variation in driving regimes over an instantaneous period of driving, so this reduction in volatility serves as a positive surrogate indicator of safety and fuel efficiency for this new application as well.",0968-090X,Not found
Worldwide city transport typology prediction with sentence-BERT based supervised learning via Wikipedia,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103661,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"An overwhelming majority of the world’s human population lives in urban areas and cities. Understanding a city’s transportation typology is immensely valuable for planners and policy makers whose decisions can potentially impact millions of city residents.

However, most previous studies investigating dynamic ridesharing systems overlook the effects on travel times due to the assignment of requests to vehicles and their routes. In order to assign the ridesharing vehicles while considering network traffic dynamics, we propose a strategy that incorporates time-dependent link travel time predictions into the request–vehicle assignment to avoid or mitigate traffic congestion. In particular, we formulate an efficient linear assignment problem that considers multiple path alternatives and accounts for the impact on travel times, which may be potentially caused by vehicles assigned to specific routes.

Researchers have extensively studied how AVs drive along highways. Nonetheless, how AVs navigate intersections in urban environments remains a challenging task due to the constant presence of moving road users, including turning vehicles, crossing or jaywalking pedestrians, and cyclists. AVs are thus required to learn and adapt to a dynamically evolving urban traffic environment. This paper proposes a design benchmark that allows AVs to sense the real-time traffic environment and perform path planning. The agent dynamically generates curves for feasible paths. The ego vehicle attempts to follow these paths under specific constraints. RL and MPC navigation algorithms run in parallel and are suitably selected to enhance ego vehicle safety. The ego AV is modeled with lateral and longitudinal dynamics and trained in a T-intersection using the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm under various traffic scenarios.

Three supply regimes for autonomous cars are investigated: welfare-maximizing public supply, competitive marginal cost supply, and profit-maximizing private supply. Pricing rules under different supply regimes are compared analytically, and the relative efficiencies in terms of the welfare gains are compared numerically.

This framework has been applied to the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), Gipps’ model, and to three basic ACC algorithms. These are linear controllers which are coupled with a constant time-headway spacing policy, and with two other policies derived from the traffic flow theory: the IDM desired distance function, and Gipps’ equilibrium distance-speed function. The ninety models resulting from the combination of the five base models with the aforementioned extensions, have been assessed and compared through a vast calibration and validation experiment against measured trajectory data of vehicles driven by ACC systems. Overall, the study has shown that physics-based extensions provide limited improvements to the accuracy of existing models. In addition, if an investigation against measured data is not carried out, it is not possible to argue which extension is the most suited for a specific model. The linear controller with Gipps’ spacing policy has resulted the most accurate model, while the IDM the most robust to different input trajectories.

Adaptive conflict resolution for multi-UAV 4D routes optimization using stochastic fractal search algorithm,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103666,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The increasing unmanned aircraft system (UAS) applications in urban environments pose challenges for safe and efficient low altitude air traffic management. As an essential enabler to meet these challenges, pre-flight 4D routes optimization is required to conduct conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) and to generate conflict-free flight routes before departure. Existing studies on strategic deconfliction cover several types of strategies such as scheduling or rerouting. However, a single type of strategy used to solve different types of conflicts may lead to an unsafe and inefficient way of conflict resolution. This paper proposes an adaptive decision-making framework to optimize the resolution strategies used for different types of conflicts with explainable mechanisms. The proposed framework is formulated as a double-layer optimization problem with the considerations of scheduling, speed adjustment, and rerouting strategies for conflict resolution. The first layer of the framework is established as a probabilistic selection model to make decisions on which strategy should be selected for what type of conflict. The second layer is developed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to optimize the decision variables of the strategies selected by the first layer. To solve the proposed double-layer optimization problem, we introduce and improve a novel meta-heuristic stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithm with two major improvements of a penalty-guided fitness function and an exploitation-exploration balancing scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive conflict resolution framework successfully optimizes the strategies used for each type of flight conflict, which subsequently optimizes the 4D routes with significant reductions in total operational cost, number of flight conflicts, and flight delays. The improved stochastic fractal search (ISFS) algorithm is also proved effective and reliable in solving the proposed optimization problem in different traffic density scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found
Modal equilibrium of a tradable credit scheme with a trip-based MFD and logit-based decision-making,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103642,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The literature about tradable credit schemes (TCS) as a demand management system alleviating congestion flourished in the past decade. Most proposed formulations are based on static models and thus do not account for the congestion dynamics. This paper considers elastic demand and implements a static TCS to foster modal shift by restricting the number of cars allowed in the network over the day while remaining easy to understand and implement. A trip-based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model represents the traffic dynamics at the whole urban scale. We assume the users have different OD pairs and choose between driving their car or riding the transit following a logit model. We aim to compute the modal shares and credit price at equilibrium under TCS. The travel times are linearized with respect to the modal shares to derive the stochastic user equilibrium with low computation times. We then present a method to find the credit charge minimizing the total travel time alone or combined with the carbon emissions. We also show that traffic dynamics and trip heterogeneity lead to different network equilibriums under TCS. It highlights the limitations of classical static representations. The proposed framework is applied to a realistic large-scale scenario: the peak hour (7:00–10:00) in Lyon Metropolis, including 384 200 travelers. Under an optimized TCS, the total travel time decreases by 17% and the carbon emissions by 45% by increasing the PT share by 24 points.",0968-090X,Not found
AdapGL: An adaptive graph learning algorithm for traffic prediction based on spatiotemporal neural networks,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103659,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"With well-defined graphs, graph convolution based spatiotemporal neural networks for traffic prediction have achieved great performance in numerous tasks. Compared to other methods, the networks can exploit the latent spatial dependencies between nodes according to the adjacency relationship. However, as the topological structure of the real road network tends to be intricate, it is difficult to accurately quantify the correlations between nodes in advance. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network based adaptive graph learning algorithm (AdapGL) to acquire the complex dependencies. First, by developing a novel graph learning module, more possible correlations between nodes can be adaptively captured during training. Second, inspired by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the parameters of the prediction network module and the graph learning module are optimized by alternate training. An elaborate loss function is leveraged for graph learning to ensure the sparsity of the generated affinity matrix. In this way, the expectation maximization of one part can be realized under the condition that the other part is the best estimate. Finally, the graph structure is updated by a weighted sum approach. The proposed algorithm can be applied to most graph convolution based networks for traffic forecast. Experimental results demonstrated that our method can not only further improve the accuracy of traffic prediction, but also effectively exploit the hidden correlations of the nodes.

A stochastic framework using Bayesian optimization algorithm to assess the network-level societal impacts of connected and autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103663,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Connected and autonomous vehicle technologies are expected to alter transportation systems by enhancements in mobility, safety, and emission reduction. While many studies have investigated the impacts of connected vehicle (CV) and autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies on traffic congestion and emission at the facility level, little is known about these impacts at large scales. Furthermore, different effective parameters associated with these impacts, such as the extra vehicle miles traveled (VMT) induced by AVs, technology cost of these vehicles, and possible reductions in the value of time of AV users, are highly uncertain. The uncertainty of these parameters and its role in assessing the societal impacts of CVs and AVs are not fully explored in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to develop a stochastic framework and an optimization algorithm to find the optimum market shares of CVs and AVs in a mixed traffic environment, consisting of human-driven vehicles without connectivity (HDVs), CVs, and AVs, minimizing the system cost. Emission, travel time, and technology costs are considered as components of the system cost. Thus, the framework combines a traffic simulation tool that considers a mixed fleet of HDVs, CVs, and AVs with heterogeneous drivers (for HDVs and CVs) distributed spatially over the network, along with an emission estimation model, to measure network-wide travel time and emission costs. Many parameters, such as extra VMT produced by AVs, value of time reduction for AV users, and automation cost, are subject to a considerable degree of stochasticity, which is considered by assuming probabilistic distributions for these parameters. A Bayesian Optimization algorithm with heteroskedastic non-stationary Gaussian process model is presented to estimate the optimum market shares of CVs and AVs considering these uncertainties. The stochastic framework and the optimization algorithm are successfully applied to a large-scale network of Chicago. The impacts of different parameters on the optimum CV and AV market shares and the system cost are explored, providing practical insights for policymakers.",0968-090X,Not found
Evaluation of e-scooters as transit last-mile solution,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103660,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"E-scooters are an alternative for short trips and are particularly suitable for solving the last-mile transit problem, yet their impact on transit is not well understood. There is a need to understand the e-scooter demand patterns and users’ characteristics to develop adequate policies and regulations. In this research, we consider the problem of modeling the interaction of e-scooters and bus transit services and provide an overview of e-scooter trips and user characteristics. We use a revealed-preference survey to evaluate the e-scooter usage in one of the highest-demand areas in the City of Austin, corresponding to a university campus. We explore population characteristics, mode shift, and mode interaction. Then, using publicly available datasets, we provide a causal analysis to evaluate the nature of the relationship between e-scooter and transit trips in the whole city. Assessing this relationship is challenging because several factors affect the demand of both types of trips (e.g., location of attractive zones), known as confounding variables. We develop a methodological framework to isolate the effects of confounding variables on transit trips using a two-stage regression procedure. The first stage aims to isolate confounding variables using a gradient boosting regression. The second stage models first and last-mile trips using a negative binomial and a zero-inflated negative binomial count model. The university survey indicated that 12 percent of the e-scooter users employed transit to complement their trips. Although small in magnitude, the data modeling results show that a statistically significant relationship was found on the university campus and downtown areas, supporting the survey results and extending the analysis to other areas of the city. However, the overall interaction between the two modes has a small magnitude. The proposed methodology can be used to identify areas with potential e-scooter and transit interaction.",0968-090X,Not found
Anticipated Collision Time (ACT): A two-dimensional surrogate safety indicator for trajectory-based proactive safety assessment,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103655,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) are widely used to assess potential crash risk proactively. Notably, most of the existing safety indicators are fundamentally designed to capture the rear-end collision risk. However, in reality, the traffic dynamics involve the simultaneous interaction of multiple vehicles on a 2-dimensional (2D) surface, which results in a broad spectrum of collision patterns, such as head-on, side-swipe, rear-end, and angled collisions. This study proposes a novel 2D surrogate safety indicator called Anticipated Collision Time (ACT) to capture the risk pattern corresponding to all collision types using a single measure. We also devised a procedure to automatically detect conflict situations and extract ACT profiles as well as crash-type information from the trajectory data. The primary inputs to the ACT estimation are the shortest distance between the vehicles and the closing-in rate. This study also introduces another safety indicator derived from the ACT profile called Time of Evasive Action (TEA). TEA primarily captures the time at which a vehicle commences to respond, in terms of deceleration, when it encounters an unsafe situation. Such a measure helps to understand the response pattern of different vehicles/drivers to a potential collision. We also derived Time Exposed ACT (TE-ACT) and Time Integrated ACT (TI-ACT) from the ACT profile to capture crash exposure and severity. To highlight the potential of ACT, the Powered Two Wheeler (PTW) safety in an urban environment was analyzed with trajectory data collected from a busy urban midblock section. The results emphasize the capabilities of ACT and the other derived indicators to capture crash risk proactively. It is incontrovertible from the analyses that the ACT is opening up a new avenue for a comprehensive investigation of the safety of various transport facilities, irrespective of geometry and traffic scenario.",0968-090X,Not found
Nested vehicle routing problem: Optimizing drone-truck surveillance operations,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103645,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Unmanned aerial vehicles or drones are becoming increasingly popular due to their low cost and high mobility. In this paper we address the routing and coordination of a drone-truck pairing where the drone travels to multiple locations to perform specified observation tasks and rendezvous periodically with the truck to swap its batteries. We refer to this as the Nested-Vehicle Routing Problem (Nested-VRP) and develop a Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming (MIQCP) formulation with critical operational constraints, including drone battery capacity and synchronization of both vehicles during scheduled rendezvous. An enhancement of the MIQCP model for the Nested-VRP is achieved by deriving the equivalent Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation as well as leveraging lifting and Reformulation-Linearization techniques to strengthen the subtour elimination constraints of the drone. Given the NP-hard nature of the Nested-VRP, we further propose an efficient neighborhood search (NS) heuristic where we generate and improve on a good initial solution by iteratively solving the Nested-VRP on a local scale. We provide comparisons of both the exact approaches based on MIQCP or its enhanced formulations and NS heuristic methods with a relaxation lower bound in the cases of small and large problem sizes, and present the results of a computational study to show the effectiveness of the MIQCP model and its variants as well as the efficiency of the NS heuristic, including for a real-life instance with 631 locations.

Impact of connected and autonomous vehicle technology on market penetration and route choices,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103646,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Before having a massive deployment of fully connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), CAVs with different automation levels and human-driven vehicles (HVs) will coexist on roads for a long time. To quantify the impacts of CAV technology on vehicle market penetration and travelers’ route choices in the future from the perspective of transportation planning, this paper investigates a two-sided market equilibrium problem, which considers the vehicle market on one side and the road traffic equilibrium market on the other side. The two markets interactively affect each other through market penetration, information quality, and spatial distribution of congestion, which are all endogenously determined in our model. In the vehicle market, two-stage decision-making is considered to describe various vehicle choices users may face in the future. In the first stage, users between each origin–destination (OD) pair choose a vehicle type between HV and CAV. In the second stage, CAV users further choose a vehicle automaton level. To account for the similarity of CAVs with different automation levels, we use a nested logit (NL) model to capture the two-stage decision-making. A vehicle choice with a higher market penetration provides higher-quality information, which affects the traffic equilibrium market. For the traffic equilibrium, route choices of users with different information quality are described by a multinomial logit (MNL) model. The spatial distribution of congestion determined by the traffic equilibrium also affects vehicle choices in the vehicle market. Specifically, users with higher quality information are more likely to choose routes with the lowest travel time. Consequently, a vehicle choice with a lower expected travel time attracts more users. The two-sided market equilibrium is formulated as a combined NL-MNL model so as to solve the two interactive market equilibria simultaneously. Then, we explore the properties of the equilibrium state. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the path flow pattern and demand pattern at equilibrium are derived, respectively. Based on the properties of the equilibrium state, we derive an equivalent variational inequality (VI) for the combined NL-MNL model. A new approach is provided to deriving two sufficient conditions, either of which guarantees the uniqueness of the VI solution. To solve the proposed problem efficiently, we develop a path-based modified self-regulated averaging (PMSRA) algorithm embedded with a modified K-shortest path method. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the effects of CAV technology and demonstrate algorithm efficiency. Sensitivity analysis of parameters in the algorithm is also performed. Our results show that the market penetration of CAVs at the early stage of introduction is low due to the high purchase cost. With the development of CAV technology and mass production, fully automated CAVs may gradually dominate the market, while partially automated CAVs tend to be squeezed out of the market. In addition, our results reveal that the travel time saving from CAV technology and high-quality information is more pronounced for long trips and congested networks.",0968-090X,Not found

"Joint optimization of timetabling, vehicle scheduling, and ride-matching in a flexible multi-type shuttle bus system",10.1016/j.trc.2022.103657,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Shuttle bus services play a vital role in public transit systems. However, conventional shuttle bus systems use the same type of buses and fixed departure timetables. They fail to meet the time-varying travel demand and do not consider the diversified characteristics of transit passengers. With the advent of the information era, communication among passengers, buses, and dispatching centers has become much easier. Accordingly, demand-responsive bus dispatching methods are expected to increase the flexibility of operation schemes to improve the performance of shuttle bus systems. To this end, this study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model to incorporate ride-matching and shuttle bus dispatching in one framework. The bus trip schedules (including the number of used bus trips of different types, departure times, dwelling stops with dwelling times, and recommended travel speeds between adjacent stops of each trip) and passenger-to-vehicle matching schemes are optimized. The commonly used stop-skipping tactic, speed adjustment, and bus holding strategies are introduced to improve the flexibility and operational efficiency of shuttle bus systems. The objective is to minimize the weighted total passenger waiting times, passenger in-vehicle times, and operating costs. A modified Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is designed to improve computational efficiency for large-scale problems. A rolling horizon scheme is designed to implement the algorithm dynamically. It updates the dispatching scheme horizon by horizon according to newly collected requests, which can also improve the algorithm performance by reducing the problem scale. Numerical results show that the proposed flexible multi-type shuttle bus system outperforms a multi-type bus timetabling algorithm in all the considered cases, and it outperforms an on-demand ride-sharing algorithm in 80% of the cases.",0968-090X,Not found
Identifying transient and persistent errors in aircraft cruise trajectory prediction using Bayesian state estimation,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103665,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Recorded aircraft trajectory data may vary significantly from predictions based on physics-informed models. This discrepancy may be attributed to inadequacies in the trajectory prediction models, including errors in modeling aircraft dynamics, and omission of inputs such as weather data, equipment malfunctions, and pilot errors. In this work, we represent model errors as additional external inputs to the trajectory prediction model, evaluate them using Bayesian state estimation, and update the trajectory prediction model to address these errors. In doing so, we distinguish between two types of model errors – transient and persistent errors – of which only persistent errors are considered for correction. In this study, we estimate the model error for the completed portion of ongoing flights, separate out the persistent error and account for it in the system model, which allows for an improved prediction of aircraft trajectory for the remaining flight duration. We perform verification and validation of the proposed methodology using both synthetically generated data as well as historically recorded data corresponding to flights affected by adverse weather conditions and engine failure.",0968-090X,Not found

Hence, many bus network operators currently ask for an optimal transformation plan to integrate battery electric buses into their fleet. Ideally, this plan also considers the installation of necessary charging infrastructure to ensure a fleet’s operational feasibility. Against this background, we introduce an integrated modeling approach to determine a cost-optimal, long-term, multi-period transformation plan for integrating battery electric buses into urban bus networks. Our model connects central strategic and operational decisions. We minimize total cost of ownership and analyze potential reductions of nitrogen oxide emissions. Our results base on a case study of a real-world bus network and show that a comprehensive integration of battery electric buses is feasible and economically beneficial.

The contribution of connected vehicles to network traffic control: A hierarchical approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103644,139,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Connected vehicles (CVs) can considerably contribute to traffic control in the near future by providing real-time information. Such information can be exploited to identify the current traffic condition. However, challenges resulting from a high volume of data and lack of perfect knowledge in mixed traffic scenarios (consisting of CVs and conventional vehicles) have led to relatively sparse research in network-wide CV-based traffic control. To deal with such challenges, this paper proposes a hierarchical framework integrating three layers: (i) an intersection controller at individual intersections located in the center of the network, (ii) a network controller to regulate traffic coming into the network, and (iii) a phase controller to optimize the sequence of intersections’ signals. This approach permits the inclusion of information of (a limited number of) CVs to estimate and control queue lengths at individual intersections as well as the overall network load. Simulations carried out in VISSIM validate our approach in comparison with alternative control systems such as the application of (1) a traffic-responsive control, (2) a traffic accumulation regulator, or (3) a network signals coordinator. Moreover, comparisons between the proposed framework and a central system equipped with the information of all vehicles (giving rise to the optimal operation with, however, costly computation) under the consideration of different penetration rates of CVs and network layouts confirm that this framework results in competitive performance indicators, which, owing to the hierarchical structure, can be efficiently employed in real-time applications.",0968-090X,Not found

We develop a general framework that can combine various traffic flow models with Bayesian Network (BN) for estimating the overall traffic parameters using partially observed vehicle trajectory data (with unknown penetration rate). The BN is formulated to establish the probabilistic relationship between the traffic arrival process, traffic states, traffic flow model parameters and observed vehicle trajectories. More specifically, given traffic arrival information (e.g., traffic arrival volume) and fundamental diagram parameters (e.g., capacity, jam density, and free flow speed), vehicle trajectories are derived or simulated based on traffic flow modelling (e.g., shockwave analysis, Cell Transmission Model (CTM), or microscopic traffic simulation model VISSIM). Here, the extracted entry time of an observed vehicle at a pre-defined location upstream of the signal and its travel time are used to establish the probabilistic relationship. On the other hand, they are also the input parameters of the model for the estimation. Then, by combining a dynamic traffic flow model with Bayesian inference, we develop a framework to establish the learning process for traffic parameters estimation, such as traffic volume and traffic flow model parameters. The proposed framework is evaluated with different traffic flow models using the NGSIM dataset of an arterial corridor with three signalized intersections. For the CTM-BN model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the estimation is generally below 5% when the penetration rate is above 12%. Regarding the VISSIM-BN model, the MAPE of the estimation is generally below 5% when the penetration rate is above 6%. These results demonstrate the applicability of the framework even under a relatively low penetration rate, and that the fidelity of the dynamic traffic model used does influence the estimation performance.",0968-090X,Not found

A batch offline reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed to learn action values and the optimal policy from archived trajectory data. The method is model-free, in that no state transition model is needed. It is more efficient than the commonly used online RL methods based on interactions with a simulator, due to batch processing and reuse of transition experiences. The batch RL method is evaluated in a large network of Shanghai, China with GPS trajectories of over 12,000 taxis. The training is conducted with two datasets: one is a synthetic dataset where state transitions are generated in a simulator with a postulated system dynamics model (Yu et al., 2019) whose parameters are derived from observed data; the other contains real-world state transitions extracted from observed taxi trajectories. The batch RL method is more computationally efficient, reducing the training time by dozens of times compared with the online Q -learning method. Its performance in terms of average profit per hour and occupancy rate is assessed in the simulator, against that of a baseline model, the random walk, and an upper bound, generated by the exact Dynamic Programming (DP) method based on the same system model of the simulator. The batch RL based on simulated and observed trajectories both outperform the random walk, and the advantage increases with the training sample size. The batch RL based on simulated trajectories achieves 95% of the performance upper bound with 30-minutes time intervals, suggesting that the model-free method is highly effective. The batch RL based on observed data achieves around 90% of the performance upper bound with 30-minute time intervals, due to the discrepancy between the training and evaluation environments, and its performance in the real world is expected to similarly good since the training and evaluation would be based on the same environment.",0968-090X,Not found
Multianticipation for string stable Adaptive Cruise Control and increased motorway capacity without vehicle-to-vehicle communication,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103687,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems have been expected to solve many problems of motorway traffic. Now that they are widespread, it is observed that the majority of existing systems are string unstable. Therefore, small perturbations in the speed profile of a vehicle are amplified for the vehicles following upstream, with negative impacts on traffic flow, fuel consumption, and safety. Increased headway settings provide more stable flow but at the same time it deteriorates the capacity. Substantial research has been carried out in the past decade on utilizing connectivity to overcome this trade-off. However, such connectivity solutions have to overcome several obstacles before deployment and there is the concrete risk that motorway traffic flow will considerably deteriorate in the meanwhile. As an alternative solution, the paper explores multianticipation without inter-vehicle communication, taking advantage of the recent advancements in the field of RADAR sensing. An analytical study is carried out, based on the most widely used model and parameter settings used to simulate currently available commercial ACC systems, comparing the transfer functions and step responses for the nominal and the multianticipative formulations. Then, a microsimulation framework is employed to validate our claim on different speed profiles. Analytical results demonstrate that multianticipation enhances stability without impacting traffic flow. On the contrary, the simulation study indicates that the multianticipative-ACC can produce higher road capacity even in the presence of external disturbances and for a wide range of calibrated parameters.

In addition, most existing techniques only focus on the congestion degree of road segments, however ignoring the correlations between CRSs and their underlying congestion propagations. This study proposed a framework for turn-level bottleneck identification in large-scale road networks using vehicle trajectory data. First, filtered GPS trajectory data was used to identify CRSs and their congestion start time. Then, congestion correlation graphs and corresponding spanning trees were constructed by investigating forward and backward correlations between CRSs. These directional correlations were later modeled via a Bayesian inference approach. Last, congestion correlation cost models were built up to identify turn-level bottlenecks considering the probability of congestion correlation.

Simulation results show that the proposed control method greatly outperforms the conventional max pressure control.

Their operations are still plagued by response delays that can often be life-threatening. Dispatching and redeployment systems identify the best practices regarding the allocation of the resources to emergencies and stations. Yet, the existing systems are unfortunately insufficient, and there is a growing need to embrace new technological solutions. This research introduces a smart system for EMS by leveraging the modular vehicle technology initially developed for transit systems. The proposed system relies on the design of vehicular modules that can couple and decouple to transfer patients from one module to another during transport.

This paper introduces a mathematical programming model to determine the optimal assignment decisions in a deterministic setting. This work is a proof of concept that demonstrates the applicability of the modular vehicle technology to EMS, evaluating the upper bound EMS performance that can be ultimately reached. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide insights and recommendations that are useful when selecting the weighting coefficients for the optimization function, to ensure a more efficient implementation of the modular vehicle technology for EMS.

First, a safe and cost-effective flight approach data collection mechanism is introduced via a pilot-operated flight simulator under varying visibility conditions. Then, data are processed and a go-around probability assignment mechanism is introduced. Finally, a go-around probability prediction model is proposed. The proposed model updates the go-around probability for each new flight record, namely every second, and converges by detecting either a go-around or a successful landing. Experiments are conducted for two airports, namely Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) and Van Nuys Airport (KVNY), which feature different go-around procedures and are operated by different types of aircraft. Findings demonstrate that the trajectories of predicted go-around probabilities follow closely the computed probabilities regardless of the dissimilarities in the trajectory patterns. Furthermore, results suggest that the likelihood of go-around exceeds 93% when the go-around is initiated, for almost 50% of the flights in the test set. Moreover, the proposed model is able to detect the successful landing of aircraft. In fact, the system indicates low chances of go-around when the aircraft landed. For instance, the likelihood of a go-around at the touchdown is below 35% and 10% for KPHL and KVNY, respectively. The findings underscore the ability of the proposed model in providing accurate and timely go-around probabilities.

Firstly, we conduct an empirical study on the growth pattern of traffic oscillations on US-101 Freeway and German-A5 Freeway. Then we perform an experiment to study the growth pattern of traffic oscillations on a single lane with a fixed bottleneck of speed limit. Both empirical and experimental results show that traffic oscillations grow in a concave way along the road. This finding is consistent with the previous one that traffic oscillations grow concavely along the platoon following a slower leader taking on the role of a moving bottleneck, which is not to be expected a priori for a fixed bottleneck. Finally, we use the finding to test three typical car-following models. The test indicates that whereas the intelligent driver model (IDM) fails to reproduce the observed growth pattern, the 2D-IDM and the stochastic speed adaptation model could. These findings are expected to improve our understanding of the role of stochasticity in car following, and the high-quality data in itself can be used to test traffic flow models and theories.",0968-090X,Not found
"Significance of low-level control to string stability under adaptive cruise control: Algorithms, theory and experiments",10.1016/j.trc.2022.103697,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems are bi-level: an upper-level planner decides the target trajectory and the low-level system executes it. Existing literature on ACCs mostly focus on the planner algorithms or the actuator delay, while the transition process between them, e.g. the low-level control design and its impact are often ignored. This paper tries to fill this gap by digging into the codebase of a recent open-source self-driving system, Openpilot (OP), Comma.ai, from which we extract and formulate the algorithms at both the upper and lower levels. For linear ACCs, the paper extends the transfer function analysis from planners only to full control loops and investigates the impact of slow/fast low-level control on the overall string stability (SS). For MPC ACCs, it studies their planning characteristics based its optimization objectives and approximates the low-level impact using an ODE approach. We find that low-level control has a significant impact on the overall SS of ACCs: (i) slow low-level control undermines SS under small frequencies and improves SS given large frequencies for linear systems, (ii) MPC features a varying gain throughout an oscillation, where the fast low-level control typically results in a ‘fast-slow’ changing process of the MPC gain, which benefits the SS, whereas the slow low-level control leads to a ‘slow-fast’ varying gain which undermines the SS, (iii) slow low-level control are common as they arise from comfort-oriented control gains, from a ”weak” actuator performance or both, and (iv) the SS is very sensitive to the integral gain under slow low-level control for both PI and PIF controllers. Overall, the study recommends fast low-level control for ensuring vehicular SS to reduce traffic congestion, considering that large congestion waves usually feature both small frequencies and large amplitudes, although slow controllers could perform even better provided a short and small leader perturbation. The findings of this paper are verified both numerically and experimentally. For the first time in the literature we implement custom ACC algorithms on market cars, and achieve SS on open roads with a random leader by only tuning the low-level controllers. The source code is shared at https://github.com/HaoZhouGT/openpilot to support on-road experiments of arbitrary car-following models, which may be of interest to other studies.",0968-090X,Not found
Joint demand prediction for multimodal systems: A multi-task multi-relational spatiotemporal graph neural network approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103731,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Dynamic demand prediction is crucial for the efficient operation and management of urban transportation systems. Extensive research has been conducted on single-mode demand prediction, ignoring the fact that the demands for different transportation modes can be correlated with each other. Despite some recent efforts, existing approaches to multimodal demand prediction are generally not flexible enough to account for spatiotemporal correlations across different modes with heterogeneous spatial units. To tackle these issues, this study proposes a multi-relational spatiotemporal graph neural network (ST-MRGNN) for multimodal demand prediction. Specifically, the spatial dependencies across modes are encoded with multiple intra- and inter-modal relation graphs. A multi-relational graph neural network (MRGNN) is introduced to capture cross-mode heterogeneous spatial dependencies, consisting of generalized graph convolution networks to learn the message passing mechanisms within relation graphs and an attention-based aggregation module to summarize different relations. We further integrate MRGNNs with temporal gated convolution layers to jointly model spatiotemporal correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world subway and ride-hailing datasets from New York City, and the results verify the improved performance of our proposed approach over existing methods across modes. The improvement is particularly large for demand-sparse locations. Further analysis of the attention mechanisms of ST-MRGNN also demonstrates its good interpretability for understanding cross-mode interactions.",0968-090X,Not found
Managing mixed traffic with autonomous vehicles – A day-to-day routing allocation scheme,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103726,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"In presence of the emerging technology of automated vehicles, it is anticipated that the future traffic system would be comprised of mixed traffic with both self-driving autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven conventional vehicles. It is imperative to propose new traffic management measures to manage the future traffic system, as complement of the existing ones such as road pricing schemes. This study seeks to take advantage of the controllable property of AVs’ routing choices to develop a day-to-day routing allocation scheme for a certain number of autonomous vehicles so as to drive the mixed traffic system into a desired traffic state. Specifically, we assume that all travelers are bounded rational and AV users are willing to accept route allocation with route travel cost not exceeding HV users’ indifference band. Therefore, the best-case bounded rationality user equilibrium (BRUE) flow pattern is in principle the most desirable traffic state out of all the BRUE solutions. This study proposes a day-to-day AVs’ routing allocation scheme by which the traffic system would be directed to evolve towards the desired best-case BRUE. The day-to-day traffic dynamics of HVs are proposed to follow a general framework, which can be further proved to be the BRUE rational behavior adjustment process (BRUE-RBAP). The condition for convergence is investigated under general assumptions. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this traffic management scheme.",0968-090X,Not found

Synchromodal transport planning with flexible services: Mathematical model and heuristic algorithm,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103711,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"As a critical feature of synchromodal transport (ST), service flexibility plays an important role in improving the utilization of resources to reduce costs, emissions, congestions, and delays. However, none of the existing studies considered flexible services under the framework of synchromodality. This paper develops a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to formulate service flexibility in ST planning. In the MILP model, vehicles with flexible services as well as fixed services are both considered, and vehicle routes and request routes are planned simultaneously. Due to the computational complexity, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic is designed to solve the problem. Several customized operators are designed based on the characteristics of the studied problem. The proposed model is compared with the models developed in a highly-cited paper and a newly published paper that do not consider service flexibility. Case studies on small instances verified that the proposed model with flexibility performs better on all scenarios, including scenarios with different weights for the individual objectives, scenarios under congestion,and dynamic optimization scenarios. On large instances (up to 1600 shipment requests), the proposed model with flexibility reduces the cost by 14% on average compared with the existing models in the literature.",0968-090X,Not found

To characterize the problem mathematically, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is formulated to minimize the passenger waiting time and operating costs of the metro system simultaneously. This model is further reformulated equivalently into a mixed-integer linear programming model via the linearization method. An effective heuristic algorithm based on the tabu search and CPLEX solver is designed to find high-quality solutions for the proposed problem. Finally, two sets of numerical examples, including a small-scale example and a large-scale example based on the Beijing metro Batong line, are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed methods.

Fine-grained highway autonomous vehicle lane-changing trajectory prediction based on a heuristic attention-aided encoder-decoder model,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103706,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Accurate prediction of lane-changing (LC) trajectories can improve traffic efficiency and reduce the probability of accidents, as well as provide driving strategies for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Aiming at solving the problems of low prediction accuracy, difficulty in long-term prediction, and an inability of a fine-grained level description of conventional models, a prediction model based on an attention-aided encoder-decoder structure and deep neural network (DNN) is proposed. This study analyzes the LC process and proposes an LC segmentation and sampling method for dividing LC into four stages. The optimal attention-aided encoder-decoder model is tested by trajectory data in the four LC stages and then a heuristic network model is designed. In addition, the proposed heuristic network is connected with the DNN for predicting vehicle kinematics data while predicting the vehicle trajectory. Finally, the heuristic network and DNN are tested in cascade to form a joint cascade prediction model that can perform a fine-grained LC description based on the prediction results. The experimental results show that the proposed cascade prediction model has high accuracy and long-term prediction capability of a vehicle’s trajectory, velocity, acceleration, and steering angle and is also capable of fine-grained LC description.

Shareability network based decomposition approach for solving large-scale single school routing problems,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103691,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"We consider the Single School Routing Problem (SSRP) where students from a single school are picked up by a fleet of school buses, subject to a set of constraints. The constraints that are typically imposed for school buses are bus capacity, a maximum student walking distance to a pickup point, and a maximum commute time for each student. This is a special case of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a common destination. We propose a decomposition approach for solving this problem based on the existing notion of a shareability network, which has been used recently in the context of dynamic ridepooling problems. Moreover, we come up with a simplified formulation for solving the SSRP by introducing the connection between the SSRP and the weighted set covering problem (WSCP). To scale this method to large-scale problem instances, we propose (i) a node compression method for the shareability network based decomposition approach, and (ii) heuristic-based edge pruning techniques that perform well in practice. We show that the compressed problem leads to an Integer Linear Program (ILP) of reduced dimensionality that can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf ILP solvers. Numerical experiments on the synthetic Boston Public School (BPS) instances are conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach. Meanwhile, our proposed SSRP formulation allows a natural extension for introducing alternate transportation modes to students, which effectively reduces the number of buses needed for each school and leads to a 15% cost reduction on average. Moreover, two state-of-art large-scale SSRP solving techniques are compared with our proposed approaches on benchmark networks and our methods outperform both techniques under a single school setting.",0968-090X,Not found
Autonomous planning of optimal four-dimensional trajectory for real-time en-route airspace operation with solution space visualisation,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103701,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"One of the challenges in applying autonomous operation-based conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) techniques to practice is their functional completeness, such as the ability to simultaneously consider three-dimensional (3D) scenarios, controlled time of arrival, restricted areas, trajectory recovery, and multi-stakeholder performance preferences. Besides, the effective interaction between controllers, pilots and autonomous operating system can better support the CD&R to work in practice, where humans are able to intuitively understand the rationale for solutions given by automatic decision-making tools. To bridge the gap, a novel operational framework for four-dimensional (4D) trajectory conflict management in the context of free route airspace is proposed. Airspace discretisation based on a 3D grid is used to facilitate the consideration of restricted areas and to balance calculation speed and optimal effect. The core of this framework is a two-stage real-time autonomous 4D trajectory planning method in a restricted en-route sector with multiple flight levels enhanced by solution space visualisation. Stage one is a trajectory pre-planning model based on a visibility graph and the Dijkstra algorithm considering the conflict between aircraft and emerging restricted areas. Stage two is a real-time conflict-free and fuel-optimal 4D trajectory re-planning model. The space–time prism is employed to enable the planned trajectory to meet the controlled time of arrival and trajectory recovery requirements, where the performance preferences of both the air traffic management and airspace users are taken into account. The reachable solution space representation is applied to realise the solution space visualisation that has the potential to support the human–machine interaction and air–ground coordination. A simulation scenario is established to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and timeliness of the proposed method. Results show that in an artificial en-route sector, the average extra flight distance, average flight delay, average extra fuel consumption, and average computing time for conflict resolution were less than 0.41 km, 2.1 s, 1.5 kg, and 0.08 s in the saturated scenario, respectively, and the domino effect of the flight conflict did not show a significant rise with the increase of traffic density, which verified that the proposed autonomous trajectory operation methodology is a promising approach to facilitate autonomous air traffic management in the future.",0968-090X,Not found
Crowdshipping: An open VRP variant with stochastic destinations,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103677,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"E-commerce continues to grow throughout the world due to people’s preference to stay at home rather than going to a brick-and-mortar retail store. COVID-19 has exacerbated this trend. Concurrently, crowd-shipping has been gaining in popularity due to both the increase in e-commerce and the current pressures due to COVID-19. We consider a setting where a crowd-shipping platform can fulfill heterogeneous delivery requests from a central depot with a fleet of professionally driven vehicles and a pool of capacitated occasional drivers. We divide delivery requests into sectors to represent different neighborhoods in a city. Occasional drivers have unknown destinations that can be anywhere inside the sectors. Route duration constraints are modeled to motivate participation and increase the probability of route-acceptance by keeping routes short. We assume that occasional drivers will choose routes that are better compensated and that the probability of route-acceptance is dependent on other routes being offered. We propose a two-stage stochastic model to formulate the problem. We use a branch-and-price algorithm capable of solving 50-customer instances, and develop a heuristic that can solve larger 100-customer instances quickly. An upper bound for the total number of occasional drivers is used to reduce the number of constraints in the master problem and reduce the complexity of the pricing problems. We show that occasional drivers with destinations far from the depot reduce the cost by over 30%, while occasional drivers with destinations that are near the depot reduce the cost by 20%. We show that route duration constraints and capacity constraints can restrict the occasional driver routes and both need to simultaneously increase in order to have cost reductions.

For the network datasets, the results indicate that the method yields satisfactory parameter estimates and graphical fits for roughly 50% of the studied networks, where estimations fall within the expected range of the parameter values. The satisfactory estimates are mostly for the datasets which (i) cover a relatively wider range of densities and (ii) the average flow values at different densities are approximately normally distributed similar to the probability density function of the SMoC. The estimated parameter values are compared to the real or expected values and any discrepancies and their potential causes are discussed in depth to identify the challenges in the MFD estimation both analytically and empirically.

H-ConvLSTM-based bagging learning approach for ride-hailing demand prediction considering imbalance problems and sparse uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103709,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The problem of learning from imbalanced ride-hailing demand data with spatiotemporal heterogeneity and highly skewed demand distributions is a relatively new challenge. Current prediction methods usually filter out some spatiotemporal partitions with sparse demands by setting a minimum ride-hailing demand threshold, where the dataset is always assumed to be well balanced in terms of its spatiotemporal partitions, with equal misprediction costs. However, this widely used assumption results in large prediction biases. To achieve better prediction performance, we propose a bagging learning approach based on hexagonal convolutional long short-term memory (H-ConvLSTM), which combines three components. 1) By setting multiple minimum ride-hailing demand thresholds, several subdatasets with different majority ride-hailing demand prediction ranges are obtained. The H-ConvLSTM regression model is applied to each undersampled dataset to train multiple submodels with their respective biased ride-hailing demand prediction ranges. 2) The H-ConvLSTM classification model is trained on the total ride-hailing demand dataset to predict the potential demand range for a certain partition at a future time. 3) The submodel with the best performance with respect to the potential demand range is selected to predict the future demand for this partition. Experiments conducted on order data obtained from Didi Chuxing in Chengdu, China, are conducted.

The recharging facility location is critical for electric logistics network planning, because it significantly affects future operation costs and efficiency.

Network-level control of heterogeneous automated traffic guaranteeing bus priority,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103671,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Guaranteeing the quality of transit service is of great importance to promote the attractiveness of buses and alleviate urban traffic issues such as congestion and pollution. Emerging technologies of automated driving and V2X communication have the potential to enable the accurate control of vehicles and the efficient organization of traffic to enhance both the schedule adherence of buses and the overall network mobility. This study proposes a novel network-level control scheme for heterogeneous automated traffic composed of buses and private cars under a full connected and automated environment. Inheriting the idea of network-level rhythmic control proposed by Lin et al. (2021b), an innovative rhythmic control scheme for heterogeneous traffic, i.e., RC-H, is established to organize the mixed traffic in a rhythmic manner. Realized virtual platoons are designed for accommodating vehicles to pass through the network, including dedicated virtual platoons for buses to provide exclusive right-of-ways (ROWs) on their trips and regular virtual platoons for private cars along with an optimal assignment plan to minimize the total travel cost. A mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is formulated to optimize the RC-H scheme with the objective of minimizing the weighted travel costs of both buses and private cars. A bilevel heuristic solution method is designed to relieve the computational burden of MILP. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the RC-H scheme under different scenarios. The results show that the bus punctuality can be guaranteed and the traveler delay can be minimized under various demand levels with transit priority.

Modelling reservation-based shared autonomous vehicle services: A dynamic user equilibrium approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103651,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are expected to be used for regular and pre-planned trips. Such trips are suitable for reservation-based services, wherein the customer needs to book for a trip in advance. Systems enabling reservation of trips can allow for better planning of routes and schedules, and if optimally designed, enable higher efficiency. The primary objective of this research is to model the effects of such a system, by formulating and solving the combined Dynamic User Equilibrium and Shared autonomous vehicle Chain Formation (DUESCF) problem. The problem is formulated as a bilevel model based on game theory, involving road users and SAV service operator. Given a situation where conventional private and shared autonomous vehicles co-exist, road users select paths and departure times to maximize a perceived utility (commonly treated as minimizing a disutility) by forming a DUE (fixed point problem), and the SAV service operator tries to maximize the performance by forming appropriate SAV chains (combinatorial problem). The final objective of this bilevel model is a traffic assignment that includes SAV chain formation, such that both road users and SAV service operator obtain optimal solutions by reaching a Nash equilibrium, where no player is better off by unilaterally changing their decisions. A solution approach, based on Iterative Optimization and Assignment (IOA) method, is proposed with path flow and SAV performance changes as convergence criteria. Furthermore, the solution approach is tested for its robustness, and a scenario analysis is carried out to evaluate the impacts of reservation-based SAV services.

"Generalized link cost function and network design for dedicated truck platoon lanes to improve energy, pavement sustainability and traffic efficiency",10.1016/j.trc.2022.103667,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Recent development on autonomous and connected trucks (ACT) has provided the freight industry with the new option of using truck platooning to improve their fuel efficiency, traffic throughput, and safety. However, closely spaced and longitudinally aligned trucks impose frequent and concentrated loading on pavements, which often accelerates pavement deterioration and increase the life-cycle costs for the highway agency. Also, effectiveness of truck platooning can only be maximized in dedicated lanes, and its benefits and costs need to be properly balanced between stakeholders. This paper proposes a network design model to optimize (i) placement of dedicated truck platoon lanes and toll price in a highway network, (ii) pooling and routing of ACT traffic from multiple origins and destinations to utilize these lanes, and (iii) configuration of truck platoons within these lanes (e.g., lateral displacements and vehicle separations). The problem is formulated as an integrated bi-level optimization model. The upper level makes decisions on converting existing highway lanes into dedicated platoon lanes, as well as setting user fees. The lower level decisions are made by independent shippers regarding the choice of routes, use of platoon lanes vs. regular lanes, and they collectively determine truck traffic in all lanes. Link cost functions for platoon lanes are obtained by simultaneously optimizing, through dynamic programming, pavement rehabilitation activities and platoon configuration in the pavement’s life cycle. A numerical case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed model framework over the Illinois freeway system. It is shown that the freight traffic is effectively channelized on a few corridors of platoon lanes and, by setting proper user fees to cover pavement rehabilitation costs, system-wide improvements for both freight shippers and highway agencies can be achieved.",0968-090X,Not found
Worst-case traffic assignment model for mixed traffic flow of human-driven vehicles and connected and autonomous vehicles by factoring in the uncertain link capacity,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103703,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can form platoons to reduce the time headway and improve the link capacity. However, in a mixed traffic flow environment where both human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs exist, the platoon intensity is significantly impacted by the stochastic order of the HDVs and CAVs (i.e., the fleet sequence). Therefore, the link capacity involves a large uncertainty even under the same HDV and CAV flow. This uncertain link capacity can cause a large variation in network flow. In the literature, traffic assignment models for mixed traffic flows of HDVs and CAVs are developed based on expected link capacity models, in which the computed link capacity is deterministic for given HDV and CAV flows. These models ignore the impacts of uncertain link capacity on the network performance and network flow distribution, which can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the corresponding planning strategies. To address this problem, this study proposes a worst-case mixed traffic assignment model. It aims to compute the worst network performance and corresponding equilibrium flow that may occur due to uncertain link capacity. The worst-case mixed traffic assignment is formulated as a bilevel programming problem, where the low-level problem is a variational inequality problem presented to compute the equilibrium results based on a fixed link capacity while the upper-level problem is to find the optimal input for all link capacities within their ranges to minimize the network performance. The partition-based norm relaxed method of the feasible direction solution algorithm is proposed to solve the bilevel worst-case mixed traffic assignment problem. A numerical application shows that the uncertain link capacity has drastic effects on the network flows and network performance, and the proposed algorithm can effectively and efficiently solve the bilevel worst-case mixed traffic assignment problem to compute the worst-case network equilibrium flows and network performance.

"On-demand valet charging for electric vehicles: Economic equilibrium, infrastructure planning and regulatory incentives",10.1016/j.trc.2022.103669,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Many city residents cannot install their private electric vehicle (EV) chargers due to the lack of dedicated parking spaces or insufficient grid capacity. This presents a significant barrier towards large-scale EV adoption. To address this concern, this paper considers a novel business model, on-demand valet charging, that unlocks the potential of under-utilized public charging infrastructure to promise higher EV penetration. In the proposed model, a platform recruits a fleet of couriers that shuttle between customers and public charging stations to provide on-demand valet charging services to EV owners at an affordable price. Couriers are dispatched to pick up low-battery EVs from customers, deliver the EVs to charging stations, plug them in, and then return the fully-charged EVs to customers. To depict the proposed business model, we develop a queuing network to represent the stochastic matching dynamics, and further formulate an economic equilibrium model to capture the incentives of couriers, customers as well as the platform. These models are used to examine how charging infrastructure planning and regulatory intervention will affect the market outcome. First, we find that the optimal charging station densities for distinct stakeholders are different: couriers prefer a lower density; the platform prefers a higher density; while the density in-between leads to the highest EV penetration as it balances the time traveling to and queuing at charging stations. Second, we evaluate a regulatory policy that imposes a tax on the platform and invests the tax revenue in public charging infrastructure. Numerical results suggest that this regulation can suppress the platform’s market power associated with monopoly pricing, increase social welfare, and facilitate the market expansion.",0968-090X,Not found
Adaptive cell-based evacuation systems for leader-follower crowd evacuation,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103699,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The challenge of controlling crowd movement at large events expands not only to the realm of emergency evacuations but also to improving non-critical conditions related to operational efficiency and comfort. In both cases, it becomes necessary to develop adaptive crowd motion control systems. In particular, adaptive cell-based crowd evacuation systems dynamically generate exit-choice recommendations favoring a coordinated group dynamic that improves safety and evacuation time. We investigate the viability of using this mechanism to develop a “leader-follower” evacuation system in which a trained evacuation staff guides evacuees safely to the exit gates. To validate the proposal, we use a simulation–optimization framework integrating microscopic simulation. Evacuees’ behavior has been modeled using a three-layered architecture that includes eligibility, exit-choice changing, and exit-choice models, calibrated with hypothetical-choice experiments. As a significant contribution of this work, the proposed behavior models capture the influence of leaders on evacuees, which is translated into exit-choice decisions and the adaptation of speed. This influence can be easily modulated to evaluate the evacuation efficiency under different evacuation scenarios and evacuees’ behavior profiles. When measuring the efficiency of the evacuation processes, particular attention has been paid to safety by using pedestrian Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (p-MFD), which model the crowd movement dynamics from a macroscopic perspective. The spatiotemporal view of the evacuation performance in the form of crowd-pressure vs. density values allowed us to evaluate and compare safety in different evacuation scenarios reasonably and consistently. Experimental results confirm the viability of using adaptive cell-based crowd evacuation systems as a guidance tool to be used by evacuation staff to guide evacuees. Interestingly, we found that evacuation staff motion speed plays a crucial role in balancing egress time and safety. Thus, it is expected that by instructing evacuation staff to move at a predefined speed, we can reach the desired balance between evacuation time, accident probability, and comfort.",0968-090X,Not found
Flexible train capacity allocation for an overcrowded metro line: A new passenger flow control approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103676,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Metro lines of some mega cities usually suffer from extreme congestions in peak hours, leading to serious operation risks. To relieve the extreme saturation for overcrowded metro lines, this study explores a novel train operation strategy, i.e., flexibly allocating the capacities through reserving carriages at different stations according to the time-variant passenger demand. With this strategy, the train capacities are reasonably distributed to each station, especially for stations with large passenger flows, so as to balance the passenger accumulation over the whole line. A nonlinear integer programming model is developed by considering the passenger dynamics, and an efficient variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is developed to solve the problem of interest. Finally, a set of numerical experiments with real-world data from Beijing metro Batong line are conducted to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can effectively obtain high-quality carriage reservation plans in a short computing time, and the generated plans can well balance the passenger accumulation at all involved stations.",0968-090X,Not found
Service operations of electric vehicle carsharing systems from the perspectives of supply and demand: A literature review,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103702,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Electric vehicle carsharing (EV-carsharing) systems not only change how people travel, but also provide economic and environmental benefits. However, EV-carsharing systems also create a series of new service operation issues resulting from the characteristics of EVs. From the EV-carsharing system supply side, these issues include an insufficient number of charging stations, high vehicle relocation costs and untimely charge scheduling. From the EV-carsharing system demand side, they include an insufficient understanding of the factors affecting EV-carsharing demand and inaccurate demand forecasts. These issues have hindered the rapid spread of EV-carsharing systems and must be resolved if the development of this industry is to accelerate.

Transformer-based map-matching model with limited labeled data using transfer-learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103668,140,2022-07-01,2022,7,"In many spatial trajectory-based applications, it is necessary to map raw trajectory data points onto road networks in digital maps, which is commonly referred to as a map-matching process. While most previous map-matching methods have focused on using rule-based algorithms to deal with the map-matching problems, in this paper, we consider the map-matching task from the data-driven perspective, proposing a deep learning-based map-matching model. We build a Transformer-based map-matching model with a transfer learning approach. We generate trajectory data to pre-train the Transformer model and then fine-tune the model with a limited number of labeled data to minimize the model development cost and reduce the real-to-virtual gaps. Three metrics (Average Hamming Distance, F-score, and BLEU) at two levels (point and segment level) are used to evaluate the model performance. The model is tested with real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed map-matching model outperforms other existing map-matching models. We also analyze the matching mechanisms of the Transformer in the map-matching process, which helps to interpret the input data’s internal correlation and the external relation between input data and matching results. In addition, the proposed model shows the possibility of using generated trajectories to solve the map-matching problems in the limited labeled data environment.",0968-090X,Not found
Heterogeneous multi-drone routing problem for parcel delivery,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103763,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"With the rapid development of drone technology, logistics giants like Amazon and SF Express have applied drones to parcel delivery. Drone delivery could eliminate delivery delays caused by traffic lights and traffic jams on ground vehicles, and it can deliver parcels in case of road damage caused by natural disasters. Based on this motivation, we study a new logistics delivery problem using heterogeneous multi-drone, namely, HDDP, where a large drone carries multiple small drones to distribution regions. The new features of HDDPs are multifold. First, the large drone does not directly deliver parcels, but rather launches small drones to deliver parcels. Second, the HDDP allows each small drone to deliver multiple parcels in a flight considering energy consumption according to its payload and endurance. Third, the small drone is launched from the large drone and lands at the automatic airport. In addition, we design a three-stage-based iterative optimization algorithm to reduce the complexity of the HDDP. Specifically, at the first stage, a fuzzy c-means cluster algorithm considering the small drone’s payload is designed to cluster customers; at the second stage, an improved variable neighborhood descent algorithm is developed to plan the route of the large drone; at the third stage, the dynamic programming algorithm is adopted to plan the routes of the small drones. These three stages are iteratively optimized until the termination criterion is met. Additionally, numerical experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm for HDDP is superior to the comparison algorithms in terms of delivery time and delivery cost, and the impacts of three crucial factors are analyzed and some constructive conclusions are given.",0968-090X,Not found

Signal retiming methods have been traditionally used to improve traffic flow at intersections by reducing delay and improving the level of service at signalized intersections. This can often be a lengthy process that includes several iterations of various optimization methods. In this paper, we have used detector data to calculate the traffic flow metrics at several intersections. This processed data is then used to predict the signal timing and phasing for the next six cycles with reasonable accuracy. Seventeen intersections from two distinct corridors have been used in this study. One of the corridors runs adaptive signal control and the other corridor runs actuated signal control.

Distance-based time-dependent optimal ratio control scheme (TORCS) in congested mixed autonomy networks,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103760,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Connected and automated vehicle technologies provide an opportunity for a more efficient distribution of traffic in urban networks through cooperative routing behavior. Controlling the route choice of a proportion of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to establish the system optimum (SO) condition has already been investigated in static networks. This study aims to develop a time-dependent optimal ratio control scheme (TORCS) in which an optimal ratio of AVs is identified and selected to seek SO routing. The objective of the control scheme is to achieve a reasonable compromise between the system efficiency (i.e., total travel time savings) and the control cost that is proportional to the total distance traveled by SO-seeking AVs. The proposed distance-based TORCS is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. A mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model (SBDTA) estimates time-dependent mixed traffic patterns in the lower level based on the time-dependent optimal ratios of SO-seeking AVs obtained from the upper level. We also introduce a new concept of frequency control within the TORCS application. The frequency-based TORCS enables the central agent to control the route choice of selected AVs only in the time periods with the most significant impact on system travel time reduction. This is formulated with a binary variable within the TORCS problem indicating an action/no action regarding controlling AVs at a given assignment interval.

Do adaptive cruise control and lane keeping systems make the longitudinal vehicle control safer? Insights into speeding and time gaps shorter than one second from a naturalistic driving study with SAE Level 2 automation,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103756,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Advanced driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane keeping system (LKS) potentially contribute to reducing crash rates and traffic congestion. On-road studies based on early ACC systems operational at medium–high speeds only have shown that the system reduces the proportion of short time gaps when activated. Despite the effects on driver behaviour, most mathematical models assessing the impact of ACC and LKS systems on crash rates and traffic congestion are not based on empirical findings. This study examines the factors that influence changes in the longitudinal vehicle control when driving with ACC and LKS. The data were collected in a naturalistic driving experiment with full-range ACC and LKS and two different vehicle brands (BMW and Tesla) in the Netherlands. To capture changes that are relevant for traffic safety, speeding and a time gap shorter than one second were investigated. The factors influencing speeding and short time gaps were analysed using statistical tests and logistic regression models with random effects, that allow to control for the impact of different explanatory variables and correlations between repeated 10-s intervals over time. The findings revealed that, overall, drivers were less likely to speed and they were also less likely to have a time gap shorter than one second in the experimental condition with the ACC and the LKS than in the baseline condition in manual driving. Drivers were likely to speed in the following 10-s interval when the current speed was close to the speed limit, and/or when the next speed limit was lower than the current speed limit, and/or when the acceleration was high. Drivers were likely to have a short time gap in the following 10-s interval when approaching a slower leader, and/or when the current time gap was short and/or when the acceleration was high. Controlled for these main factors, drivers were less likely to speed and to have a short time gap when the ACC and the LKS were active. However, drivers were more likely to speed when overruling the ACC by pressing the gas pedal. When the systems were active, one vehicle brand showed a smaller probability of a short time gap than the other brand, suggesting differences in ACC system settings between brands. In addition, the speeding probability increased while the probability of a short time gap decreased over time during the trip after the activation of the systems. Although further studies including a larger sample of participants and a wider range of traffic situations are needed, the results are useful to the design of automated vehicles that prevent speeding and short time gaps, and to the implementation of traffic simulations that evaluate the impact of ACC and LKS on crash rates and traffic congestion according to realistic on-road data.",0968-090X,Not found
A Spatio-Temporal autocorrelation model for designing a carshare system using historical heterogeneous Data: Policy suggestion,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103758,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"As an emerging urban mobility service, carsharing has become increasingly popular worldwide. To understand customers’ needs and optimize the design of service networks, the usage of carsharing vehicles whose trips are recorded by the operators has been applied in research estimating carsharing demand. However, as a form of spatio-temporal correlated data, the underlying spatio-temporal information included in such carsharing records has not been investigated in existing models of carsharing demand. Meanwhile, due to the supply limitation of carsharing stations, some demand cannot be fulfilled and thus remains unrecorded in the operational data. Unrealized demand may lead to underestimation of carsharing demand and therefore an incorrect vehicle deployment strategy by the service providers. In view of these issues, this paper develops an innovative approach to estimating the actual demand at a carsharing station with operational data from GoGet, the largest carsharing company in Australia. The accuracy of the estimation is improved by adding spatio-temporal correlated variables as well as variables from emerging data sources such as social media. To explore the latent space-and-time correlated information, spatio-temporal autoregressive and moving-average models have been applied.

To do so, we develop an aggregate modeling framework to analyze a ridesourcing market involving electric vehicles and examine the response of the ridesourcing platform to regulatory policies such as annual permit fees (AP), differential trip-based fees (TB) or differential commission caps (CC). Our modeling exercises and numerical analyses suggest that both AP and TB are effective at achieving a high electrification level, while CC may only electrify the system to a low level. However, CC is the most cost-efficient as it simultaneously benefits drivers and customers, and allows finer intervention to the market. TB is the least cost-efficient as the platform prefers to deliver fewer customers to avoid the trip-based fees and surcharge drivers and customers for higher per-trip profits. Under all policies, the platform’s best response is always to adopt fast chargers and gradually expand the charging network to accommodate the increasing charging needs of its electric vehicle fleet.",0968-090X,Not found
Traveler-oriented multi-criteria decision support for multimodal itineraries,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103741,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In recent years, the variety of mobility services has increased strongly. Travelers expect a diverse set of combined mobility services according to multiple individual preferences. Due to the competing characteristics of these preferences (e.g. travel time, price, and the number of transfers), several Pareto-optimal itineraries representing trade-offs arise. While there are efficient approaches for finding multimodal shortest paths, the full set of Pareto-optimal itineraries cannot be determined efficiently when multiple traveler preferences are considered in a large multimodal network. However, this would be required to provide travelers with more relevant choices in the light of available options and complex solution space characteristics. In this work, we propose smart ways to approximate the Pareto front of multimodal itineraries efficiently. The core idea is to apply solution space sampling systematically. We focus on the scalability of the sampling framework with respect to multiple traveler preferences as well as identifying interesting characteristics of itineraries to enable travelers to take well-informed decisions. The framework is evaluated with a large amount of real-world data of mobility services. To this end, we analyze long-distance trips between major cities in Germany, taking up to five most prevalent traveler preferences into account. In addition, we examine the Pareto-optimal solutions and derive characteristics of potential interest for the traveler that can help to make the search more transparent and explainable and thus shape the traveler’s choice set.",0968-090X,Not found
Reinforcement Learning based cooperative longitudinal control for reducing traffic oscillations and improving platoon stability,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103744,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Stop-and-go traffic poses significant challenges to the efficiency and safety of traffic operations. In this study, a cooperative longitudinal control based on Soft Actor Critic (SAC) Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed to address this issue. The reward function is carefully designed to consider vehicle cooperation and to achieve three main objectives: safety, efficiency, and oscillation dampening. A global performance metric for oscillation dampening is proposed to evaluate the developed RL and other baseline models. Depending on the number of preceding vehicles that can share maneuver information, two models RL-1 and RL-2 are proposed and compared with human driven (HD) and an adaptive cruise control (ACC) model using the HighD and simulated data. It is found that with information from additional preceding vehicles, RL-2 can dampen shockwaves more efficiently. Specifically, RL-1 and RL-2 decrease traffic oscillation by 15%-36% and 15%-42%, respectively, while HD amplifies the oscillation by 14–37%. The ACC model can also dampen shockwaves but is not as effective as RL-1 and RL-2. The two RL control methods are further evaluated based on data collected using a commercial Model X vehicle. Compared with the commercial Model X ACC vehicle in some controlled settings, the proposed RL methods can better dampen the stop-and-go waves by generating smaller oscillation growth, overshooting, and average acceleration/deceleration rate change, suggesting that they can generalize well in a new but similar environment. Finally, the RL methods are evaluated considering a platoon of vehicles with different RL penetration rates. The results show that they consistently outperform HD and ACC in dampening shockwaves.",0968-090X,Not found
Drone logistics for uncertain demand of disaster-impacted populations,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103735,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The paper introduces a stochastic optimization-based approach to address the logistics for the timely delivery of aid packages to disaster-affected areas utilizing a fleet of drones when the set of demand points is unknown. The major problem addressed is to locate a set of drone take-off platforms so that with a specified probability α , the maximum total disutility (or cost) under all realizations of the demand locations is minimized. A set of discrete scenarios defines the uncertainty set of the demand points. A Chance Constrained Programming (CCP) formulation is developed to select a set of platform locations whose disutility distribution produces minimum α percentile. For each platform location set, and each demand scenario, the total disutility is defined as the total delivery time for serving the demand points plus a penalty for unvisited demand points. For every set of drone platform locations, referred to as a candidate combination of platforms, the resultant disutility distribution is obtained by solving a space-time drone scheduling subproblem for all possible demand scenarios. The drone scheduling subproblem optimally schedules and sequences a set of trips for each drone so that the total disutility is minimized. Owing to the computational complexity of the proposed approach, an approximation method is developed that decomposes the problem into three tractable stages. The first stage identifies a set of most preferable platform combinations. The second stage develops an approximation algorithm based on a greedy approach to mitigate the extensive computational requirements for solving the large number of drone scheduling subproblems. The last stage builds upon the properties of a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method and of the CCP formulation to select the optimum set of platforms.

Resilient airline scheduling to minimize delay risks,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103734,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Airlines tend to design their flights schedules with the primary concern of the minimization of operational costs.

We follow a data-driven method to estimate flight delay probabilities to calculate the airport congestion coefficients required for the probability distributions of non-cruise time random variables. We formulate the problem as a bi-criteria nonlinear mixed integer mathematical model with chance constraints.

Traffic volume prediction using aerial imagery and sparse data from road counts,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103739,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Around the world, metropolitan areas invest in infrastructure for traffic data collection, albeit focusing on highway networks, thus limiting the amount of data available on inner-city roads. For this purpose, various modelling techniques have been developed to interpolate traffic counts spatially and temporally across an entire road network. However, the predictive accuracy of these models depends on the quality and coverage of traffic count data. In this study, we extend the power of spatio-temporal interpolation models with vehicle detection from aerial images, developing a new approach to estimate Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) across all roads in an urban area. Using Google aerial images, we extracted the number of vehicles on a road segment and treated these values as observed traffic counts collected over a short period of time. This information was used as input and merged with traffic count data at stations with longer record lengths to predict traffic on all urban roads. This approach was compared against a hold-out sample of roads with observed traffic count data and images, indicating an R-squared (R2) = 90% and RMSE = 7675 between predicted and observed daily traffic counts and R2 = 58% and RMSE = 18918 between observed and predicted AADT.

A hierarchical solution evaluation method and a hybrid algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with drones and multiple visits,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103733,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) has recently gained much traction among the research community due to its potential to improve efficiency and reduce costs for delivery. However, limited research investigates feasibility evaluation methods for the VRPD due to complex synchronization requirements between truck routes and drone trips. This paper proposes an efficient hierarchical solution evaluation method for a general VRPD problem with multiple visits (VRPD-MV), in which each vehicle is equipped with a single drone capable of serving multiple customers per trip. The endurance model is based on both the payload and flight time of the drone. The solution evaluation method decomposes a combined truck–drone route into its constituent truck segment and drone segment, which are collectively recognized as a route segment. Thereafter, efficient processing methods are developed for each segment type. We hybridize an iterative local search heuristic with a variable neighborhood descent procedure (ILS-VND) to solve the VRPD-MV. The algorithm obtains promising computational results in reasonable times for the VRPD-MV. Specifically, the proposed evaluation method is shown to accelerate the feasibility evaluation of a solution and reduce the time complexity to O ( 1 ) independent of the length of the route.

Optimal pricing and fleet management for shared electric vehicle in coupled power and transport networks,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103727,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper considers a group of shared electric vehicles (SEV) that provide transport and energy services through a ride-sourcing platform. Under the novel business model, the transport and power networks are coupled and the resulting market equilibrium depends on the pricing strategies of the distribution network operator (DNO) and the SEV platform operator. To capture the interaction between the DNO and the SEV platform operator, we develop two market competition models, including (a) a Stackelberg competition model where the DNO makes the decision first and the SEV operator reacts accordingly, and (b) a Nash competition model where the DNO and the SEV operator make decisions simultaneously. The strategic interactions of the DNO and the SEV platform operator are analyzed over a coupled transport and power network, which captures the routing and discharging behaviors of EV drivers, the matching process between passengers and drivers, and the corresponding traveler and power flows. We analytically prove that the supply and demand equilibrium between travelers and EV drivers over the transport network always exists. We also numerically validate that the equilibrium solution between the SEV operator and the DNO is stable and unique. By varying the transport demands, we show that the SEV platform operator, the DNO and EV drivers always benefit from the discharge business even though passengers may be slightly worse off. Surprisingly, we find that integrating the discharging service will have diverse impacts on the cruising traffic depending on the demand levels of the transport service: under low demand level, it will reduce the cruising traffic; under medium demand level, it will increase the cruising traffic; under high demand level, it has no impact on the cruising traffic.",0968-090X,Not found
Truncated tensor Schatten p-norm based approach for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation with complicated missing patterns,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103737,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Rapid advances in sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing and data science have brought unprecedented amount of data to assist transportation engineers and researchers in making better decisions. However, traffic data in reality often has corrupted or incomplete values due to detector and communication malfunctions. Data imputation is thus required to ensure the effectiveness of downstream data-driven applications. To this end, numerous tensor-based methods treating the imputation problem as the low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) have been attempted in previous works. To tackle rank minimization, which is at the core of the LRTC, most of aforementioned methods utilize the tensor nuclear norm (NN) as a convex surrogate for the minimization. However, the over-relaxation issue in NN refrains it from desirable performance in practice. In this paper, we define an innovative nonconvex truncated Schatten p -norm for tensors (TSpN) to approximate tensor rank and impute missing spatiotemporal traffic data under the LRTC framework. We model traffic data into a third-order tensor structure of time intervals × locations (sensors) × days and introduce four complicated missing patterns, including random missing and three fiber-like missing cases according to the tensor mode- n fibers. Despite nonconvexity of the objective function in our model, we derive the global optimal solutions by integrating the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with generalized soft-thresholding (GST). In addition, we design a truncation rate decay strategy to deal with varying missing rate scenarios. Comprehensive experiments are finally conducted using four different types of real-world spatiotemporal traffic datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed LRTC-TSpN method performs well under various missing cases even with high rates of data loss, meanwhile outperforming other state-of-the-art tensor-based imputation models in almost all scenarios. In general, the performance of the proposed method achieves up to a 52% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to baseline methods even when the missing ratio is as high as 90%.

An integrated lane change prediction model incorporating traffic context based on trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103738,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Predicting lane change maneuvers is critical for autonomous vehicles and traffic management as lane change may cause conflict in traffic flow. Most existing studies do not consider the effect of traffic context (i.e., traffic level and vehicle type) on lane change maneuvers. Therefore, these models cannot adapt to different traffic environments. This study aims to address this problem and establish an integrated lane change prediction model incorporating traffic context using machine learning algorithms. In addition, lane change decisions and lane change trajectories are both predicted to capture the whole process, which have been less studied. The framework of the proposed model contains two parts: the traffic context classification model, which is used to predict traffic level and vehicle type, and the integrated lane change prediction model, which is used to predict lane change decision with XGBoost and lane change trajectories with LSTM incorporating context information. Instead of considering lane change, we establish trajectory prediction models for left lane change and right lane change, further improving the prediction accuracy. The naturalistic trajectories of the highD dataset are used to train and validate the model. The results show that the proposed model improves the accuracy from 97.02% to 98.20% when predicting lane change decision that incorporate traffic context. In addition, the MSE decreases from 11.21 to 6.62 when predicting trajectories. The proposed models are also validated on NGSIM dataset, proving the adaptability of the model.

While the reactive algorithm exploits real-time measurements, the predictive approach exploits the Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) optimization algorithm to seek the optimal configuration of the moving walkways over the short term future. Furthermore, we discuss the advantage of using multi-objective optimization to explicitly quantify the trade-off between improving pedestrian travel time or congestion. The simulation results show that the predictive algorithm is generally fairer across different population groups and is better at preventing high congestion. Furthermore, the predictive algorithm can significantly decrease the travel time compared to the reactive and reference scenarios. The results from the prediction approach emphasize the trade-off which must be made between travel time and density. Finally, these results confirm the need for control strategies which are tailored to pedestrian flow dynamics.",0968-090X,Not found
CVLight: Decentralized learning for adaptive traffic signal control with connected vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103728,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper develops a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) scheme for multi-intersection adaptive traffic signal control (TSC), called “CVLight”, that leverages data collected from connected vehicles (CVs). The state and reward design facilitates coordination among agents and considers travel delays collected by CVs. A novel algorithm, Asymmetric Advantage Actor-critic (Asym-A2C), is proposed where both CV and non-CV information is used to train the critic network, while only CV information is used to execute optimal signal timing. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of CVLight over state-of-the-art algorithms under a 2-by-2 synthetic road network with various traffic demand patterns and penetration rates. The learned policy is then visualized to further demonstrate the advantage of Asym-A2C. A pre-train technique is applied to improve the scalability of CVLight, which significantly shortens the training time and shows the advantage in performance under a 5-by-5 road network. A case study is performed on a 2-by-2 road network located in State College, Pennsylvania, USA, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under real-world scenarios. Compared to other baseline models, the trained CVLight agent can efficiently control multiple intersections solely based on CV data and achieve the best performance, especially under low CV penetration rates.",0968-090X,Not found
Incident duration prediction using a bi-level machine learning framework with outlier removal and intra–extra joint optimisation,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103721,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Predicting the duration of traffic incidents is a challenging task due to the stochastic nature of events. The ability to accurately predict how long accidents will last can provide significant benefits to both end-users in their route choice and traffic operation managers in handling of non-recurrent traffic congestion. This paper presents a novel bi-level machine learning framework enhanced with outlier removal and intra–extra joint optimisation for predicting the incident duration on three heterogeneous data sets collected for both arterial roads and motorways from Sydney, Australia and San-Francisco, U.S.A. Firstly, we use incident data logs to develop a binary classification prediction approach, which allows us to classify traffic incidents as short-term or long-term. We find the optimal threshold between short-term versus long-term traffic incident duration, targeting both class balance and prediction performance while also comparing the binary versus multi-class classification approaches using quantiled duration groups and varying threshold split. Secondly, for more granularity of the incident duration prediction to the minute level, we propose a new intra–extra Joint Optimisation algorithm (IEO-ML) which extends multiple baseline ML models tested against several regression scenarios across the data sets. Final results indicate that: (a) 40–45 min is the best split threshold for identifying short versus long-term incidents and that these incidents should be modelled separately, (b) our proposed IEO-ML approach significantly outperforms baseline ML models in 66% of all cases showcasing its great potential for accurate incident duration prediction. Lastly, we evaluate the feature importance and show that time, location, incident type, incident reporting source and weather at among the top 10 critical factors which influence how long incidents will last.",0968-090X,Not found
A joint optimisation model for charger locating and electric bus charging scheduling considering opportunity fast charging and uncertainties,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103732,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The continuous improvement of charging technologies makes fast charging applicable to overcoming the limited driving range of electric vehicles by providing en-route opportunity charging. Fast chargers can be deployed at bus stops to top up the battery for an electric bus during its dwelling time when passengers board and alight, which allows the usage of small size battery and avoids deadheading trips to depot or charging station for recharging. This paper examines the joint optimisation problem of locating fast chargers at selected bus stops and developing charging schedule to support electric bus operation considering time-varying electricity price and penalty cost if passengers’ extra waiting time, the delay time of starting a trip or the excessive travel time of completing a trip is caused by charging activities. To handle the uncertainties associated with the travel time and passenger demand, a robust model is proposed and formulated. The proposed methods are applied to multiple bus routes in Sydney in the numerical studies. The numerical results show that frequent charging activities occur at both intermediate and last stops during bus service trips, indicating that it is beneficial for buses to utilise passengers’ boarding and alighting time at intermediate stops and resting time at the last stop between two adjacent trips to top up battery. Sensitivity analysis on a series of system parameters, such as the acquisition cost of chargers, amortized battery price and charging power, is conducted. The numerical results verify the feasibility of deployment of fast chargers and corresponding top-up charging activities at both intermediate and last stops. Electric buses outperform the conventional diesel buses regarding energy consumption cost, especially considering the increasing diesel fuel price and its costly environmental impacts. Moreover, charging activities at intermediate stops will become more common when passenger demand (the volume of boarding and alighting passengers) increases at intermediate stops.",0968-090X,Not found
Network-scale traffic prediction via knowledge transfer and regional MFD analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103719,141,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Network traffic flow prediction on a fine-grained spatio-temporal scale is essential for intelligent transportation systems, and extensive studies have been carried out in this area. However, existing methods are mostly data-driven, with stringent requirements on the amount and quality of data. The collected network-scale traffic data are expected to be complete, sufficient, and representative, containing most traffic flow patterns in the road network. Unfortunately, it is very rare that sufficient and representative traffic data across the whole road network in several consecutive weeks are available for model calibration. In real-world applications, data insufficiency and dataset shift problems are prevalent, resulting in the ‘cold start’ issue in traffic prediction. To deal with the challenges above, this paper develops a two-stage physics-informed transfer learning method for network-scale link-wise traffic flow knowledge transfer under MFD-based physical constraints. In the first stage, the road network is partitioned and similar traffic regions are identified according to the physical invariants and MFD characteristics. In this way, the network-scale link-wise traffic flow pattern transfer between similar regions can be initiated under the assumption that regions with similar aggregated traffic flow patterns are more likely to share comparable link-wise traffic flow features. In the second stage, we propose our knowledge transfer architecture Deep Tensor Adaptation Network (DTAN) to bridge traffic flow knowledge in source and target regions via the parallel Siamese network structure, and further reduce domain discrepancy by imposing two distribution adaptation regularizations. A real-world traffic dataset on the urban expressway network of Beijing is used for numerical tests. The experiment results show that the proposed framework can leverage the trade-off between specific regression task performance in a single region and generalized domain adaptation capacity across multiple regions. The data insufficiency, dataset shift, and heavy computational cost problems are alleviated by improving model transferability. Finally, extensive empirical analysis is carried out to explore traffic flow pattern transferability and its relation to network traffic properties.",0968-090X,Not found

Deep reinforcement learning for transit signal priority in a connected environment,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103814,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Transit signal priority (TSP) is an effective measure to reduce traffic congestion and improve bus efficiency in metropolises. The connected vehicle technology and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can respectively provide more detailed and accurate information and more robust algorithms to traffic signal control systems, to develop smarter TSP strategies. This paper proposes an extended Dueling Double Deep Q-learning with invalid action masking (eD3QNI) algorithm for TSP strategy in a connected environment. The algorithm considers multiple conflicting bus priority requests and the constraints on the traffic light and phase skipping rule, aiming to improve the person delay of buses. Its performance is evaluated by simulation for a single intersection with two traffic demands and random arrivals, schedule deviations, occupancies of buses. Results demonstrate that eD3QNI produces lower average person delay and schedule delay than fixed-time signal, active TSP strategies, and other common RL methods. It also shows that the invalid action masking (IAM) method is superior to the usual variable decision points (VDP) method in terms of high convergence speed, effective performance improvement, and application of domain knowledge on the RL algorithm. The penetration rates of connected buses do not affect the converging speed of the proposed method, and an environment with a higher penetration rate will show better performance. Moreover, under the proposed method, different specific reward functions can be incorporated as desired to realize different operational goals for the TSP strategies.",0968-090X,Not found
Electrification of a bus system with fast charging stations: Impact of battery degradation on design decisions,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103807,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"In this paper, we evaluate the cost of the electrification of an existing bus network.

The proposed mathematical models investigate different charging policies and measure their impacts on overall cost. Battery degradation is estimated by a tailored and linearized semi-empirical approach and is explicitly incorporated in the proposed mixed-integer linear models. The impact of different charging policies on reducing the overall costs is evaluated for a bus network in Rotterdam.

Ride acceptance behaviour of ride-sourcing drivers,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103783,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The performance of ride-sourcing services such as Uber and Lyft is determined by the collective choices of individual drivers who are not only chauffeurs but private fleet providers. In such a context, ride-sourcing drivers are free to decide whether to accept or decline ride requests assigned by the ride-hailing platform. Drivers’ ride acceptance behaviour can significantly influence system performance in terms of riders’ waiting time (associated with the level of service), drivers’ occupation rate and idle time (related to drivers’ income), and platform revenue and reputation. Hence, it is of great importance to identify the underlying determinants of the ride acceptance behaviour of drivers. To this end, we collected a unique dataset from ride-sourcing drivers working in the United States and the Netherlands through a cross-sectional stated preference experiment designed based upon disparate information conveyed to the respondents. Using a choice modelling approach, we estimated the effects of various existing and hypothetical attributes influencing the ride acceptance choice. Employment status, experience level with the platform, and working shift are found to be the key individual-specific determinants. Part-time and beginning drivers who work on midweek days (Monday-Thursday) have a higher tendency to accept ride offers. Results also reveal that pickup time, which is the travel time between the driver’s location and the rider’s waiting spot, has a negative impact on ride acceptance. Moreover, the findings suggest that a guaranteed tip (i.e., the minimum amount of tip that is indicated upfront by the prospective rider, a feature that is currently not available) and an additional income due to surge pricing are valued noticeably higher than trip fare. The provided insights can be used to develop customised matching and pricing strategies to improve system efficiency. Since the study has been conducted during the COVID-19 crisis, the potential implications of the pandemic on ride acceptance behaviour have been examined using an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) model. The results show that drivers with a higher sensitivity to the COVID-19 effects tend to have a lower acceptance rate.",0968-090X,Not found
Time-dependent on-street parking planning in a connected and automated environment,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103745,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Parking remains a serious difficulty in metropolitan transport mainly because of the supply shortage in downtown areas. The parking experience will be improved with the support of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, enabled by remote parking functionality. Nevertheless, remote parking of CAVs not only results in additional surface traffic but also increases the total vehicle miles traveled (VMT). On the other hand, it is possible to manage the overall traffic by a centralized system with the assistance of CAV technology, which brings the potential for using road resources more flexibly. Inspired by the above ideas, this paper investigates a novel scheme to transfer some lanes to provide on-street parking spaces for CAVs within a necessary period to reduce “cruise-for-parking” travel; as such transfer compromises road capacity, a methodological framework is required to optimally plan the scheme for maximizing certain social goals. We formulate the on-street planning problem as a multi-period mixed-integer linear program with inter-period constraints, which determines the locations and opening durations of on-street parking lots, as well as the assignment of all parking demands across the network. Approximate approaches are adopted to solve the problem for large-scale instances. Numerical experiments are conducted on a real-world network in Wangjing District, Beijing. The results indicate that appropriate time-dependent planning of on-street parking can reduce the total VMT by 10%–27% under various demand levels.",0968-090X,Not found
Congestion-mitigating MPC design for adaptive cruise control based on Newell's car following model: History outperforms prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103801,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Currently, model predictive control (MPC) for adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems relies on the prediction of the leader’s motion to plan the follower’s trajectory. However, such predictions must be accurate to guarantee string stability, which represents an ongoing challenge for machine learning approaches. This issue can be circumvented by simply incorporating the leader’s history, which follows from Newell’s car-following (CF) model where a trajectory under congestion corresponds to a temporal–spatial shift of the leader’s past trajectories. By leveraging this insight, this paper develops a family of MPC models based on Newell’s CF model, labeled Newell MPCs, which are safe and can reduce traffic congestion. Specifically, We first present baseline Newell MPCs to replicate the original Newell’s CF model, including the X b o u n d -Model, which uses the shifted leader trajectory as an upper envelope; and the X r e f -Model, which adopts the shifted leader trajectory as a reference to avoid the issue of infeasible solution triggered by hard constraints. To further improve the control performance, we propose the X V -Model which uses the leader speed history as an additional reference to enhance the model robustness and regulate speed over/under-shootings. In addition, we extend the single-leader Newell’s model through incorporating multiple leaders and propose the X m u l -Model, which can achieve driver anticipation, and correspondingly reduce reaction time and improve string stability. Finally, based on the X V -Model, we present two additional extensions: (i) the X V r e l a x -Model, which incorporates driver relaxation to achieve smooth response to merging traffic; and (ii) the X V s s -Model, which achieves strict string stability to further dampen traffic oscillations.

Effectiveness of trip planner data in predicting short-term bus ridership,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103790,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Predictions on Public Transport (PT) ridership are beneficial as they allow for sufficient and cost-efficient deployment of vehicles. On an operational level, this relates to short-term predictions with lead times of less than an hour. Where conventional data sources on ridership, such as Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) data, may have longer lag times and contain no travel intentions, in contrast, trip planner data are often available in (near) real-time and are used before traveling. In this paper, we investigate how such data from a trip planner app can be utilized for short-term bus ridership predictions. This is combined with AFC data (in this case smart card data) to construct a ground truth on actual ridership. Using informative variables from the trip planner dataset through correlation analysis, we develop 3 supervised Machine Learning (ML) models, including k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boosting. The best-performing model relies on random forest regression with trip planner requests. Compared with the baseline model that depends on the weekly trend, it reduces the mean absolute error by approximately half. Moreover, using the same model with and without trip planner data, we prove the usefulness of trip planner data by an improved mean absolute error of 8.9% and 21.7% and an increased coefficient of determination from a 5-fold cross-validation of 7.8% and 18.5% for two case study lines, respectively. Lastly, we show that this model performance is maintained even for the trip planner requests with prediction lead times up to 30 min ahead, and for different periods of the day. We expect our methodology to be useful for PT operators to elevate their daily operations and level of service as well as for trip planner companies to facilitate passenger replanning, in particular during peak hours.",0968-090X,Not found

This work develops a novel iterative approach to tackle two of these stages jointly: line planning and timetabling. Compared to existing approaches that iteratively ban a whole conflicting line plan when the timetable is found infeasible, our method can accurately identify the smallest set of incompatible services. Besides, by efficiently exploiting the available railway infrastructure, our method accounts for all the possible routing options of trains, a feature commonly neglected to reduce complexity but that helps gaining timetable feasibility. Using real data from a railway company in Switzerland, we find that our approach is (i) practical for solving real-life instances, (ii) an order of magnitude faster than existing benchmarks, and (iii) able to solve more instances.

Capacity allocation and tolling-rewarding schemes for the morning commute with carpooling,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103789,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This study investigates the road capacity allocation scheme and step tolling-rewarding scheme for carpooling. Different from most studies that assume a single or a continuous carpooling ratio, this study models multiple scenarios explicitly considering two-person, three-person, and four-person carpooling, as well as shared vans or shuttle buses. The proposed capacity allocation schemes reserve road service capacity during designated time windows for specific carpooling vehicles. During these time windows, the road service capacity is exclusively allocated to carpooling vehicles with a designated number of commuters (or carpoolers), while other vehicles are only allowed to pass the roadway bottleneck outside these time windows. Multiple reserved time windows can be designed and allocated to carpooling vehicles with different numbers of carpoolers. We examine the commuting equilibrium profile under given temporal capacity allocation schemes. We also model the potential “braking or tactical waiting” behavior due to temporal changes of right-of-way under the capacity allocation schemes. On the one hand, the temporal capacity allocation scheme encourages more carpoolers to share one vehicle and thus the number of vehicles on the road is potentially reduced; on the other hand, the temporal capacity allocation scheme yields inconvenience costs due to carpooling and road capacity waste due to braking or tactical waiting behavior under the capacity allocation scheme. We model this trade-off and quantify the system performance under the temporal road capacity allocation scheme. We also extend the analysis to the cases with heterogeneous inconvenience costs due to carpooling and with both temporal and spatial road capacity allocation (i.e., a proportion of road capacity is used for carpooling during certain time windows). Furthermore, we integrate the step tolling-rewarding scheme with the capacity allocation scheme, which further manages the carpooling choices and reduces total system cost. Numerical studies are presented to illustrate the analytical results. We found that carpooling should not be rewarded in some occasions, and instead should be penalized to avoid overcrowded carpooling flows in order to improve system efficiency.",0968-090X,Not found

However, in a complex urban road network with extensive and stochastic roadside service demands, current macroscopic dispatch methods can hardly establish accurate and real-time matching relationships between taxis and passengers, and microscopic dispatch methods have the disadvantage of excessive computational complexity and nonupdatable match relationships. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical and cooperative macroscopic and microscopic dynamic dispatching approach for real-time urban network taxis in a connected taxi (CTaxi) information environment. First, network traffic flow dynamic evolution is described based on a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), and the optimal macroscopic dispatching model is proposed to optimize the distribution of CTaxis for large-scale urban road networks with multiple MFD sub-regions. Second, to avoid the phenomenon of CTaxis blindly searching for passengers, a microscopic and relationship-updatable dispatching strategy between CTaxis and passengers is established within each MFD sub-region considering stochastic service demands and the signal timing of intersections.

The framework splits the problem into two subtasks, a trajectory forecasting task based on historical data and an imputation task based on the forecasting results and real-time incomplete observational data. Temporal features are extracted and fused following an encoder-decoder architecture.

Optimal en-route charging station locations for electric vehicles: A new modeling perspective and a comparative evaluation of network-based and metanetwork-based approaches,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103781,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"In many regions across the world, the distribution density of electricity-charging stations is yet sufficient for taming the range anxiety concern of electric vehicle drivers. In such driving circumstances, making detours to find alternative charging opportunities is often an operational remedy to accomplish long-distance trips. To reduce the frequency and extra mileage of detouring, public charging infrastructures should be coordinately sited and constructed in a regional network. With the goal of minimizing the possible detour mileage, this paper describes an optimal charging station location problem for intercity highway networks and develops two approaches for modeling and solving it. Specifically, two mixed linear integer programming models are constructed in different network modeling paradigms: The first one is formed and solved on the basis of the original node-link network topology, with newly introduced integer variables such as path and subpath activation indicators to quantify the utilization status of paths and subpaths, respectively. The classic branch-and-bound algorithm encapsulating a bi-criteria label-correcting algorithm is designed for solving this network-based model. The other one is formulated and solved relying on the station-subpath metanetwork topology, as the result of a two-phase process that decomposes an individual routing and charging decision into two parts. The two phases are conducted on the node-link network and station-subpath metanetwork levels, respectively, where the first phase is done by solving a network-based, distance-constrained minimum-cost path problem, while the second phase collapses to a metanetwork-based, simple minimum-cost path problem. The findings we obtained through conducting this research are twofold: First, analytical and computational studies clearly identify the effectiveness of the two modeling and solution approaches, while the metanetwork-based approach exhibits its appealing computing advantage for solving problems of large size; second, the application of the solution approaches for a real-world network instance reveals how budget limit and distance limit impact the charging station locations, individual routing and charging decisions, and network cost and accessibility levels.",0968-090X,Not found
Robust unsupervised learning of temporal dynamic vehicle-to-vehicle interactions,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103768,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Robust unsupervised learning of temporal dynamic interactions is an important problem in robotic learning in general and automated unsupervised learning in particular. Temporal dynamic interactions can be described by (multiple) geometric trajectories in a suitable space over which unsupervised learning techniques may be applied to extract useful features from raw and high-dimensional data measurements. Taking a geometric approach to robust unsupervised learning for temporal dynamic interactions, it is necessary to develop suitable metrics and a systematic methodology for comparison and for assessing the stability of an unsupervised learning method concerning its tuning parameters. Such metrics must account for (geometric) constraints in the physical world as well as uncertainties associated with the learned patterns. In this paper, we introduce a model-free metric based on the Procrustes distance for robust learning of dynamic vehicle interactions, and an optimal transport-based distance metric for comparing between distributions of interaction patterns. These distance metrics can serve as an objective for assessing the stability of an interaction learning algorithm. They are also used for comparing the outcomes produced by different algorithms. Moreover, they may also be adopted as an objective function to obtain clusters and representative interaction primitives. These concepts and techniques will be introduced, along with mathematical properties, while their usefulness will be demonstrated in unsupervised learning of vehicle-to-vehicle interactions extracted from the Safety Pilot database, one of the world’s largest databases for connected vehicles. Results reveal that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques under several well-founded notions of clustering efficiencies.",0968-090X,Not found

Trajectory pattern identification and classification for real-time air traffic applications in Area Navigation terminal airspace,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103765,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"In order to address the continuing growth of demands on airspace capacity, various navigation methods have been developed such as Area Navigation (RNAV), which allows pilots and air traffic controllers to have a higher degree of freedom in the airspace, but at the same time, the airspace becomes more complex than ever, and maintaining the safety and efficiency becomes challenging. To develop assistant tools for such situation, this paper proposes (i) a trajectory pattern identification framework that can identify complex and diverse trajectory patterns in the RNAV terminal airspace, and (ii) a recurrent neural network-based real-time trajectory pattern classification framework that is necessary for real-time air traffic applications.

Who moves the locker? A benchmark study of alternative mobile parcel locker concepts,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103780,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Stationary parcel lockers have established as useful delivery options, especially for those households where nobody is at home during typical parcel delivery times. However, having to move toward a locker, maybe after a tiring workday, can be inconvenient for customers. Mobile parcel lockers, especially when driving autonomously, can be positioned closer to the customers and thus seem as a logical next evolutionary step to reduce customer inconvenience. Until autonomous driving is finally realized, however, mobile parcel lockers depend on human-driven vehicles to reposition them, and this paper compares optional locker–vehicle–driver setups. In the most restrictive case, a parcel locker is fixedly mounted onto a vehicle and equipped with a dedicated driver. But a human driver can also be in charge of multiple lockers, so that the driver must travel, e.g., via public transport, between different lockers in order to reposition them. There are also first concepts without a fixed coupling of lockers that are only loaded onto their vehicles. Hence, a vehicle equipped with an automated handling mechanism can subsequently reposition multiple mobile locker modules between different parking positions. Based on the assumption that a given set of customers is to be serviced with a predefined service level, this paper provides a flexible heuristic multi-stage optimization approach that minimizes the total costs associated with each of these concepts. This algorithm is applied in a benchmark study to compare the alternative mobile parcel locker concepts, and our results reveal substantial differences among them. For instance, we show that mobile locker modules are very effective to provide better customer service (i.e., smaller walking distances and longer parking durations) at low cost",0968-090X,Not found
Energy and mobility impacts of connected autonomous vehicles with co-optimization of speed and powertrain on mixed vehicle platoons,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103764,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Intersections are known to be traffic bottlenecks where a significant amount of energy consumption could be caused due to deceleration/acceleration in the presence of red signals. With an increased level of connectivity and automation of intelligent transportation systems, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to be able to proactively adjust their driving strategies subject to constraints imposed by the predicted future traffic. As a result, many potential benefits can be achieved, such as improved energy efficiency, enhanced traffic safety, among many others. Notably, the way CAVs are controlled affects the following legacy vehicles (LVs) due to complex traffic dynamics. In this article, we are particularly interested in studying the energy and mobility impact of CAVs with an improved traffic prediction method on mixed vehicle platoons at various market penetration rates. Leveraging traffic prediction, CAVs are controlled with co-optimization of their speed and gear position. Specifically, a traffic prediction framework in a rolling horizon fashion is employed based upon a modified Payne–Whitham (PW) model capable of handling mixed traffic consisting of CAVs and LVs. The prediction error of the modified PW model is reduced by 53.62% compared to that of the standard PW model under test scenarios. According to the predicted traffic conditions, speed and gear position of CAVs are co-optimized with the primary goal of minimizing energy consumption when driving on a signalized arterial. The energy benefits achieved by CAVs and the impact of CAVs on LVs behind are studied comprehensively for mixed vehicle platoons. The lead LV follows a real-world speed profile collected on TH-55 in Minnesota. Numerical results show that energy benefits achieved by the vehicle platoon range from 2% to 16%, and a 1% to 5% reduction in travel time for LVs behind CAVs is also observed, at different penetration rates of CAVs in various traffic scenarios. In addition, it is observed that CAVs using the proposed eco-driving approach appear to have a positive impact on the LVs behind in terms of energy consumption, regardless of the driving styles of the LVs ahead.",0968-090X,Not found
Heterogeneous traffic information provision on road networks with competitive or cooperative information providers,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103762,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This paper studies the long-term effects of heterogeneous information provision on road networks with multiple information providers (IPs). To capture the information heterogeneity resulting from various IPs, we consider that users subscribing to different IPs receive non-identical information sets about the available routes and make route choices within their information sets. We investigate both IPs’ strategic interactions and users’ route choices in a bi-level “leader–follower” game. At the upper level, IPs act as leaders who compete or cooperate to determine the optimal information sets provided for their users to maximize their objectives. Three models are developed to investigate IPs’ strategic interactions, i.e., Nash game, Stackelberg game, and cooperation, in which IPs are non-cooperative, leader and followers, and cooperative, respectively. At the lower level, users act as followers to choose their user-optimal routes based on their received information sets. Wardrop Equilibrium with Multiple Information Classes (WEMIC) is defined to capture users’ route choices. The WEMIC problem is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem. The existence and uniqueness of the VI solution are proved. When IPs play the Nash game, the problem is formulated as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) with discrete variables and non-continuous payoff functions. To solve the EPEC efficiently, we propose a Binary Coded Nash Dominance based Evolutionary (BCNDE) algorithm embedded with a heuristic method for action space reduction. Finally, numerical experiments with two IPs (a big IP and a small IP) are conducted to analyze the effects of unit information cost in the Nash game and the impact of the leader’s strategy in the Stackelberg game, respectively. We find that the small IP may benefit from higher information costs in the Nash game. Moreover, the effects of IPs’ competition and cooperation are compared from both the perspectives of IPs and the system. The results indicate that cooperation can reduce congestion and make both IPs better off. On the Nguyen–Dupuis network, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the BCNDE algorithm and analyze the effects of market share distribution in the Nash game. We also extend this study by considering elastic demand. The extended models, theoretical proofs, and corresponding numerical experiments are provided.",0968-090X,Not found

Modeling and simulation of approaching behaviors to signalized intersections based on risk quantification,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103773,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The stop/go decisions made by drivers who are approaching signalized intersections during yellow period will affect the safety and efficiency of intersections. Existing research mostly modeled drivers’ decision-making behaviors using real-world driving data, while these datasets were collected in different traffic flows and road environments, and it is difficult to develop models suitable for different intersections. Aiming at explaining the approaching behaviors to signalized intersections from the perspective of human behavioral mechanism, this study establishes a driving behavior model framework, including a risk field model of dynamic traffic control elements independent on yellow duration, and a trajectory planning model constructed according to the risk homeostasis theory and preview-follower theory. Probabilities of passing the stop line during yellow period and the distribution of acceleration and deceleration rates when passing are obtained in the simulation by the Monte Carlo method. Results show the validity of the proposed model and its applicability to drivers with different desired risks. Compared to the proposed model, drivers are more inclined to use smaller acceleration rates or greater deceleration rates when entering intersections in observed cases. The intervention of reaction time may decrease the probabilities of passing. This study is an indispensable supplement to our previous study, contributing a unified model based on risk quantification to comprehensively describe the risk of the traffic environment, and is an attempt to promote the development of driving behavior models.",0968-090X,Not found
Managing merging from a CAV lane to a human-driven vehicle lane considering the uncertainty of human driving,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103775,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This paper proposes a control strategy for a freeway merging bottleneck consisting of a Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) exclusive lane and a human-driven vehicle (HDV) lane, aiming to achieve fuel economy and increase traffic efficiency. The trajectories of CAVs are optimized to enable them to smoothly merge into the gaps in the HDV lane. We utilize a stochastic car-following model to incorporate the uncertainty of HDVs and adopt the concept of α-percentile trajectory proposed in our earlier work (Xiong and Jiang, 2021) to estimate the trajectories of HDVs. Based on these, an optimization model is constructed to optimize the merging sequence and the merging trajectories of CAVs simultaneously. We use dynamic programming to solve the optimization model. Dividing RECTangles algorithm and Hamiltonian analysis are imbedded as a subroutine to obtain the energy efficient merging trajectory of each CAV. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy is capable of reducing average fuel consumption and travel time under a wide range of inflow rates. The benefits depend on the inflow rate and the trajectory percentile α. When the total inflow rate is low, the impact of α is insignificant. If the total inflow rate increases to a high level, the impact of α becomes remarkable and the maximum benefits would be achieved at an intermediate range of α. Moreover, the computation efficiency of the proposed system is fast enough and can be implemented in real-time in the near future.",0968-090X,Not found
A local traffic characteristic based dynamic gains tuning algorithm for cooperative adaptive cruise control considering wireless communication delay,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103766,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Due to the inevitable existence of wireless communication delay, the string stability of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) platoon systems may not be guaranteed if the controller gains are not tuned in time. Most relevant studies discussed how to determine the stable region of controller gains under different communication delays, but seldom told us how to select the optimal gains. Some simulation-based approaches just gave out the feasible gains to meet CACC string stability conditions under different communication delays by using standard input signal (e.g. Sine wave, step function) as the leading vehicle acceleration curve. Unfortunately, as the above approaches did not consider the local traffic characteristics, these feasible gains were not robust enough and even failed when tackling a realistic environment. To this end, this paper proposes a dynamic controller gains tuning algorithm to ensure CACC string stability. First, a synthesized leading vehicle acceleration curve is obtained by performing an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) on the average frequency spectra of 230 vehicles’ acceleration from the next-generation simulation (NGSIM) dataset, which is highly related to the local traffic flow characteristics of the specified road. Then, the ratio of the ∞ -norm of the spacing error between the ego vehicle and the preceding vehicle is set as the objective function, and with the synthesized curve as the input of the vehicle platoon, we apply an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to dynamically tune the gains of the CACC controller when the wireless communication delay changes. Hereby, the improved PSO utilizes the nonlinear decreasing inertia weight to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, three groups of detailed simulation experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and performance of the dynamic optimal gains generated by the synthesized curve on string stability and assess the convergence speed of the improved PSO. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional methods and can significantly suppress the disturbance along the direction upstream of the platoon.",0968-090X,Not found
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Driving Recommendations to Mitigate Aggressiveness and Riskiness: Modeling and Impact Assessment,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103770,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Most driving recommendation and assistance systems, such as Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), are usually designed based on the behavior of an average driver.

In this paper, an enhanced self-aware driving recommendation system is developed using a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, which produces personalized driving recommendations with a view to improving driving safety, while respecting individual driving styles and preferences. The impact of applying this recommendation system is evaluated through microscopic simulation; findings revealed that, in case all drivers follow the suggestions, there is a significant improvement in road safety and some minor changes in traffic flow properties.

However, a vehicle-infrastructure cooperative approach, in which infrastructure and vehicles cooperate to perform the different driving tasks, may prevail in enabling automated driving. This paper conducts an economic analysis of vehicle infrastructure cooperation for automated driving. In doing so, we present a model that captures investment decisions in vehicle automation and infrastructure digitalization and their effect on travelers’ purchase and travel decisions. Our analysis shows that, under certain conditions, equipping both infrastructure and vehicles is socially optimal. However, by analyzing strategic interactions between infrastructure support service providers and automakers, we show that lack of coordination between these two actors results in suboptimal investment in vehicle automation and infrastructure digitalization. Especially, when these two technologies are complementary, service providers are reluctant to invest in digital infrastructure and vehicle manufacturers tend to over equip their vehicles so as to avoid relying on infrastructure technology. Thus, we conclude by showing that better coordination between automakers and service providers – under the form of profit sharing – is welfare-improving and could potentially yield the socially optimal levels of automation and digitalization.",0968-090X,Not found
Data efficient reinforcement learning and adaptive optimal perimeter control of network traffic dynamics,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103759,142,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Existing data-driven and feedback traffic control strategies do not consider the heterogeneity of real-time data measurements. Besides, traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for traffic control usually converge slowly for lacking data efficiency. Moreover, conventional optimal perimeter control schemes require exact knowledge of the system dynamics and thus they would be fragile to endogenous uncertainties. To handle these challenges, this work proposes an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) based approach to learning the macroscopic traffic dynamics for adaptive optimal perimeter control. This work makes the following primary contributions to the transportation literature: (a) A continuous-time control is developed with discrete gain updates to adapt to the discrete-time sensor data. Different from the conventional RL approaches, the reinforcement interval of the proposed IRL method can be varying with respect to the real-time resolution of data measurements. Approximate optimization methods are carried out to address the curse of dimensionality of the optimal control problem with consideration on the resolution of data measurement. (b) To reduce the sampling complexity and use the available data more efficiently, the experience replay (ER) technique is introduced to the IRL algorithm. (c) The proposed method relaxes the requirement on model calibration in a “model-free” manner that enables robustness against modeling uncertainty and enhances the real-time performance via a data-driven RL algorithm. (d) The convergence of the IRL based algorithms and the stability of the controlled traffic dynamics are proven via the Lyapunov theory. The optimal control law is parameterized and then approximated by neural networks (NN), which moderates the computational complexity. Both state and input constraints are considered while no model linearization is required. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.",0968-090X,Not found
Price of competition and fragmentation in ride-sourcing markets,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103851,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This paper proposes a general model for describing the equilibrium state of a ride-sourcing market with an arbitrary number of platforms competing with each other. As the number of platforms increases, the market changes from monopoly to duopoly, oligopoly, and finally perfect competition, bringing about two different effects on system efficiency. On the one hand, as in other service markets, competition in the ride-sourcing markets prevents a monopolist platform from extracting excessive profit by distorting its operating strategies from socially efficient levels. On the other hand, competition between platforms leads to market fragmentation, thereby increasing matching frictions and passengers’ waiting time. To well characterize these two opposite driven forces, we develop a game-theoretical model to find out the Nash equilibrium solutions of a competitive ride-sourcing market, at which no platform can increase its profits by unilaterally changing its own strategy. Then we try to quantify the price (efficiency gain or loss) of competition and fragmentation by establishing an upper bound of the inefficiency ratio, i.e., the ratio of social welfare under a social optimum to social welfare under a competitive Nash equilibrium. We show that the results of market equilibrium, including the inefficiency ratio, are jointly governed by the degree of market fragmentation and competition among platforms. In particular, we find that some key market measures, such as consumer surplus, platform profits, social welfare, display diverse trends of changes with respect to the number of platforms, as the on-demand matching between passengers and drivers exhibits increasing, constant, and decreasing returns to scale.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimizing lane reversals in transportation networks to reduce traffic congestion: A global optimization approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103840,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This paper studies how to reduce the overall travel time of commuters in a transportation network by reversing the direction of some lanes in the network using a macroscopic network-wide perspective. Similar to the Network Design Problem, the lane reversal problem has been shown to be NP-hard given the dependence of the users’ route selection on the lane direction decision. Herein, we propose and compare three efficient methods to solve the routing and lane reversal problem jointly. First, we introduce an alternating method that decouples the routing and lane assignment problems. Second, we propose a Frank–Wolfe method that jointly takes gradient steps to adjust both the lane assignment and routing decisions. Third, we propose a convex approximation method that uses a threshold-based approach to convexify the joint routing and lane reversal objective. The convex approximation method is advantageous since it finds a global optimum solution for the approximated problem and it enables the possibility to include linear constraints. Using this method, we extend the main formulation to be able to limit a maximum number of reversed lanes, as well as to incorporate multiple origin–destination (OD) patterns. We test the proposed methods in a case study using the transportation network of Eastern Massachusetts where our results indicate an overall reduction in travel times of 4.7% by selecting the best 15 reversals. Moreover, using a small test network, we investigate the performance of the lane reversal strategies as a function of the OD demand symmetry. As expected, we observe that when the OD demand is very asymmetric (e.g., for a single OD pair, evacuations, large events), the reduction in travel times is larger than the symmetric case, reaching travel time reductions of 60%.",0968-090X,Not found

A periodic optimization approach is adopted to periodically collect passenger demands, optimize customized bus routes for the period, and re-optimize the routes to cater to late-coming customers. The static problem for each period is modeled as a time-dependent customized bus routing problem with time windows and release date (TDCBRPTW-R), which is solved with a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm combining adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) with variable neighborhood descent (VND). An acceleration method is developed for insertion feasibility check for the TDCBRPTW-R. The stability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in the numerical experiments derived from Solomon’s data set. For the periodic re-optimization procedure, four methods are proposed to handle late customers according to different application scenarios.

In this paper, we formulate and solve a novel seamless evacuation route plan problem, by designing | K | spanning trees with side constraints that capture the refueling needs of each k ∈ K vehicle fuel type on their way to reach a shelter. We develop a branch-and-price matheuristic algorithm based on column generation to solve the evacuation route planning problem. We apply the proposed framework to the Sioux Falls transportation network with existing infrastructure deployment and present numerical experiments. Specifically, we discuss the optimal system evacuation travel and refueling times under scenarios of various alternative fuel vehicle driving ranges. Our findings show that the characteristics of each vehicle fuel type, like driving range and the refueling infrastructure topology, play a pivotal role in determining evacuation route plans. This means that an evacuation route could prove unique to a single vehicle fuel type, while being infeasible to others. Finally, we observe that the driving range constraints could force evacuee vehicles to detour to meet their refueling needs before reaching safety and increase the total evacuation time by 7.32 % in one of evaluated scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found

Adopting the network perspective, this paper aims to provide an integrated framework for summarizing the methodological developments of modeling TTR in transportation networks, including its characterization, evaluation and valuation, and traffic assignment.

This study investigated the competition and coordination behavior in public transport mode choice with both positive and negative externalities. Subjects participated in a mode-choice game in which they were required to choose between bus and metro. The externalities in one public transport mode were determined by its characteristics and how many individuals chose it. We examined two treatments with different amounts of information: less information and more information, corresponding to non-implementing and implementing advanced traveler information systems, respectively. We derived three different theoretical solutions (i.e., the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, the mixed-strategy equilibrium, and the fair-reference point) as benchmarks to compare with the experimental outcomes, finding that the fair-reference point was achieved when more information was provided, whereas the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium was better to predict the choice behavior when providing less information. Furthermore, the comparison of the two treatments revealed the information paradox, indicating that information affected the public transport mode choice behavior, and more information might lead to worse outcomes. The spontaneous collective actions induced by less information and risk aversion could exert the benefits from positive externalities, thereby reducing travel costs compared with more information. Also, we adopted an adaptive learning model to reproduce the main findings in the experiment and exhibit simulated results under different levels of information provision, providing a parsimonious explanation for the information paradox.",0968-090X,Not found
Distributed cooperative trajectory and lane changing optimization of connected automated vehicles: Freeway segments with lane drop,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103761,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This study presents a methodology for optimal control of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in freeway segments with a lane drop. Lane drops can create bottlenecks with a considerable number of mandatory and discretionary lane-changing maneuvers when traffic volume is high, which can eventually lead to stop-and-go conditions. Proper motion planning aligned with optimal lane changing upstream of a lane drop can increase capacity and reduce the number of stops and the risk of collision. This paper introduces a vehicle-level mixed-integer program to control longitudinal and lateral movement of CAVs, provide a smooth flow of traffic, and avoid congestion in freeway segments with lane drops. To ensure the feasibility of vehicle-level decisions and promote system-level optimality, a cooperative distributed algorithm is established, where CAVs coordinate their decisions to find the optimal longitudinal and lateral maneuvers that avoid collisions among all vehicles. The proposed coordination scheme lets CAVs find their optimal trajectories based on predictive information from surrounding vehicles (i.e., future locations and speeds) and coordinate their lane-changing decisions to avoid collisions. The results show that optimal lane changing of CAVs smoothens the traffic flow and increases freeway capacity in congested traffic conditions. Compared with all-knowing CAVs simulated in Vissim, the proposed methodology reduced the average travel time by up to 86.4%. It increased the number of completed trips by up to 134.3% based on various traffic demands and lane drop layout combinations.",0968-090X,Not found
"Metro crew planning with day-off pattern, duty type, and rostering scheme considerations",10.1016/j.trc.2022.103832,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The metro crew planning must consider various complex factors in real scenarios, such as day-off requirements, duty types, and rostering rules. The metro crew planning problem is often divided into crew scheduling and rostering problems, which are modeled separately and solved sequentially. However, the solution determined in a sequential planning process may not guarantee the optimality of the entire crew planning problem. This study is a first attempt at including rostering pattern consideration in the metro crew planning problem, where a rostering pattern is defined as the combination of a day-off pattern, a set of duty types and a rostering scheme. To solve this complicated problem, we first generate a multiple-layer time–space network where duty time windows with specific duty types are represented by different layers. We then model the considered crew planning problem using a path-based integer program on the time–space network and develop two column generation-based heuristics to solve the problem, where dual prices are particularly used in generating train paths. A computational study is conducted with real-life data derived from Hefei Metro to examine the effectiveness of the modeling and solution methods as well as observe the benefits of roster pattern designs.",0968-090X,Not found
Make space to change lane: A cooperative adaptive cruise control lane change controller,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103847,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This research proposes a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control Lane Change (CACCLC) controller. It is designed for maneuvering a CACC platoon to change lane in dense traffic. The proposed controller has the following features: i) with enhanced change-lane-in-dense-traffic capability; ii) with an improved success rate of lane-change; iii) with string stability. A Backward-Looking (BL) CACC information topology is adopted for better serving the objective of making space to change lane. The proposed controller is evaluated on a simulation platform with the context of traffic and a joint simulation platform consisting of PreScan and Matlab/Simulink. The proposed controller is evaluated against the conventional simultaneous CACCLC controller. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted in terms of congestion level and road type. Results demonstrate that, compared to the conventional simultaneous CACCLC method, the proposed controller does enhance CACCLC capability no matter the lane-change competence and efficiency. The magnitude of enhancement on competence is 29.13 % on arterials and 43.14 % on freeways on average. The magnitude of enhancement on efficiency is 88.65 % on arterials and 92.30 % on freeways on average.

Congestion tolling — Dollars versus tokens: Within-day dynamics,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103836,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Tradable credit schemes (or tolling in tokens) are a form of quantity control, which promise to be an appealing alternative to congestion pricing (or tolling in dollars) owing to considerations of revenue neutrality, equity, reduced infrastructure costs, and political acceptability. The comparative performance of the two instruments under uncertainty in demand and supply has only recently received attention in the transportation setting, despite being widely studied for emission markets. In this paper, we add to this literature by considering a tradable credit scheme in a departure time context wherein users are provided an initial endowment of tokens by the regulator and incur a token charge (determined prior to all departures) to travel in a specific time-period. Tokens can be bought and sold within a marketplace at a price determined endogenously by token demand and supply. Two key features of the market model are: (1) the time-of-day dynamics of price is explicitly modeled through a smooth market clearing mechanism in each period, and (2) the selling decisions of users, which determine the distribution of token supply in the market over the day are explicitly modeled. This enables us to study the impact of selling behavior on performance of the credit system. Travel demand is modeled using a logit mixture model and supply consists of static congestion. Extensive experiments under stochastic demand show that when the tolls (in dollars and tokens) are not day-to-day adaptive, tolling in tokens outperforms tolling in dollars when congestion effects are more severe (e.g., realistic BPR models and steep congestion functions, high demand levels and high day-to-day variability). Importantly, we find that this result is robust with respect to selling behavior in the market, although there can be welfare losses in the quantity control system when selling behavior in the market is excessively irrational. These findings underscore the importance of examining disaggregate market behavior when designing tradable credit schemes. Moreover, when the supply of tokens can be adapted from day to day, the credit system was found to be superior in all tested scenarios, provided the selling behavior of individuals is rational. Finally, even in the case when toll revenues in the price instrument are equally redistributed (often difficult in practice), tolling in tokens (when tokens are equally distributed) is marginally more equitable in scenarios where congestion effects are more severe. These findings make a case for tolling in tokens.",0968-090X,Not found
Forecasting the crowd: An effective and efficient neural network for citywide crowd information prediction at a fine spatio-temporal scale,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103854,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Modelling and forecasting citywide crowd information (e.g., crowd volume of a region, the inflow of crowds into a region, outflow of crowds from a region) at a fine spatio-temporal scale is crucial for urban and transport planning, city management, public safety, and traffic management. However, this is a challenging task due to its complex spatial and temporal dependences. This paper proposes an effective and efficient model to reduce the training time cost while maintaining predictive accuracy in forecasting citywide crowd information at a fine spatio-temporal scale. Our model integrates Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), convolutional neural network (CNN), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to jointly capture the spatial and temporal dependences between two regions in a city. The evaluation with two different datasets in two different cities shows that compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, our model has better predictive accuracy (reducing the mean absolute errors MAEs by 20.99% on average) and a lower training time cost (reducing the time cost to only 26.16% on average of that of the baselines). Our model also has better abilities in making accurate predictions with low time cost under the influences of large-scale special events (when massive crowds of people are gathering in a short time) and for regions with high and irregular crowd changes.

Understanding charging dynamics of fully-electrified taxi services using large-scale trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103822,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"An accurate understanding of “when, where, and why” of charging activities is crucial for the optimal planning and operation of E-shared mobility services. In this study, we leverage a unique trajectory of a city-wide fully electrified taxi fleet in Shenzhen, China, and we present one of the first studies to investigate the charging behavioral dynamics of a fully electrified shared mobility system from both system-level and individual driver perspectives. The electric taxi (ET) trajectory data contain detailed travel information of over 20,000 ETs over one month period. By combing the trajectory and charging infrastructure data, we reveal remarkable regularities in infrastructure utilization, temporal and spatial charging dynamics as well as individual driver-level charging preferences. Specifically, we report that both temporal and spatial distributions of system-level charging activities present strong within-day and daily regularities, and most charging activities are induced by drivers’ shift schedules. Further, with 425 charging stations, we observe that the drivers show strong preferences over a small subset of charging stations, and the power-law distribution can well characterize the charging frequency at each charging station. Finally, we show that drivers’ shift schedules also dominate the individual charging behavior, and there are strikingly stable charging patterns at the individual level.

Traffic management and resource allocation for UAV-based parcel delivery in low-altitude urban space,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103808,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This research proposes a framework of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) system traffic management in the context of parcel delivery in low-altitude urban airspace, including clustering-based UAV path planning, Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) with conflict detection and resolution (CD&R), and mechanism design for airspace resource allocation. For UAV path planning, we develop a procedure by first clustering a large variety of obstacles that arise from building heights and terrain topology and can impede UAV flying. Based on the clustered obstacles, Saturated Fast-Marching Square (Saturated FM2) algorithm is then employed to generate optimal and alternative paths for each UAV mission. While identifying the optimal and alternative paths does not consider UAV traffic interactions, several traffic management models are proposed to efficiently allocate spatial and temporal airspace resources to UAV missions. The UTM models determine the departure time and the path to take for each UAV flight while resolving path conflicts from different perspectives. Specifically, four UTM models are proposed: Sequential Delay (SD) Model, Sequential Delay/Reroute (SDR) Model, Full Optimization (FO) Model, and Batch Optimization (BO) Model. Among the four models, the BO model is of particular interest as it strikes a balance between seeking a system optimum solution and maintaining computational tractability. Given that traffic management requires private information from UAV operators, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is further adapted to the UTM context, in which airspace resource allocation is performed in conjunction with a payment scheme to incentivize truthful private information reporting by UAV operators. Extensive numerical analysis is conducted with San Francisco as the case study area. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, particularly the scalability of the BO model. We also find that payment by a UAV flight under the adapted VCG mechanism depends critically on traffic density and the extent of interaction the UAV flight has with other flights.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal scheduling and quantitative analysis for multi-flying warehouse scheduling problem: Amazon airborne fulfillment center,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103831,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The outstanding advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have led to an intensive study of the UAV system over the past decade. A variety of potential UAV applications are emerging nowadays, and UAV delivery is one in the limelight. However, one of the critical issues for UAV delivery service is how UAVs can be persistently used within their fundamental limited battery capacity. One recent approach to alleviate the weaknesses is using a cooperative system of UAVs with movable stations for the delivery logistics. The movable stations move across the field of operation, providing persistent delivery service using UAVs by efficiently replenishing the consumables of UAVs. In this study, one of the compelling cooperative delivery services called the flying warehouse system is investigated. The concept of the flying warehouse delivery service has firstly filed as a patent by the e-commerce giant Amazon. The service utilizes airborne fulfillment centers (AFCs), an airship that floats at an altitude of around 45,000. The airship has stocked with inventory, and when a customer places an order, UAVs fly down and deliver the package. The AFC is a novel delivery system that allows delivery in under 10 min and expands Amazon Prime members' access to UAV shipping. On the other hand, AFC is a challenging system that must extract the simultaneous operating schedule of the different system elements. For this purpose, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed. The proposed MILP enables the derivation of service schedules of multiple AFCs and their components. The validity of the MILP is tested through case studies and quantitatively investigated system managerial issues.

Optimal policy for integrating Autonomous Vehicles into the auto market,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103821,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"With the advent of emerging technologies, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to become increasingly available to travelers. It is highly anticipated that there will be a transitional period when legacy vehicles (LVs) are gradually replaced by AVs before AVs take up a full penetration in the auto market. As a result, LVs and AVs will inevitably coexist during this period experiencing an interactive temporal evolution in terms of their market shares. Inspired by the classic Lotka–Volterra equations, we develop a continuous-time dynamical model capable of capturing such temporal evolution. A discrete choice model is constructed and incorporated into the dynamical model for describing the likelihood of choosing LVs or AVs. To achieve the desired temporal integration of AVs, monetary subsidies and investment in AV-specific transportation infrastructure are considered as decision variables to promote the adoption of AVs. Further, an optimal control problem is formulated with the objective of achieving a desired market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs at the end of the planning horizon, while minimizing the cost associated with AV subsidies and infrastructure investment. We prove the existence of an optimal AV integration policy. Moreover, we derive necessary conditions of optimality characterizing the mathematical properties of the optimal integration policy. Based on the optimality conditions derived, an iterative computational algorithm is developed to determine the time-dependent integration policy, which allows the government agency to appropriately subsidize AV purchases and invest in AV-specific infrastructure in an adaptive manner. Extensive numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach under two distinct demand patterns. In addition, a systematic cost–benefit analysis is conducted, along with appropriate sensitivity analysis, to evaluate the desirability of the integration of AVs. Since the dynamical model is general and the decision variables are easy to implement, the procedures presented in this article will provide significant managerial insights for government agencies into developing long-term strategic planning policies.",0968-090X,Not found
Maximizing network utility while considering proportional fairness for rail transit systems: Jointly optimizing passenger allocation and vehicle schedules,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103812,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"To deal with the contradiction between oversaturated demand and the restricted transport infrastructure and capacity during peak periods in a rail transit system, several passenger flow control methods that include soft pricing incentive, rigorous physical barrier and so on are widely used in current scenarios. However, the traffic disorderliness at the bottleneck and the control unfairness for the flows on specific stations may occur with those methods in the rail transit corridor. To alleviate those problems, this paper focus on the passenger allocation and matching with the corresponding schedules by considering the fairness of passengers and cost of operation from a macro perspective, where the passenger trip plan can be collected via a reservation platform in advance. A passenger utility maximization model that programs passenger allocation is proposed firstly, and we theoretically prove that there is an optimal traffic flow allocation with maximum utility under the oversaturated flow condition for any network. The model is solved by the Newton iteration algorithm and further proven to effectively make a tradeoff between efficiency and fairness. Furthermore, the transportation network utility maximization model is constructed by jointly optimizing the passenger allocation and vehicle schedules, thereby saving the cost of vehicle operation while guaranteeing the fairness of passenger allocation macroscopically. The model is solved by Multi-tree depth-first search algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation with a subgradient in an iterative manner. A real-world case from the Batong subway line in Beijing is studied to validate the proposed models and algorithms. The results show that the model can jointly optimize the passenger allocation and vehicle schedules effectively in both an economical and fair manner, and the passengers can pass through the bottleneck in an orderly way.",0968-090X,Not found

To cope with this complex problem, we first construct a two-layer time–space network in which each layer can only be used by trains traveling in the same direction. We then formulate the considered problem as a minimum-cost multi-commodity network flow model with incompatible arc sets and operational constraints. To solve the network flow problem, we present a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic.

Memory-augmented dynamic graph convolution networks for traffic data imputation with diverse missing patterns,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103826,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Missing data is an inevitable and ubiquitous problem for traffic data collection in intelligent transportation systems. Recent research has employed graph neural networks (GNNs) for spatiotemporal data imputation and achieved promising performance. However, there still exist two limitations to be addressed: first, existing approaches are generally limited in directly leveraging global spatiotemporal information from different nodes at different time; second, most of these approaches do not consider the unique characteristics of transportation systems or traffic data, including dynamic spatial dependencies and correlated missing patterns. To fill these research gaps, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Memory-augmented Dynamic Graph Convolution Networks (MDGCN) to impute missing traffic data. The model uses a recurrent layer to capture temporal information and a graph convolution layer to capture spatial information. To address the first research gap, we introduce an external memory network to store and share the global spatiotemporal information across the traffic network. For the second research gap, a graph structure estimation technique is proposed to learn dynamic spatial dependencies directly from traffic data. In addition, four types of missing patterns with various missing ratios are considered in model evaluation. Extensive experiments based on two public traffic speed datasets are conducted. The results show that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in all kinds of missing scenarios, and both the proposed external memory network and graph structure estimation technique contribute to the model performance.

This paper considers the problems of aircraft feature representation and selection for environmental impact analysis. First, aircraft features from different sources are integrated and filtered to obtain a comprehensive, yet essential feature set for representing an aircraft type. Then, a large-scale computer simulation is performed on over 200 unique aircraft types to obtain their environmental impacts during departure and arrival. Multiple supervised statistical learning approaches are utilized for the selection of critical aircraft features. In particular, single- and multi-target feature selections are performed on different levels of environmental impacts. The main results of this study include optimal subsets of features along with their relative importance scores for multiple levels of environmental impacts.

However, how to correctly allocate DBLs across a large-scale real-world network is challenging. Simulation-Based Optimization (SBO) methods were utilized in this work to resolve this optimal allocation problem. Traditional discrete SBO methods are intractable when handling high-dimensional, costly, simulation-based Transportation Network Design Problems (TNDPs) using a limited computational budget. Thus, several efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based surrogate models and a Jackknife uncertainty estimator were introduced to existing SBO framework in this work. A number of comparative experiments between proposed methods and frequently-used Gaussian Process (GP)-SBO methods were conducted. A mesoscopic simulation and Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) tool was adopted to evaluate the network performance. The results of numerical studies show that the optimization efficiency of proposed method is significantly higher than that of commonly used GP-based method when dealing with high dimensional problems.

Does bus bunching happen inevitably: The counteraction between link and stop headway deviations?,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103828,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Bus headway deviations are the major causes of bus bunching, which is detrimental to bus service reliability and leads to excessive waiting time for passengers. Generally, it is believed that bus bunching is an inevitable result once a service disturbance occurs, as long as the route is long enough. However, in this study, it goes as low as 5% of all trips from the empirical data, contradicting the expectation in theory. This study explores the underlying reasons for this contradiction based on empirical data from two representative bus routes in China. The results show that headway deviations on links and at stops mostly counteract with each other, constraining the occurrence of bus bunching. Under this counteraction effect, the path headway deviations remain within a stable range, normally bounded by the planned headway. It indicates that the bus system has a self-repair ability to resist headway disruptions, which explains why bus bunching happens at a considerably lower frequency in practice than in theory. We further discuss how the counteraction effect works. The insights gained from this study can shed light on preventing bus bunching and generating new ways to recover bus service regularity after a headway disruption. If we can adequately adjust the control methods to make the link and stop headway deviations counteract with each other, the bus system can automatically mitigate the headway deviations.",0968-090X,Not found

However, interactions among connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and manually driving vehicles (MVs) are varied and interrelated.

This paper proposes a situation-aware Reasoning Graph (RG) framework that consists of the Reasoning Process and the Solution Process. Complex interactions are first described by a graph, where the mapping from situations to the graph is constructed. Then the Reasoning Process divides future motion space into numerous situations and reasons potential situations using the graph search-based algorithm. Some rules for maneuver compatibility and social interaction customs are integrated into the graph search to ensure the maneuver compatibility and social compliance of these reasoned situations. The Solution Process develops a heuristic algorithm to quickly search for speed profiles that follow the reasoned situations. After comparative tests of the reservation-based and the optimization-based methods, the results show that the RG-based method helped decrease the average systemic cost by approximately 10%. However, it did not cause losses in individual performances.

Optimization of service frequency and vehicle size for automated bus systems with crowding externalities and travel time stochasticity,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103793,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Public transport is considered as one of the most suitable candidates to benefit from autonomous driving technologies. In this research, we develop a mathematical modeling framework to optimize service frequency and vehicle size for automated bus systems, while accounting for both user and operator costs. We explicitly consider travel time stochasticity, time-dependent passenger flows, vehicle capacity limitations (extra waiting time due to denied boarding), and in-vehicle discomfort externalities for both sitting and standing passengers at a microscopic level. We attempt to provide a thorough assessment of the service and cost implications of the deployment of automated buses. Hence, a broad range of experiments are simulated by combining different deployment cases: (i) vehicle technology (human-driven or automated vehicles), (ii) travel time assumptions (deterministic or stochastic travel times), and (iii) crowding externalities (considering or ignoring in-vehicle crowding costs). The model applicability is assessed on two real-world bus corridors in Regensburg (Germany) and Santiago (Chile). Results show that, with crowding externalities, optimal vehicle size is increased at a similar rate for both human-driven and automated bus services, whereas optimal service frequency is increased at a higher rate for automated buses. Thus, under optimal levels of supply, automated vehicles are operated with lower occupancy levels than human-driven vehicles, increasing the quality of service. Besides, the deployment of automated bus systems can significantly alleviate or eliminate denied boardings. The effects of automation on travel time volatility and dwell time regularity are studied. The consideration of stochastic travel times increases optimal frequencies at a higher rate for automated services relative to human-driven vehicles. Interestingly, we find that even though the operator benefits from automation are more pronounced in high-income countries (due to a greater potential for human driving cost savings), the final outcome is counterbalanced by the actual public transport demand level, because large user cost savings from automation are reachable in crowded routes even in situations in which labor costs are lower (as in developing countries).",0968-090X,Not found

Since AVT is the same for each user, it is inherently fair to every-one. Thus, not only do users gain by subscribing to this system but the overall system also, as SO flows are followed each day. We then model the case of mixed equilibrium (ME), wherein drivers are given the option to subscribe to the TMC path combinations and hence assist in achieving SO, while non-subscribers only minimize their own private costs and follow their user equilibrium (UE) paths, which typically have shorter times than the corresponding AVT. To counter this, a tolling scheme is imposed on non-subscribers, i.e., UE users, based on their value-of-time (VOT) distribution and the travel time difference between subscribers' AVT and non-subscribers' UE time at ME. In the end, the total cost of travel of non-subscribers, toll plus UE time, is equal to the corresponding AVT of subscribers. The efficiency of this system is shown through numerical studies. Finally, the impact of market penetration and different VOT distributions on AVT and toll are investigated through sensitivity analysis.",0968-090X,Not found
Truck routing and platooning optimization considering drivers’ mandatory breaks,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103809,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Truck platooning has been touted as one of the most promising technologies to improve fuel efficiency thanks to the reduced air drag of the digitally connected truck’s slipstream in a trainlike convoy. The benefits of truck platooning lie in the reduced fuel consumption and labor cost, and the enhanced driving experience. However, these benefits cannot be realized without an appropriate routing, scheduling, and platooning plan of trucks subject to practical constraints, especially the drivers’ break requirement for long-haul journeys. This study addresses the truck routing and platooning problem considering drivers’ mandatory breaks as well as other characteristics such as the state-and-position-dependent fuel-saving rates of platooning, trucks’ designated intermediate relays, and platoon size limit. The problem is to route the trucks to their respective destinations on time using the least amount of fuel by maximizing the formations of fuel-saving platoons over entire trips while satisfying the break time requirement of drivers. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is first developed for the proposed problem. A hybrid algorithm integrating the partial-MILP approach and iterated neighborhood search with tailored search operators is proposed to address the problem. Various randomly generated networks are used in numerical experiments to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model and solution method. An extensive sensitivity analysis is also conducted to explore the impacts of several major influential factors, i.e., the drivers’ mandatory break times, the fuel reduction rate of the leading truck of platoons, as well as the width of the service time window, on the system performance and derive the managerial insights.",0968-090X,Not found
A new approach to improve destination choice by ranking personal preferences,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103817,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"It is vital to have the right choice-sets when dealing with many alternatives in discrete choice models, which play a critical role in transport modelling. Various approaches have been proposed to address the issue when forming individual choice-sets. While these methods have been continuously improved, they seem not effectively explain how individuals form their choice-sets when facing a large number of alternatives. To know individual choice-sets, one possible way is to ask all of them about their preferred alternatives directly. However, this is costly and impractical for a large population. This paper proposes a novel behavioural choice-set generation approach by ranking personal preferences of destinations using a matrix factorisation model with Bayesian personalised ranking. From a large travel survey, we form a user-zone-visited frequency matrix for shopping locations. We then use the model to factorise the user-zone-visited frequency matrix into two lower-rank latent matrices. The matrix factorisation model is optimised by using Bayesian personalised ranking. After estimation, the model’s outputs, which are user-factor and zone-factor latent matrices, can produce top preferred destinations for individuals. Our experiment from a large travel survey with thousands of alternatives shows that the proposed choice-set generation framework can significantly improve the predictive capability of discrete choice model evaluation with even small choice-set sizes.",0968-090X,Not found
A novel Max Pressure algorithm based on traffic delay,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103803,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This paper considers a novel travel-delay-based Max Pressure algorithm for control of arbitrary transportation networks with signalized intersections. The traditional number-of-vehicle-based Max Pressure (Original-MP) algorithm has received tremendous attention recently due to its ease of implementation and scalability to large network scenarios. The Original-MP algorithm also has a desirable property called maximum stability, which means a demand scenario can be accommodated by this method as long as it can be accommodated by any existing control policy. However, implementation of the Original-MP Max Pressure algorithm may be difficult in practice as estimation of the number of vehicles at intersections requires significant measurement infrastructure. The Original-MP framework also uses a point queue model to represent the vehicle transition between links, which does not consider the position of the vehicles, even though this may significantly impact the control performance. The proposed travel-delay based Max Pressure model overcomes these drawbacks while inheriting the maximum stability feature of the Original-MP. It also is shown to outperform several benchmark Max Pressure variants in a battery of simulation tests. Lastly, the proposed algorithm can be implemented in a Connected Vehicle (CV) environment, in which a subset of vehicles serve as mobile probes. The results show the proposed travel-delay-based model generates lower delay with non-full penetration rate than the benchmark models with full penetration rate under certain traffic conditions.",0968-090X,Not found
Weather impact quantification on airport arrival on-time performance through a Bayesian statistics modeling approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103811,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Compared with departures, predicting the weather impact on arrival delays is more challenging because of possible non-linear, cascading effects, and higher uncertainty. Existing weather impact studies are location-dependent and often neglect the impacts of dangerous phenomena. We propose a data-driven model for severe weather impact quantification on airport arrival on-time performance based on the Bayesian approach to address these issues. Our model considers the impact of the dangerous phenomenon by evaluating the mean shift and is flexible enough to be applied to different airports. Using two years’ worth of data (2017-2018) from the Hong Kong International Airport, we studied over 55,000 local meteorological reports and analyzed over 430,000 arrival flights. Across all three key performance metrics considered, a non-linear relationship with the weather score, akin to a phase transition, could be observed. This framework allows a comparison between the sensitivity of each airport’s arrival performance metric towards severe weather. Delay rate is the most sensitive metric, while cancellation rate is the least. For the impacts of dangerous phenomena, cumulonimbus has the most significant impact on the delay rate. Shower rainfall/cumulonimbus has a similar and vital impact on the mean arrival delay per hour. Because of its potential applications in different airports, this framework can provide a deeper insight into weather impact on air traffic networks.",0968-090X,Not found
Real-time train motion parameter estimation using an Unscented Kalman Filter,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103794,143,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Train movement dynamics are usually modelled by means of Newton’s second law. The resulting dynamic equation can be very precise if the parameters that it depends on are determined accurately. However, these parameters may vary in time and show wide variations, making the calibration task nontrivial and jeopardizing the performance of a broad variety of applications in the railway industry: from timetable planning and railway traffic simulation to Driver Advisory Systems and Automatic Train Operation. In this article, the online train motion model calibration problem is addressed with a special focus on energy-efficient on-board applications. To this end, location and speed measurements are assumed to be available for a train running under normal operation conditions. A well-known real-time parameter estimation algorithm, the Unscented Kalman Filter, is combined with a driving regime calculator and a post-processing module in order to obtain bounds and statistics of parameters such as the maximum applied tractive effort and power, the applied brake rates, the cruise speed and the length of the final coasting and braking. The proposed framework is tested in a case study with real data from trains operating on the Eindhoven-’s-Hertogenbosch corridor in the Netherlands. Results obtained show that UKF is able to track the speed and location measurements and to estimate the parameters that model the running resistance in the dynamic equation.

Assessing the impacts of last mile delivery strategies on delivery vehicles and traffic network performance,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103915,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Urban freight is growing fast, and its adverse effects bring consequences for the residents, the environment, and the liveability of cities. Although understanding its dynamics has become a priority for governments, the multiplicity of actors with conflicting objectives makes it a significant urban planning challenge. This study focuses on one type of on-street parking infrastructure for urban freight: loading zones. Although they are considered one of the most important parking strategies to control freight traffic, increasing pressure for more pedestrian space, public transport, sustainable mobility and the surge in urban deliveries have reduced their size, quantity and availability. These factors have increased the externalities generated by delivery vehicles (congestion, accidents, noise, pollution and visual intrusion), reduced the liveability of urban areas and increased the difficulty for cities to improve urban traffic. To address this problem, we developed a simulation-optimisation framework to evaluate urban logistics strategies that balance the courier’s (walking and cruising time) and the city’s (traffic flow variability) objectives. The methodology considers the decision-making processes of the road users, their interaction, and the variability of stochastic parameters (traffic conditions, competition, cruising, and illegal parking). To optimise the routes of delivery vehicles, we developed an evolutionary algorithm that minimises the trucking and walking distances and used commercial software to re-optimise mid-route decisions. The model is applied to a representation of the Melbourne central business district (CBD), a common network structure among many cities, simulating realistic conditions. Results show that is possible to devise win-win solutions that favour all parties in the transport network.",0968-090X,Not found
A new reinforcement learning-based variable speed limit control approach to improve traffic efficiency against freeway jam waves,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103900,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) models of variable speed limit (VSL) control systems (and traffic control systems in general) cannot be trained in real traffic process because new control actions are usually explored randomly, which may result in high costs (delays) due to exploration and learning. For this reason, existing RL-based VSL control approaches need a traffic simulator for training. However, the performance of those approaches are dependent on the accuracy of the simulators. This paper proposes a new RL-based VSL control approach to overcome the aforementioned problems. The proposed VSL control approach is designed to improve traffic efficiency by using VSLs against freeway jam waves. It applies an iterative training framework, where the optimal control policy is updated by exploring new control actions both online and offline in each iteration. The explored control actions are evaluated in real traffic process, thus it avoids that the RL model learns only from a traffic simulator. The proposed VSL control approach is tested using a macroscopic traffic simulation model to represent real world traffic flow dynamics. By comparing with existing VSL control approaches, the proposed approach is demonstrated to have advantages in the following two aspects: (i) it alleviates the impact of model mismatch, which occurs in both model-based VSL control approaches and existing RL-based VSL control approaches, via replacing knowledge from the models by knowledge from the real process, and (ii) it significantly reduces the exploration and learning costs compared to existing RL-based VSL control approaches.",0968-090X,Not found

When constructing empty repositioning plans, the cost of repositioning empty resources needs to be weighed against the cost of corrective actions in case of unavailable resources. This is especially challenging given the uncertainty of future demand. We design and implement a robust rolling horizon framework for constructing effective empty repositioning plans. An extensive computational study demonstrates the benefits of explicitly accounting for uncertainty in future demand by using robust optimization, and pragmatically controlling the level of conservatism in hedging against this uncertainty.

System Identification for the design of behavioral controllers in crowd evacuations,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103913,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Behavioral modification using active instructions is a promising interventional method to optimize crowd evacuations. However, existing research efforts have been more focused on eliciting general principles of optimal behavior than providing explicit mechanisms to dynamically induce the desired behaviors, which could be claimed as a significant knowledge gap in crowd evacuation optimization. In particular, we propose using dynamic distance-keeping instructions to regulate pedestrian flows and improve safety and evacuation time. We investigate the viability of using Model Predictive Control (MPC) techniques to develop a behavioral controller that obtains the optimal distance-keeping instructions to modulate the pedestrian density at bottlenecks. System Identification is proposed as a general methodology to model crowd dynamics and build prediction models. Thus, for a testbed evacuation scenario and input–output data generated from designed microscopic simulations, we estimate a linear AutoRegressive eXogenous model (ARX), which is used as the prediction model in the MPC controller. A microscopic simulation framework is used to validate the proposal that embeds the designed MPC controller, tuned and refined in closed-loop using the ARX model as the Plant model. As a significant contribution, the proposed combination of MPC control and System Identification to model crowd dynamics appears ideally suited to develop realistic and practical control systems for controlling crowd motion. The flexibility of MPC control technology to impose constraints on control variables and include different disturbance models in the prediction model has confirmed its suitability in the design of behavioral controllers in crowd evacuations. We found that an adequate selection of output disturbance models in the predictor is critical in the type of responses given by the controller. Interestingly, it is expected that this proposal can be extended to different evacuation scenarios, control variables, control systems, and multiple-input multiple-output control structures.",0968-090X,Not found

Fine-grained crowd distribution forecasting with multi-order spatial interactions using mobile phone data,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103908,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Fine-grained crowd distribution forecasting benefits smart transportation operations and management, such as public transport dispatch, traffic demand prediction, and transport emergency response. Considering the co-evolutionary patterns of crowd distribution, the interactions among places are essential for modelling crowd distribution variations. However, two issues remain. First, the lack of sampling design in passive big data acquisition makes the spatial interaction characterizations of less crowded places insufficient. Second, the multi-order spatial interactions among places can help forecasting crowd distribution but are rarely considered in the existing literature. To address these issues, a novel crowd distribution forecasting method with multi-order spatial interactions was proposed. In particular, a weighted random walk algorithm was applied to generate simulated trajectories for improving the interaction characterizations derived from sparse mobile phone data. The multi-order spatial interactions among contextual non-adjacent places were modelled with an embedding learning technique. The future crowd distribution was forecasted via a graph-based deep neural network. The proposed method was verified using a real-world mobile phone dataset, and the results showed that both the multi-order spatial interactions and the trajectory data enhancement algorithm helped improve the crowd distribution forecasting performance.

Predicting public transit arrival: A nonlinear approach,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103875,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Arrival/Travel times for public transit exhibit variability on account of factors like seasonality, dwell times at bus stops, traffic signals, travel demand fluctuation etc. The developing world in particular is plagued by additional factors like excess vehicles, poor lane discipline, diverse modes of transport and so on. This renders the bus arrival time prediction (BATP) to be a challenging problem especially in the developing world. A data-driven approach for BATP in real-time is proposed in the current work. We explicitly learn both spatial and temporal correlations in a general (non-linear) fashion, unlike most existing approaches. The real-time BATP is next intelligently reposed as a hidden-state estimation (or inference) problem on a related non-linear dynamical system (NLDS) model. We propose an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF) based solution to the above inference problem. We demonstrate utility of this general framework of learning and prediction using (i)support vector regression and (ii)feed-forward ANN to learn spatial and temporal correlations. The EKF based inference under support-vector and feed-forward approximations to the system maps of the associated NLDS model reveals interesting computational structure, which goes beyond the BATP application. Specifically, the Jacobian computation at each step of the EKF can be carried out exactly and efficiently using either (i)forward recursion (ii)backward recursion (back-propagation) under feed-forward approximations. Under support-vector approximation, this Jacobian evaluation is possible in closed form. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated on real field data collected from challenging traffic conditions.

Multivariate analysis of car-following behavior data using a coupled hidden Markov model,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103914,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Accurate analysis of driving behavior data is important for improving traffic operations and for automakers to design safe and effective Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Although different approaches have been proposed to analyze driving behavior data and understand the car-following behavior, very few of them have considered the interaction effects among driving behavior variables and constructed a multivariate modeling framework to fully understand and extract the underlying primitive driving patterns. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM) and evaluates its applicability in obtaining the car-following behavioral semantics and comparing the similarity of different drivers’ driving styles. The Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) dataset, which contains two years of naturalistic driving data, is used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed coupled modeling approach. The modeling results suggest that CHMM with 3 hidden states provides the most appropriate driving behavior pattern segmentation results. It generates reasonable durations for each behavioral semantic by accounting for the dependence relationship among variables in the analysis. Moreover, a similarity analysis is conducted considering three aspects of a driving behavior pattern: driving behavior pattern transfer, driving behavior pattern selection, and aggressiveness behavior. The result reveals that these three aspects do not necessarily show consistent trends for the same driving behavior. Overall, the findings from this paper provide a novel framework for better understanding and interpreting the driving behavior and primitive driving patterns, and confirm the importance of considering the dependence among different driving behavior variables.",0968-090X,Not found

However, especially in urban environments, not all streets may be feasible for automated driving which restricts the operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to certain zones. Outside of these zones, AVs may be safely navigated by a leading vehicle that is operated by a human driver using the concept of platooning. In this paper, we consider the service network design problem of a service provider that offers platooning services to AV operators in an urban environment in exchange for monetary compensation. Tactical planning decisions comprise determining the fleet size and scheduling platooning services for a planning horizon such as a season. Those decisions are supported by the quoting of rates to potential customers that reflect their willingness to pay depending on the received service level. A second stage of decisions, made on each day of the planning horizon, comprises the acceptance or rejection of individual platooning requests and the routing of AVs through the platooning services. Since the platooning demand is assumed to be stochastic, we model the problem as a two-stage stochastic integer program. On a real-world based network, we perform computational experiments that indicate potential profits for a platooning service provider and considerable savings for AV operators with different demand characteristics.

Decarbonizing regional multi-model transportation system with shared electric charging hubs,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103881,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"In light of the growing concerns of global climate change, the pace of transportation electrification has greatly accelerated in recent years as an effort towards net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, it remains unclear how to effectively deploy and operate public charging infrastructure to best serve an electrified transportation system within a multi-modal context while maximizing the benefits of decarbonization. This is especially true when considering the GHG emitted by generating one kWh of electricity, i.e. the electricity carbon intensity, varies across a day due the change of generation mix between renewable and fossil fueled resources. To address this question, we propose a mechanism of shared charging hubs that can provide holistic energy management for both electric buses (EBs) and passenger electric vehicles (EVs). The deployment and operation of shared charging hubs is determined by a new spatio-temporal optimization model which aims to minimize GHG emission given a budget limit while avoiding the occurrence of massive spikes in peak power demand. This is achieved by coherently accommodating the charging demand of EBs and EVs, and explicitly integrating the time-varying electricity carbon intensity and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the model is applied to the bus fleets operated by seven transit agencies and the park-and-ride facilities (for EVs) near twelve rail transit stations in Contra Costa County, California, USA. The results show that the shared charging hubs can lead to significant GHG emission reduction while mitigating the peak electricity demand.

However, with the emerging of new technologies, one conventional assumption, on which many models rely, that all the day-to-day observations on the network follow a single pattern appears to be questionable. To better understand network flow patterns and their respective similarities, cluster analysis that partitions the day-to-day data into groups is an effective solution, but directly applying generic clustering algorithms may not always be appropriate identifying and interpreting day-to-day pattern changes due to the ignorance of the transportation network characteristics. In view of this practical issue, we propose a new clustering method that integrates network flow models, namely a statistical traffic assignment model and a probabilistic OD travel demand estimation model, into generic clustering algorithms. It essentially examines the probabilistic characteristics of traffic data by projecting those onto the dimensions of OD demands. For this reason, it can deal with traffic data where observations on some days and locations may be missing, or observing locations may change from day to day.

Some reported studies mainly focused on the economical driving performance in cruising, following, or ramping scenarios, where longitudinal control is primarily considered. The impact of lateral decisions on economical performance is rarely discussed, especially in traffic flows. In the multi-lane scenario, the upper decision-making module could output reasonable behavior selections to avoid the limitation of single longitudinal control and further enhance the energy-saving potential in traffic flows, such as the appropriate lane-keeping or lane-changing proposal. Furthermore, designing comprehensive rules to coordinate diverse driving goals with separated decision-making and control modules is challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated decision and control framework for economical driving in the multi-lane scenario, based on the actor–critic reinforcement learning method. The proposed integrated framework contains two function layers: a static-evaluating layer and a dynamic-tracking layer. The former, i.e., the critic network, considers static information, evaluates potentially feasible lanes, and selects an advantage lane as the lane-changing proposal. The latter, i.e., the actor network, obtains dynamic traffic information and solves a constrained control problem. Finally, the solution aims to achieve obstacle avoidance and economical and stable tracking to the proposed advantage lane as far as possible. Furthermore, a model-accelerated soft actor–critic (MSAC) algorithm is developed to simultaneously solve the integrated decision and control problem.

This paper aims to investigate the potential of introducing intermodal mobility options to balance ride-hailing services. We first identify the importance of the availability decision on intermodal mobility options. Then we formulate the availability decision problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Due to its convoluted system dynamics and large state space, we cast the intractable MDP into a reinforcement learning (RL) problem to approximately learn the availability policy. To stabilize the learning processes, we model the intermodal ride-hailing services as a stochastic queueing network and tailor a family of state-of-the-art RL algorithms to iteratively evaluate and improve the availability policy. Lastly, we test this optimization framework in a large-scale intermodal mobility scenario calibrated with real-world trip data.

Recent advancements in data collection techniques have gained attention towards a data-driven choice set identification process. However, empirical vehicle trajectory datasets result in several path observations compared to the traditional algorithms, complicating the route choice modelling process. This study proposes a bi-level vehicle trajectory clustering framework where the output of the upper-level clustering provides a representative path choice set for simple/mixed logit modelling (MNL), whereas the lower-level clustering provides a nested or cross-nested representation of the paths based on hard and soft clustering, respectively. As proof of concept, the proposed methodology is applied on real Bluetooth-based trajectories from Brisbane, where 62 unique paths were observed from a one-year trajectory data for an origin–destination pair. The results of the MNL model for the representative paths provide desirable magnitude with negative coefficients for the distance and travel time path attributes. Further, the results of the (cross) nested modelling appropriately identified the (cross) nested structure for the path choice set.",0968-090X,Not found
Detecting metro service disruptions via large-scale vehicle location data,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103880,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Urban metro systems are often affected by disruptions such as infrastructure malfunctions, rolling stock breakdowns and accidents. The crucial prerequisite of any disruption analytics is to have accurate information about the location, occurrence time, duration and propagation of disruptions. To pursue this goal, we detect the abnormal deviations in trains’ headway relative to their regular services by using Gaussian mixture models. Our method is a unique contribution in the sense that it proposes a novel, probabilistic, unsupervised clustering framework and it can effectively detect any type of service interruptions, including minor delays of just a few minutes. In contrast to traditional manual inspections and other detection methods based on social media data or smart card data, which suffer from human errors, limited monitoring coverage, and potential bias, our approach uses information on train trajectories derived from automated vehicle location (train movement) data. As an important research output, this paper delivers innovative analyses of the propagation progress of disruptions along metro lines, which enables us to distinguish primary and secondary disruptions as well as effective recovery interventions performed by operators.",0968-090X,Not found
Truck–drone hybrid routing problem with time-dependent road travel time,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103901,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Combining trucks and drones in package delivery provides a promising venue for a future logistics system that is more efficient and sustainable than the existing one. However, how to coordinate trucks and drones, particularly under uncertain traffic conditions (thus, travel time), remains a critical question in this field. To address this challenge, this study proposes and solves a truck–drone hybrid routing problem with time-dependent road travel time (TDHRP-TDRTT) to address the truck–drone cooperation issue. TDHRP-TDRTT is formulated as a cost minimization problem with constraints associated with logistics demand and supply. An iterative local search heuristic algorithm based on intra-pair and inter-pair customer exchanges and link re-optimization is developed to solve TDHRP-TDRTT. Our results on small-scale and benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm has better computational performance than CPLEX solver, the adaptive large neighborhood search, hybrid genetic-sweep algorithm, and variable neighborhood search. A case study using traffic data from Chongqing, China shows that the truck–drone solution improves the timeliness of delivery, undertakes sensitivity analysis considering four road congestion states, significantly reduces trucking mileage, and facilitates overcoming terrain limitations.

Incentivizing shared rides in e-hailing markets: Dynamic discounting,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103879,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Ridesourcing service provided by transportation network companies (TNCs) has been shown by various studies to deteriorate traffic conditions as they increase the number of unoccupied vehicles on the road. Ridesharing is an alternate service where passengers with similar itineraries may be pooled together in a combined trip, which could counteract some of the negative externalities of ridesourcing. Passengers are generally compensated with a price discount for their inconveniences experienced in shared trips. We therefore propose a dynamic discount pricing strategy for the platform to incentivize ridesharing. This study explicitly considers the passengers to be cost and service quality sensitive, impatient, and have a choice to decline services offered by the platform. The strategy is integrated in the matching algorithm which maximizes the platform’s profit with given batches of waiting passengers and idle vehicles, and strategically offers shared trips to selected passengers with varying price discounts. We show that the adoption of the dynamic discount pricing strategy creates substantial economic benefit for the platform in both the short and long terms. The drivers are also shown to benefit from the strategy as they spend more time serving passengers. The strategy reduces the fleet size required to service the same number of passengers and is beneficial to all stakeholders.",0968-090X,Not found
Risk reduction for safety of the intended functionality of CACC with complex uncertainties: A cooperative robust non-fragile fault tolerant strategy,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103885,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is very challenging due to heterogeneous performance limitations and complex uncertainties in real road environments. In this paper, a cooperative robust non-fragile fault tolerant control (CRNFTC) strategy is presented to reduce the risks caused by multi-vehicle performance limitations of perception and actuation systems for ensuring SOTIF of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC). First, an intermediate based cooperative robust estimation method is proposed, by combining ego and cooperative information, system states, matched disturbances, performance limitations of perception and actuation of the vehicles in the platoon are simultaneously estimated. Existence conditions of estimators are given with respect to predecessor following (PF) and bi-directional (BD) communication network topologies. Then, based on the estimation, a distributed robust non-fragile fault tolerant H∞ control method is proposed, such that compensation of the effects of heterogeneous performance limitations and matched disturbances, and suppression of the remaining unmatched disturbances can be achieved. The sufficient condition and optimal solution of the proposed CRNFTC are obtained by using Lyapunov theory with explicit consideration of the system uncertainty and controller perturbation.

Predicting the likelihood of airspace user rerouting to mitigate air traffic flow management delay,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103869,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"At present, the most common air traffic flow management measure used by the European Network Manager to solve en-route demand and capacity balance issues is to impose air traffic flow management regulations in congested airspace, which delay flights on the ground to smooth demand. The delay imposed on a regulated flight, however, has a negative operational and economic impact on the corresponding airspace user. When the impact is severe, the airspace user may reroute the flight to tactically circumvent the regulated airspace, thereby avoiding the regulation and reducing (or even eliminating) the delay. This legitimate strategy is unquestionably effective in mitigating the delay and the associated cost, but it may also increases traffic demand uncertainty due to last-minute changes as well as the environmental impact due to sub-optimal trajectories. This paper presents a gradient-boosted decision trees model that, trained on historical data, could assist in predicting the likelihood of a regulated flight rerouting to mitigate air traffic flow management delay. Specific metrics for highly imbalanced binary classification problems reveal that, while not perfect, the model outperforms a rudimentary decision tree and a dummy classifier. Furthermore, Shapley values computed with the model uncover the most important triggers for tactical rerouting from a data-driven perspective, namely the current delay, the aircraft operator, the airspace sector where the most penalising regulation is applied and the remaining time until departure. This interpretable model could be used to assist flow managers in their decision-making, as well as to accurately mimic the behaviour of flight dispatchers when facing delays in simulators.",0968-090X,Not found
Time-of-day pricing for toll roads under traffic demand uncertainties: A distributionally robust simulation-based optimization method,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103894,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Road pricing has received increasing attention for traffic congestion mitigation, but traffic demand uncertainties cause a profound impact on its effectiveness. This study proposes a link-based time-of-day pricing distributionally robust simulation-based optimization (DRSO) model to minimize the worst-case expected total travel time (TTT). This model aims to answer where and how much to charge under origin–destination (OD) traffic demand uncertainties that are described by an ambiguity set of probability distributions, and is solved by a DRSO method with two stages. The first stage searches an infill sample after building two stochastic kriging models (i.e., SKG-I and SKG-II) to map the relation between the traffic demand uncertainty parameter and the average TTT for each decision sample, and that between the decision variable and the worst-case average TTT, respectively. The second stage introduces the optimal computational budget allocation (OCBA) method to distribute more simulation replications to more promising combination samples, which helps to improve the prediction accuracy of SKGs in promising regions. The DRSO method is first tested with an M/M/1 queuing problem, and numerical results show its outperformance compared with one counterpart algorithm. After that, it is applied to address the link-based time-of-day pricing DRSO problem on Anaheim network and two solution algorithms are also added for comparison. Numerical results show that the robust toll plan solved by the DRSO method outperforms no toll plan and two other toll plans solved by the comparison algorithms in handling traffic dynamics and different levels of traffic demand uncertainties.

Ride-pooling services with differentiated pooling sizes under endogenous congestion effect,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103883,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This paper analytically examines the ride-pooling market equilibrium under a single or multiple ride-pooling service(s) considering different pooling sizes (number of riders sharing the same vehicle) and endogenous congestion effect of the ride-pooling fleet, and investigates the optimal operation decisions of the service operator(s) regarding the pricing, fleet size, and pooling size in different administrative and market regimes. We firstly examine the scenario with a single ride-pooling service platform given a specific vehicle type for either profit-maximization or social welfare-maximization (different administrative regimes), and then extend the model to the scenario with two differentiated ride-pooling services (given different vehicle types), where the platforms may either compete or cooperate (different market regimes). We have the following major findings. First, the pooling size should be optimized to accommodate the congestion effect and thus simultaneously increase operator’s profit and social welfare. The optimal pooling size balances the marginal pickup time, crowding cost and waiting time cost, and the optimal value is different in different market regimes. Second, the ride-pooling service operator will internalize the congestion effect of providing more vehicles to serve customers, which yields a larger ratio of waiting customers to vacant vehicles (larger demand–supply ratio). Under two differentiated ride-pooling services, in addition to the direct congestion effect of providing more vehicles, its effect on the other operator’s decision will also be internalized by the service operator in concern. Our results also suggest that the competition between platforms tends to reduce the waiting customers-vacant vehicles ratio (demand–supply ratio), while the cooperation between or integration of two operators might yield a large ratio. Third, when the endogenous congestion effect of fleet size is zero, the operator’s profit at social optimum will always be negative when the matching function exhibits increasing return to scale and the marginal operation cost is less than the average operation cost, which means that the social welfare seeking operator has to be subsidized. When the endogenous congestion effect of the fleet size is positive, the ride-pooling service operator may earn a positive profit at social optimum under certain conditions. This study enhances the understanding in relation to users’ reactions to differentiated ride-pooling services, how such services interact with congestion, and how such services can be optimized in different market regimes.",0968-090X,Not found

This paper devises an eco-driving algorithm based on connected vehicle technologies, with basic kinematic wave and car-following models. The objectives of the proposed algorithm are to increase the throughput of signal intersections and decrease fuel consumption. Specifically, we focus on a signalized intersection under mixed traffic flows with connected and autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Through the proposed algorithm, the vehicle speeds at the intersection (i.e., the intersection control speed) and signal timings can be adjusted in response to the real-time traffic conditions. According to the signal timing and the speed at the intersection, the algorithm estimates the time points of each vehicle entering the intersection. An advisory speed limit approach is formulated for each AV, making the vehicle enter the intersection at the allocated timing with the control speed. An onboard alert is set for each HV to stop or pass through. The algorithm is evaluated under various market penetration rates of AVs, different congestion levels, and with signal actuation.

Integrated optimization model for hierarchical service network design and passenger assignment in an urban rail transit network: A Lagrangian duality reformulation and an iterative layered optimization framework based on forward-passing and backpropagation,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103877,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This study solves an integrated operational problem regarding hierarchical service network design and passenger assignment for urban rail transit systems.

Given a certain passenger demand matrix, this model simultaneously determines the system-optimal path flow while assigning passengers to lines to minimize the passenger total travel cost. The proposed nonlinear programming model is then reformulated based on Lagrangian duality as two resource allocation sub-problems represented as artificial neural networks. The forward pass of the train flow sequentially assigns train resources to candidate depots and lines, and the forward pass of the passenger flow sequentially assigns the passenger demand to candidate paths and links. The solution can be improved by backpropagation of the first-order gradients and re-assignment of the train resources and passenger demand with updated weights between different layers under the proposed layered optimization framework. A comparative analysis indicates that the proposed solution approach can obtain an approximate optimal solution for the integrated optimization model, thereby providing an optimized operational hierarchical service plan and system-optimal passenger assignment results.

Coordinated trajectory planning for lane-changing in the weaving areas of dedicated lanes for connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103864,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is widely recognized as a promising way to improve traffic safety, fuel efficiency and network throughput. However, at the early stage of CAV adoption, there will inevitably be a long period when both CAVs and regular vehicles coexist in the traffic system. To facilitate CAV functionalities in mixed traffic, providing dedicated rights of way for CAVs is necessary. In such scenarios, traffic control requires careful design in the weaving areas that allow CAVs to transfer between dedicated roads and ordinary roads for both safety and efficiency considerations. This paper proposes a dynamic programming approach for the coordinated trajectory planning of CAVs in mandatory lane-changing scenarios, in which CAVs have to switch from a dedicated CAV lane into parallel ordinary lanes with mixed traffic. For a group of CAVs that are poised to enter the ordinary road, the proposed method aims to provide each CAV with a suggested lane-changing gap and a reference trajectory in a coordinated manner. To solve the problem, we establish a dynamic programming formulation to determine the suggested gaps for all CAVs. We formulate a nonconvex quadratic-constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem to characterize the trajectory determination problem, and a relaxation-based approximate algorithm is developed to solve the QCQP.

Stochastic optimization models for location and inventory prepositioning of disaster relief supplies,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103871,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"We consider the problem of preparing for a disaster season by determining where to open warehouses and how much relief item inventory to preposition in each.

Airport surface movement prediction and safety assessment with spatial–temporal graph convolutional neural network,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103873,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Collisions during airport surface operations can create risk of injury to passengers, crew or airport personnel and damage to aircraft and ground equipment. A machine learning model that is able to predict the trajectories of ground objects can help to diminish the occurrences of such collision events. In this paper, we pursue this objective by building a spatial–temporal graph convolutional neural network (STG-CNN) model to predict the movement of objects/vehicles on the airport surface. The methodology adopted in this paper consists of three steps: (1) Raw data processing: leverage Apache Spark to parse a large volume of raw data in Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) format streamed from the Surface Movement Event Service (SMES) for the purpose of deriving historical trajectory associated with each object on the ground; (2.1) Graph-based representations of ground object movements: build graph-based representations to characterize the movements of ground objects over time, where graph edges are used capture the spatial relationships of ground objects with each other explicitly; (2.2) Trajectory forecasts of all ground objects: combine STG-CNN with Time-Extrapolator Convolution Neural Network (TXP-CNN) to forecast the future trajectories of all the ground objects as a whole; and (3) Separation distance-based safety assessment: define a probabilistic separation distance-based metric to assess the safety of airport surface movements.

Besides, an analytical and stochastic formulation of the lateral model which can generate CLMM and LCD distribution and adjust the parameters online is still lacking. To the best of our knowledge, currently, no method can provide an analytically stochastic lateral movement that explicitly considers the system noise and simultaneously outputs the information of lane changing initiation moment, cross-lane-mark moment, and lane changing duration in a real-time manner.

The results show that 1) computational efficiency-wise, the algorithm takes milliseconds to run, which suggests promising prospects for field deployment; 2) the false negative and false positive errors of the LCIM inference are as low as 1.5%, indicating that the method is robust to the stochastic noise; 3) LCIM inference is insensitive to the lane width, which means the model is error tolerant when such information is lacking; and 4) the error of CLMM inference is within 2 sec, while most of the error of LCD locates within 4 sec, suggesting satisfactory performance.",0968-090X,Not found
Joint routing of conventional and range-extended electric vehicles in a large metropolitan network,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103830,144,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Range-extended electric vehicles combine the higher efficiency and environmental benefits of battery-powered electric motors with the longer mileage and autonomy of conventional internal combustion engines. This combination is particularly advantageous for time-constrained delivery routing in dense urban areas, where battery recharging along routes can be too time-consuming to economically justify the use of all-electric vehicles. However, switching from electric to conventional fossil fuel modes also results in higher costs and emissions and lower efficiency. This paper analyzes this heterogeneous vehicle routing problem and describes two solution methods: an exact branch-price-and-cut algorithm and an iterated tabu search metaheuristic. From a methodological perspective, we find that the exact algorithm consistently obtains tight lower bounds that also serve to certify the metaheuristic solutions as near-optimal. From a policy standpoint, we examine a large-scale real-world case study concerning parcel deliveries in the Chicago metropolitan area and quantify various operational metrics including energy costs and vehicle miles traveled. We find that by deploying roughly 20% of range-extended vehicles with a modest all-electric range of 33 miles, parcel distributors can save energy costs by up to 17% while incurring less than 0.5% increase in vehicle miles traveled. Increasing the range to 60 miles further reduces costs by only 4%, which can alternatively be achieved by decreasing the average service time by 1 minute or increasing driver working time by 1 hour.

The goal of this paper is to define MAEB working parameters for effective mitigation of injuries and to validate their real-world applicability through field tests in representative riding scenarios of intervention. The results of previous studies and injury risk functions for motorcyclists were employed to define a set of MAEB working parameters (duration of intervention ≥ 0.60 s, target declaration of 0.5 g, fade-in jerk of 2 g/s) which enable MAEB impact speed reductions capable of mitigating injuries. Field tests were then carried out involving common riders as participants and employing a test protocol consistent with previous studies. Automatic Braking (AB) interventions were intended to reproduce unexpected MAEB activations in different riding conditions including straight-line riding and lane-change manoeuvres reproducing an avoidance action. The tests were carried out using a sport-touring motorcycle provided with extension arms to prevent capsizing and equipped with an automatic braking system which was activated remotely by researchers. Thirty-one participants involved in the test experienced AB interventions riding in straight-line and lane-change at a mean speed ranging from 41 km/h to 47 km/h. In the 0.5 g test session, the AB system performed mean deceleration 0.48 g reached with 2.0 g/s fade-in jerk for a duration of around 1.1 s. Both subjective assessment and vehicle data analysis indicated that the participants were consistently able to easily control the vehicle during the automatic braking interventions and were always able to complete a lane-change manoeuvre. No signal of incipient loss of vehicle control was recorded in on-board videos nor identified in the behaviour and body movement by participants. The tested MAEB working parameters performed speed reductions capable to reduce impact speed up to 15 km/h, potentially reducing serious injuries (MAIS3+) by 15 %. The proposed MAEB working parameters were proved as effective in reducing vehicle speed and feasible from end-users’ perspective.

To better understand the detour choices of drivers, we explore the factors that may influence different detour patterns in terms of drivers, spatio-temporal distribution, land use, and network characteristics, and find that these two types of detours have distinctly different features. Based on these analyses, the detour behavior is modeled as a multi-class problem taking into account various features such as actual time, driver trip grids, driver average daily trips, origin/destination trip degrees, origin/destination land use, etc. Considering that our dataset is imbalanced due to significantly fewer detour trips than normal driving trips, a combined model of hybrid sampling and ensemble learning is used to predict detour choices at the beginning of the trip. Results show that the proposed method is useful and powerful in the prediction of detour behavior. This paper is a quantitative study to empirically reveal the factors influencing different detour patterns and to perform ex ante predictions of detour choices, which facilitates managers to understand detour behavior and develop appropriate interventions.",0968-090X,Not found
Logistics of temporary testing centers for coronavirus disease,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103954,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused the death of millions of people, and PCR testing is widely used as the gold standard method to detect the infections to restrict the outbreak. Through the interviews conducted with people from the field in South Korea, the UK, and Turkey, we have found that there are numerous testing strategies worldwide. Those testing strategies include drive-through and home delivery testing capabilities, local test sites, and mobile test centers. Our primary motivation is to propose a generic model based on the best practices in the UK and South Korea. Also, we aim to present a case study on Turkey for the implementation of vital procedures and increase their availability. This paper represents a study on how to construct a temporary testing logistics system during the initial phases of pandemics to increase the availability of PCR testing with the primary objective of maximizing total sample collection. The design also considers minimizing the maximum walking distance to increase the convenience of sample collection for the people living in the neighborhoods. The proposed system consists of temporary testing centers and a central laboratory. Temporary testing centers perform direct tours to the potential areas to collect samples and bring the collected sample to the designated central laboratories located at central hospitals. Moreover, to represent the non-linear inheritance of the pandemic progress within a population, we consider diminishing sample potentials over time and coverage. This new problem is defined as an extension of the Selective Vehicle Routing Problem and Covering Tour Problem. We propose a mathematical model and four two-stage math-heuristic algorithms to determine the location and routing of the temporary testing centers and their lengths of stay at each visited location. The performances of the proposed solution methodologies are tested on two data sets. The first set is constructed by the confirmed cases of the districts of Seoul, Korea, and by the interview of health personnel of H+ Yangji Hospital COVID-19 semi-mobile booth application, and the second set is constructed by 99 hospital/health centers from distinct neighborhoods of 22 districts of Istanbul, Turkey.

The platform utilizes the agent’s choice to learn about her preferences and improve the estimated decision mechanism of the agent. Through systematic experimentation, we first establish that at the earlier iterations and while the decision mechanism of the agent is not yet accurately estimated, a larger menu size could benefit the platform’s overall gain better.

The proposed cordon pricing method is designed to (i) minimize vehicles’ total time spent in the network and (ii) aim for a revenue-neutral tolling. A controller based on model predictive control (MPC) approach is proposed to determine the (possibly negative) optimal time- and region-varying tolls. The MPC controller comprises a regional MFD-based traffic model with no need of destination information and a long-short term memory neural network (LSTM-NN) to obtain an accurate estimation of inter-region transfer flows.

By identifying core (representative) trajectories, we do not need to follow previous studies that compare a current trajectory with each historical trajectory, which significantly reduces the computation time and increases the accuracy of our similarity calculation. In order to obtain the optimal weights for the static and dynamic models, we develop a multi-response constrained linear regression model. This method has high interpretability, as the weights directly indicate the different roles of static and dynamic models at different stages after departure. Our results show that the stacking model is highly accurate after three days from departure, indicating the indispensable role of both information types.",0968-090X,Not found
Strategic and tactical decision-making for cooperative vehicle platooning with organized behavior on multi-lane highways,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103952,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Driving automation and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication provide opportunities to deploy cooperative automated driving systems (C-ADS) for transportation system goals such as sustainability, safety, and efficiency. Among various C-ADS applications, vehicle platooning has great potential to achieve the above system management goals by establishing trajectory-aware V2V cooperative strategies among C-ADS vehicles. Previously, the concept of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC)—that is, single-lane decentralized ad-hoc operations of multiple vehicles that closely follow each other—has been studied by researchers extensively. This study builds upon the existing research and proposes a comprehensive multi-lane platooning algorithm with organized behavior via a hierarchical framework. The proposed algorithm adopts the modern state of the art (SOTA) C-ADS software platform framework, which consist of perception, plan and control levels. The multi-lane platooning algorithm incorporates both the strategic level (i.e., mission level) and the tactical level (i.e., motion level) decision-making to cope with complex multi-lane highway challenges, including same-lane platooning, multi-lane joining, and on-ramp merging. Based on the algorithm’s strategies, the platoon leaders coordinate between platoon members and external vehicles to guide the platoon through complicated and realistic driving scenarios. On the strategic mission level, a platooning behavior protocol based on a deterministic finite state machine (FSM) is developed to guide the member operations. Additionally, as heuristic protocols fall short in explicitly expressing complex cooperative scenarios, a genetic fuzzy system was trained with FSM as a baseline to extend the algorithm’s capability under the cooperative on-ramp merge scenarios. On the tactical motion level, trajectory generation for general ADS maneuvers (i.e., lane following and lane changing) and platooning behavior regulation is proposed such that planned trajectories of other relevant vehicles can be fully considered (i.e., intent sharing of predictive nature). The performance is evaluated in both traffic and automated driving simulators, and the results indicate that the proposed comprehensive multi-lane platooning algorithm can efficiently and safely regulate C-ADS-equipped vehicle behavior and meet system goals.",0968-090X,Not found
Potential destination discovery for low predictability individuals based on knowledge graph,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103928,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Travelers may travel to locations they have never visited, which we call potential destinations of them. Especially under a very limited observation, travelers tend to show random movement patterns and usually have a large number of potential destinations, which make them difficult to handle for mobility prediction (e.g., destination prediction). In this paper, we develop a new knowledge graph-based framework (PDPFKG) for potential destination discovery of low predictability travelers by considering trip association relationships between them. We first construct a trip knowledge graph (TKG) to model the trip scenario by entities (e.g., travelers, destinations and time information) and their relationships, in which we introduce the concept of private relationship for complexity reduction. Then a modified knowledge graph embedding algorithm is implemented to optimize the overall graph representation. Based on the trip knowledge graph embedding model (TKGEM), the possible ranking of individuals’ unobserved destinations to be chosen in the future can be obtained by calculating triples’ distance. Empirically. PDPFKG is tested using an anonymous vehicular dataset from 138 intersections equipped with video-based vehicle detection systems in Xuancheng city, China. The results show that PDPFKG outperforms baseline methods overall, and the rankings given by it have strong consistency with travelers’ behavior in choosing potential destinations on the aggregated level. Besides, experiments indicate the performance would be further improved with new valid data introduction.

Approximating a ride-sourcing system with block matching,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103920,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"On-demand matching between waiting passengers and idle drivers is one of the most important components in a ride-sourcing system. A variety of matching mechanisms have been developed to meet different needs of ride-sourcing platforms, e.g. mitigating supply–demand imbalance, maximizing platform revenue. In this paper, we focus on a block matching system, a special type of matching mechanism, where the region of interest is partitioned into blocks, and on-demand matching is separately and simultaneously conducted in each block. Block matching can bring many benefits, such as limiting order assignment with long pick-up distance, simplifying the process of deployment, etc. However, it still remains a challenging yet interesting issue to determine the block size for the matching system, which is a key decision variable governing passengers’ waiting time. To solve the problem, we model the ride-sourcing system with block matching via a M/M/c queue, in which the service rate is endogenous and partially determined by passengers’ average pick-up time. Based on the model, we find that the average queueing time of passengers decreases with block size increasing, while the average pick-up time may increase instead. In addition, the average total waiting time (sum of average queueing and pick-up time) become nearly invariant to the change of block size when the block size is large, which we call plateau phenomenon. In the plateau, ride-sourcing platforms can choose the block size based on other standards while the average total waiting time is always maintained at the nearly lowest value. The findings are verified via an agent-based simulation study, demonstrating that the proposed model can be an effective tool to approximate block matching system.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperative traffic signal assistance system for non-motorized users and disabilities empowered by computer vision and edge artificial intelligence,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103896,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Information and communication technology has many promising benefits including improvement the traffic network capacity, efficiency, and stability. However, to date, most of the improvements in signal management and interactions in connected vehicle environments focus solely on the vehicular side. This has led to a massive gap for non-motorized users and vulnerable road users. Specifically, deficit perception capability, inconsistent dissemination, obsolescent acquisition techniques, and ignorance of equality make the current experience of the active non-motorized users inconvenient and risky, especially for those with disabilities. To serve the users in an unbiased and automated way, a novel cooperated signal phase and timing (SPaT) services infrastructure — Vision Enhanced Non-motorized Users Services (VENUS) smart node is proposed. With customized up-to-date computer vision algorithms and artificial intelligence pipelines on the edge, VENUS smart node can collect necessary active-user information (including location, class, pose direction and mobility status), and generate directional crossing request for every pedestrian and cyclist in real time. Meanwhile, the improved communication system makes the VENUS node a reliable information hub to share the SPaT messages and carry interactions to/from the signal controller, connected vehicles and user personal information devices (i.e., cell phones, wearable devices) through various protocols. Based on extensive experimentation, 1076 testing users from six intersections, the VENUS sensing achieves 90.24% accuracy on directional-aware crossing trigger generation and 89.87% accuracy on mobility status estimation for normal users and four types of disabled persons. Furthermore, the VENUS smart node is fully compatible with the connected vehicles environment, and improves the signal system at low cost, mainly due to its flexibility and adaptability with existing infrastructure. The VENUS smart node is the first connected infrastructure architecture that integrates traffic sensing, data processing and information dissemination together for the self-operating indistinguishable signal services based on edge computing.",0968-090X,Not found
String stability of automated vehicles based on experimental analysis of feedback delay and parasitic lag,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103927,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Recent literature shows that automated vehicle (AV) significantly impacts traffic flow stability. However, as a widely used longitudinal AV technology, the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system still has several unknown features that lack field data for modeling. We ran a series of novel tests with two ACC vehicles to simulate the behavior of the AV platoon in the field experiment. We designed a linear car-following controller in the upper layer system and tested the string stability of the ACC vehicle platoon. Data is collected through the vehicle's GPS sensor and upper controller. These data can help us estimate the feedback delay in the upper layer and parasitic lag in the lower layer. The data analysis results specify the range of different time delays and further optimize the dynamic response model in the lower layer. Then we propose an improved longitudinal model based on a first-order inertia system with a pure time delay in the dynamic response process. The experimental results show that the improved longitudinal model is twenty percent more accurate than the traditional first-order inertia model. Finally, we analyze the string stability of the improved longitudinal model. The results indicate that the improved longitudinal model has more strict stability conditions than the traditional model. Although the current feedback delay can satisfy the string stability criterion, the parasitic lag in the dynamics response process cannot satisfy the stability criterion. In this study, a customized ACC car-following controller is implemented in the field experiments, and thus all hypotheses and analysis results are validated by field data.",0968-090X,Not found
A generative car-following model conditioned on driving styles,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103926,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Car-following (CF) modeling, an essential component in simulating human CF behaviors, has attracted increasing research interest in the past decades. This paper pushes the state of the art by proposing a novel generative hybrid CF model, which achieves high accuracy in characterizing dynamic human CF behaviors and is able to generate realistic human CF behaviors for any given observed or even unobserved driving style. Specifically, the ability of accurately capturing human CF behaviors is ensured by designing and calibrating an Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with time-varying parameters. The reason behind is that such time-varying parameters can express both the inter-driver heterogeneity, i.e., diverse driving styles of different drivers, and the intra-driver heterogeneity, i.e., changing driving styles of the same driver. The ability of generating realistic human CF behaviors of any given observed driving style is achieved by applying a neural process (NP) based model. The ability of inferring CF behaviors of unobserved driving styles is supported by exploring the relationship between the calibrated time-varying IDM parameters and an intermediate variable of NP. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models, we conduct extensive experiments and comparisons, including CF model parameter calibration, CF behavior prediction, and trajectory simulation for different driving styles.",0968-090X,Not found

The model calibration determines an optimal set of model parameters that minimizes the discrepancy between the modeling results and real traffic data. The model validation is furthermore performed to corroborate the accuracy of a calibrated model using data other than used for calibration. The model calibration aims to reflect traffic reality, while model validation focuses on the prediction of future traffic using calibrated models.

A macroscopic dynamic network loading model using variational theory in a connected and autonomous vehicle environment,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103911,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Recent studies on macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) have shifted towards enhancing MFD dynamics in terms of efficiency and realism. In this paper, a multi-reservoir dynamic network loading (MRDNL) model for a large-scale urban road network is developed. The proposed framework consists of a hyper-link and a hyper-node model. The hyper-link model is constructed using variational theory (VT) by introducing a set of constraints that construct an upper bound for upstream and downstream cumulative accumulations. Using VT, LWR is incorporated into MFD dynamics to enhance traffic propagation at reservoirs. The hyper-link model captures important traffic phenomena, such as kinematic waves, queueing, and congestion, while the hyper-node model functions as a medium for transferring flow to other parts of the multi-reservoir urban network. A numerical scheme is advanced for solving the proposed MRDNL model and its performance is evaluated using a hypothetical traffic network. Compared to previous MFD-based dynamic network loading models, our approach is more computationally efficient since it does not require discretization and offers more realistic solutions by considering multiple kinematic waves and including the dynamics of urban traffic signals. This study, further, incorporated connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) into MFD dynamics and evaluated the network-wide effect of introduction of CAVs in urban traffic networks.

Predicting and explaining lane-changing behaviour using machine learning: A comparative study,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103931,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Predicting lane-changing behaviour is an integral part of lane-changing decision models and has a significant impact on both traffic flow characteristics and traffic safety. A variety of lane-changing decision models have been developed for this purpose, with most of them focussing only on explaining lane-changing behaviour, while assessing the predictive capability of these models has comparatively received less attention. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques are often preferred for prediction purposes, but their application to predicting lane-changing behaviour is limited. However, the lack of interpretability of machine learning techniques is often criticised and needs a solution. Motivated by these research needs, this study explains and predicts driver’s mandatory and discretionary lane-changing behaviours using a set of suitable machine learning techniques. Input features are objectively selected using the technique of Recursive Feature Elimination, and standard classification metrics are employed to select the best model. By accounting for class imbalance, this study finds that the Extra Trees classifier outperforms other machine learning techniques as well as a conventional utility theory-based model in predicting lane-changing behaviour. Furthermore, by keeping the model hyperparameters unchanged, this classifier shows good transferability in predicting lane-changing behaviour when tested on a completely new dataset. Finally, through explainable artificial intelligence, the output of the Extra Trees classifier is interpreted.

Compared to the maximum traffic throughput under idealized conditions, the total network origin–destination (OD) demand considering practical and political requirements has recently been brought into focus.

To quantify the SNC of multimodal networks, an accurate traffic assignment model incorporating combined modes such as Park-and-Ride is necessary. This paper develops a simulation-based approach that exploits the advantages of the off-the-shelf simulator to reduce model complexity. A bilevel formulation of SNC analysis in a simulation-based manner is proposed to obtain optimal OD demand patterns. Owing to the black-box nature of simulation models, there is a need for computationally efficient algorithms dispensing with gradient approximations. Inspired by machine learning parameter tuning techniques, a Bayesian-type algorithm is employed to solve the model, which can considerably save the number of simulation evaluations.

DROP: Deep relocating option policy for optimal ride-hailing vehicle repositioning,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103923,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"In a ride-hailing system, an optimal relocation of vacant vehicles can significantly reduce fleet idling time and balance the supply–demand distribution, enhancing system efficiency and promoting driver satisfaction and retention. Model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been shown to dynamically learn the relocating policy by actively interacting with the intrinsic dynamics in large-scale ride-hailing systems. However, the issues of sparse reward signals and unbalanced demand and supply distribution place critical barriers in developing effective DRL models. Conventional exploration strategy (e.g., the ϵ -greedy) may barely work under such an environment because of dithering in low-demand regions distant from high-revenue regions. This study proposes the deep relocating option policy (DROP) that supervises vehicle agents to escape from oversupply areas and effectively relocate to potentially underserved areas. We propose to learn the Laplacian embedding of a time-expanded relocation graph, as an approximation representation of the system relocation policy. The embedding generates task-agnostic signals, which in combination with task-dependent signals, constitute the pseudo-reward function for generating DROPs. We present a hierarchical learning framework that trains a high-level relocation policy and a set of low-level DROPs. We note that DROP is a general method and can be incorporated into existing model-free RL advances for further improvements in ride-hailing applications.

Calibration of human driving behavior and preference using vehicle trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103916,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"In a recent work (Dai et al., 2021) we proposed a multi-agent computational framework in which each agent’s driving policy at micro-level is derived by maximizing its own utility function. Here we tackle the inverse problem of calibrating the utility parameters using observed vehicle trajectory data. Our starting point is to cast the state evolution as a state space model where driver’s decision is treated as the control input. Then the preference calibration can be achieved with the maximum likelihood estimation technique of the associated Kalman filter. We explicitly illustrate our approach using the vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. Not only the estimated state filter can fit the observed data well for each individual vehicle, the inferred utility functions can also reproduce quantitatively similar pattern of the observed collective traffic pattern. Because our forward model treats driving decision process, which is intrinsically dynamic with multi-agent interactions, as a sequence of independent static optimization problems contingent on the state with a finite look ahead anticipation, we are able to sidestep solving interacting dynamic inversion problems. Consequently, our approach can be made very efficient computationally. We further demonstrate how the calibrated model can be used to gain insights on human driving behaviors via counterfactual simulations.

Both frameworks are empirically shown to be more efficient than the current ship selection method. Like existing ship risk prediction models, the proposed frameworks are of black-box nature whose working mechanism is opaque. To improve model explainability, local explanation of the prediction of individual ships by the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is provided. Furthermore, we innovatively extend the local SHAP model to a near linear-form global surrogate model which is fully-explainable. This demonstrates that the behavior of black-box data-driven models can be as interpretable as white-box models while retaining their prediction accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the white-box global surrogate models can accurately show the behavior of the original black-box models, shedding light on model validation, fairness verification, and prediction explanation.

Integrated macro-micro modelling for individual vehicle trajectory reconstruction using fixed and mobile sensor data,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103929,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Vehicle trajectories can provide a clear picture of the traffic flow that plays a pivotal role in traffic management and control. Two types of traffic sensors, i.e., fixed and mobile sensors, are widely adopted to collect road traffic information. However, fully-sampled vehicle trajectories are far from obtainable through those sensors due to their fixed-location measurements or low penetration rates. To overcome these issues, this study proposes an integrated macro–micro framework to reconstruct individual vehicle trajectories on freeways under a multi-source data environment, in which fixed-location sensor data that collect positions and velocities of vehicles in a certain place and a small fraction of probe vehicle (PV) data that yield continuous trajectories are available. The framework consists of three modules. First, at the macro level, we apply shockwave theory and fundamental diagram to expand the partially detected information to the whole space–time diagram, and then establish a velocity baseline for evaluation of the trajectory fusion thereafter. Second, at the micro level, we develop two trajectory estimation algorithms based on extended car-following models to generate individual trajectories between any two consecutive PVs, in which two candidate trajectories will be generated for each non-probe vehicle. Third, we tailor a trajectory fusion algorithm to integrate the macro- and micro-level models, and apply dynamic programming to solve the optimal trajectories as per the established velocity baseline. The proposed framework is finally tested with NGSIM and HighD datasets.

A possible shortcoming of classical perimeter control is its limiting perception of congestion propagation dynamics, viewing congestion only through aggregated or local properties, e.g., traffic accumulation within the perimeter or queue length at each intersection. Furthermore, restricting traffic via gating by conventional perimeter control may trigger formation of congested queues at the control boundary. In this work, we tackle this problem with control at a dynamic perimeter where the geometry of the boundary evolves over time according to the congestion propagation dynamics. The proposed dynamic perimeter control utilizes percolation theory, a well-established theory for studying statistical physics of spreading phenomena, to analyze the evolving congestion and adapt the shape of the perimeter accordingly. The percolation-based dynamic perimeter effectively adjusts to propagating congestion and prevent small congestion pockets from merging into a larger congested cluster. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in a typical grid network. Our results show that i) the percolation analysis is able to effectively characterize the spatio-temporal evolution of the congestion for the purpose of traffic signal control, ii) adjusting the control dynamically according to percolation-based analysis of congestion successfully balances the traffic leading to boosting the flow capacity of the network, and iii) the percolation-based dynamic perimeter control significantly improves the network traffic performance, compared to the classic fixed perimeter control. This study applies percolation theory and for the first time incorporates an account for the geometrical properties of congestion propagation in traffic signal control, aiming at preventing the emergence of large-scale connected jams.",0968-090X,Not found
Traffic-light control in urban environment exploiting drivers’ reaction to the expected red lights duration,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103910,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Traffic congestion in urban environment is one of the most critical issue for drivers and city planners for both environment and efficiency reasons. Traffic lights are one of the main tools used to regulate traffic by diverting the drivers between different paths. Rational drivers, in turn, react to the traffic light duration by evaluating their options and, if necessary, by changing direction in order to reach their destination quicker. In this paper, we introduce a macroscopic traffic model for urban intersections that incorporates this rational behavior of the drivers. Then, we exploit it to show that, by providing additional information about the expected red-time duration to the drivers, one can decrease the amount of congestion in the network and the overall length of the queues at the intersections. Additionally, we develop a control policy for the traffic lights that exploits the reaction of the drivers in order to divert them to a different route to further increase the performances. These claims are supported by extensive numerical simulations.",0968-090X,Not found
Signalized arterial origin-destination flow estimation using flawed vehicle trajectories: A self-supervised learning approach without ground truth,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103917,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"For alleviating arterial congestion, most control strategies provide progression for through and turning traffic. A prerequisite input is the arterial origin–destination (OD) flow pattern, which can be estimated based on connected vehicle (CV) trajectories. However, the existing estimation methods require the ground-truth historical OD flow, which is difficult to obtain. To address this issue, this paper develops a method to estimate real-time OD flow along a signalized arterial without ground truth. A model based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) network is proposed, which incorporates long short-term memory (LSTM), attention mechanism, and convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the temporal and spatial correlations between OD flow patterns. This model is trained with the proposed self-supervised without historical OD flow.

Connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization along signalized arterial: A decentralized approach under mixed traffic environment,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103918,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Trajectory optimization, as a key connected automated vehicles (CAVs) operation task, has the potential to mitigate traffic congestion, lower energy consumption, and increase the efficiency of traffic operation. This study proposes a decentralized approach to optimization CAV trajectories in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions along a signalized arterial under the mixed traffic environment, where human vehicles (HVs) and CAVs co-exist. More specifically, a 2-stage model is developed to optimize CAV trajectories based on traffic signal plans of downstream intersections and trajectory information of surrounding vehicles. The stage-1 is formulated to provide a rough estimate of the minimal travel time required for a single CAV traveling along this arterial with minimum stops. The stage-2 model is then designed to optimize the longitudinal and lateral behavior of CAVs with the objective of minimizing delay and lane-changing costs. This model is solved by a dynamic programming algorithm to satisfy the real-time optimization needs. A rolling horizon approach is adapted to dynamically implement the proposed model in light of changing traffic conditions. Numerical experiments have been conducted on a real-world arterial to evaluate the model performances. By comparing the optimized trajectories to the no optimization benchmark, the proposed model can reduce average stop delays of CAVs. Moreover, it can also reduce the stop delays of HVs and mixed traffic.",0968-090X,Not found
Lane-level trajectory reconstruction based on data-fusion,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103906,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"While lane-changing movements are performed on the entire motorway network for various reasons, such as overtaking, their intensity is substantially greater near complex segments, such as weaving areas. Aside from mandatory lane changes, some drivers also conduct lateral maneuvers for cooperation or anticipation near network nodes. Unlike longitudinal driver behavior (car-following models), lateral driver behavior (lane-changing movements) has received fewer research efforts. The scarcity of suitable data resources to analyze these behaviors and movements might be a crucial cause for this research gap. This paper presents a four-step approach for reconstructing and correcting lateral bias in trajectories collected by a commercial traffic information application running on everyday smartphones. The resulting lateral position is accurate enough to allow for identification of the driving lane, and thus, the lane changes. The algorithm's core is built on a data fusion method using trajectory and loop detector data. The evaluation and validation of the proposed algorithm using drones and closed-circuit television (CCTV) data demonstrate that the core of the algorithm can correctly match more than 94% of trajectory and loop detector data. Between each pair of successive detector stations, the lateral position error has been significantly corrected and reduced to less than half the width of a standard lane of motorway networks. As a result, more than 90% of processed trajectory sample points are in the correct lane. The algorithm requires just two calibration parameters, so it is relatively simple to apply to other test networks.",0968-090X,Not found
Data-driven trajectory-based analysis and optimization of airport surface movement,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103902,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Driven by the recent deployment of equipment and the availability of data, aircraft trajectories on the surface can be tracked continuously, and the detailed analysis of surface operations is enabled to measure airport operational performance and prepare for collaborative decision making. This paper proposes a hybrid approach combining traffic analysis and optimization to address the airport surface movement problem. Important metrics of surface management such as runway utilization, taxi routes, taxi times are extracted and characterized based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) messages. After recognizing the congestion bottleneck, a trajectory-based optimization model is proposed, and an adapted simulated annealing heuristic is applied to solve the related problem. Two concepts for optimizing surface operations: arrival taxi reroute and departure controlled pushback are evaluated. The proposed approach is illustrated for Beijing Capital International airport. Computational experiments show that a mean taxi-in time reduction of 5.1 min is achieved for the rerouting arrivals, and the mean taxi-out time is reduced by 3.7 min with gate holding strategy. This data-driven approach allows advanced characterization of complex surface operations and enables collaborative decision assistance tools for managing surface movement efficiently.",0968-090X,Not found
Energy-efficient automatic train operation for high-speed railways: Considering discrete notches and neutral sections,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103884,145,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The energy-efficient driving of automatic train operation (ATO) system in high-speed railway systems has attracted more and more attention. Different from the energy-efficient automatic train control problem for metro trains, the traction/braking forces given by high-speed ATO systems are currently not continuous but discrete values corresponding to traction/braking notches due to the limited communication interface between ATO systems and rolling stocks. In addition, since high-speed trains are powered by single-phase alternating current, there is no power supply for train traction in neutral sections, which is introduced to separate two catenaries powered by currents with different phases. In this paper, we propose a discrete-space based mathematical formulation for the energy-efficient automatic train control problem for high-speed trains, where binary variables are introduced to indicate the traction/braking notch selections and to indicate whether a discrete space interval is a neutral section or not. The mathematical formulation is then transformed into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which can be solved by existing solvers. However, due to the discretization of the space the discrete traction/braking notches, the resulting MILP problem could be infeasible and the optimal driving strategy cannot be obtained. Hence, we present a novel relaxation method, i.e., the final braking notch relaxation method, to relax a few constraints in the final braking phase and to generate a feasible speed profile. Comprehensive experiments are investigated based on Beijing–Harbin high-speed railway line, where the energy consumption of the speed profiles with discrete (i.e., notch-based) traction/braking forces is slightly higher than that with continuous traction/braking forces. Moreover, the impacts of the neutral section locations and the effects of different numbers of traction/braking notches are deeply analyzed.",0968-090X,Not found
Real-time detection of abnormal driving behavior based on long short-term memory network and regression residuals,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103983,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Abnormal driving behavior is one of the main causes of roadway collisions. In most studies of abnormal driving behavior, the abnormal driving status is detected and analyzed using classification algorithms directly or using unsupervised learning algorithms to classify reconstruction or prediction residuals. However, abnormal driving behavior data are difficult to acquire and label. Also, a class imbalance issue is inherent in the algorithm training process due to the relatively sparse data for abnormal driving behavior. Moreover, current studies that include residual analysis tend to focus on individual points and thus fail to capture the continuity characteristic of abnormal driving behavior. To address these problems, a long short-term memory-residual (LSTM-R) algorithm is proposed to detect abnormal driving behavior in real time. The proposed algorithm (referred to simply as LSTM-R) has two steps. First, an LSTM network is used to fit the current vehicle kinematic data based on historical data to obtain the root mean square residual at each moment. Second, a time window-based residual algorithm is designed and employed to detect abnormal driving behavior according to the magnitude and continuity of the residuals. To verify the effectiveness of LSTM-R, an experimental test was conducted in Nanjing, China. The vehicle kinematic data were collected non-intrusively using a smartphone. In addition, AdaCost, SMOTEBoost, EasyEnsemble, LightGBM-residual, and linear regression-residual algorithms were employed for comparison with the proposed algorithm to assess its effectiveness. The effects of (1) the degree-of-fit of the LSTM network, (2) the LSTM-R parameters, and (3) the abnormal driving behavior percentage on the detection results were analyzed in detail. First, both the underfitting and overfitting of the LSTM network compromise the detection performance. Second, within a certain range of values, the LSTM-R parameters have little effect on the detection results. Third, the detection results are affected only slightly by the abnormal proportion. The results show that LSTM-R, with a maximum F1-score of 0.866, significantly outperforms the other five algorithms. Furthermore, even if only 10% abnormal driving behavior is in the training set, LSTM-R’s F1-score can still be close to 0.86, indicating a significant relaxation of the requirements for labeled data. Also, the required data are easy to collect, which indicates LSTM-R’s extensive application possibilities. This paper thus provides an effective method for the real-time detection of abnormal driving behavior and also supports driving risk assessment and driving behavior improvement with the overall goal to enhance roadway safety.",0968-090X,Not found
A simulation-based metro train scheduling optimization incorporating multimodal coordination and flexible routing plans,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103964,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The promotion of multimodal coordination is of great significance to the joint development of diversified urban transportation systems. Focusing on an urban comprehensive passenger transport hub (UCPTH) that converges both inter-city modes and multiple inner-city modes, this study aims to customize a bridging metro train operation plan with the utilization of multimodal passenger simulation. A bi-objective integer nonlinear programming model (INLP) incorporating train schedule and flexible routing plan is proposed to minimize passenger waiting time and operating costs simultaneously. Notably, a real-time flow prediction method based on Monte Carlo simulation and queuing network system is proposed and embedded in the optimization model framework to reflect the difference of individual passengers’ transfer walking time and thereby provide detailed passenger distribution on the platform for metro hub stations connecting UCPTH. Compared with the estimation using historical data, this method can particularly support the scheduling coordination of metro and other modes during an abrupt change of arrival flows. Moreover, to solve the collaborative optimization model tractably, the ε -constraint method based on a tailored variable neighborhood search algorithm is developed to generate approximate Pareto optimal solutions, including the number of effective trains, demand-sensitive headway, the route pattern of each effective train, and train dwell time. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments, including a small-scale case and a real-world hub-metro network instance are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Optimal dispatching of electric vehicles for providing charging on-demand service leveraging charging-on-the-move technology,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103968,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Range anxiety and charging infrastructure scarcity have been the main challenges for the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The emerging mobile electric-vehicle-to-electric-vehicle (mE2) charging technology offers a promising solution, which combines battery-to-battery and connected and autonomous vehicle technologies to enable an EV with an extra battery to charge another EV on the move. This paper focuses on the efficient pairing and routing of electricity providers (EPs) to demand (EDs) by extending the existing Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) strategy to the mE2 charging service (referred to as CaaS+). We investigate the EP fleet management problem, which is mathematically modeled as a vehicle routing problem (i.e., mE2-VRP), aiming to optimally dispatch the minimum number of EPs to approach and serve the EDs. To adapt mE2 charging strategy to the online service involving large-scale EDs in practice, we develop a Clustering-aid Decomposition and Merging (c-DM) algorithm. It clusters the EDs according to their coalition potential so that we can decompose a large-scale mE2-VRP into smaller subproblems which can be efficiently solved by parallel computing. Our numerical experiments built upon citywide (Chicago) and statewide (Florida) case studies confirm the efficiency of the proposed c-DM algorithm. It enables us to investigate the performance of CaaS+ under a realistic large-scale setup. The results show that CaaS+ will be applied in different proportions of EV flows to save EDs’ travel time and mitigate traffic congestion to different extents in different network congestion and charging station coverage scenarios. The sensitivity analyses of EDs’ energy inventory and range anxiety also provide some hints and suggestions for improving the service efficiency of CaaS+.",0968-090X,Not found
COOR-PLT: A hierarchical control model for coordinating adaptive platoons of connected and autonomous vehicles at signal-free intersections based on deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103933,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Platooning and coordination are two implementation strategies that are frequently proposed for traffic control of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at signal-free intersections instead of using conventional traffic signals. However, few studies have attempted to integrate both strategies to better facilitate the CAV control at signal-free intersections. To this end, this study proposes a hierarchical control model, named COOR-PLT, to coordinate adaptive CAV platoons at a signal-free intersection based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). COOR-PLT has a two-layer framework. The first layer uses a centralized control strategy to form adaptive platoons. The optimal size of each platoon is determined by considering multiple objectives (i.e., efficiency, fairness and energy saving). The second layer employs a decentralized control strategy to coordinate multiple platoons passing through the intersection. Each platoon is labeled with coordinated status or independent status, upon which its passing priority is determined. As an efficient DRL algorithm, Deep Q-network (DQN) is adopted to determine platoon sizes and passing priorities respectively in the two layers. The model is validated and examined on the simulator Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). The simulation results demonstrate that the model is able to: (1) achieve satisfactory convergence performances; (2) adaptively determine platoon size in response to varying traffic conditions; and (3) completely avoid deadlocks at the intersection. By comparison with other control methods, the model manifests its superiority of adopting adaptive platooning and DRL-based coordination strategies. Also, the model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on reducing travel time and fuel consumption in different traffic conditions.",0968-090X,Not found
Application of modular vehicle technology to mitigate bus bunching,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103953,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The stochastic nature of public transport systems leads to headway variability and bus bunching, causing both operator and passenger cost to increase significantly. Traditional strategies to counter bus bunching, including bus-holding, stop-skipping, and bus substitution/insertion, suffer from trade-offs and shortcomings. Autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology provides an additional level of flexibility in bus dispatching and operations, which can offer significant benefits in mitigating bus bunching compared to strategies available with conventional buses. This paper introduces a novel alternative to stop-skipping by leveraging the new capabilities offered by AMVs (in particular, en-route coupling and decoupling of modular units). We develop a simple bus-splitting strategy that directs a modular bus to decouple into individual units when it experiences a headway longer than a given threshold. We then use a macroscopic simulation to present a proof-of-concept evaluation of the proposed modular strategy compared to a benchmark traditional stop-skipping strategy and the base (no control) case. We find that the proposed strategy outperforms the benchmark in decreasing each of the three travel time components: waiting time, in-vehicle time, and walking time (which it eliminates completely). It therefore reduces the overhead of bus bunching and thus the travel cost by more than twice as much as the benchmark for busy bus lines. Simultaneously, it also reduces headway variability to a comparable degree. Furthermore, we analyze different control thresholds for applying the proposed strategy, and show that it is most effective when applied proactively, i.e. with the control action being triggered even by small headway deviations.",0968-090X,Not found
Alpha-fair large-scale urban network control: A perimeter control based on a macroscopic fundamental diagram,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103961,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This paper introduces a novel α -fair perimeter control (AFPC) scheme for a multi-region urban network based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) modeling approach. The goal is to optimize the allocation of available region resources (i.e., available capacity) through perimeter control by metering the flow that transfers between any two neighbor regions while also considering the impacts (i.e., accumulation, average speed and queue) of such decision on road users in the regions. Regional traffic state dynamics are modeled using a multi-region MFD approach while queuing dynamics at a regional perimeter border, caused by control, are modeled using a point queue model. Based on regional average speed, a utility measure for each region is defined. Weights corresponding to regions are assigned dynamically to reflect the prevailing state of regional queues. The problem is then formulated based on these utilities with a novel perimeter control model that identifies the inflows between any two neighboring regions. The unique feature of the developed AFPC model is its ability to find a balanced trade-off between efficiency (i.e., travel time savings) and fairness in the distribution of both resources and impacts. The performance of the proposed model is compared with the no control base scenario as well as four other control scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms other control scenarios in terms of fairness while not degrading efficiency. The sensitivity analysis of a range of α values illustrates the wide spectrum of fair-centered yet efficient solutions that can be successfully achieved. Thus, by manipulating α values and regions’ weights, the AFPC framework can be tweaked to meet the specific fairness and efficiency aspirations of a network while also tailoring the specific regions’ need.",0968-090X,Not found

Another distinguishing feature of our modeling consists of building a single statistical model for actual dwell times at all stations and in all contexts, not just in constrained situations like late arrivals or not just for some minimum dwell time. These models are fully data-driven and stem from either linear regressions with multiplicative effects or machine-learning methods like random forests, both carefully tuned on training data sets. While railway operations variables remain key for the modeling of dwell time, we are able to characterize the added value of passenger flows variables. Overall, they lead to an average reduction of the global modeling error by about 0.5 s, with up to 5 s–10 s average improvements in challenging situations consisting, e.g., of late arrivals or associated with high passenger affluence. We also study which are the most influential variables among the available operations and passenger flows variables, and we do so globally and by regime of punctuality: for instance, passenger flows variables, and in particular, the passenger affluence at the critical door, are the most influential variables for trains suffering a late arrival, while the scheduled dwell time and the deviation to the scheduled arrival time are the most important variables for early trains.",0968-090X,Not found

Due to a lack of empirical studies, there is limited understanding of how an individual’s travel pattern evolves over months and years. We use two high-resolution user-labelled datasets consisting of billions of GPS track points from ∼ 3800 individuals to analyse individuals’ activity–travel behaviour over the long term. The general movement patterns of the considered population are characterised using mobility indicators. Despite the differences in the mobility patterns, we find that individuals from both datasets maintain a conserved quantity in the number of essential travel mode and activity location combinations over time, resulting from a balance between exploring new choice combinations and exploiting existing options. A typical individual maintains ∼ 15 mode–location combinations, of which ∼ 7 are travelled with a private vehicle every 5 weeks. The dynamics of this stability reveal that the exploration speed of locations is faster than the one for travel modes, and they can both be well modelled using a power-law fit that slows down over time.

To address this problem, a hybrid short-term metro passenger flow prediction model named decomposition ensemble attention sequence to sequence (DEASeq2Seq) is proposed in this paper. The proposed DEASeq2Seq includes three phases: decomposition, ensemble, and prediction. First, complete empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is utilized to decompose the original passenger flow data into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue. Second, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is performed to reconstruct the decomposed modes into a stochastic part, a deterministic part, and a trend part via determinism evaluation.

Hence, it can significantly increase the capacity of rail transit. Similar to the vehicle platooning, most established VC approaches select the constant time/spacing gap commonly as the spacing policy but regards the relative braking distance as a constraint. These spacing policy diminish the priority of safety concern in train control systems due to the severity of incidents and economic loss. Motivated by this research gap, in this paper, we designed a stabilized virtual coupling scheme for a train set with heterogeneous braking dynamics capability. Specifically, a relative braking distance based spacing policy is introduced according to the braking dynamics capability of the train, which is a typical characteristic that distinguishes it from the vehicle platoon model. A linear control architecture suitable for the virtual coupled train set (VCTS) is designed to maintain the equilibrium spacing. Sufficient conditions to ensure the local stability are derived and obtained in this paper.

As an alternative to using sensors fixed in vehicles, this paper presents a scalable approach for detecting hard-braking events using the kinematics data collected from smartphone sensors.

A general approach to smoothing nonlinear mixed traffic via control of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103967,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Stop-and-go waves are easily caused by unstable traffic due to the collective behavior of human drivers, resulting in higher vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. In this article, we develop a general approach to synthesizing feedback controllers of autonomous vehicles (AVs) for smoothing unstable nonlinear mixed traffic flow, consisting of AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). In the context of traffic smoothing and stabilization, prior studies have mainly focused on analyzing string stability of specific car-following models linearized at flow equilibrium points. By contrast, we are interested to analytically synthesize appropriate feedback controllers of AVs for smoothing nonlinear mixed traffic in its general functional forms, covering a broad class of deterministic car-following models commonly seen in the literature. Specifically, by leveraging feedback control theory AVs are controlled to operate in such a way that they closely track a virtual speed profile, i.e., a subtler version of the disturbance resulting from the immediate preceding vehicle. Thus, traffic waves are reduced when propagating backward across controlled AVs. Based on the general functional form of car-following dynamics, we derive a class of effective additive AV controllers that are proven to be able to ensure convergence in tracking desired speed profiles, leading to smoother traffic. In addition, a set of sufficient conditions is devised for guaranteeing car-following safety. More importantly, head-to-tail string stability of the mixed traffic is likely to be achieved with a sufficient market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs. Notably, unlike many existing studies the feedback controllers synthesized for AVs require only local traffic information without having to rely on high degrees of vehicle connectivity, and the rate of smoothing mixed traffic is readily tunable, which is useful for practical implementations. The proposed approach is further illustrated with a theoretical intelligent driver model (IDM) and commercially available adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles represented by a well calibrated IDM.

This framework addresses the coupling between EMV navigation and traffic signal control via an innovative design of multi-class RL agents and a novel pressure-based reward function. The proposed methodology enables EMVLight to learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phasing strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also shortens the travel time of non-EMVs. Simulation-based experiments indicate that EMVLight enables up to a 42.6% reduction in EMV travel time as well as an 23.5% shorter average travel time compared with existing approaches.",0968-090X,Not found
High-dimensional population inflow time series forecasting via an interpretable hierarchical transformer,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103962,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Mobile device location data (MDLD) are emerging data sources in the transportation domain that contain large-scale, fine-grained information on population inflow. However, limited studies have built forecasting models based on large-scale MDLD-based population inflow time series. This task is challenging due to complex nonlinear temporal dynamics, high-dimensional time series structure (i.e. multiple time series with multi-shape inputs and outputs), and non-negligible impacts from various external factors. To address these challenges, this study introduces a deep learning framework, the Interpretable Hierarchical Transformer (IHTF), for nationwide county-level population inflow time series forecasting and interpretation. A variety of cutting-edge deep learning techniques are fused, including the variable selection network to incorporate external effects, the gated residual network to handle nonlinearity, and the transformer architecture to learn temporal dynamics. Different interior parameters, such as variable selection weight and temporal attention weight, are extracted to explain patterns learned by the framework. Numerical experiments show that IHTF outperforms extensive baseline models in forecasting accuracy. In addition, feature importance generated by IHTF is similar to the tree-based model, LightGBM, but exhibits a more even distribution, among which point-of-interests (POIs) count, county location, median household income, and percentage of accommodation and food services are the most important static variables. Moreover, attention weight demonstrates that IHTF can automatically learn the seasonality from time series. Taken together, this framework can serve as a reliable travel demand forecasting component in the transportation planning process that allows modeling the travel demand continuously instead of by snapshot.",0968-090X,Not found
A new framework for mixed-user dynamic traffic assignment considering delay and accessibility to information,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103977,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"We consider a transport network consisting of two classes of users, namely, selfish users whose objective is to minimize their individual travel times, and cooperative users whose objective is to maximize the aggregate throughput of their class, or equivalently, to minimize the total travel time of their class. The selfish users decide the paths from their respective origins to destinations depending on their knowledge of the traffic conditions prevailing up to the beginning of their journeys, and they do not alter their paths once their journeys start. The cooperative users, on the other hand, keep making the decisions of ‘the next link to take towards the destination’ throughout their journeys based on their current knowledge of the traffic conditions, which evolves with time and the availability of traffic information. We develop a new framework for the problem of informed mixed-user dynamic traffic assignment (IMUDTA) considering the delay and the degree of penetration of information. The proposed framework enables us to study the route choices made by the two classes of users and the resulting network performance. Due to its non-linear formulation with high complexity, we propose a novel incremental solution method to this problem where we present a transformation of this complex IMUDTA problem into a relaxed linear programming (LP) model. We show via numerical results that (i) appropriately postponing (intentionally or unintentionally) the access to information can improve the system performance, (ii) better information penetration increases the robustness of the network performance against the information delay, and (iii) the value of information (in terms of improving network performance) is reduced when the degree of information penetration is high. The applicability of our framework is demonstrated in a large-scale network example, and analyze the computational aspects and the impact of information on network performance with varying information delay and penetration.",0968-090X,Not found
Cost-optimal deployment of autonomous mobile lockers co-operating with couriers for simultaneous pickup and delivery operations,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103958,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This work is an extension of a study by Li et al. (2021) in which a two-echelon network consisting of multiple depots and a fleet of Autonomous Mobile Lockers (AMLs) co-operating with couriers was examined to address the simultaneous pickup and delivery problem. This work considers the same problem but allows couriers and robots to traverse open routes. Most importantly, couriers can perform multiple missions, allowing them to restart a new mission from any stop. In order to formulate this problem, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was introduced with the aim of minimizing the total cost. Since the MILP model is not able to solve large-scale problems, an Adaptive Backtracking-Simulated Annealing metaheuristic (ABSM) algorithm was developed whose efficiency was analysed using numerical experimentation. The results show that the ABSM algorithm introduced is able to provide quality solutions within a reasonable amount of time. Also, the proposed algorithm was compared with three variants of the simultaneous pickup and delivery problem and the amount of savings was calculated. Finally, the significant problem parameters were identified and their impact on the value of the objective function was investigated. The results show that significant savings can be achieved when couriers are able to perform multiple open routes in a cooperative system of AMLs and couriers.",0968-090X,Not found
Copula ARMA-GARCH modelling of spatially and temporally correlated time series data for transportation planning use,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103969,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Time series analysis has been used extensively in transport research in various areas, such as traffic management and transport planning. Time-series data may contain temporal and spatial correlations. Temporal correlation refers to the dependency of observations on time, while spatial correlation refers to the dependence of observations on space. Although there is a substantial amount of literature on statistical models that modelled temporal correlation of transport time-series data, there are few studies that accommodate both temporal and spatial correlations. In cases where more than one time-series dataset is collected from different locations, each observation can depend on its previous values and observations from other locations. Transport-related time-series data (e.g., traffic volumes, travel times, etc.) may exhibit nonlinear spatial correlation within the transport network. However, existing statistical time series models that consider spatial correlation, such as vector auto-regression (VAR) models, are limited to linear spatial correlation functions with a time-invariance assumption. This study introduces a copula time series model capable of modelling correlations between variables through time and space. Temporal correlations are modelled by an autoregressive moving average-generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) model, where the conditional mean is predicted based on past values and errors, and conditional variance is predicted based on past residuals and conditional variances. This enables the model to describe heteroscedastic data. The spatial correlation is modelled with a copula model, which has the flexibility to model different types of correlations, such as nonlinear, tailed and asymmetric correlations. We illustrate the statistical properties of our approach where the performance of the copula ARMA-GARCH model is compared with the VAR model based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values of model predictions on synthesised data. We then demonstrate practical implementations of these models examined in two case studies with traffic count data collected from four main arterial roads in Sydney.",0968-090X,Not found
Estimating on-board passenger comfort in public transport vehicles using incomplete automatic passenger counting data,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103963,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The prevention of crowding inside buses, trams and trains is an important component of on-board passenger comfort and is central to the provision of good public transport services. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated significant reduction in public transport patronage and, more importantly, in passenger confidence, the avoidance of crowds by passengers and operators alike becomes even more critical. This is where the provision of information on on-board comfort becomes a necessity. The present study, therefore, proposes a new Kalman filter based estimation scheme for on-board comfort levels, employing historical and current (same-day) non-exhaustive Automatic Passenger Counting data, as well as Automatic Vehicle Locating measurements. The accuracy and reliability of the estimation is, then, evaluated through application to the tramway network of the French city of Nantes. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to deliver good estimation accuracy, both in terms of absolute passenger numbers, but also, more crucially, in terms of on-board comfort Levels of Service.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal curbside pricing for managing ride-hailing pick-ups and drop-offs,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103960,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Recent years have witnessed the rise of ride-hailing mobility services thanks to ubiquitous emerging technologies. Curbside spaces, as a category of public infrastructure, are being used by private ride-hailing services to pick up and drop off passengers, in addition to deliveries and parking access. This becomes quite common in urban areas and has led to additional congestion for ride-hailing, private and public transit vehicles on the driving lanes. Curb utilization by various traffic modes further alters travelers’ choices in modes/routes, clogging streets and polluting urban environment. However, there is a lack of theories and models to evaluate the effects of curbside ride-hailing stops in regional networks and to effectively manage ride-hailing pick-ups and drop-offs for system optimum. In view of this, this paper develops a bi-modal network traffic assignment model considering both private driving and ride-hailing modes who are competing for roads and curb spaces in general networks. To model the impact of limited curbside capacity to through traffic, a curbside queuing model is utilized to quantify the effect of congestion on both curbs and driving lanes induced by curbside stops in terms of waiting time and queue lengths. Travelers make joint choices of modes (driving or ride-hailing), curb stopping locations or parking locations. In addition, this study explores the option to regulate the amount of curbside stops to improve system performance, which is done by imposing a location-specific stopping fee on ride-hailing trips for using curbs to pick-up and drop-off. The curb pricing would influence travelers’ modal choices and parking location choices. To determine the optimal curbside pricing, a sensitivity analysis-based method is developed to minimize the total social cost of the network among all trips. The proposed methods are examined on three networks. We find that the optimal curbside pricing could effectively reduce curbside congestion and total social cost of the traffic system, benefiting all trips in the network.",0968-090X,Not found
Trajectory-as-a-Sequence: A novel travel mode identification framework,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103957,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Identifying travel modes from GPS tracks, as an essential technique to understand the travel behavior of a population, has received widespread interest over the past decade. While most previous Travel Mode Identification (TMI) methods separately identify the mode of each track segment of a GPS trajectory, in this paper, we propose a sequence-based TMI framework that constructs a feature sequence for each GPS trajectory and sent it to a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to obtain the corresponding travel mode label sequence, named Trajectory-as-a-Sequence (TaaS). The proposed seq2seq model consists of a Convolutional Encoder (CE) and a Recurrent Conditional Random Field (RCRF), where the CE extracts high-level features from the point-level trajectory features and the RCRF learns the context information of trajectories at both feature and label levels, thus outputting accurate and reasonable travel mode label sequences. To alleviate the lack of data, we adopted a two-stage model training strategy. Additionally, we design two novel bus-related features to assist the seq2seq model distinguishing different high-speed travel modes (i.e., bus, car, and railway) in the sequence. Besides the classical performance metrics such as accuracy, we propose a new metric that evaluates the rationality of the travel mode label sequence at the trajectory level. Comprehensive evaluations corresponding to the real-world TMI applications show that the sequence-based TaaS outperforms the segment-based models in practice. Furthermore, the results of ablation studies demonstrate that the elements integrated into the TaaS framework are helpful to improve the efficiency and accuracy of TMI.",0968-090X,Not found
Residency and worker status identification based on mobile device location data,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103956,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Mobile device location data (MDLD) have been widely recognized for their rich human mobility information and thus considered as a supplementary data source for the current travel data bank consisting of travel survey data and traffic monitoring data. However, the lack of ground truth information about the device owners raises concern about the biases and representativeness of the nonprobability MDLD sample and significantly limits the applications of MDLD. This paper focuses on identifying two important socio-demographic characteristics for the MDLD sample devices: residency and worker status, including four worker types (normal commuters, professional drivers, mobility-for-work workers, and nonworkers/home-based workers). Based on the spatial–temporal patterns of location sightings and derived trips from MDLD, a comprehensive imputation framework is proposed with parameters calibrated against public domain ground truth data. A national-level case study in the U.S. based on a commercial MDLD dataset further evaluates the performances of the proposed heuristic rules. The multi-level validation results indicate a satisfying match against the ground truth data and prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods. As one of the earliest efforts to identify the residency and worker status information for a large-scale national-level MDLD dataset, mobile workers—including professional drivers and mobility-for-work workers—are also identified from MDLD for the first time.",0968-090X,Not found
Unboxing the graph: Towards interpretable graph neural networks for transport prediction through neural relational inference,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103946,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Predicting the supply and demand of transport systems is vital for efficient traffic management, control, optimization, and planning. For example, predicting where from/to and when people intend to travel by taxi can support fleet managers in distributing resources; better predictions of traffic speeds/congestion allows for pro-active control measures or for users to better choose their paths. Making spatio-temporal predictions is known to be a hard task, but recently Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied on non-Euclidean spatial data. However, most GNN models require a predefined graph, and so far, researchers rely on heuristics to generate this graph for the model to use. In this paper, we use Neural Relational Inference to learn the optimal graph for the model. Our approach has several advantages: 1) a Variational Auto Encoder structure allows for the graph to be dynamically determined by the data, potentially changing through time; 2) the encoder structure allows the use of external data in the generation of the graph; 3) it is possible to place Bayesian priors on the generated graphs to encode domain knowledge. We conduct experiments on two datasets, namely the NYC Yellow Taxi and the PEMS-BAY road traffic datasets. In both datasets, we outperform benchmarks and show performance comparable to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we do an in-depth analysis of the learned graphs, providing insights on what kinds of connections GNNs use for spatio-temporal predictions in the transport domain and how these connections can help interpretability.",0968-090X,Not found
Collaborative truck-and-drone delivery for inventory-routing problems,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103791,146,2023-01-01,2023,1,"With the retail market more competitive than it has ever been and with profit margins razor-thin, it has become of the essence that business operations are conducted as cost-efficiently as possible. With traditional methods exhausted, companies now see it worthwhile to explore fundamentally paradigm-shifting methods to create savings. For the logistics industry, one such approach is the incorporation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, into the delivery cycle, whose per-mile transportation costs are much lower than those of trucks, the traditional mode of transportation for deliveries. Yet despite the long-standing promise of drones to revolutionize the supply chain, realistic proposals for the exact ways in which UAVs would be introduced into delivery operations have only recently begun to appear in the operations research literature. Particularly noteworthy among these proposals is the concept of collaborative truck-and-drone operation, which captures the advantages of each of the two modes of delivery involved while attenuating their respective downsides. Over the past five years, collaborative delivery has been studied extensively in the classical contexts of the traveling salesman problem and the vehicle-routing problem. In this paper, we offer a first incursion into studying the incorporation of tandem truck–drone delivery into the inventory-routing problem (IRP)–a more realistic and more challenging operations model. After presenting a mixed integer-linear programming formulation for the IRP with drone (IRP-D), we propose an exact branch-and-cut solution approach for it. Additionally, a heuristic for the problem is designed based on the solution of the basic (i.e., droneless) IRP. Extensive computational results show that the heuristic is effective both as a standalone algorithm and as a warm-starting agent for the branch-and-cut IRP-D algorithm.

Modeling mode choice of customized bus services with loyalty subscription schemes in multi-modal transportation networks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104012,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"This study models the equilibrium mode choice of emerging customized bus (CB) services in a multi-modal urban transportation network. Two unique characteristics of CB services are considered: (1) the reservation of a seat for every CB passenger, and (2) the loyalty scheme for long-term CB subscribers. The first characteristic eliminates in-vehicle crowding but imposes tight constraints on CB demand, while the second characteristic encourages passenger loyalty to CB services. An advanced equilibrium mode choice model based on the dogit model, a well-established travel choice model that is widely used to consider captive mode choices, is proposed to account for the choice behavior of passengers loyal to CB services. In contrast, a nested weibit model is used to account for the choice behavior of passengers not loyal to CB services by simultaneously considering the effects of mode similarity and mode heterogeneity on mode choice behavior. The proposed model is formulated as an equivalent mathematical programming problem, which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the properties and applicability of the proposed model in a real-world setting. The results demonstrate the importance of considering passenger loyalty and managing mode similarity and heterogeneity when modeling emerging CB services. The results also show the applicability of the proposed model for evaluating the performance of a network with CB services and the design and pricing of CB operation and subscription schemes.",0968-090X,Not found
Departure time choices in the morning commute with a mixed distribution of capacity,10.1016/j.trc.2022.104011,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Incidents and other random factors may create variations to the transportation system and thus result in stochastic road capacity during the travel period. The realized capacity on a given day (i.e., an average value over the travel period) changes from day to day. For instance, existing empirical studies indicate that incident capacity reduction can be approximated as a continuous random variable. This study examines the morning commute problem with a road bottleneck whose capacity is constant within a day but changes stochastically from day to day. This study extends existing stochastic bottleneck model studies by considering a more general distribution of the bottleneck capacity. In particular, the capacity of bottleneck is at the designed value under good external conditions and degrades into a smaller value within an interval (i.e., the capacity degradation range) under adverse external conditions (a “mixed” distribution). Commuters’ departure time choices follow the Wardrop’s first principle in terms of their mean individual travel cost. Given the considered distribution of capacity, additional equilibrium departure/arrival patterns not identified by the literature have been identified and examined. How the mean travel cost and the mean of total travel time may vary with the capacity degradation probability and the level of capacity degradation have been analyzed. The impacts of the width of degraded capacity range have also been investigated to quantify how the results are affected if the degraded capacity is assumed as the mean value (rather than a degraded capacity range). Our results indicate that with less severe capacity degradation, the mean travel cost always decreases and improving the capacity under the “worst condition” can be more effective than improving the capacity under the “best adverse condition”. However, it is not always the case for reducing the total travel time, and the mentioned measures may exacerbate the system’s congestion, especially when the capacity degradation rarely occurs. Under a given mean capacity, the mean travel cost would be underestimated if the capacity degradation range is ignored. We also compare system performance considering different capacity distributions. It is found that the “mixed” capacity distribution defined in this study outperforms the binary capacity distribution in terms of evaluating the departure/arrival pattern and the mean travel cost. This study enhances our understanding on the morning commute problem under capacity uncertainty.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-task supply-demand prediction and reliability analysis for docked bike-sharing systems via transformer-encoder-based neural processes,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104015,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"With the rise of sharing economy, bike-sharing systems (BSSs) have gained heated attention, and their operations require accurate prediction of bike usage. Although many deep learning methods have been exploited to predict bike usage, they generally provide point predictions of average bike usage, neglecting the stochasticity in BSSs. Due to the analytically explainable properties and linear computational costs with respect to data size, neural processes (NPs) have recently attracted increasing interest. An NP model learns a Gaussian process (GP) by mapping the input–output observations to a probabilistic distribution over functions. Each function is a distribution of the outputs given an input, conditioned on the arbitrary size of observed data. NPs provide probabilistic confidence in predicted results, which overcomes the point prediction issue faced by other models and provides insights for operational strategies in stochastic scenarios. This paper originally proposes a transformer-encoder-based NP (TENP) model to fit the distribution of bike usage in BSSs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to incorporate transformer encoders into NPs, enhancing the capability of extracting relevant information in a targeted manner. Based on the Citi Bike datasets in New York City, the TENP method is adopted in a multi-task learning task that simultaneously fits the number of pickups and returns. The proposed TENP model outperforms the conventional NP method and its extensions and prevalent machine learning models in terms of prediction accuracy. Armed with the probabilistic confidence provided by the TENP, reliability analysis is conducted, and thoughtful guidance is provided for bike-sharing operations, such as dynamic bike rebalancing.",0968-090X,Not found
How does transport supply and mobility behaviour impact preferences for MaaS bundles?

We extend this work by analysing the influence of transport supply and mobility behaviour on preferences for MaaS bundles in multiple cities. To this end, we conduct a stated preference experiment in 83 cities in Germany. Respondents choose between two MaaS bundle options and one pay-as-you-go option. Besides public transport, we include shared e-scooters and bikes or carsharing and ridepooling in the bundles. To integrate city characteristics we merge this data with supply data from the shared services and data about public transport quality in the respective cities. We find previous shared mobility usage to positively and car usage to negatively influence bundle uptake. While included units are crucial for bundles integrating car-based shared modes, additional prices beyond these units are more important for shared micro-mobility services.

Data from a 2022 online survey collected in Texas is employed to estimate a multivariate joint model. Model estimation results indicate that the most frequent customers of the eat-out channel are white individuals, individuals from 3+ motorized vehicle-owning households, those in non-joint families, those in households with no children, full-time employees who never work from home or do so only for a small fraction of their workdays, and those residing in areas with a high density of restaurants. The distinct consumer segments for the eat-in takeout channel include young individuals, those with high household incomes, those working from home all their workdays or a substantial fraction of their workdays, and urban residents; the most enthusiastic consumers of the eat-in delivery channel are white individuals, those with less than three vehicles in the household, individuals with children, urban residents, and those worried about pandemic-related personal health risks. Older individuals, non-white individuals, individuals with a graduate degree, individuals in fewer motorized vehicle-owning households and in joint families, those with children in the household, and rural residents constitute the most committed population segments of the home-cooked meal (HCM) consumption channel. The results suggest the important impact of workplace location on dining channel choice. The results also show clear evidence of complementary and substitution effects at play; the delivery channel complements eating out but substitutes takeout. Similarly, eat-out has a substitution effect on eat-in takeout. These effects have important implications for activity-travel behavior due to emerging technology-based ordering options for dining choices, especially in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic.",0968-090X,Not found
Capturing positive network attributes during the estimation of recursive logit models: A prism-based approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104014,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Although the recursive logit (RL) model has been recently popular and has led to many applications and extensions, an important numerical issue with respect to the computation of value functions remains unsolved. This issue is particularly significant for model estimation, during which the parameters are updated every iteration and may violate the feasibility condition of the value function. To solve this numerical issue of the value function in the model estimation, this study performs an extensive analysis of a prism-constrained RL (Prism-RL) model proposed by Oyama and Hato (2019), which has a path set constrained by the prism defined based upon a state-extended network representation. The numerical experiments have shown two important properties of the Prism-RL model for parameter estimation. First, the prism-based approach enables estimation regardless of the initial and true parameter values, even in cases where the original RL model cannot be estimated due to the numerical problem. We also successfully captured a positive effect of the presence of street green on pedestrian route choice in a real application. Second, the Prism-RL model achieved better fit and prediction performance than the RL model, by implicitly restricting paths with large detour or many loops. Defining the prism-based path set in a data-oriented manner, we demonstrated the possibility of the Prism-RL model describing more realistic route choice behavior. The capture of positive network attributes while retaining the diversity of path alternatives is important in many applications such as pedestrian route choice and sequential destination choice behavior, and thus the prism-based approach significantly extends the practical applicability of the RL model.",0968-090X,Not found
Dispatching a fleet of electric towing vehicles for aircraft taxiing with conflict avoidance and efficient battery charging,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103995,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Following the Paris Accords, the aviation industry aims to become climate neutral by 2050. In this line, electric vehicles that tow aircraft during taxiing are a promising emerging technology to reduce emissions at airports. This paper proposes an end-to-end optimization framework for electric towing vehicles (ETVs) dispatchment at large airports. We integrate the routing of the ETVs in the taxiway system where minimum separation distances are ensured at all times, with the assignment of these ETVs to aircraft towing tasks and scheduling ETV battery recharging. For ETV recharging, we consider a preemptive charging policy where the charging times depend on the residual state-of-charge of the battery. We illustrate our model for one day of operations at a large European airport. The results show that the 913 arriving and departing flights can be towed with 38 ETVs, with battery charging distributed throughout the day. The fleet size is shown to increase approximately linear with the number of flights in the schedule. We also propose a greedy dispatchment of the ETVs, which is shown to achieve an optimality gap of 6% with respect to the number of required vehicles and with 22% with respect to the maximum delay during towing. We also show that both algorithms can be leveraged to account for flight delays using a rolling horizon approach, and that over 95% of the flights can be reallocated if delays occur. Overall, we propose a roadmap for ETV management at large airports, considering realistic ETV specifications (battery capabilities, kinematic properties) and requirements for aircraft collision avoidance during towing.",0968-090X,Not found
Reliability of the traffic network against cascading failures with individuals acting independently or collectively,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104017,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"The domino-like cascading failures may deteriorate traffic network reliability for both system and users. As the microscopic origin of this dynamic process, route choice behavior should be essential for the pattern of reliability against cascading failures, but the mechanism has not been systematically investigated. To uncover this, we propose a two-level cascading failure model to observe route choice patterns during the evolution of traffic jams: (i) the upper-level depicts how cascading failures spread out in network topologies, while (ii) the lower-level models what paths travelers may select in the trade-off between user equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO). Given nearly-one million OD pairs on large-scale traffic networks, the influence mechanisms of four factors on two reliability indicators are explored. We find that under certain perturbations, staying at the identified critical tolerance is the most profitable for investment yet unstable for reliability. Surprisingly, phase transition patterns are found in different topologies of traffic networks, where the lattice network is the most unreliable. Network reliability is found to increase by modifying travelers’ route choices from independent UE toward collective SO, whereas, the reliability is found to decrease if travelers have stochastic perception errors of travel time or have risk preferences to probabilistic travel time. Furthermore, if the overload failures can be recovered from the failed states, a traffic network may become more reliable. Our finding may help to improve reliability management of future transportation with multiple states between UE and SO.",0968-090X,Not found
A space–time-energy flow-based integer programming model to design and operate a regional shared automated electric vehicle (SAEV) system and corresponding charging network,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103997,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Shared automated vehicles are expected to be part of the supply of transportation systems in the future.

The model is used to assess the impact of vehicle range and different types of chargers in the optimal design of an interurban SAEV transport system in the center of Portugal. Results show a reduction in profit as the vehicle range increases. In regards to energy, it is observed that the adoption of long-range vehicles reduces the energy spent in relocations, and increases the amount of energy charged at a lower price. Additionally, it is found that a system with long-range vehicles does not take advantage of having fast chargers. Concerning the chargers’ optimal location, systems using short-range vehicles have more chargers close to the main commuter trips attracting cities, while systems with long-range vehicles have the chargers nearby the homes of users.",0968-090X,Not found

A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), containing individual and household characteristics and latent attitudes toward car ownership and use alongside life events, was employed to study the interdependences. The temporal relationships among life events and lead-lag effects were also captured in the DBN. The longitudinal survey data “the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN)” from 2013 to 2018 was used to train and test the DBN. The analysis results confirm the dynamic interdependences between vehicle transactions and other life events and reveal noticeable associations between attitudes and purchase decisions. It is found that several life events (e.g., “Birth of a baby”, “Marital status change”) have concurrent or varied lag-effects on vehicle transaction decisions. The validation indicates that the proposed DBN approach has a high predictive accuracy of vehicle transaction decisions and other life events.",0968-090X,Not found
Coordinated lane-changing scheduling of multilane CAV platoons in heterogeneous scenarios,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103992,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"With the development of sensing, communication and automated driving technology, connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are becoming promising solutions for future transport requirements. It is widely believed that a vehicle platoon is a good form to organize urban traffic in the CAV era. Due to the multicommodity nature of urban traffic streams, vehicles will continuously leave and join a multilane platoon, which inevitably gives rise to the need of lane changing within a multilane platoon. This paper studies the coordinated lane-changing scheduling problem in a CAV platoon, with the goal of transferring the platoon from an initial state to a target state to minimize a certain cost measurement (e.g., number of steps), while heterogeneous scenarios are considered. Two approaches, i.e., an exact and an approximate approach, are proposed. For the exact approach, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to identify the global optimal solution. Multiple objective functions are defined to meet the different needs. To relieve the computational issue of the exact approach, we further propose a tree-based heuristic search (THS), an approximate algorithm framework. THS is able to obtain an acceptable solution with negligible computational effort, and has the potential to handle the scheduling problem with more precise modeling or larger platoons. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of different algorithms on both small- and large-scale cases (with up to 60 vehicles in a platoon), and the parameter combinations in the THS are tested for the optimal trade-off between solution quality and computational load. The findings indicate that ILP is practical for small- or medium-scale cases, which can generate multiple optimal solutions for different objectives; THS can solve large-scale cases in milliseconds on an ordinary personal computer, while the acquired solution is verified to be only slightly worse than the global optimum.",0968-090X,Not found
Modified DDPG car-following model with a real-world human driving experience with CARLA simulator,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103987,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"In the autonomous driving field, fusion of human knowledge into Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is often based on the human demonstration recorded in a simulated environment. This limits the generalization and the feasibility of application in real-world traffic. We propose a two-stage DRL method to train a car-following agent, that modifies the policy by leveraging the real-world human driving experience and achieves performance superior to the pure DRL agent. Training a DRL agent is done within CARLA framework with Robot Operating System (ROS). For evaluation, we designed different driving scenarios to compare the proposed two-stage DRL car-following agent with other agents. After extracting the “good” behavior from the human driver, the agent becomes more efficient and reasonable, which makes this autonomous agent more suitable to Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) traffic.",0968-090X,Not found
Bicycle sharing station planning: From free-floating to geo-fencing,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103990,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Bicycle sharing systems (BSSs) are expanding with unparalleled speed all over the world due to various advantages of cycling such as cost effectiveness, environmentally friendliness, capability to bridge other public transport modes and reduce private vehicle usage. One of the latest trend of BSS mode appears to be free-floating, which offers more flexibility in bike rental and return for cyclists in terms of service locations. However, despite the convenience brought by the free-floating BSS to the users, it also causes a headache for the authorities, largely attributed to its poor enforcement on regulating bad user behaviours, which significantly deteriorates the city scape. In order to preserve the benefits of BSSs and meanwhile solve the problems caused by free-floating BSS, this study develops a multi-objective integer non-linear programming (MOINLP) model to convert an existing free-floating BSS into a geo-fence-based one by determining the geo-fencing stations to be opened, their corresponding parking capacities and deployment of bikes. The three objectives of the developed MOINLP model are minimizing monetary cost, user dissatisfaction as well additional first-/last-mile walking distance of users. The MOINLP model is transformed into an equivalent multi-objective integer linear programming (MOILP) model. The augmented ε-constraint method (AUGMECON2) is customized to solve the MOILP model for exact Pareto optimal solutions while a tailored simulation-based heuristic method is proposed to solve large-scale problems.

Identifying the rail operating features associated to intermodal freight rail operation delays,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103993,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Intermodal freight rail operations represent a complex stochastic system that is impacted by disruptions and disturbances from diverse causes like extreme weather events, unplanned upstream network delays, equipment failures, labor actions, and intra-railyard inefficiency, which in turn generate delays in travel times. Understanding and predicting the delays caused by the occurrence of these disruptions and disturbances holds the potential to limit their system-wide schedule impact through early-warning prompting mitigating actions. This paper presents the training of a suite of supervised machine learning models using classification algorithms to predict the delay times caused by the occurrence of disruptions and disturbances in intermodal freight rail operations, and the most suitable model in terms of the evaluation metrics (e.g., AUC, recall, and F1-score) was used to explore the major predictors of the delays caused by disturbances and disruptions (using the Morris method). The supporting dataset includes intermodal freight rail operations with origin the central station of the freight rail network of CFL, the National Railway Company of Luxembourg, in the intermodal hub of Bettembourg, connecting several EU countries terminals forming a pan-European network. Results reveal that the CatBoost implementation of the gradient boosting machine model outperforms other ML models in terms of the selected metrics. Additionally, results suggest that the train weight, train length, number of TEU, weight per wagon, distance between stations, and the month of operation are key features to predict the delays caused by the occurrence of disruptions and disturbances in the freight operations in the studied rail network. The outcome of the study suggests that longer and more heavily loaded trains are related to the occurrence of trip delays, and this insight can be used to optimize the freight operations of the National Railway Company of Luxembourg.",0968-090X,Not found
Temporal equilibrium for electrified ride-sourcing markets considering charging capacity and driving fatigue,10.1016/j.trc.2022.104008,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are now being introduced to the ride-sourcing market to catalyze the realization of sustainable transportation. Given their demand for charging, ride-sourcing EV drivers may have distinct work schedules from gasoline vehicle (GV) drivers, yielding significant impacts on the market supply when their penetration becomes high. Driving fatigue is another factor affecting ride-sourcing drivers’ working hours and work schedules, but has been seldom deliberated. This paper proposes an equilibrium modeling framework based on a time-expanded network to describe the work schedules of EV and GV drivers with the consideration of their driving fatigue and EVs’ charging opportunities subject to the limited charging infrastructure. Specifically, a novel cost formulation is proposed to capture the impact of driving fatigue on drivers’ choices of work schedules. To solve the equilibrium model, we develop a gap function-based method coupled with the column generation scheme in which a non-additive shortest path (NSP) problem appears as a subroutine. A customized multi-objective label correcting algorithm enhanced with several problem-tailored speed-up techniques is then designed to solve the NSP problem efficiently. Experimental results suggest that the speed-up techniques contribute significantly to the reduction of computational time. Numerical examples reveal that the temporal equilibrium of the electrified ride-sourcing market is moderated by the charging capacity, EV penetration as well as the competition among drivers; and driving fatigue may yield considerable impacts on drivers’ work schedules and the market performance.",0968-090X,Not found

The traffic situation awareness method can efficiently calculate the traffic complexity to meet the real-time requirement. The trajectory selection model captures the controller workload accurately and the interactions between traffic flow and strategic conflict managements. Randomized numerical experiments in high-density scenarios are conducted to explore the potential impact of integrating traffic flow and strategic conflict managements. Results show that compared with the existing hierarchical operations method, integrating traffic flow and strategic conflict managements not only significantly improves airspace capacity utilization, but also further reduces the number of trajectory conflicts. The method proposed provides a new reference for developing the operational framework for high-density en-route airspace, in the future TBO context.

Joint scheduling and formation design for modular-vehicle transit service with time-dependent demand,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103986,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"This paper focuses on the operation design of a future public transit service adopting modular vehicles. The unique feature of modular vehicles allows for assembling and disassembling operations along each trip to dynamically adjust the vehicle formation at stations. We propose a mathematical model to determine the optimal scheduling and modular vehicle formation (i.e., capacity adjustment) on a single transit line with time-dependent travel demand. In particular, the limited availability of the modules at stations, as well as the incurred re-balancing cost of the modules during operation, is explicitly considered. The model is originally formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). We then apply exact reformulation techniques to recast the MINLP into an equivalent mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved to its global optimal solution by off-the-shelf solvers. To solve more practical problems with a long planning horizon, we then develop a two-step heuristic that combines a searching algorithm and a rolling horizon approach. The first exact solution method based on MILP reformulation can be used to derive the global optimal solution for the small-size problem, while the heuristic can solve large-size problems efficiently. Numerical studies demonstrate the validity of the formulation and the efficiency of the solution methods. Besides, the experimental results reveal that the timetable and vehicle formations change significantly with the time-dependent demands, and the modular transit services have remarkable advantages in reducing both operator’s and passengers’ costs.",0968-090X,Not found
Network-level signal predictive control with real-time routing information,10.1016/j.trc.2022.104007,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"This paper presents a framework for signalized road network predictive optimization using real-time routing information from connected vehicles (CVs). An important feature of the real-time routing information is the ability of CVs to broadcast the target routes they expect to travel through to the infrastructure in real time while assuming that a majority of the CVs can provide their target routes. A fully movement-level network representation model is proposed to easily describe the traffic state and demand of the signalized network. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model to predict the movement-level network dynamics, which is solved in real time to optimize phase-free movement signal timings. The objective is to maximize the network throughput within the prediction horizon while avoiding queue spillbacks. A decentralized solution algorithm is developed to decompose the network-level problem into intersection-level subproblems, thereby reducing computational complexity. Simulation experiments validate the advantages of the proposed framework over TRANSYT schemes and max pressure-based control strategy in various scenarios. Sensitivity analysis shows the control performance under different traffic demand levels and penetration rates of the target route information.

To address the above issue, this study focuses on optimizing a railway’s comprehensive investment, including the construction and environmental costs, as well as the railway’s life-cycle carbon emission caused by the production of building materials and the trains’ energy consumption. A novel railway alignment optimization model is formulated based on the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework to reduce the railway total cost, accounting for both the construction cost and environmental factors. In the proposed model, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is enhanced with an envelope algorithm that can optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q-values to ensure an efficient consistency between the entire space of preferences in a domain and the corresponding optimal policies.

Subsequently, an algorithm is developed to solve the formulated optimization model by combining the enumeration method and branch and price to address nonlinearity. Finally, a real EB route in Meihekou, Jilin Province, China, is taken as an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To solve this model, a feedback iterative framework consisting of the Lagrangian relaxation and the branch-and-bound algorithm is developed, in which the Lagrangian relaxation aims to generate the train schedule and the branch-and-bound strategy with the constraint updating procedure resolves the potential micro conflicts. Compared with some existing approaches in the literature, the proposed model and solution algorithm have the merit of no requirement of optimization solvers.

Effective coordination of charging and platooning are urgently needed to maximize the benefits of these two technologies, especially considering the current inadequate charging infrastructure, long charging duration, higher energy usage, and tight delivery schedules for long-haul electric freight vehicles (EFVs). In this study, we aim to co-optimize the platooning and charging strategies of EFVs. To achieve this goal, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the total system costs, including en-route charging cost, delivery delay cost, and hub charging cost. The proposed model was tested using a case study of a 595-mile Florida interstate highway route and solved by the state-of-the-art branch-and-cut algorithms, through which we demonstrated the effectiveness of using our model to identify the optimal charging and platooning schedules and quantify the spatial distribution of charging demand and platoon energy savings.

To this end, the paper first develops an algorithm for minimizing the lane change time of a single CAV. This algorithm is then successively applied to all lane-changing CAVs. As a special feature, the proposed algorithm analytically computes CAV reference trajectories based on a second-order vehicle model such that all computations can be carried out in real time.

UAS has been instrumental in the recent pNEUMA experiment, where a swarm of drones collected a large-scale urban traffic dataset containing vehicle trajectories. These trajectory data are subject to challenges such as noise due to visual restrictions, perspective distortions, and human-induced errors. While the pNEUMA dataset is missing its imagery part, we present an extended version of it named pNEUMA Vision, which incorporates imagery data and annotations of vehicles in the form of image coordinates along with newly added vehicle trajectory features like azimuth. Moreover, we demonstrate that visually restricted trajectories are also highly prone to become anomalies, and vice-versa, through novel anomaly detection proposed in this literature. Specifically, we distinguish between stationary and non-stationary errors and argue that the latter account for the largest part of the noise. Furthermore, we analyze the new visual dataset with two different computer vision methods for estimating the number of vehicles on the roads from the input images. Particularly, we show that using a density map to count vehicles from drone images achieves comparable results to conventional vehicle counting methods via detection.

Second, the probability distribution of the CAVs platoon size is derived based on the Markov chain model. Subsequently, the capacity model and stability condition of mixed traffic flow are proposed based on the probability distribution of the CAVs platoon size, and some characteristics of the influence of the maximum platoon size on traffic capacity and stability are analyzed. A numerical experiment based on car-following models was conducted to investigate the effect of the maximum platoon size on capacity, stability, safety, fuel consumption, and emission of mixed traffic flow. The results show that (1) the capacity of mixed traffic flow increases with the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (2) the stability of mixed traffic flow deteriorates with the increase in the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (3) the safety risk of vehicles in mixed traffic flow increases with the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (4) the fuel consumption and emissions (e.g., CO, HC, and NOx) increase with the maximum platoon size of CAVs.

Improving short-term bike sharing demand forecast through an irregular convolutional neural network,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103984,147,2023-02-01,2023,2,"As an important task for the management of bike sharing systems, accurate forecast of travel demand could facilitate dispatch and relocation of bicycles to improve user satisfaction. In recent years, many deep learning algorithms have been introduced to improve bicycle usage forecast. A typical practice is to integrate convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture spatial–temporal dependency in historical travel demand. For typical CNN, the convolution operation is conducted through a kernel that moves across a “matrix-format” city to extract features over spatially adjacent urban areas. This practice assumes that areas close to each other could provide useful information that improves prediction accuracy. However, bicycle usage in neighboring areas might not always be similar, given spatial variations in built environment characteristics and travel behavior that affect cycling activities. Yet, areas that are far apart can be relatively more similar in temporal usage patterns. To utilize the hidden linkage among these distant urban areas, the study proposes an irregular convolutional Long-Short Term Memory model (IrConv+LSTM) to improve short-term bike sharing demand forecast. The model modifies traditional CNN with irregular convolutional architecture to leverage the hidden linkage among “semantic neighbors”. The proposed model is evaluated with a set of benchmark models in five study sites, which include one dockless bike sharing system in Singapore, and four station-based systems in Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York, and London.

Two approaches are developed to solve the problem, namely a branch-and-price algorithm as well as a two-stage meta-heuristic. We evaluate the performance of each solution approach, and also assess the value of integrating the assignment, scheduling and routing decisions versus solving these problems sequentially. Computational studies demonstrate that our multi-objective model can bring about savings in healthcare costs and improve the compatibility between nurses and patients. These studies also demonstrate that solutions with increased compatibility do not necessarily come at a price of increased healthcare costs.

This strategy provides a convenient way to mitigate urban congestion by manipulating vehicular movements across homogeneous regions without modeling the detailed behaviors and interactions involved with individual vehicle presence. In particular, multi-region perimeter metering control holds promise for efficient traffic management in large-scale urban networks. However, most existing methods for multi-region control require knowledge of either the environment traffic dynamics or network properties (i.e., the critical accumulations), whereas such information is generally difficult to obtain and subject to significant estimation errors. The recently developed model-free techniques, on the other hand, have not yet been shown scalable or applicable to large urban networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a scalable model-free scheme based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The proposed scheme features value function decomposition in the paradigm of centralized training with decentralized execution, coupled with critical advances of single-agent deep reinforcement learning and problem reformulation guided by domain expertise. Comprehensive experiment results on a seven-region urban network suggest the scheme is: (a) effective, with consistent convergence to final control outcomes that are comparable to the model predictive control method; (b) resilient, with superior learning and control efficacy in the presence of inaccurate input information from the environment; and (c) transferable, with sufficient implementation prospect as well as real time applicability to unencountered environments featuring increased uncertainty.",0968-090X,Not found

To understand the statistical properties of the system, a queueing approximation method is proposed to compute the network accumulation variance. It is found that (i) the accumulation variance is much larger than predicted by traditional queueing models, due to the nonlinear dynamics imposed by the MFD, (ii) the trip-length distribution has no effect on the accumulation variance, indicating that a proposed formula for the variance might be universal, and (iii) the system exhibits critical behavior near the capacity state where the accumulation variance diverges.

Conducting inspections every year is unnecessary and will decrease the budget for M&R activities, while infrequent inspections may lead to suboptimal M&R planning due to the lack of accurate information. This paper presents a methodology for jointly optimizing the inspection scheduling and M&R planning for pavement systems, considering model uncertainty and facility-specific heterogeneity. The problem is defined as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model, accounting for the tradeoff between the information value and inspection costs. Moreover, a statistical learning method is used to update the prediction of pavement conditions using the collected inspection data and, eventually, improve the condition-based decisions. This “belief update” process can gradually reduce the model uncertainty as the dataset size increases. We demonstrate the proposed stochastic optimization framework through a numerical example with a system of fifty heterogenous pavement facilities under a combined budget for inspection and M&R activities. Several managerial insights and implications are discussed. For example, the optimal inspection frequencies are less sensitive to the budget; and the agency should perform fewer reconstructions and more rehabilitations when the budget is limited.",0968-090X,Not found

Many existing ACC and CACC control models focus on three strategies that can indirectly mitigate congestions and damp traffic shockwaves: time headway suppression, stability improvement, and adaptive mode-switching control based on traffic conditions. Although congestion mitigation and shockwave damping are achievable with those control strategies, the improvement is often limited to the by-product effect of their main control objectives of headway suppression and system stability. Many adaptive models also need to calibrate many parameters for different road conditions. This paper proposes a new ACC and CACC framework that directly integrates the congestion shockwave damping and traffic congestion mitigation into the objective function of a dynamic control framework. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) based dynamic optimization framework is proposed to balance the trade-offs among multiple objectives, including safety, efficiency, shockwave, elasticity, and driver’s comfort. The proposed framework is applied in both ACC and CACC platoons mixed with manual vehicles, and five different control models are explored. The stability conditions of the proposed models are derived analytically and analyzed numerically. Three experimental studies, including platoon, ring-road, and traffic simulation studies, indicate promising results of proposed models in reducing shockwave propagation speed and mitigating traffic congestion under different environments compared with existing ACC and CACC models.",0968-090X,Not found
Train following model for urban rail transit performance analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104037,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"In this paper we introduce a mesoscopic Train Following Model which accurately captures train interactions and predicts delays based on spacing between consecutive trains. The Train Following Model is applied recursively block by block estimating train trajectories given initial conditions (i.e. the trajectory of an initial train and dispatching headways of following trains from the terminal station). We validate the proposed model using data from the Red Line of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The results indicate that it accurately represents train operations under both normal and disrupted conditions. Based on the model developed, the impacts of factors such as service frequency, headway variations, passenger demand, and initial train delays on line performance (i.e. line throughput and train knock-on delays) are explored. The proposed Train Following Model is generic and can be developed based on readily available historical train tracking data. It is not as resource intensive as micro simulation models, while it can efficiently address the drawbacks of macro-scale analytical models and complex discrete algebraic models. The proposed model can be used to predict system performance either off-line or in real-time.",0968-090X,Not found
Assessing the willingness of Australian households for adopting home charging stations for electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104034,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The objective of this study is to understand what factors drive household decisions to install electric vehicle charging infrastructure at home. To this end, we administrated an online questionnaire to 1,199 households drawn from across the state of New South Wales in Australia, who were asked to complete one of two discrete choice experiments (DCEs). The DCEs were customized based upon the type of property the recruited respondents reside in, with this being either a separate private dwelling (i.e., house) or a house/apartment belonging to a building complex. A Logit Mixed Logit model (Train, 2016), a non-parametric version of the traditional random effects discrete choice model, is used to analyse the data obtained from the two DCEs. The empirical findings suggest that both sampled populations positively value the opportunity to endow their property with EV home charging points, with those who live within apartment buildings clearly preferring having access to private charging as opposed to communal charging.",0968-090X,Not found
Tolls vs tradable permits for managing travel on a bimodal congested network with variable capacities and demands,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104028,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Congestion pricing has long been considered an efficient tool for tackling road traffic congestion, but tolls are generally unpopular. Interest is growing in tradable permits as an alternative. Tolls and tradable permits are interchangeable if travel conditions are unchanging, but not if conditions vary and tolls and permit quantities are inflexible and cannot be adapted to current conditions. We compare the allocative efficiency of tolls and tradable permits on a bimodal network under uncertainty. Road links are congestion prone and public transit may be crowded. Road traffic entering a cordon area around the downtown is controlled using either a toll or a tradable permit. Two groups of travelers can drive or take transit. Group 1 travels downtown, and if it drives it must either pay the toll or use a permit. Group 2 travels to a suburb, and can avoid the cordon by taking a bypass. All demand and cost parameters of the model can vary, either systematically or irregularly. Each parameter combination constitutes a state. Travelers learn the state in advance, and adapt their mode and route choices accordingly. A planner minimizes expected total travel costs by either setting the level of the toll or choosing the quota of permits to distribute. Two cases are considered. In the first, the toll and quota are flexible and can be adjusted to daily travel conditions. In the second, the instruments are inflexible and must be set at the same level regardless of the state. If travelers have identical preferences, the optimal flexible toll is invariant to the numbers of travelers in each group and the capacity of the link entering the cordon. The toll is robust in the sense that inflexibility causes no welfare loss if these parameters vary. By contrast, the quota is not robust. We derive a general rule for ranking the efficiency of a fixed toll and fixed quota. We then explore a numerical example. In most instances, the fixed toll outperforms the fixed quota by a significant margin although the quota can do better in some states. We also compare the welfare-distributional effects of tolls and permits, and find that suburban travelers fare better than downtown travelers from both forms of regulation.",0968-090X,Not found
A pure number to assess “congestion” in pedestrian crowds,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104041,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The development of technologies for reliable tracking of pedestrian trajectories in public spaces has recently enabled collecting large data sets and real-time information about the usage of urban space and indoor facilities by human crowds. Such an information, nevertheless, may be properly used only with the aid of theoretical and computational tools to assess the state of the crowd. As shown in this work, traditional assessment metrics such as density and flow may provide only a partial information, since it is also important to understand how “regular” these flows are, as spatially uniform flows are arguably less problematic than strongly fluctuating ones. Recently, the Congestion Level ( C L ), based on the computation of spatial variation of the rotor of the crowd velocity field, has been proposed as an assessment metric to evaluate the state of the crowd. Nevertheless, the C L definition was lacking sound theoretical foundations and, more importantly, was of very difficult interpretation (it was difficult to understand “what” C L was measuring). As we believe that such theoretical shortcomings were limiting also its relevance to applied studies, in this work we clarify some aspects concerning the C L definition, and we show that such an assessment metric may be improved by defining a dimensionless Congestion Number ( C N ). As a first application of the newly defined C N indicator we first focus on the cross-flow scenario and, by using discrete and continuous toy models, idealised “limit scenarios”, more realistic simulations and finally data from experiments with human participants, we show that C N ≪ 1 corresponds to a crowd with a regular and safe motion (even in high density and high flow settings), while C N ≈ 1 indicates the emergence of a congested and possibly dangerous condition. We finally use the C N indicator to analyse and discuss different settings such as bottlenecks, uni-, bi- and multi-directional flows, and real-world data concerning the movement of pedestrians in the world’s busiest railway station.",0968-090X,Not found
Unified framework for over-damped string stable adaptive cruise control systems,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104039,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Many recent experiments have shown that the current commercially available adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems demonstrate string instability phenomena. The lower-level time-lag, the sensor time-delay, and the input disturbance primarily contribute to such instability. This paper presents a unified strategy to design ACC systems compensating the lower-level time-lag, the sensor time-delay, and the input disturbance, by fulfilling the over-damped string stability criterion for homogeneous platoons. The over-damped feature associated with string stability explicitly addresses the safety of a platoon in a stricter sense, considering the transient convergence effects, such as over-shoot, under-shoot, and oscillations, and satisfying all the L p stability norms, where p ∈ 1 , ∞ . In this article, the derived over-damped string-stable strategy compensating lag, delay, and disturbance (OSSCLDD) is presented in a general unified form that applies to any linear or convex velocity-dependent spacing functions. The derived strategy is demonstrated and validated via simulation using a linear constant time gap spacing function and two nonlinear spacing functions, namely, the variable time gap and the quadratic range spacing function.",0968-090X,Not found
A deep generative model for feasible and diverse population synthesis,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104053,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"An agent-based model (ABM) simulates actions and interactions of the synthetic agents to understand the system-level behaviour. The synthetic population, the key input to ABM, mimics the distribution of the individual-level attributes in the actual population. Since individual-level attributes of the entire population are unavailable, small-scale samples are generally used for population synthesis. Synthesizing the population by directly sampling from the small-scale samples ignores the possible attribute combinations that are observed in the actual population but do not exist in the small-scale samples, called ‘sampling zeros’. A deep generative model (DGM) can potentially synthesize the sampling zeros but at the expense of falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that should be ‘zero’ in the generated data but exist, called ‘structural zeros’. This study proposes a novel method to ensure that the generation of structural zeros is minimal while recovering the ignored sampling zeros. Two loss functions for regularizing the DGMs are devised to customize the training and applied to a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a variational autoencoder (VAE). The adopted metrics for feasibility and diversity of the synthetic population indicate the capability of generating sampling and structural zeros – lower generation probability of structural zeros and lower generation probability of sampling zeros indicate the higher feasibility and the lower diversity, respectively. Results show that the proposed loss functions achieve considerable performance improvement in the feasibility and diversity of the synthesized population over traditional models. The proposed VAE additionally generated 23.5 % of the population ignored by the sample with 79.2 % precision (i.e., the generation ratio of structural zeros and the total samples is 20.8 %), while the proposed GAN generated 18.3 % of the ignored population with 89.0 % precision. The proposed improvement in DGM generates a more feasible and diverse synthetic population. Since synthesizing the population is the first stage of ABM, the proposed approach improves the overall accuracy of the ABM by circumventing the error propagation to later modelling stages.",0968-090X,Not found
Pickup and delivery with lockers,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104022,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"We define a pickup and delivery routing problem with time windows that arises in last-mile delivery.

The returned parcels can be picked up directly at the customers’ homes or at a locker. Customers can select home service, self-service at one of the nearby lockers with a discount, or let the logistics company decide. All services must be performed within a given time window.

By leveraging general-purpose computing on graphics processing units and combining continuous and discrete elements in an integrated fashion, we can simulate and evaluate multiple trajectory options under multiple scenarios in parallel, allowing us to provide quick iterations to a stochastic optimization algorithm.

Leveraging connected vehicle platooning technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of train fleeting under moving blocks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104026,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This paper leverages emerging highway vehicle platooning technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fleeting trains at minimum headways under moving blocks. The research aims to better understand how closely following trains respond to different throttle and brake control algorithms, and, using insights gained from automobile and truck platooning technology, develop improved train control algorithms balancing fuel efficiency and train headway. To do so, a detailed multi-train performance simulator is developed to evaluate following train control algorithms and then adapt highway vehicle platooning control methods to the heavy haul freight rail domain. Five following train control algorithms under two different communication topologies are formulated to more intelligently consider information on the status of the train ahead when specifying throttle or brake settings for each following train. With string stability, following trains attenuate the actions of preceding trains and each successive train requires less aggressive acceleration and braking rates to maintain headways. The simulation results suggest that certain families of control laws are better than others at managing train separation and fuel consumption within train fleets. The results of this research will allow industry practitioners to develop improved locomotive driver advisory and semi-autonomous adaptive train cruise control systems for the operation of fleets of trains under moving blocks, and railroad operators to make more informed decisions regarding the potential fuel efficiency and capacity benefits of these systems.",0968-090X,Not found
A deep reinforcement learning based distributed control strategy for connected automated vehicles in mixed traffic platoon,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104019,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This paper proposes an innovative distributed longitudinal control strategy for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in the mixed traffic environment of CAV and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), incorporating high-dimensional platoon information. For mixed traffic, the traditional CAV control method focuses on microscopic trajectory information, which may not be efficient in handling the HDV stochasticity (e.g., long reaction time; various driving styles) and mixed traffic heterogeneities. Different from traditional methods, our method, for the first time, characterizes consecutive HDVs as a whole (i.e., AHDV) to reduce the HDV stochasticity and utilize its macroscopic features to control the following CAVs. The new control strategy takes advantage of platoon information to anticipate the disturbances and traffic features induced downstream under mixed traffic scenarios and greatly outperforms the traditional methods. In particular, the control algorithm is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to fulfill car-following control efficiency and further address the stochasticity for the aggregated car following behavior by embedding it in the training environment. To better utilize the macroscopic traffic features, a general platoon of mixed traffic is categorized as a CAV-HDVs-CAV pattern and described by corresponding DRL states. The macroscopic traffic flow properties are built upon the Newell car-following model to capture the characteristics of aggregated HDVs' joint behaviors. Simulated experiments are conducted to validate our proposed strategy. The results demonstrate that the proposed control method has outstanding performances in terms of oscillation dampening, eco-driving, and generalization capability.",0968-090X,Not found
Decentralized motion planning for intelligent bus platoon based on hierarchical optimization framework,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104025,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Intelligent bus platoon effectively meets the high demand for public transport during rush hours.

A high-order hidden Markov model for dynamic decision analysis of multi-homing ride-sourcing drivers,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104031,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Ride-sourcing drivers enjoy flexibility in scheduling work hours and choosing platforms, which generates multi-homing behavior on multiple platforms. It is challenging to observe the labor supply of multi-homing ride-sourcing drivers due to data limitations, which motivates our research on modeling drivers' dynamic decisions on labor supply in the competitive ride-sourcing market with multiple platforms. We propose a dynamic discrete choice framework by modeling drivers' high-frequency decision sequences on platform switching as high-order hidden Markov processes and considering time-varying factors. The high-order hidden Markov framework relaxes the first-order Markovian assumption and builds interdependencies of unobserved states across multiple time periods. The estimation of the proposed model takes advantage of city-scale multiple platforms datasets in Hangzhou, China, including more than 16 million records of the order payment information and more than 46 thousand records of active ride-sourcing drivers' information. The case study results indicate that the high-order hidden Markov model (HO-HMM) has superior explanatory power in fitting multiple platforms datasets than the multinomial logit model and the first-order hidden Markov model. HO-HMM performs an advantage in modeling the extended historical dependency of drivers' decisions and individual driver behavior modeling with high interpretability. The results uncover the variations of drivers' attitudes in different hidden (unobservable) states and towards different platforms. In general, ride-sourcing drivers respond actively and positively to income and working time. The findings support the platforms' decision-making on pricing, reward, and personalized management of ride-sourcing drivers, and provide beneficial suggestions for improving income in the competitive ride-sourcing market.",0968-090X,Not found
A Bayesian clustering ensemble Gaussian process model for network-wide traffic flow clustering and prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104032,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Traffic flow prediction is an essential component in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, there has been a notable trend in applying machine learning models, especially deep learning, for network-wide traffic prediction. However, existing studies have limitations on model interpretability, model generalization, and over-reliance on image data processing or fine-designed deep learning structures for extracting traffic attributes. This paper attempts to tackle these limitations by proposing a Bayesian clustering ensemble Gaussian process (BCEGP) model for network-wide traffic flow clustering and prediction. The model utilizes a subset-based Dirichlet process mixture (SDPM) model to conduct a hard clustering among input data; then, within each cluster, it adopts the Gaussian Process (GP) to learn the probability relationship between inputs and outputs. During the prediction phase, the model conducts a soft clustering of the input as weights, and makes predictions via a weighted average of GPs’ outputs. The merits of the BCEGP model include: (a) data with similar spatial–temporal patterns are clustered, which helps understand traffic dynamics in a non-Euclidean and non-graphical manner that enhances information extracting for model development; (b) GPs provide analytically trackable functions/gradients of predicted traffic flows with features and reveal variances of predicted traffic flow, enhancing model applicability and interpretability to some extent; (c) the model incorporates an ensemble learning framework that achieves great generalization performance as good as deep learning models; (d) the subset-based clustering and cluster-based GP learning are conducted parallelly, and thus vastly accelerate the training efficiency compared with conventional GPs (but slower than deep learning models). We test the performance of the proposed model based on both synthesized and real-world datasets. For comparison, several widely used machine learning and deep learning models are trained under the real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that the BCEGP model performs well in predictive accuracy, computational speed, and applicability, which can be a promising method for transportation problems.",0968-090X,Not found

However, they are currently isolated and can only extract information from each of their fixed views. To track vehicles across multiple cameras and help public agencies collect link travel time and speed information, an Edge-empowered Cooperative Multi-camera Sensing (ECoMS) System is proposed. ECoMS system presents a novel algorithmic and edge-server cooperative system construct to push edge computing and multi-camera re-identification workflow serving for traffic sensing based on Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. On the algorithm side, ECoMS system proposes a featherlight edge-based computer vision framework for vehicle detection, tracking, and features selection process in a real-time manner.

Furthermore, a hierarchical clip-based deep vehicle re-identification framework is proposed and integrated into the ECoMS system, and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by 4%–8% on Rank-1 accuracy. Finally, to balance the accuracy level of different camera pairs, a collaborative cross-camera traffic information estimation framework based on kernel density estimation with kernel smoother is implemented, which can get the precise link and region traffic information together with distributions (less than 1.01 KL distance). By maximizing the cooperation of the computational resources, orchestrating the data transmission and integrating road network graph features in the system, the ECoMS can precisely model the network-scale traffic information in a flexible, cost-effective, and scalable workflow.

This study investigates the trade-off in cost and capacity effects of automated vehicles when a social planner decides the optimal fleet mix for serving a given network demand. We present a system optimal assignment problem that is a non-linear program with linear constraints. Using second-order analysis, we label each link of the network as either “convex” or “concave”. The classification is done prior to any traffic assignment and is independent of demand patterns. According to the classification, a social planner benefits from increasing (decreasing) the automated vehicle ratio of traffic in convex (concave) links. We show that the proposed system optimal problem is non-convex and develop a Benders decomposition algorithm with a master problem that decides path flows and a sub-problem that finds the optimal automated vehicle ratio of each path. We further discuss the system optimal properties in three stylized networks with parallel, series, and mixed topology, and a larger Sioux Falls network. Results show that in parallel networks, the convex (concave) links have an automated vehicle ratio of one (zero), whereas in series networks, the optimal automated vehicle ratios depend on several network parameters.",0968-090X,Not found

A deep reinforcement learning approach for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103981,148,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in learning quality solutions in many combinatorial optimization problems.

Unfortunately, they perform poorly for the TSP with Drone (TSP-D), requiring routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles in coordination—a truck and a drone. In TSP-D, the two vehicles are moving in tandem and may need to wait at a node for the other vehicle to join. State-less attention-based decoder fails to make such coordination between vehicles. We propose a hybrid model that uses an attention encoder and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network decoder, in which the decoder’s hidden state can represent the sequence of actions made. We empirically demonstrate that such a hybrid model improves upon a purely attention-based model for both solution quality and computational efficiency. Our experiments on the min-max Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (mmCVRP) also confirm that the hybrid model is more suitable for the coordinated routing of multiple vehicles than the attention-based model.

Prediction of estimated time of arrival for multi-airport systems via “Bubble” mechanism,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104065,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Predicting Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for a Multi-Airport System (MAS) is much more challenging than for a single airport system because of complex air route structure, dense air traffic volume and vagaries of traffic conditions in an MAS. In this work, we propose a novel “Bubble” mechanism to accurately predict medium-term ETA for a Multi-Airport System (MAS), in which the prediction of travel time of an origin–destination (OD) pair is decomposed into two stages, termed as out-MAS and in-MAS stages. For the out-MAS stage, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is used to predict the travel time of a flight to reach the MAS boundary. For the in-MAS stage, we construct new spatio-temporal features based on clustering analysis of trajectory patterns facilitated by a novel data-driven hybrid polar sampling method. A sequence-to-sequence prediction model, Multi-variate Stacked Fully connected Bidirectional Long–Short Term Memory, is further developed to achieve multi-step-ahead predictions of in-MAS travel time for each trajectory pattern using the spatio-temporal features as input. Finally, the medium-term ETA prediction for an MAS is achieved by integrating the out-MAS and in-MAS prediction with the help of trajectory pattern prediction via random forest. A case study of predicting medium-term ETA for a typical MAS in China, Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, is conducted to demonstrate the usage and promising performance of the proposed method in comparison to several commonly used end-to-end learning methods.",0968-090X,Not found
An ADMM-based dual decomposition mechanism for integrating crew scheduling and rostering in an urban rail transit line,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104081,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The crew planning problem is a key step in the urban rail transit (URT) planning process and has a critical impact on the operational efficiency of a URT line. In general, the crew planning problem consists of two subproblems, crew scheduling and crew rostering, which are usually solved in a sequential manner. Such an approach may, however, lead to a poor-quality crew plan overall. We therefore study the integrated optimization of crew scheduling and crew rostering and propose an effective dual decomposition approach. In particular, we formulate the integrated problem as an integer programming model using a space–time-state network representation, where the objective of the model is to minimize the weighted sum of total travel cost and penalties associated with imbalances in the workloads of the crew members. Then, an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based dual decomposition mechanism that decomposes the model into a set of independent crew member-specific subproblems is introduced, where each of these subproblems is efficiently solved by a tailored time-dependent shortest path algorithm. To improve the performance of ADMM approach, two enhancement strategies are also designed to accelerate convergence. A set of real-life instances based on a rail transit line in Chengdu, China, is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Computational results show that the ADMM-based approach with enhancements significantly outperforms a conventional Lagrangian Relaxation-based approach, yielding improved convergence and significantly smaller optimality gaps. Finally, on a set of real-life instances, the proposed ADMM-based approach with enhancements obtains an optimality gap of, on average, 4.2%. This is substantially better than Lagrangian Relaxation, which provides optimality gaps of, on average, 34.73%.",0968-090X,Not found
System-level impacts of en-route information sharing considering adaptive routing,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104075,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication have great potential to improve traffic safety and mobility at intersection and road segment levels. However, since transportation is an interconnected network, local transportation state change could lead to broader impacts by rerouting. In this study, we focus on investigating the impacts of en-route locational information updates on the system-level safety and mobility considering adaptive routing of CAVs. We propose a novel two-stage stochastic traffic equilibrium model to characterize the equilibrium traffic patterns considering adaptive routing behavior when en-route traffic information is provided. The proposed methodology is tested using the Orlando transportation network with real traffic and accident data.

Proactive route choice with real-time information: Learning and effects of network complexity and cognitive load,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104035,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Proactive route choice refers to a driver’s taking into account future diversion possibilities enabled by real-time information in a network with random travel times. Route choice experiments were conducted in three types of networks with increasing complexity, where the simplest one has no diversion possibilities and is used to gauge risk attitude. Two apparatuses with different cognitive load, a driving simulator and PC were used. Aggregate analyses show that network complexity negatively affects subjects’ ratio of choosing the risky option on a driving simulator; cognitive load negatively affects subject’s ratio of choosing the risky option in the simplest network, but not in more complex networks. A mixed Logit model with two latent classes, proactive and myopic, is specified and estimated. Results show that subjects learn to be more proactive over time.

A multi-objective rolling horizon personnel routing and scheduling approach for natural disasters,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104029,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The magnitude of the workload associated with the provision of emergency response services in the aftermath of natural disasters, coupled with limited availability of personnel for providing these services, leads to demand–supply imbalances with detrimental effects on the provision of the required services. In this context, personnel routing and scheduling decisions aim to meet the demand as fast as possible while at the same time they ensure fair provision of services among the impacted areas. Due to their excessive working hours, and their travel over unreliable transportation networks, personnel are prone to burnout effects and are exposed to risks derived from the unreliable condition of the disaster impacted transportation networks. To address these issues, we propose a novel Disaster Response Personnel Routing and Scheduling (DRPRS) model with efficiency, fairness and risk objectives, subject to working and resting related constraints. The proposed model can be applied to routing and scheduling decisions for different types of emergency response services, and takes into account the precedence relations among them. We solve the resulting multi-objective model lexicographically over a rolling horizon sequentially on a daily basis until the demand for all types of services considered is satisfied. We report results from the application of the proposed model for routing and scheduling personnel involved in the provision of evacuation and medical services in the context of 2018 Lombok Earthquake, Indonesia.",0968-090X,Not found
A deep inverse reinforcement learning approach to route choice modeling with context-dependent rewards,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104079,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Route choice modeling is a fundamental task in transportation planning and demand forecasting. Classical methods generally adopt the discrete choice model (DCM) framework with linear utility functions and high-level route characteristics. While several recent studies have started to explore the applicability of deep learning for route choice modeling, they are all path-based with relatively simple model architectures and require choice set generation. Existing link-based models can capture the dynamic nature of link choices within the trip without the need for choice set generation, but still assume linear relationships and link-additive features. To address these issues, this study proposes a general deep inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework for link-based route choice modeling, which is capable of incorporating diverse features (of the state, action and trip context) and capturing complex relationships. Specifically, we adapt an adversarial IRL model to the route choice problem for efficient estimation of context-dependent reward functions without value iteration. Experiment results based on taxi GPS data from Shanghai, China validate the superior prediction performance of the proposed model over conventional DCMs and other imitation learning baselines, even for destinations unseen in the training data. Further analysis shows that the model exhibits competitive computational efficiency and reasonable interpretability. The proposed methodology provides a new direction for future development of route choice models. It is general and can be adaptable to other route choice problems across different modes and networks.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic tradable credit scheme for multimodal urban networks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104061,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"A Tradable Credit Scheme (TCS) is a demand management policy aiming for more sustainable travel behavior. The regulator defines the total credit cap and the credit distribution; it also determines the credit charges for each travel alternative at different times of the day, which modifies the perceived users’ costs. The credit price is determined by trading of credits between travelers. Defining the credit scheme at the urban level and estimating its impacts on user travel decisions and the network congestion dynamics is challenging. We propose a framework wherein travelers change their departure times and choose between solo car driving, Public Transportation (PT), and carpooling to complete their trips under a dynamic TCS, meaning the credit charge is time-dependent. A multimodal macroscopic traffic simulator based on a generalized bathtub model captures the congestion dynamics for the different transport modes. Additionally, we consider different values of time, trip lengths, and desired arrival times for the demand profile. The proposed TCS minimizes the total travel cost, (the sum of all travelers’ travel costs) and the carbon emissions by solving an optimization problem through an iterative method, including an inner loop that updates the users’ choices and credit price under the stochastic user equilibrium principle; and an outer loop that updates the credit charge profile. The methodology is implemented and applied to a realistic test case in Lyon (France). The dynamic TCS profiles result in 36% fewer carbon emissions than static TCS for a total travel cost reduction of 19%. Besides, 94% of the travelers benefit from the TCS as their user costs decrease in the case study. The final results are compared with a more advanced simulation framework, which is too computationally expensive to find the optimal TCS.

Intelligent vehicle pedestrian light (IVPL): A deep reinforcement learning approach for traffic signal control,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103991,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely studied in traffic signal control. Despite the promising results that indicate the superiority of deep RL in terms of the quality of solution and optimality over fixed time signal control, the real-world multi-modal traffic flows, especially pedestrians, are not properly considered nor sufficiently investigated. This study presents a novel deep RL-based adaptive traffic signal model to control the vehicles and pedestrian flows by allocating an equitable green time to each, aiming at minimizing “total user delays” as opposed to “total vehicle delays” dominantly being used in the literature. Our proposed intelligent vehicle pedestrian light (IVPL) method can perform in the absence or presence of pedestrians, especially when there is jaywalking at the intersection, interrupting vehicle flows. To this end, an extended reward function is designed to capture delays due to vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-pedestrian, and pedestrian-to-pedestrian interactions, as well as red-light delays for vehicles and pedestrians. To evaluate the performance of IVPL, a microsimulation model of an intersection in city of Melbourne is used as a case-study. The real traffic signal parameters of an existing operation system (SCATS) are employed, and the simulation is calibrated using video-based camera data and loop detectors data collected at intersection. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over fully actuated traffic signal, not only in terms of the quality of optimal solution, but also considering the fact that the proposed model can minimize the “total user delays”.",0968-090X,Not found

We propose three stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) models representing different performance measures important to food banks, namely maximizing efficiency, maximizing equity, and maximizing efficiency and equity simultaneously. To solve practical large-scale instances, we develop an original matheuristic based on adaptive large-scale neighborhood search. Using real-world data based on real-life instances, we conduct an extensive numerical experiment to assess the computational performance of our approach and derive insights relevant to food banks.

Predictive trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles at intersections using reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104063,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"In this work we put forward a predictive trajectory planning framework to help autonomous vehicles plan future trajectories. We develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to model this sequential decision making problem, and a deep reinforcement learning solution methodology to learn high-quality policies. The POMDP model utilizes driving scenarios, condensed into graphs, as inputs. More specifically, an input graph contains information on the history trajectory of the subject vehicle, predicted trajectories of other agents in the scene (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists), as well as predicted risk levels posed by surrounding vehicles to devise safe, comfortable, and energy-efficient trajectories for the subject vehicle to follow. In order to obtain sufficient driving scenarios to use as training data, we propose a simulation framework to generate socially acceptable driving scenarios using a real world autonomous vehicle dataset. The simulation framework utilizes Bayesian Gaussian mixture models to learn trajectory patterns of different agent types, and Gibbs sampling to ensure that the distribution of simulated scenarios matches that of the real-world dataset collected by an autonomous fleet. We evaluate the proposed work in two complex urban driving environments: a non-signalized T-junction and a non-signalized lane merge intersection. Both environments provide vastly more complex driving scenarios compared to a highway driving environment, which has been mostly the focus of previous studies. The framework demonstrates promising performance for planning horizons as long as five seconds. We compare safety, comfort, and energy efficiency of the planned trajectories against human-driven trajectories in both experimental driving environments, and demonstrate that it outperforms human-driven trajectories in a statistically significant fashion in all aspects.",0968-090X,Not found

In this paper, to enhance train timetable adherence and reduce energy consumption, we provide a hierarchical optimal control framework for the automatic train regulation problem with energy-efficient speed trajectory based on the model predictive control method. Specifically, by considering the dynamic passenger flows, the non-linear train regulation model is proposed at the higher level to enhance timetable adherence, while at the lower level the energy-efficient speed trajectories of the trains are generated on-line in a distributed manner. The interaction of real-time information exists between the higher level and the lower level, i.e., the upper model provides the train running time and the numbers of onboard passengers to the lower model, while the lower model feedbacks the updated train information (e.g., the actual arrival time) to the upper model, which provides the potential for the proposed framework to respond to disturbances at the operational stage. Moreover, a customized model predictive control method combined with Radau pseudospectral method (RPM) is designed to generate the energy-efficient train speed trajectory at the lower level in response to uncertain operational conditions.

SESAR has proposed the concept of Extended-Arrival MANagement (E-AMAN), which aims to plan the arrival streams from an earlier stage in order to achieve delay absorption and earlier planning in the en-route phases of flights. Based on this concept, we address a dynamic/on-line air traffic control problem to provide control decisions for flights in order to achieve safety and efficiency during arrival. The dynamic feature is realized by periodically updating the flight information for aircraft trajectory predictions. Sub-problems corresponding to each information update are established. The objective of this problem is to minimize the weighted sum of route congestion and the conflict resolution workload in the enroute segment, and the number of conflicts in the TMA (Terminal Maneuvering Area). A dynamic weight assignment approach is applied for ensuring that as an aircraft get closer to the TMA, its weight for TMA metrics increases accordingly.

They can further function as distributed energy storage units. We investigate the feasibility of the novel “Bus-to-Grid” (B2G) or “E-Buses as Power Storage” (EBaPS) concept, which allows battery E-buses to provide transportation as well as power-grid services. By aggregating the electrified bus fleets into Virtual Power Plants and discharging the energy to the grid, a bus operator can provide grid services and open up a secondary revenue source in addition to fareboxes. We discuss two contracts the bus operator can arrange with the grid. The first one is “Sale by Market Price (SbMP)”, presuming that the buses can discharge and sell the energy at real-time market prices. The second one is “Frequency Control Reserve (FCR)”, in which the buses discharge on immediate requests of the grid. We formulate the two contracts and their associated fleet allocation problems as two non-linear optimization problems maximizing the operator’s profit. Optimal bus charging, discharging, and dispatching plans are solved on an aggregate level for strategic planning, allowing scalability to large fleet sizes.

In this paper, we first model driver behavior and their payoffs under a game theory framework and find optimal lane-changing strategies for individuals and their peers in multiple pairwise games. Payoffs are estimated for two primary evaluation criteria: efficiency and safety, which are quantified by incorporating driver tradeoffs. After that, the discretionary lane-changing (DLC) model is calibrated and validated by real-world vehicular trajectory data. To manipulate drivers’ DLC behaviors, two types of lane-changing tolls based on local-optimal and global-optimal rules are introduced to align individual preferences with social benefits. We find prices can close this gap and achieve ‘win-win’ results by reducing drivers’ aggressive lane changes in the congested traffic. Meanwhile, the tolls collected can be used to compensate drivers who get delayed when yielding, to encourage appropriate yielding behavior and a pseudo-revenue neutral tolling system.",0968-090X,Not found
Online transportation network cyber-attack detection based on stationary sensor data,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104058,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Penetration of connected vehicles and crowdsourced mapping applications give rise to security vulnerabilities in transportation networks. Accurate detection of cyber-attacks on transportation networks is critical to minimize impacts on transportation systems. This task is particularly challenging because the impacts of regional cyber-attacks can be invisible on aggregated traffic data, especially when only sensor data is accessible to transportation agencies. We propose an analytical framework that leverages real-time road link sensory data to conduct online data-driven transportation network anomaly detection using non-parametric long short-term memory (LSTM) and parametric Gaussian process model. The online anomaly detection models can continuously update model coefficients as real-time sensory data arrives. We utilize a city-scale microscopic traffic simulation to validate our cyber-attack detecting framework. The cyber-attack detection model achieves a F 1 score, which is a harmonic mean of the precision and recall of classifiers, between 84% to 96% considering different initial training data sizes. We compare with major offline models to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of online models. In addition, we devised a meta-heuristic method to solve the multi-objective sensor location problem to simultaneously enhance anomaly detection efficiency and maximize traffic information gain.

Integrated electric bus timetabling and scheduling problem,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104057,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Vehicle timetabling and scheduling in a public transit system are usually performed separately, with the output of timetabling serving as the input of scheduling. An obvious drawback of this sequential planning method is that the trade-off between bus timetables and vehicle schedules may be neglected when determining solutions, which in turn results in that the obtained solutions may be inferior to those produced using an integrated framework. For example, a well-planned timetable may result in a schedule that requires a large vehicle fleet size with more operational cost, while a well-planned schedule may reduce the quality of a bus timetable by limiting the use of vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a time-space network-based framework for integrating electric bus timetabling and scheduling, with minimum and maximum headway times, depot requirements, deadheading and vehicle battery capacities considerations. The underlying time-space network is constructed with well-designed inventory arcs that represent multiple operations a bus may execute, thus decreasing the network size. Using the constructed network, we formulate the considered problem with a multi-commodity network flow model and develop a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic that consists of three phases, including generating relaxed solutions, making relaxed solutions feasible, and improving feasible solutions, to solve the integrated model. Tests on a set of instances confirm that the proposed integrated solution method can efficiently produce bus timetables and schedules with valid bounds, indicate that the integrated method can produce better solutions where the profit is increased by 5.29%–20.28%, and show how the headway times, service trip profit and operating cost settings affect the solution.",0968-090X,Not found
Crowdsourced on-demand food delivery: An order batching and assignment algorithm,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104055,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Since the early 2010s, the meal delivery business went through a veritable revolution due to online food delivery platforms. By allowing customers to quickly order from a wide range of restaurants and outsourcing currently available couriers using their vehicles (crowdsourcing), this typology of service dynamically bridges demand and supply. The main goal of online food delivery platforms consists of matching couriers to meal orders within short time intervals to provide an efficient, reliable, and sustainable service. A way to increase efficiency consists of consolidating orders into batches, such that the same courier can serve several orders in multiple pickup and drop-off routes. Since such an assignment-batching problem becomes computationally prohibitively costly in real-world scenarios characterized by a large number of customer orders as well as uncertain demand and supply, heuristic solution methods come into play. This study proposes an order batching and assignment algorithm that leverages a graph-based approach after decomposing the original problem into more tractable sub-problems employing clustering. The solution is improved by local search moves and re-optimization procedures and integrated with advanced policies to improve solutions over time. An ‘Insertion policy’ aimed at increasing batch size, and a ‘Swap policy’ aimed at identifying more efficient assignments, are implemented and compared to a ‘Myopic policy’ that does not involve any re-optimization over time. An agent-based simulation framework is developed to implement dynamic policies where couriers’ operations and movements are realistically reproduced. The performance of the developed solution approach is tested through experiments based on a real-world case study. Results show that the algorithm allows for high-quality solutions in several configurations characterized by different demand and supply patterns (e.g., density levels, couriers availability) and problem sizes.In particular, the two advanced policies investigated considerably improve the solutions.",0968-090X,Not found
Self-organized criticality of traffic flow: Implications for congestion management technologies,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104056,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Self-organized criticality (SOC) is a celebrated paradigm from the 90’s for understanding dynamical systems naturally driven to its critical point, where the power-law dynamics taking place make predictions practically impossible, such as in stock prices, earthquakes, pandemics and many other problems in science related to phase transitions. Shortly thereafter, it was realized that traffic flow might be in the SOC category, implying that conventional traffic management strategies seeking to maximize the local flows can become detrimental. This paper shows that the Kinematic Wave model with triangular fundamental diagram, and many other related traffic models, indeed exhibit SOC, thanks in part to the fractal nature of traffic exposed here on the one hand, and our need to get to our destinations as soon as possible, on the other hand.Important implications for congestion management of traffic near the critical region are discussed, such as: (i) Jam sizes obey a power-law distribution with exponent 1/2, implying that both its mean and variance become ill-defined and therefore impossible to estimate. (ii) Traffic in the critical region is chaotic in the sense that predictions becomes extremely sensitive to initial conditions. (iii) However, aggregate measures of performance such as delays and average speeds are not heavy tailed, and can be characterized exactly by different scalings of the Airy distribution, (iv) Traffic state time–space “heat maps” are self-affine fractals where the basic unit is a triangle, in the shape of the fundamental diagram, containing 3 traffic states: voids, capacity and jams.

Managing parking with progressive pricing,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104040,149,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Parking supply and demand are often imbalanced in urban areas, causing adverse consequences such as excessive search times and long walking distances. Many parking authorities price parking as a demand management strategy by charging either a fixed daily fee or an hourly price for parking. An emerging alternative is progressive pricing, whereby drivers pay an hourly price that increases if their tracked parking duration is longer than a predetermined threshold. This study investigates the optimal design of progressive pricing for revenue and social welfare maximization when there are two market segments. We study equilibrium properties of progressive pricing and show that its optimal design for revenue maximization segmentizes the demand. In contrast, progressive pricing does not improve social welfare over hourly pricing, because any additional surplus accrued by drivers is offset by the revenue of the parking authority. We develop a micro-simulation model of the City of Toronto’s downtown core with parking capability, and show that progressive pricing lowers average parking occupancy and search time in high demand parking clusters by 5.6% and 12.5%, respectively, compared to hourly pricing.",0968-090X,Not found
Disrupted transportation networks under different information availability and stochasticity situations,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104097,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Disruptive events may result in severe performance degradations in transportation networks. Properly evaluating the performance deterioration of a disrupted network with taking individual’s behavioral response into account is a critical step within many operational and planning decisions, such as emergency rescue, traffic management, evacuation planning, infrastructure reinforcement, and so on. The focus of this paper is on the development and analysis of a set of disrupted network evaluation methods, considering different disruption information availability conditions and further an adaptation of these methods into a stochastic traffic environment and stochastic disruption context. Specifically, we define two typical information availability conditions: 1) information globally available (IGA); 2) information locally available (ILA), in terms of different data collection and transmission capabilities and traveler response behaviors. The IGA condition presumes that travelers know the complete set of disruption information before they make trips, while the ILA condition, however, represents another extreme information attainment condition, implying that travelers can observe or notice the occurrence of a disruption only when they reach in person the proximity of the disruption site. A new dynamic adaptive routing process is constructed to model individual routing behaviors for the ILA condition. The above modeling framework implies that, the total travel cost in the IGA condition is always better than the ILA situation in the deterministic traffic environment, and this conclusion is also applicable to the total traveler surplus in the IGA and ILA conditions in the stochastic traffic environment. On the other hand, the resulting ILA network flow pattern in the stochastic traffic environment can be fully accommodated by a Markovian traffic assignment process. When disruptions probabilistically occur, the proposed network evaluation method resorts to a combinatorial number of network evaluations and poses a very time-consuming process. For tackling this computational complexity, we suggested a Monte Carlo simulation-based evaluation framework and found that it can very precisely conduct network evaluations in a much more efficient manner, especially when the number of independently occurring disruptions is large.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling the impact of lane-changing's anticipation on car-following behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104110,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Lane-changing (LC) in congested traffic has been identified as a trigger for the sudden deceleration behavior of the new follower in the target lane, leading to severe traffic disturbances. Thus, investigating the response of the new follower to an LC maneuver is an important research topic in the literature. To date, numerous efforts have been devoted to understanding the impact of the lane changer on the new follower after the insertion, while less attention has been given to this influence during the pre-insertion stage (anticipation). Therefore, this paper aims to establish a new car-following (CF) model to capture the new follower’s driving behavior during anticipation. Specifically, we introduce an attention mechanism deviating from Newell’s CF rules to quantify the impact of anticipation. Then, we apply a neural network with an attention layer to estimate the attention mechanism and incorporate it into the Newell CF model, which yields a new CF model, denoted as CF_Attention. Using real-world trajectory data, we design three experiments and select three representative CF models to validate the CF_Attention. The results indicate that the CF_Attention outperforms the other models in predicting the new follower’s trajectory, which is not affected by the heterogeneous behavior of the new follower and the anticipation duration. Additionally, the CF_Attention is proven effective in capturing the speed-space relationship and the formation of oscillation. Finally, our transferability test suggests that the CF_Attention is promising for different locations and times without requiring retraining. The results of this study could advance the integration of the LC impact and CF behavior, and could be implemented into commercial traffic simulation programs to describe vehicle movements in traffic flow more accurately.",0968-090X,Not found

Targeted for profit maximization, we first formulate a basic model and derive the equilibrium results of parking platforms’ profits. Results show that indirect network effects positively affect the two parking platforms’ profits when the equivalent gains from alternative activities for parking owners are large, while negatively affect the profits otherwise in certain cases. Extensions regarding some considerations are then discussed, where Model D is proposed for dual decision of the shared parking platform and Model S is proposed for the social welfare maximization objective of the public parking platform.

Autonomous vehicle impacts on travel-based activity and activity-based travel,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104107,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This paper undertakes a deep dive into the kinds of activities that individuals are likely to pursue when freed from the task of driving in the fully automated vehicle (AV) era. We refer to such activities as travel-based activities (TBAs) and examine the potential effects of TBA participation on activity-based travel (ABT). Two aggregate ABT characteristics are considered: additional local area travel (ALT) and additional long distance travel (ALDT). TBAs and the two ABTs are jointly modeled in a parsimonious fashion using psycho-social latent constructs, individual characteristics, and built environment (BE) attributes. The data used in this study is drawn from a 2019 “emerging mobility” survey administered in the Austin, Texas metropolitan area by the research group. Our study indicates that “productive use of time” is not necessarily always tied with activities such as work and study; rather, being able to partake in relatively chill activities (such as sleeping, relaxing, and gazing out the window) is also considered as good use of time. This suggests caution in the interpretation of what are traditionally referred to as “productive” activities and also a need for scholarly restraint in the use of the label “multitasking” to exclusively refer to non-passive activities. We suggest that the field move away from subjective/ambiguous terms such as multitasking and “productive” activities, and adopt the more neutral label of “travel-based activity”. The results also support the notion that the option of opening up travel to pursue work/study activities may itself be engendering stress in individuals; that is, as the option to pursue “non-chill” activities increases in an AV environment, that itself may produce angst in individuals and lead to less enjoyment in travel.

How can we provide the right incentives to potential suppliers and demanders so that they are shared in the market? We consider a parking-sharing platform in which each agent supplies a parking space and needs another one. We propose a novel parking-sharing mechanism that amends the well-known Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction with the notion of scale control, which ex-ante constrains the number of agents who are offered a parking space by the platform. We show that such a mechanism is incentive compatible and individually rational. We illustrate that it can easily achieve budget balance with a proper choice of scale.

A dynamic dispatching problem for autonomous mine trucks in open-pit mines considering endogenous congestion,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104080,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The introduction of autonomous mine trucks can improve the efficiency, productivity, and safety of open-pit mines, but may require more reasonable dynamic truck dispatching system to guide routes and schedules than manual driven mine trucks. In practical operations, for security consideration, only one autonomous mine truck is allowed to pass through each intersection at a time, which may lead to endogenous congestion at intersections. In this paper, we first introduce the autonomous mine trucks and endogenous congestion at intersections in the dynamic truck dispatching problem. We propose the concept of road resource which denotes the time-extended intersection and give the time–space network with road resources. The rolling horizon framework is applied to model the dynamic feature. In each horizon, the dispatching of autonomous mine trucks is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model on the time–space network with road resources. To solve the dispatching problem in each horizon, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm to decompose the problem into a series of shortest path problem, which is solved by the designed label setting algorithm. Moreover, to yield high-quality feasible solution in each iteration of Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, a repairing algorithm with an adaptive initialization strategy is designed. A case study of an open-pit mine in China is involved to show the efficiency of the designed model with road resources and the proposed algorithm.

Integrated design framework for on-demand transit system based on spatiotemporal mobility patterns,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104087,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"On-demand transit is a flexible transit service designed to adjust the service schedule and route based on passengers’ dynamic demand. The operation of on-demand transit operates in accordance with physical and socioeconomic environments, and demand patterns. In order to meet the diverse mobility needs in urban areas, integrating different transit services is essential to improve both passenger convenience and operational efficiency simultaneously. We propose a data-driven design framework for an on-demand transit system that operates three types of services: planned-and-inflexible (PI), planned-and-flexible (PF), and unplanned-and-flexible (UF), each with varying levels of responsiveness to real-time demand. We classify historical demand data into three classes based on their spatiotemporal density. Then, we use the trip data of each class to plan and operate the PI, PF, and UF services. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using real public transit data from Sejong city. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed system outperforms the existing on-demand transit system. Specifically, we observe that the PI and PF services, which are planned based on the historical spatiotemporal mobility patterns, highly compatible with requests that follow the major mobility patterns. At the same time, the UF service, which offers real-time routing without prior planning, covers areas and times beyond those served by the PI and PF services that do not correspond to major mobility patterns. Furthermore, we found that the proposed system is flexible enough to accommodate various real-world demand patterns by proving suggestions on the optimal vehicle operation for each service.",0968-090X,Not found

The goal of the EB-CFP problem is to determine the number and type of EB chargers that should be deployed at bus terminals and depots to meet daily EB charging demand while minimizing total cost. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model, with the first stage determining the EB charger deployment scheme and the second stage estimating the EB daily operational cost with respect to a predetermined EB trip timetable for a given EB charger deployment scheme.

Specifically, in this study, the aggressiveness of all preceding vehicles in the car-following scenario can be estimated globally by monitoring the history of their time-series behaviors, before the CAV initiates a particular action, which is performed at the upper layer of the proposed decision-making structure. If it is determined that initiating a specific action is advantageous, the action is initiated, and the CAV then interacts with the vehicles locally to achieve its driving goal in a game-theoretical manner at the lower layer.

Integrated optimization of bus bridging service design and passenger assignment in response to urban rail transit disruptions,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104098,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"As the urban rail transit (URT) system plays an increasingly important role in supporting large cities’ mobility around the world, service disruptions have become more prevalent, potentially resulting in severe economic losses and passenger safety issues. It is imperative to investigate effective response strategies to mitigate the effects of such disruptions. In response to URT service disruptions, this paper systematically investigates the bus bridging service design (BBSD) problem, which concerns the integration of bus bridging route design, frequency determination, and passenger assignment in the integrated URT and bus network. The problem is formulated as a path-based integer linear programming (ILP) model with the goal of simultaneously minimizing operator-oriented and passenger-oriented costs.

Optimizing first-mile ridesharing services to intercity transit hubs,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104082,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Travel to intercity transportation hubs, such as railway stations and airports, can be the most troublesome and inefficient part of the entire air/railway travel journey, as travelers often carry large luggage and have stringent arrival time requirements. Taking public transportation, such as metro and bus services, is inconvenient to carry luggage and less reliable in arrival time while taking taxi services could be less economical. As a result, providing reliable and convenient yet economical on-demand first-mile services for travelers to intercity transportation hubs is essential. This paper proposes a ridesharing approach for the first-mile transport system for travelers heading towards the intercity transportation hub and develops a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with the objective of minimizing the total operating costs for ridesharing service operators. The MILP model considers (1) large luggage that may occupy seats when the car trunk is not large enough to place them; (2) passengers’ requirements on arrival time and ride time; and (3) travel time uncertainty ensuring that riders’ arrival time and ride time can be satisfied. A tailored adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm with an acceleration strategy is developed for obtaining robust near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time. To assess the solution quality, the MILP model is reformulated as a set-partitioning model, and the column generation algorithm is leveraged to determine a tight lower bound; a greedy algorithm is introduced to obtain an upper bound. Computational experiments on Shanghai South Railway Station demonstrate that ridesharing is an effective strategy for reducing overall travel costs while meeting the first-mile travel demand. In addition, it is essential to consider luggage and travel time uncertainty for determining ridesharing schemes.",0968-090X,Not found

A distributed cooperative control for multiple LPs is designed which projects on-ramp LPs onto mainline to transform the complex 2-D multi-platoon cooperation problem into a 1-D platoon following control problem. An optimal control is applied to further consider the strict nonlinear safety spacing constraint and state limitations (e.g., maximum speed and acceleration), and an analytical solution to the optimal control is derived based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle. The consensus of intra-platoon and inter-platoon are analyzed, and sufficient conditions of the consensus are mathematically deducted based on Lyapunov stability theorem. Numerical simulations are conducted for different traffic demand levels and demand splits to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The proposed neural network architecture ensures the existence of equilibrium and accommodates future changes in road network topology. The variational inequality is then embedded as an implicit layer in a learning framework, which takes the context features (e.g., road network and traveler characteristics) as input and outputs the user equilibrium flow distribution.

Throughput properties and optimal locations for limited deployment of Max-pressure controls,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104105,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Max-pressure (MP) control is one of the few traffic signal controllers proven to maximize network throughput or maximally stabilize the network. According to the theoretical results published so far, it can stabilize a network if all intersections are equipped with MP control for all stabilizable demands. However, budget constraints may not allow the installation of MP control on all intersections. Previous work did not consider a limited number of MP controlled intersections while proving the stability properties. Therefore, it is not clear whether a network can still be stabilized with a limited deployment of MP control. Using Lyapunov drift techniques this paper proves that even with a limited deployment, MP control can stabilize a network within feasible demand. Then we present an optimization formulation to find the optimal intersections to install MP control given a limited budget. We also present a greedy efficient algorithm to solve that optimization problem and prove that the algorithm solves the problem to optimality. Numerical results from simulations conducted on the downtown Austin network using an in-house custom simulator called AVDTA are then presented. The change in theoretical maximum servable demands for different amounts of deployments obtained from the optimization problem seemed to match with simulation results most of the times. We found that limited deployment of MP control almost always performed better than random deployment of MP control in terms of servable stable demand. Average total queue length and link density were observed to decrease as the number of MP controls increased which indicates better network performance. Average travel times per vehicle also decreased with installations of MP controls which shows how the travelers would benefit from more MP controls.",0968-090X,Not found
A multi-stage fusion network for transportation mode identification with varied scale representation of GPS trajectories,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104088,150,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Accurate transportation mode identification is essential for traffic management and travel planning. The rapid development of GPS-enabled devices has made it both popular and cost-effective to obtain travel modes from massive GPS trajectory datasets. However, since different transportation modes exhibit significantly different spatial characteristics, varied scale representation can be used to efficiently capture these differences, but existing research have failed to fully exploit this point. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework named Multi-Attribute-Scale-Object-based Multi-Stage Fusion Network (MASO-MSF). A MASO structure is constructed to represent the local motion states and spatial characteristics of one GPS trajectory segment at different spatial scales. Subsequently, a multi-stage fusion model (MSF) is designed to perform accurate transportation mode identification in an end-to-end manner. In this model, an attribute channel fusion module is built to fuse local motion states and capture the spatial dependencies. A scale feature fusion module is then established to selectively aggregate features from different spatial scales. Finally, MSF deploys an object decision fusion module to generate the final identification result from different probabilities of multiple objects in a trajectory segment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed MASO-MSF model, a series of experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of MASO in characterizing a trajectory segment from three perspectives (i.e., attribute, scale, and object) and demonstrate that MASO-MSF can achieve the state-of-the-art identification performance. In addition, the source code of MASO-MSF is now available at GitHub (https://github.com/MYL23/MASO-MSF).",0968-090X,Not found

However, research on other transportation information systems has shown that informing only a subset of drivers of road conditions may have a perverse effect of increasing congestion. In the context of a simple (yet novel) model of V2V hazard information sharing, we ask whether partial adoption of this technology can similarly lead to undesirable outcomes. In our model, drivers individually choose how recklessly to behave as a function of information received from other V2V-enabled cars, and the resulting aggregate behavior influences the likelihood of accidents (and thus the information propagated by the vehicular network). We fully characterize the game-theoretic equilibria of this model using our new equilibrium concept. Our model indicates that for a wide range of the parameter space, V2V information sharing surprisingly increases the equilibrium frequency of accidents relative to no V2V information sharing, and that it may increase equilibrium social cost as well.",0968-090X,Not found

This paper elaborates the application of class association rules (CARs) and examines their predictive performance using data extracted from the 2015 National Dutch Travel Survey. To solve the problem how to activate rules that have high confidence but low support, the information gain (IG) concept is introduced in the model building process. The modeling process in this study first involves extracting frequent items from the data using the FP-Growth algorithm and deriving CARs from these frequent items. Next, the IG statistic is used to construct a novel model (named CARIG), which consists of a set of decision rules that formally represent behavioral scripts, for predicting individuals’ transportation mode choice.

Extending ramp metering control to mixed autonomy traffic flow with varying degrees of automation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104119,151,2023-06-01,2023,6,"The emergence of automated vehicles may have significant impacts on traffic flow. While many studies suggest that fully automated vehicles can improve traffic flow by changing their macroscopic characteristics at different market penetration rates, recent studies show that partially automated vehicles (e.g., adaptive cruise control vehicles) commercially available on the market may negatively impact the traffic flow. With this in mind, existing traffic control strategies, such as ramp metering, may require further modification due to the change of macroscopic traffic flow characteristics in the presence of mixed autonomy traffic. However, the extent to which the ramp metering control algorithm will have to change in response to mixed autonomy traffic is still an open question. In this study, we first formulate the fundamental diagram analytically for mixed autonomy traffic, which is dependent on the market penetration rates of automated vehicles. Next, we model and simulate the composite traffic flow with a mixed autonomy macroscopic traffic flow model, and modify a standard ramp metering control strategy to optimize operations under the new flow conditions. The simulation results show that the total time spent is reduced by 4% compared to the scenario controlled with a standard ramp metering control strategy, suggesting a higher highway throughput is obtained at a merge section when leveraging the modified ramp metering controller.

A Weibit-Based sequential transit assignment model based on hyperpath graph and generalized extreme value network representation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104142,151,2023-06-01,2023,6,"This study aims to develop a weibit-based stochastic transit assignment model for situations in which passengers’ travel choice strategies are stochastic. The weibit choice model, which was originally developed for the stochastic traffic assignment problem, is adapted using a hyperpath graph network representation. Unlike the traditional logit model, the weibit model can account for the homogeneous perception variance problem. Besides, a joint choice network representation originated from the network generalized extreme value (N-GEV) model, known as the GEV network, is adopted to depict the correlation among the arcs within the hypergraph consisting of all efficient hyperpaths. The GEV network uses a link-based parameter, the degree of membership, to capture the overlap effect, which is thus well incorporated with the link-based transit assignment approach. For implementation, a link-based stochastic network loading approach is proposed for solving the weibit-based transit assignment model in the sequential process. This sequential assignment approach does not need to enumerate and store the transit hyperpaths in the solution process. This model is then extended to a stochastic transit equilibrium model under congestion conditions, which is formulated as a fixed-point problem. Thus, a recent fast line-search scheme, i.e., the Barzilai and Borwein step-size, is adopted for solving the stochastic transit equilibrium model.

This paper proposes and analyzes alternative market models for a TMC system – focusing on market design aspects such as allocation/expiration of credits, rules governing trading, transaction fees, and regulator intervention – and develops a methodology to explicitly model the dis-aggregate behavior of individuals within the market. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted within a combined mode and departure-time context for the morning commute problem to compare the performance of the alternative designs relative to congestion pricing and a no-control scenario. The results indicate that small, fixed transaction fees can effectively mitigate undesirable speculation in the market without a significant loss in efficiency (total welfare) whereas proportional transaction fees are less effective, both in terms of efficiency and in avoiding undesirable speculation. Further, an allocation of credits in continuous time can be beneficial in dealing with non-recurrent events and avoiding concentrated trading activity. In the presence of income effects, despite small, fixed transaction fees, the TMC system yields a marginally higher social welfare than congestion pricing while attaining revenue neutrality. Moreover, it is more robust in the presence of forecasting errors and non-recurrent events due to the adaptiveness of the market. Finally, as expected, the TMC scheme is more equitable (when revenues from congestion pricing are not redistributed) although it is not guaranteed to be Pareto-improving when credits are distributed equally.",0968-090X,Not found

However, when observed decisions outcomes are non-stationary in time because, for example, the agent is changing their behavioral policy over time, existing methods fail to recognize the intent behind these changes. To this end, we introduce a non-parametric sequentially-valid online statistical hypothesis test to identify entities in the urban environment that ride-sourcing drivers increasingly sought out or avoided over the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To defend against direct cyber-attacks that alter signal settings directly and maliciously by hacking into the wireless connected traffic control center or signal controllers, this study applies a precautionary and inexpensive measure of designing the robust signal control plan. This is realized by modelling the biobjective traffic signal control simulation-based optimization (SO) problem under cyber-attacks in a bi-level framework, with the aim of minimizing the negative impact of potential cyber-attacks on traffic efficiency and safety performance. Depending on the type of attacker with complete or incomplete knowledge on traffic signal control system, two typical bi-level models exist.

An urban road network in Changsha, China, is modelled as the experimental site and numerical results show the effectiveness of IBORSO in solving the two bi-level models.

One important question is how to find a space to merge into without placing any vehicle in a collision-prone situation. Moreover, what is the traffic flow impact of doing so? To tackle this issue, we start by adopting a safety definition based on a worst-case braking scenario. We then propose a decentralized controller-agnostic cooperative approach for lane changes that relies only on Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications and guarantees safety. In our method, the merging vehicle operates as having two possible leaders, one in its own lane and one in the destination lane, till the lane change maneuver is completed. Furthermore, the future following vehicle in the destination lane cooperates by acting as if the merging vehicle has already changed lanes. The merging vehicle only performs the lane change maneuver when the gaps are safe. Vehicle-level simulations are used to evaluate the approach in detail for a single lane change maneuver. Then, the method’s impact on highway safety and traffic flow is assessed using microscopic traffic simulations based on the commercial software VISSIM. We simulate three types of vehicles: adaptive cruise control equipped vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and connected and autonomous vehicles. The various simulations allow us to identify which improvements are brought by cooperative lane changes. Results indicate that connected and autonomous vehicles can achieve almost zero collision risk in congested and uncongested scenarios while improving traffic flow by 26% in the congested case. However, energy consumption increases significantly in the uncongested scenario. Moreover, our method outperforms an existing cooperative lane-changing method regarding safety and traffic flow. Our simulations with mixed traffic suggest that the proposed method is advantageous only at high penetrations of autonomous vehicles or in congested situations.",0968-090X,Not found
An automated driving systems data acquisition and analytics platform,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104120,151,2023-06-01,2023,6,"In this paper, an automated driving system (ADS) data acquisition and analytics platform for vehicle trajectory extraction, reconstruction, and evaluation based on connected automated vehicle (CAV) cooperative perception are presented. This platform presents a holistic pipeline from the raw advanced sensory data collection to data processing, which is capable of processing the sensor data from multi-CAVs and extracting the objects’ Identity (ID) number, position, speed, and orientation information in the map and Frenet coordinates. First, the ADS data acquisition and analytics platform are presented. Specifically, the experimental CAVs platform and sensor configuration are shown, and the processing software, including a deep-learning-based object detection algorithm using LiDAR information, a late fusion scheme to leverage cooperative perception to fuse the detected objects from multi-CAVs, and a multi-object tracking method is introduced. To further enhance the object detection and tracking results, high-definition maps consisting of point cloud and vector maps are generated and forwarded to a world model to filter out the objects off the road and extract the objects’ coordinates in Frenet coordinates and the lane information. In addition, to refine trajectories from the object tracking algorithms, a post-processing method is proposed. Given the objects’ information from the object detection and tracking and the world model, a Kalman filter and Chi-square test method are applied to reduce the noise and remove the outlier in the trajectories. Aiming at tackling the ID switch issue of the object tracking algorithm, a fuzzy-logic-based approach is proposed to detect the discontinuous trajectories belonging to the same object. Then, a vehicle-kinematics-based trajectory prediction method is used, and a forward–backward-smoothing technique is applied to reconstruct the trajectory between the discontinuous trajectories. Finally, results, including object detection and tracking and a late fusion scheme, are presented, and the improvements by the post-processing algorithm in terms of noise level and outlier removal are discussed, which confirm the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed holistic data collection and processing platform. In another aspect, the extracted objects’ information and generated HD maps can be used for several purposes in the transportation research community and ADS development community: analyzing the interaction between human-driven vehicles and ADS-equipped vehicles, car-following behavior analysis of ADS-equipped vehicles, traffic flow status analysis and modeling, and scenario generation for ADS testing.",0968-090X,Not found
A Two-stage Learning-based method for Large-scale On-demand pickup and delivery services with soft time windows,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104122,151,2023-06-01,2023,6,"With the rapid growth of the on-demand logistics industry, large-scale pickup and delivery with soft time windows has become widespread in various time-critical scenarios. This problem has proven to be an NP-hard problem. Hence, the computation time and resources required to solve it increase exponentially with the growth of size. As a result, it is burdensome for the exact algorithm and heuristic method to generate a high-quality solution instantly. Machine learning seems to be a possible option due to the advantage of offline training. However, it is difficult to solve large-scale problems due to the lengthy training time, heavy computational cost, and training instability. Thus, this paper proposes the two-stage learning-based method composed of the clustering stage and the routing stage to tackle this problem. The clustering stage builds upon the attention mechanism by introducing graph convolutional network to the input, which can keep the match of pickup and paired delivery customers and classify them into different vehicles, while the routing stage adopts a well-trained model to generate a route for each capacitated vehicle. Furthermore, the well-trained model is utilized to train another problem inspired by transfer learning. Experiments show that the model, trained on small-scale problems, generalizes well to larger-scale problems, and achieves superior performance compared with the heuristic method and Google OR-Tools, with an extremely short computing time. In addition, the favorable transferability of this model is verified through contrast experiment, which can save a significant amount of training time.",0968-090X,Not found

However, the limitations of generalisation make it difficult for existing RL-based conflict resolution (CR) methods to be effective in practice. This paper proposes a general multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method that integrates an adaptive manoeuvre strategy to enhance both the solution’s efficiency and the model’s generalisation in multi-aircraft conflict resolution (MACR). A partial observation approach based on the imminent threat detection sectors is used to gather critical environmental information, enabling the model to be applied in arbitrary scenarios. Agents are trained to provide the correct flight intention (such as increasing speed and yawing to the left), while an adaptive manoeuvre strategy generates the specific manoeuvre (speed and heading parameters) based on the flight intention. To address flight uncertainty and performance challenges caused by the intrinsic non-stationarity in MARL, a warning area for each aircraft is introduced. We employ a state-of-the-art Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) method, Rainbow DQN, to improve the efficiency of the RL algorithm. The multi-agent system is trained and deployed in a distributed manner to adapt to real-world scenarios. A sensitivity analysis of uncertainty levels and warning area sizes is conducted to explore their impact on the proposed method.

Do incentives make a difference? Understanding smart charging program adoption for electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104123,151,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Climate change and environmental problems have spurred new strategies to reduce fossil fuel consumption in transportation. Two important strategies include a rapid transition to green energy and the replacement of internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs). However, the increasing demand for electricity by EVs, especially from time-dependent green sources of energy (e.g., solar, wind), will likely overload the grid at peak hours. Smart charging programs for EVs could defer charging to off-peak times and better match demand with supply. Yet, little is currently known about people’s willingness to sign up for a program. To understand incentive effects on smart charging program adoption, we distributed a survey (n = 785) in October 2018 across the United States targeting three groups: 1) EV owners/lessees (n = 151), 2) EV interested buyers/lessees (n = 555), and 3) a general population (n = 79). We first found that a significant portion of both EV groups would be interested in the program without any incentive, but there was a participation limit. Employing three mixed logit models, we found that monetary incentives and free charging equipment increased participation for the two EV groups, although the attributes exhibited heterogeneity. Guaranteed battery level (or rides home) increased participation for all three groups and at least one random parameter was present for all three groups. Penalties deployed to discourage participants from taking back charging control decreased participation willingness in the two EV groups, although EV interested buyers/lessees responded heterogeneously. While higher monetary incentives increased participation, the effects displayed diminishing returns.",0968-090X,Not found

First, we propose a general platoon dynamics model with heterogeneous time delays that may originate from the communication channel and/or vehicle onboard sensors. Based on the proposed dynamics model, we develop an augmented state extended Kalman filter (ASEKF) to smooth sensor readings, and use it in conjunction with an anomaly detector to detect sensor anomalies. Specifically, we consider two detectors: a parametric detector, the χ 2 -detector, and a learning-based detector, the one class support vector machine (OCSVM). We investigate the detection power of all combinations of vehicle dynamics models (EKF and ASEKF) and detectors ( χ 2 and OCSVM). Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept in string stability, namely, pseudo string stability, to measure a platoon’s string stability under cyberattacks and model uncertainties. We demonstrate the relationship between the pseudo string stability of a platoon and its detection rate, which enables us to identify the critical detection sensitivity/recall that the platoon’s members should meet for the platoon to remain pseudo string stable.",0968-090X,Not found

However, this close following operation is still difficult to be achieved given uncertain resistances and nonlinear safety constraints. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a robust model predictive control (RMPC) approach for the close following operation of VCTS while satisfying a nonlinear safety constraint with relative braking principle. First, we construct a robust positively invariant set that bounds the tracking errors caused by uncertain resistances. Further, a semi-definite program-based controller tuning algorithm is proposed to reduce the following distance in the premise of the tightened constraint for robustly satisfying the nonlinear safety constraint. Then, by mathematically examining the future trajectories of successive trains, we create a terminal constraint set to ensure the recursive feasibility of the proposed RMPC. This closed-loop property guarantees the satisfaction of the safety constraint in any situation, even in the case of sudden deceleration of VCTS. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the following distance with respect to heterogeneous trains and verify the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the expected close following operation can be achieved while robustly satisfying the nonlinear safety constraint with uncertain resistances. Moreover, our approach further reduces the following distance in a VCTS by over 5%, compared with existing research.",0968-090X,Not found

Autonomous and connected vehicles rely on real-time, at-scale updating of the environment in which they operate. Successful operation in a hybrid environment, where human and machine intelligence coexist, requires explicit knowledge of the traffic regulator infrastructure. Future generation traffic management strategies and path planning systems must be tightly integrated with the regulator infrastructure in order to improve traffic dynamics and reduce congestion in urban environments. In this article, we present Intersense, a regulator identification and categorization system that leverages raw, naturalistic GPS trajectory data to infer the existence and type of regulators present at network intersections. A supervised learning approach, based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, combines infrastructure and vehicle telemetry data features to analyze movement patterns vehicles follow when approaching intersections. For the most widely used regulator types (traffic light, stop sign and right of way), the achieved accuracy surpasses 96%. Permutation feature importance is used to evaluate the relative importance of the generated features, providing a detailed view of the classification model and insights for future data collection and processing stages. We showcase the Intersense’s adaptability to various GPS data sources with uneven penetration and sampling rates and we illustrate the system’s transferability across very diverse cities by performing experiments in San Jose and San Francisco.

Balancing convenience and sustainability in public transport through dynamic transit bus networks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104100,151,2023-06-01,2023,6,"The rapid transformation of urban mobility fueled by the evolution of digital technologies has enabled smarter and more convenient modes of transportation. However, these new modes (e.g., ride-hailing and ridesharing) are not always more sustainable than traditional modes, such as public transport networks. In this work, we propose a dynamic transit bus system that aims at combining the higher convenience provided to passengers in on-demand systems with the sustainability of public transport. The goal is to attract more passengers to the transit service by offering reduced walk-to-station distance and total travel time compared to the fixed lines. Our proposed system plans the routes and intermediate stops of the transit lines based on the actual observed demand. Due to the complexity of the resulting optimization problem under investigation, we propose a solution method which splits the problem into four stages: clustering, initialization, optimization, and merging. We compare our proposed system in two settings: flexible (i.e., all intermediate stations are dynamic), and semi-flexible (i.e., original fixed lines intermediate stations are kept at the route and more dynamic stations are added) to the fixed static line. Our results show that our proposed system offers a more sustainable option and can reduce the system-wide travel distance by attracting more on-demand passengers to the transit service by offering them reduced walking distance and travel duration compared to the static lines. We also quantify the positive impact of passengers’ willingness to act more sustainably by accepting to walk more or arrive later to their destinations on the system-wide sustainability.",0968-090X,Not found
Energy-efficient predictive control for trams incorporating disjunctive time constraints from traffic lights,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104113,151,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Tram operations are often blocked by traffic lights, leading to frequent decelerations and re-accelerations that increase operational energy consumption. This paper focuses on tram energy-efficient control problem incorporating time constraints from traffic lights that have multiple feasible green time windows (GTWs). We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), where binary variables are assigned to model disjunctive time constraints of the GTWs. To address computational challenge of solving the MINLP, we reformulate it as a tractable nonlinear program (NLP). Specifically, an equivalent NLP is first presented by replacing the integrality constraint with nonlinear constraints, and then the nonlinear constraints are relaxed and penalized into cost functions. To recover a solution of the MINLP, we propose a computationally efficient sequential quadratic programming algorithm in a shrinking horizon model predictive control framework, which updates the penalty parameter and quadratic programming subproblems in parallel. The solution obtained from the subproblem is feasible in each iteration, and convergence of the feasibility iterations can be enforced by the updated penalty. The performance of the proposed approach is investigated on different scenarios using real-life tram data. Results show that the method is able to generate energy-efficient driving trajectories in a dynamic environment, while crossing traffic lights in effective GTWs without unnecessary decelerations and re-accelerations.",0968-090X,Not found
FitFun: A modelling framework for successfully capturing the functional form and noise of observed traffic flow–density–speed relationships,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104068,151,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Measurements of the average properties of vehicular traffic are inherently noisy. The distributions of flow and speed measurements at any particular density are non-Gaussian with density-dependent variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Previous studies have failed to properly account for these complicated noise properties. In remediation, we present FitFun, a general framework for modelling any observed flow–density–speed relationship. Models specified within FitFun incorporate components for both the functional form and the noise. We define three flexible noise model components and we fit 200 different models to a high-quality sample of 10,150 observed urban flow-occupancy relationships. We compare the fits using information criteria and assess fit quality through analysis of the residuals. We find that the non-parametric Sun model for the functional form component combined with a Skew Exponential Power Type III noise component significantly outperforms all of the other models. Interestingly, we find that the city, country, road topology, and detector location have virtually no impact on model performance and fit quality, which is very convenient for model selection. The only factor of relevance from those that we studied is the effective occupancy coverage of the data. We conclude that certain models specified judiciously within FitFun can successfully capture the functional form and noise of observed flow–density–speed relationships without the need to discard data taken during non-stationary conditions. This is particularly advantageous for urban data where stationary traffic conditions are rarely observed.",0968-090X,Not found
Managing a bi-modal bottleneck system with manned and autonomous vehicles: Incorporating the effects of in-vehicle activity utilities,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104179,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This paper addresses the congestion management issues of a bottleneck-constrained highway system with manned vehicles (MVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). A novel model that incorporates the in-vehicle activity utilities and activity type choices of AV commuters is presented for analyzing the equilibrium of the bi-modal bottleneck system with MVs and AVs. Time-varying and step tolling schemes accounting for the effects of in-vehicle activity utilities are analytically explored. In particular, a differentiated and a non-differentiated (or anonymous) step tolling scheme for the mixed MV and AV traffic system are analyzed and compared. The differentiated step tolling scheme means different toll levels across MV and AV commuters, whereas the non-differentiated step tolling scheme means an identical toll level for both the MV and AV commuters. The results show that a queuing segregation phenomenon occurs between the MV and AV commuters. The optimal AV proportion solution that minimizes the total social cost of the mixed MV and AV system exists. For a pure MV or AV system, the optimal step toll scheme can eliminate exactly half of the total queuing delay with the no-toll equilibrium for each of the differentiated and non-differentiated step tolling schemes. However, for a mixed MV and AV system, the queuing removal rate of the optimal differentiated step tolling scheme would exceed a half, whereas that of the optimal non-differentiated step tolling scheme may be lower than a half.

To achieve this, we developed a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) that generates an ego vehicle's car-following response and the trajectories of the ego and surrounding vehicles. The proposed modeling framework integrates a theory-based car-following model with two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to embed the trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles into the hidden driving regimes and the corresponding random coefficients of the car-following model.

A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to solve this “modular dial-a-ride problem” (MDARP). A heuristic algorithm based on Steiner-tree-inspired large neighborhood search is developed to solve the MDARP for practical scenarios.

Such a melange of irregularities has presented significant challenges to the airline industry, which typically relies on long-term planning. Given the growing risk of disruptions during epidemic and pandemic outbreaks, the role of airline recovery is becoming increasingly crucial for the aviation industry. This study proposes a novel model for airline integrated recovery problem under the risk of in-flight epidemic transmission risks. This model recovers the schedules of aircraft, crew, and passengers to eliminate possible epidemic dissemination while reducing airline operating costs. To account for the high uncertainty with respect to in-flight transmission rates and to prevent overfitting of the empirical distribution, a Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set is utilized to formulate a distributionally robust optimization model. Aimed at tackling computation difficulties, a branch-and-cut solution method and a large neighborhood search heuristic are proposed in this study based on an epidemic propagation network. The computation results for real-world flight schedules and a probabilistic infection model suggest that the proposed model is capable of reducing the expected number of infected crew members and passengers by 45% with less than 4% increase in flight cancellation/delay rates.

Correlating sparse sensing for large-scale traffic speed estimation: A Laplacian-enhanced low-rank tensor kriging approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104190,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Traffic speed is central to characterizing the fluidity of the road network. Many transportation applications rely on it, such as real-time navigation, dynamic route planning, and congestion management. Rapid advances in sensing and communication techniques make traffic speed detection easier than ever. However, due to sparse deployment of static sensors or low penetration of mobile sensors, speeds detected are incomplete and far from network-wide use. In addition, sensors are prone to error or missing data due to various kinds of reasons, speeds from these sensors can become highly noisy. These drawbacks call for effective techniques to recover credible estimates from the incomplete data. In this work, we first identify the issue as a spatiotemporal kriging problem and propose a Laplacian enhanced low-rank tensor completion (LETC) framework featuring both low-rankness and multi-dimensional correlations for large-scale traffic speed kriging under limited observations. To be specific, three types of speed correlation including temporal continuity, temporal periodicity, and spatial proximity are carefully chosen and simultaneously modeled by three different forms of graph Laplacian, named temporal graph Fourier transform, generalized temporal consistency regularization, and diffusion graph regularization. We then design an efficient solution algorithm via several effective numeric techniques to scale up the proposed model to network-wide kriging. By performing experiments on two public million-level traffic speed datasets, we finally draw the conclusion and find our proposed LETC achieves the state-of-the-art kriging performance even under low observation rates, while at the same time saving more than half computing time compared with baseline methods.

This uncertainty is quantified utilizing the ensemble weather forecast and the robust optimizations for trajectory and sequence are formulated in an ensemble approach. To connect the two optimizations, we introduce the so-called performance surfaces, which represent the characteristics of the optimal trajectory.

Understanding the demand for these services is essential for planning and managing modern transportation systems. Existing studies develop statistical models for ride-sourcing demand estimation at an aggregate level due to limited data availability. These models lack foundations in microeconomic theory, ignore competition of ride-sourcing with other travel modes, and cannot be seamlessly integrated into existing individual-level (disaggregate) activity-based models to evaluate system-level impacts of ride-sourcing services.

"Capacity of a constrained urban airspace: Influencing factors, analytical modelling and simulations",10.1016/j.trc.2023.104173,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The traffic density of small aerial vehicles operating within urban environments is expected to increase significantly in the near future. This urban environment is highly constrained due to being limited to the low-altitude airspace directly above the existing road network. Multiple studies have addressed factors influencing the capacity of urban airspace. These have used simulations of aircraft, yet the empirical nature of these simulations limits their use beyond the specific conditions that have been tested. Analytical models would not have this limitation, but they are only developed for general airspace, while the emergent patterns in constrained urban airspace are different than in general, unconstrained conditions. For instance, queuing and local congestion are patterns that are unique to the heavily-constrained environment. Therefore, in this paper, we derive an analytical model for air traffic in a confined airspace to find the influencing factors for its capacity. By means of a simulation of aerial vehicles, we verify the analytical model and show a relationship between the mean flow rate and mean density in a two-dimensional orthogonal grid network airspace. Results show that the entire airspace can become unstable when the maximum capacity of just one intersection is reached.

Calibrating lane-changing models: Two data-related issues and a general method to extract appropriate data,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104182,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Lane-changing is a routine but difficult driving task with important implications on traffic flow characteristics. Despite significant progresses in lane-changing decision modeling, lane-changing models are often improperly calibrated due to two issues related to trajectory data processing. First, the time of insertion (i.e., the time instant where a vehicle crossed the lane marking) is incorrectly considered as the lane-changing decision point, since the lane-changing decision is typically made earlier. Secondly, there is an imbalance between the number of non-lane-changing and lane-changing events, where non-lane-changing events typically dominate trajectory data. These issues can overestimate model performance and biased parameters. In this paper, we propose a method that combines (i) the wavelet transform method to pinpoint the correct lane-changing decision point, and (ii) a case–control design to systematically neutralize the dominance of non-lane-changing events in the data. The proposed method is applied to two NGSIM datasets to assess the performance of four representative lane-changing models. Results uncover that (i) lane-changing models are sensitive to various degrees of data imbalance, (ii) regardless of a driver’s decision time window (e.g., 1 s, 2 s, or 3 s), an analysis time window of 6 s will work reasonably well for evaluating the performance of a lane-changing model, while the optimal control-to-case ratio is 1:1; and (iii) when possible, a temporal discretization interval (i.e., an approximation of a driver’s typical decision time window) of 2 s should be preferred, while 3 s should be avoided. The proposed method also enabled us to outline a performance range for the selected lane-changing models.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimization of electric bus scheduling and charging planning incorporating flexible charging and timetable shifting strategies,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104175,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In a battery electric bus (BEB) network, buses are scheduled to perform timetabled trips while satisfying time, energy consumption, charging, and operational constraints. Increasing research efforts have been dedicated to the integrated optimization of multiple planning tasks to reduce system costs. At a high integration level, this study determines the BEB scheduling and charging planning with flexible charging and timetable shifting strategies. We first formulate an integrated arc-based model to minimize the total costs considering the power grid pressure cost and subsequently reformulate it into a two-stage model, for which we develop an effective solution method. The first stage minimizes the total operational costs including the fleet, charging, and battery degradation costs based on the column generation technique, and the second stage minimizes the peak power demand through two timetable shifting strategies. It is found through numerical experiments that the proposed integrated optimization model and solution method can achieve significant improvement in the utilization rate and reductions in the fleet size, operational costs, and peak power demand compared to the two baseline models.",0968-090X,Not found
Fleet sizing and charging infrastructure design for electric autonomous mobility-on-demand systems with endogenous congestion and limited link space,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104172,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Autonomous vehicles are to revolutionize the way urban mobility demands are served, and they are most likely to be powered by electricity. To accurately quantify the benefits of replacing existing mobility services with autonomous electric vehicles, electric autonomous mobility-on-demand (EAMoD) systems need to be evaluated and designed with the congestion effects they may cause taken into account. In this work, the congestion effects are depicted through a discrete event simulation model with state-dependent link travel speed and limited link space that allow endogenous congestion to emerge, spread, and dissipate across the entire road network. Three mathematical models are integrated into the simulation model to optimally match vehicles with waiting requests, relocate empty vehicles to potential high-demand areas, and assign low charge vehicles to charging stations based on the workloads of the charging stations. Based on the simulation model, we apply Bayesian optimization to jointly design the fleet size and charging facility configuration considering the endogenous congestion incurred by the daily operation of autonomous electric vehicles. Contraction hierarchies are adopted to route vehicles to perform assigned tasks in real-time. The proposed solution method is tested on Manhattan below 60th street, which corresponds to the potential congestion pricing zone in New York City. Experiment results show that the proposed simulation-based optimization approach is computationally tractable, and can find a satisfactory solution to the fleet sizing and charging infrastructure design problem within a tight computation budget. Excluding congestion effects at system design stage would lead to up to 14% passenger loss due to long assignment waiting time. Although the charging facility cost accounts for only 1.8% of the total cost, the number of chargers can indirectly affect the percentage of passengers that can be served through its efficiency in recharging vehicles. A charging facility configuration aligned with the fleet size can help to improve service quality and vehicle utilization rate.",0968-090X,Not found

Existing ASA studies have considered objectives associated with the slot scheduling process per se without considering the implications of the alternative schedules, represented by the generated efficient frontier, on the operational delays, i.e., the delays that will be encountered when a selected airport schedule will be implemented. Furthermore, one notes the absence of an integrated methodology that incorporates the preferences of all ASA stakeholders/experts in selecting the most preferable airport schedule. This gap becomes more evident when considering the dearth of empirical data with respect to ASA scheduling performance metrics. The ASA framework proposed herein taps the above gaps by considering operational delays and eliciting airport slot schedules through the integration of multi-stakeholder preferences.

This paper presents a full field-of-view asphalt pavement deformation inspection framework based on multi-dimensional surface data and machine learning, which can detect and measure pavement rutting, roughness and large-span deformation simultaneously. In this integrated system, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) classification and localization models are developed for two-step rutting detection. The quarter-car model with multiple measuring lines is employed for full-lane international roughness index (IRI) measurement and spatial analysis. The unsupervised K-means convolutional neural network (K-CNN) model is proposed for large-span deformation detection. The results show that the overall F1 scores of rutting classification and localization are 99.56% and 97.24%, respectively.

Two design aspects of on-demand mobility systems are: (i) the matching mechanism between idle ride-sourcing vehicles and passenger travel requests (i.e., vehicle–passenger matching) and (ii) the repositioning mechanism of idle vehicles. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic non-equilibrium dynamic model of ride-sourcing systems with capabilities of investigating the efficiency of vehicle–passenger matching and idle vehicle repositioning methods. A spatio-temporal vehicle–passenger matching method is introduced to determine dynamically and jointly the matching time instances and maximum matching distances to minimize passengers’ waiting time (i.e., from the travel request until the pickup) while considering the network congestion levels. Designing a controller for repositioning idle vehicles to balance vehicle supply and passenger travel demand based on the proposed model is scrutinized in the companion paper (Part II). The accuracy of the proposed model and the performance of the matching method under noticeable variations of traffic congestion and passenger travel requests are investigated with microsimulation. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the model in predicting the evolution of the number of ride-sourcing vehicles in different states (idle, transferred, dispatched, and occupied) and passengers (waiting and assigned) in each region of the network.

ADMM-based joint rescheduling method for high-speed railway timetabling and platforming in case of uncertain perturbation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104150,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The operation of high-speed trains is susceptible to perturbations such as strong winds and heavy snowfall, causing them to deviate from operating schedules. A joint mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on the event-activity network is proposed to reschedule the train timetable and platform assignment jointly. Trains traveling in different directions are simultaneously considered in this model, and they can occupy the available reverse platforms in stations. Furthermore, to strengthen the robustness of the rescheduling scheme in case of uncertain perturbations, such as variable temporary speed restrictions caused by changing wind speed, the uncertainty is modeled using scenario-based chance constraints, which are then converted into deterministic constraints. Model predictive control (MPC) divides the entire time horizon into several stages. In each stage, the proposed model is decomposed according to directions. The constraints for trains traveling in different directions are dualized by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which makes the sub-problems decoupled and solvable in parallel in each iteration of ADMM, promoting real-time performance. The real timetable and line data of Beijing–Shanghai HSR are utilized to investigate the effect of the proposed method. Compared to the commonly used strategies, it can significantly reduce delays and the number of affected events.

Many congestion reduction strategies have been proposed in the past, ranging from roadway extension to transportation demand management. In particular, congestion pricing schemes have been used as negative reinforcements for traffic control. In this paper, we study an alternative approach of offering positive incentives to drivers to take different routes. More specifically, we propose an algorithm to reduce traffic congestion and improve routing efficiency via offering (personalized) incentives to drivers. We propose to exploit the wide accessibility of smart devices to communicate with drivers and develop an incentive offering mechanism using individuals’ preferences and aggregate traffic information. The incentives are offered after solving a large-scale optimization problem in order to minimize the total travel time (or minimize any cost function of the network such as total carbon emission). Since this massive-size optimization problem needs to be solved continually in the network, we developed a distributed computational approach. The proposed distributed algorithm is guaranteed to converge under a mild set of assumptions that are verified with real data.

This paper investigates the order cancellation behaviour in a frequency-based flexible bus (FB) system, which provides customized door-to-door service, considering stochastic elastic demand volume and stochastic spatial demand distribution. A two-stage stochastic model that simultaneously optimises the FB service price, FB dispatching, and passenger assignment is developed while capturing the effect of pre-booked order cancellation probability. This cancellation probability is calculated based on the pricing and availability of street-hailing taxi and FB services. The availability of FBs is derived from the underlying stochastic demand and order assignment process, which makes the model nonlinear. To solve the mixed integer nonlinear model, a two-phase decomposition scheme is employed, and then approximation techniques are implemented to make each decomposed problem solvable by commercial solvers. Finally, a gradient decent solution algorithm is applied.

Here, we develop a force-based model to reproduce the walking behaviors of pedestrian subgroups, in which the quantitative laws extracted from public datasets are incorporated for controlling their spatial configurations at different non-extreme densities. Numerical simulations indicate that our model achieves the simulation of pedestrian subgroups that coincides with empirical observations, and presents better simulation performance than existing subgroup models.

We consider microscopic details (i.e., block sections) for ensuring the feasibility of the solution from a train signaling point of view, and an even higher level of detail, to accurately represent the train speed profiles. Running time and headway time are variable, at the same time depending from, and affecting, traffic. We optimize train speed profiles by considering vehicle and infrastructure constraints (e.g., traction, slopes). The model naturally considers the transition along the normal, disturbed and the recovery operation periods. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is first developed to simultaneously optimize train orders, routes, and departure and arrival times, as well as train speed profiles, aiming at reducing total train deviation time. The MINLP model is difficult to solve; thus we further reformulate it into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model by means of piecewise linear approximation. A two-step approach is designed to speed up the solving procedure of the MILP model: first estimate the upper/lower bounds of train speeds and then solve the MILP model based on the estimated bounds of train speeds. Three instances (i.e., a small-scale line, a medium-scale line, and a large-scale network) are used to highlight the performance of the approach, verify the benefit of the integration, and its dependence on the parameters used.

Improve generalization of driving policy at signalized intersections with adversarial learning,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104161,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Intersections are quite challenging among various driving scenes wherein the interaction of signal lights and distinct traffic actors poses great difficulty to learn a wise and robust driving policy. Current research rarely considers the diversity of intersections and stochastic behaviors of traffic participants. For practical applications, the randomness usually leads to some devastating events, which should be the focus of autonomous driving. This paper introduces an adversarial learning paradigm to boost the intelligence and robustness of driving policy for signalized intersections with dense traffic flow. Firstly, we design a static path planner which is capable of generating trackable candidate paths for multiple intersections with diversified topology. Next, a constrained optimal control problem (COCP) is built based on these candidate paths wherein the bounded uncertainty of dynamic models is considered to capture the randomness of driving environment. We propose adversarial policy gradient (APG) to solve the COCP wherein the adversarial policy is introduced to provide disturbances by seeking the most severe uncertainty while the driving policy learns to handle this situation by competition. Finally, a comprehensive system is established to conduct training and testing wherein the perception module is introduced and the human experience is incorporated to solve the yellow light dilemma. Simulation results indicate that the trained policy can handle the signal lights flexibly meanwhile realizing smooth and efficient passing with a humanoid paradigm.

Optimal locations and sizes of layover charging stations for electric buses,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104157,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Public transit agencies across the world are rapidly converting their bus fleets from diesel or hybrid powertrains to battery-electric propulsion systems. To realize the benefits of the transition to battery-electric buses (BEBs) while retaining acceptable quality of service and limiting capital costs, agencies must intelligently decide where to locate recharging infrastructure. While most agencies electrifying their fleets plan to install chargers at bases where buses are kept overnight, a question faced by many fleet operators is where to install layover chargers that provide additional energy while buses are in operation during the day. To address this challenge, this work presents a mixed-integer linear programming model, referred to as BEB-OCL (BEB Optimal Charger Location), that optimizes the tradeoff between upfront charging infrastructure costs and operational performance.

Moreover, a non-equilibrium macroscopic model is developed to predict the evolution of the ride-sourcing system states. In this paper, we propose a control method to transfer idle vehicles to balance the passengers’ demand and supply of ride-sourcing vehicles by repositioning the idle vehicles in locations where there is a higher possibility of faster pickups of new passengers.

In those situations, high-quality traffic control actions are needed to reduce the delays. Existing studies mainly used prescriptive techniques (e.g., mathematical programming, heuristics) to identify the best control action. These methods have limitations in the firm reliance on deterministic parameters prescriptively or normatively determined beforehand, and little understandability by the practitioners. These drawbacks hinder their acceptance in practice. This study exploits instead past realization data to provide decision support for traffic control. The realized data describe the traffic control actions taken by human controllers, and their effects; those latter are more complex than a linear sum of predetermined parameters. We use decision graphs to identify which traffic control action leads to the best solution, in terms of reduction of delays, based on the past performance of the same action in similar conditions. We are also able to explain the reasons and the factors that lead to each suggested action. We focus on the relevant case of merging stations, where multiple lines merge as one line, deciding the relative order between two consecutive trains. The method determines the stochastic effects of the two possible decisions at merge points, which allows for choosing the best one. Compared within the framework of realized data, the action suggested is the best out of a series of benchmarks, including simple rules and optimization, improving (reducing delays) approximately 11.7% on the common benchmarks.

Managing connected and automated vehicles with flexible routing at “lane-allocation-free” intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104152,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"With the development of internet of vehicles and automated driving, individual-based trajectory control at intersections becomes possible. Trajectory planning and coordination for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have been studied at isolated “signal-free” intersections and in “signal-free” corridors under the fully CAV environment in the literature. Most existing studies are based on the definition of approaching and exit lanes. The route a vehicle takes to pass through an intersection is determined by its movement. That is, only the origin and destination arms are included. This study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize vehicle trajectories at an isolated “signal-free” intersection without lane allocation, denoted as “lane-allocation-free” (LAF) control. Each lane can be used as both approaching and exit lanes for all vehicle movements including left-turn, through, and right-turn. A vehicle can take a flexible route by way of multiple arms to pass through the intersection. In this way, the spatial–temporal resources are expected to be fully utilized. The interactions between vehicle trajectories are modeled explicitly at the microscopic level. Vehicle routes and trajectories (i.e., car-following and lane-changing behaviors) at the intersection are optimized in one unified framework for system optimality in terms of total vehicle delay. Considering varying traffic conditions, the planning horizon is adaptively adjusted in the implementation of the proposed model to make a balance between solution feasibility and computational burden. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the LAF control in terms of both vehicle delay and throughput with different demand structures and temporal safety gaps.",0968-090X,Not found

Computational experiments suggest, somewhat surprisingly, that the brute-force approach is the most effective and most scalable one, outperforming other alternatives by a substantial margin in both computing time and solution quality. Furthermore, an optimization–simulation framework is proposed to assess the system performance over a long horizon that spans multiple dispatch periods without complicating the optimization model. Using the simulation framework, useful managerial insights including the effects of battery capacity, wind condition and computing capability on the fleet dispatch operation, are generated, which will guide real-world implementations of the new business model.",0968-090X,https://github.com/profyliu/topcg

In most works, calibration is performed on trajectories of leading and following vehicles either on speed or spacing quantities, with the combination of the two plus the acceleration quantity to be considered as the most appropriate according to the literature. With the advent of adaptive cruise control (ACC) technology, there are intrinsic behavioral differences between human- and ACC-driven vehicles that are visible in experimental observations. Some examples include constant headway for ACC-enabled vehicles, string instability, hysteretic behavior, human-like response time and others. Since calibration is performed only on basic vehicle dynamics, i.e., the spacing, speed and acceleration, even after proper parametrization we cannot be certain that CF models will be able to reproduce some or all of the above phenomena and to what extend.

Online-to-offline on the railway: Optimization of on-demand meal ordering on high-speed railway,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104143,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"On-demand meal ordering on high-speed railway is an emerging on-demand service that is becoming increasingly popular. One key challenge about this service is how to design the ordering system to maximize profits while guaranteeing timely delivery. However, few related studies have been done for this new business. In this paper, we first develop a mathematical model to optimize the existing ordering procedure, which sets a deadline for order placement. Furthermore, we propose a pre-ordering policy which cancels the order deadline but ensures timely delivery via stocking up. Considering the ambiguity in demand distributions and uncertainty in delivery time, we develop distributionally robust stochastic optimization models for both the existing and the pre-ordering procedures. Cutting-plane algorithms are developed to solve the proposed models. Computational studies on a real-world high-speed railway line in China show that our proposed new policy could simultaneously increase service availability, improve the profit, and reduce delay rate.",0968-090X,Not found
Incorporating time-dependent demand patterns in the optimal location of capacitated charging stations,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104145,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"A massive use of electric vehicles is nowadays considered to be a key element of a sustainable transportation policy and the availability of charging stations is a crucial issue for their extensive use. Charging stations in an urban area have to be deployed in such a way that they can satisfy a demand that may dramatically vary in space and time. In this paper we present an optimization model for the location of charging stations that takes into account the main specific features of the problem, in particular the different charging technologies, and their associated service time, and the fact that the demand depends on space and time. To measure the importance of incorporating the time dependence in an optimization model, we also present a simpler model that extends a classical location model and does not include the temporal dimension. A worst-case analysis and extensive computational experiments show that ignoring the temporal dimension of the problem may lead to a substantial amount of unsatisfied demand.",0968-090X,Not found
Two-layer adaptive signal control framework for large-scale dynamically-congested networks: Combining efficient Max Pressure with Perimeter Control,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104128,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Traffic-responsive signal control is a cost-effective, easy-to-implement, network management strategy, bearing high potential to improve performance in heavily congested networks with dynamic traffic characteristics. Max Pressure (MP) distributed control gained significant popularity due to its theoretically proven ability of throughput maximization under specific assumptions. However, its effectiveness is questionable in over-saturated conditions, while network-scale implementation is often practically limited due to high instrumentation cost, which increases proportionally to the number of controlled intersections. Perimeter control (PC) based on the concept of Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) is a state-of-the-art aggregated control strategy that regulates exchange flows between homogeneously congested regions, with the objective of maximizing traffic system performance and prevent over-saturation. However, homogeneity assumption is hardly realistic under congested conditions, which can compromise PC effectiveness. In this paper, network-wide parallel application of PC and MP strategies embedded in a two-layer control framework is evaluated in a macroscopic simulation environment. With the aim of reducing implementation cost of network-wide MP without significant performance drop, we propose a critical node identification algorithm that is based on node traffic characteristics and assess partial MP deployment to the most critical nodes. An enhanced version of Store-and-forward dynamic traffic paradigm incorporating finite queues and spill-back consideration is used to test different configurations of the two-layer framework, as well as each layer individually, for a real large-scale network, in moderate and highly congested conditions. Results show that: (i) combination of MP and PC outperforms individual layer application in almost all cases for both demand scenarios tested; (ii) MP control in critical node sets formed by the proposed strategy leads to similar or even better performance compared to full-network implementation, thus allowing for significant cost reduction; iii) the proposed control schemes improve system performance even under stochastic demand fluctuations of up to 20% of mean.",0968-090X,Not found
A deep learning approach for network-wide dynamic traffic prediction during hurricane evacuation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104126,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Proactive evacuation traffic management largely depends on real-time monitoring and prediction of traffic flow at a high spatiotemporal resolution. However, evacuation traffic prediction is challenging due to the uncertainties caused by sudden changes in projected hurricane paths and consequently populations’ evacuation behavior. Moreover, modeling spatiotemporal traffic flow patterns requires extensive data over a longer time period, whereas evacuations typically last for two to five days. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach for predicting evacuation traffic at a network scale. We develop a dynamic graph convolutional long short-term memory neural network (DGCN-LSTM) model to learn the network dynamics during hurricane evacuation. We first train the model for non-evacuation period traffic data and found that the model outperforms existing deep learning models for predicting non-evacuation period traffic with an RMSE value of 226.84. However, when the model is applied for predicting evacuation traffic, the RMSE value increased to 1440.99. We overcome this issue by adopting a transfer learning approach with additional features related to evacuation traffic demand such as distance from the evacuation zone, time to landfall, and other zonal level features to control the transfer of information (network dynamics) from non-evacuation periods to evacuation periods. The final transfer learned DGCN-LSTM model performs well to predict evacuation traffic flow (RMSE = 399.69). The implemented model can be applied to predict evacuation traffic over a longer forecasting horizon (up to 6-hour). It will assist transportation agencies to activate appropriate traffic management strategies to reduce delays for evacuating traffic.",0968-090X,Not found
Effects of threshold-based incentives on drivers’ labor supply behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104140,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In recent years, driver incentives have become a vital tool for ride-sourcing operators to deal with supply management challenges brought by a high level of labor flexibility and scarcity. However, despite its large-scale implementation in the industry, an understanding of the influence of threshold-based incentives on driver labor supply has been lacking. This lack of understanding could greatly reduce the efficiency of incentives on regulating labor supply. Thus, in this study, using an extensive ride-sourcing dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the treatment effect of driver incentives on ride-sourcing drivers’ behavior. Our results suggest that although threshold-based incentives positively impact drivers’ labor supply along the intensive and extensive margin, their effectiveness is limited by their design and drivers’ working schedules. The incentives cannot alter the drivers’ participation outside their normal schedule and have limited effective ranges within drivers’ shifts. We also find that the incentives only have an impact on drivers’ working decisions before the incentive threshold is reached and the reward collected, but not after.",0968-090X,Not found
A novel one-stage approach for pointwise transportation mode identification inspired by point cloud processing,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104127,152,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Transportation mode identification is fundamental for transportation planning and management. With the popularization of ubiquitous GPS-enabled devices, leveraging travelers’ GPS trajectories to infer transportation modes becomes a cost-effective and appealing approach. The prevailing two-stage framework of transportation mode identification usually suffer from the inevitable segmentation errors in the first stage, and can hardly achieve real-time inference. The existing one-stage framework models either require multi-source data as input or solely enable fixed-size features, which may need to be further improved. In concern of the similar data structure and semantic segmentation task for point clouds and GPS trajectory points, this study proposes a novel one-stage method to directly predict pointwise transportation modes by introducing and improving PointNet, which is a widely used deep learning network in point cloud processing. Specifically, 1D convolution and pointwise pyramid pooling structure are embedded into the original PointNet to capture local features in various granularities for better distinguishing similar transportation modes. Moreover, a post-processing algorithm is further proposed to refine the pointwise classification by taking the nearby consistency into account. Experiments on the GeoLife dataset show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.849 in identifying five transportation modes, including walk, bike, bus, car, and train.

General multi-agent reinforcement learning integrating heuristic-based delay priority strategy for demand and capacity balancing,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104218,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been studied for solving the demand and capacity balancing (DCB) problem in air traffic management to exploit their full computational potential. Due to the lack of generalisation and the seemingly reduced optimisation performance affected by the training scenarios, it is challenging for existing RL-based DCB methods to be effectively applied in practice. This paper proposes a general multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method that integrates a heuristic-based delay priority strategy to improve the efficiency of the solution and the generalisation of the model. The delay priority strategy is used to reduce the potential learning task and thus training difficulty. This study explores what features of the delay priority strategy are better suited to the MARL method. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is integrated into a deep q-learning network (DQN) to ensure the model compatible with arbitrary DCB instances and to facilitate agents to identify key sectors. This study is conducted as a part of a large-scale European DCB research project, where real data from French and Spanish airspace are used for experimentation.

To address these challenges, we present an object detector called Butterfly detector that is tailored to detect objects in aerial images. It is an anchor-free method that leverages field-based representations. We introduce Butterfly fields, a type of composite field that describes the spatial information of output features as well as the scale of the detected objects. We employ a voting mechanism between related Butterfly vectors pointing to the object center. We highlight the benefits of our method for urban traffic monitoring by (i) evaluating the recall/precision rate of our detector on two publicly available drone datasets (UAVDT and VisDrone2019), and (ii) measuring the error rate for flow estimations on our newly released EPFL roundabout dataset.

On the joint network equilibrium of parking and travel choices under mixed traffic of shared and private autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104226,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper investigates the joint network equilibrium of parking and travel route choices in the future mobility paradigm with mixed traffic of private and shared autonomous vehicles. Specifically, we consider that private autonomous vehicle (PAV) travelers need to make both route and parking choices though the vehicle can drive itself to parking after dropping off the traveler. The origin–destination-based shared autonomous vehicle (OD-SAV) ride service allows multiple travelers with a common origin and destination (OD) pair to share the same vehicle, while the routing of OD-SAVs is determined by the operator. In this context, a bi-level model is developed which optimizes the OD-SAV service fare and OD-SAV flow in the upper-level, and specifies the travel demands, route and parking choices, and network traffic equilibrium in the lower-level. In particular, PAV travelers choose their route and parking location to minimize their own travel time or cost, while the routing of OD-SAVs is subject to the decision of the operator. The OD-SAVs controlled by the operator may minimize each vehicle’s travel time (user equilibrium, ‘UE’) or minimize the total travel time of all OD-SAVs operated by the operator (Cournot-Nash equilibrium, ‘CN’). The joint equilibrium of travel and parking under either UE or CN routing for OD-SAVs can be modeled as a Variational Inequalities (VI) problem. The uniqueness/non-uniqueness properties of the joint network equilibrium are investigated. Moreover, we examine the OD-SAV service operator’s optimal operation decisions subject to the lower-level network equilibrium. Solution approaches are introduced to solve the joint equilibrium and the proposed bi-level model.

A Smart Predict-then-Optimize method for dynamic green bike relocation in the free-floating system,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104220,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Cities are facing numerous challenges such as road traffic congestion and environmental pollution. Bike-sharing, as an emission-free travel mode, aligns with the principle of green and environmental protection and serves mainly for short-distance trips in urban areas. Shared bikes pose significant issues to operators due to supply–demand imbalances across different time and space. This study proposes a Smart Predict-then-Optimize method for dynamic green bike relocation in the free-floating system, which aims to minimize the cost of fuel and carbon emissions from repositioning vehicles and the total unmet demand during the operating period. A multi-task deep neural network model is designed to predict regional inflow and outflow demand, where targeted modules are embedded to extract the spatio-temporal characteristics. Potential unusable shared bikes are discovered from the users’ travel behavior and the usage characteristics of shared bikes. Then, we build a data-driven optimization model for bike-sharing relocation and design an iterative decomposition algorithm that incorporates an adaptive large neighborhood search for relocation routes and vehicle speed optimization. The proposed method is tested on real-world bike-sharing trips in Shenzhen, China, and results show that the relocation distance and carbon emission cost can be reduced by 11.69% and 14.09% by relocating operational bikes and unusable bikes simultaneously.

An adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic for a passenger and parcel share-a-ride problem with drones,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104203,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"With the increasing concerns about traffic congestion and climate change, much effort has been made to enhance sustainable urban mobility for passengers and goods. One emerging promising strategy is to transport passengers and goods in an integrated manner, as it could reduce the number of vehicles on the road compared with the separate transportation of passengers and goods. This study proposes the simultaneous transportation of passengers and goods using demand-responsive buses and drones. Compared with the prevalent strategies that rely only on ground vehicles to integrate passenger and parcel transportation, we propose the joint usage of ground vehicles and drones to transport passengers and deliver parcels. The ground vehicles for passenger and parcel delivery are on-demand buses, which combine the advantages of the flexibility of taxis and the large capacity of public transport modes. The drones automatically take off from and land on the on-demand buses’ rooftops and are only for parcel delivery. A new optimization problem that designs the routes for both demand-responsive buses and drones is proposed and denoted as the passenger and parcel share-a-ride problem with drones (SARP-D). A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is devised; the nonlinearity exists because drone launch/recovery can occur simultaneously with request servicing by a bus at the same node. To solve the model for large-scale instances, we develop an adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the correctness of the model and evaluate the efficiency of the metaheuristic. Moreover, sensitivity analyses are performed to explore the influences of the maximum number of intermediate stops during one passenger request service, the drone flight endurance, and the unit delay penalty on the total cost, which comprises the transportation and delay costs.",0968-090X,Not found

In the co-modal system, we model one transit operator that serves passengers and provides co-modal services, one freight forwarder (an intermediary) that serves freight customers and uses freight transportation services provided by a freight carrier or the transit operator, and one freight carrier that provides services to the freight forwarder. We derive the analytical conditions under which co-modal operations can improve the profits of the freight forwarder, carrier and transit operator, and the consumer surpluses of freight customers and passengers compared with the status quo without co-modality. We also analytically and numerically compare the optimal operation decisions, the three operators’ profits, and the users’ welfare under different games among the operators (non-cooperative and cooperative games). Our results show that when the three operators are in a non-cooperative relationship, the freight carrier might have a profit loss due to the decreased freight units allocated to the direct road channel; whereas, both the freight forwarder and the transit operator would have profit gains from the co-modality. The numerical studies further reveal that to ensure a Pareto-improving co-modal system, the operators have to reduce the freight/transit service fare and co-modal transportation price.",0968-090X,Not found
Computational method for feedback perimeter control of multiregion urban traffic networks with state-dependent delays,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104231,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Perimeter control is the manipulation of traffic flow by adjusting traffic signals on the borders between regions.

In reality, such equilibrium points and the optimal reference points are unavailable in advance. With these in minds, this paper formulates an optimal feedback perimeter control problem (OFPCP) subject to state-dependent delays without given information about the optimal reference point and equilibrium point.

Air traffic density prediction using Bayesian ensemble graph attention network (BEGAN),10.1016/j.trc.2023.104225,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Air traffic density prediction is crucial to aviation safety and air traffic management (ATM). Understanding the complex spatial–temporal varying traffic patterns and the inter-dependencies of air traffic networks is especially demanding. To address these challenges, a novel knowledge-based deep learning framework, Bayesian ensemble graph attention network (BEGAN), is proposed to leverage the interactions of traffic density at different airspace grids and predict stochastic traffic density near the terminal. The core concept of BEGAN is to divide the large airspace into small overlapped gridded sections for individual training, and then assemble posterior distributions of density forecasts for large-scale prediction. The ensemble method improves the scalability of handling heterogeneous air traffic flow patterns. Algorithm-wise, a weighted directed graph interleaves the connection between different gridded airspaces. A parallel graph attention network (P-GAT) block followed by the long short-term memory (LSTM) network is designed to learn the spatial–temporal dependencies of the graph. Notably, P-GAT can incorporate existing domain knowledge into data-driven learning, such as historical trajectory paths, future flight plans, and airspace restrictions. The inclusion of existing knowledge and rules proves beneficial for air traffic density prediction in heavily regulated and controlled airspace.

An optimization model of on-demand mobility services with spatial heterogeneity in travel demand,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104229,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"We propose an optimization model that predicts the required fleet size of on-demand mobility (ODM) services at various service levels for a range of demand patterns. Both customer waiting time and spatial heterogeneity in demand are considered when formulating the flow conservation equation for the system’s steady state. The demand–supply imbalance problem is solved through vehicle relocation. Vehicle relocation is reformulated into a simple linear programming problem, and the objective function is set to minimize the number of relocation vehicles. Furthermore, indicators were defined to more effectively explain the effects of spatial heterogeneity of travel demand on the required fleet size. The analysis results show that even among regions with the same average demand rate, the required fleet size may vary depending on the spatial demand pattern of origins and destinations. The higher the ratio of long-distance travel and the greater the need for vehicle relocation, the larger the fleet size required. Furthermore, the user travel time reduction effect is maximized at the minimum fleet size and then steadily decreases as fleet size increases. Cost minimization requires more vehicles than fleet size minimization. Cost minimization may be an advantageous goal for operation of an ODM service as a driverless vehicle service. The simultaneous consideration of both fleet size minimization and cost minimization provides a required fleet size range. Although the proposed model is simple and includes approximations, it helps provide insight into ODM service design and investment decision-making. Thus, the proposed model can be used by governments or agencies to design policy or operationally optimized services. Moreover, the model can serve as the basis for the practical implementation of planned services.",0968-090X,Not found
Transitioning to multi-dimensional estimation of visual distraction and its safety effects under automated driving: A spatiotemporal and directional estimation approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104212,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Traditional methodologies for measuring visual distraction have been limiting in their approaches, treating distraction as a one-dimensional variable. This has been accomplished either by categorizing distraction as a binary variable or using surrogate measurements, such as reaction time in response to non-driving related tasks, which follow the procedures of measuring distraction from psychology. Furthermore, as human-vehicle interaction (HVI) under automated driving has the potential to provide safety information and bring visual distraction simultaneously, there lacks an investigation on the quantitative relationship between distraction and safety due to the restrained methodologies in measuring visual distraction. As HVI-induced driver distraction plays a critical role in determining safe driving under automated driving, a methodology is highly needed to comprehensively measure the visual distraction under automated driving so that its impact on safety can be further investigated. Therefore, sticking to the definition of visual distraction, this research aims to (1) improve the existing methodology in measuring HVI-induced driver distraction under automated driving by focusing on visual distraction and mathematically describing it from spatiotemporal and directional dimensions; (2) theoretically investigate how the quantified visual distraction influences driving safety and (3) quantify the relationship between distraction and safety with introducing the “distraction-safety” ratio. Drivers’ fixation behaviors are used in quantifying visual distraction, which is measured by spatiotemporal and directional relationships between drivers’ visual attention and the attention that indicates “zero distraction”. Three newly added performance measures in quantifying HVI-induced visual distraction are real-time magnitudes, real-time directions, and intensities (cumulation of magnitudes over time). To validate the proposed methods, a verification study was conducted by recruiting drivers to test automated driving under Level 3 automation. Drivers are required to wear an eye-tracker and go through two scenarios interacting with jaywalkers where takeover actions are needed with two takeover warnings (“visual-only” and “visual & audible”). Per past studies, takeover time was measured in representing distraction level. As a result, this study confirms the validity of the proposed methods by revealing the significant and positive correlations between the measured distraction intensity and the takeover time. Discussions of the quantified visual distraction from the spatiotemporal and directional perspective further enhance the understanding of HVI-induced driver distraction under automated driving through multiple dimensions. Furthermore, this research reveals how distracted driving affects safety under automated driving through the takeover performance. Thresholds under visual distraction magnitudes and degrees that lead to traffic conflicts were identified. More importantly, a “distraction-safety” ratio that quantifies the relationship between visual distraction and safety benefits is proposed. The results suggest that the “visual & audible” is more effective in significantly enhancing safety while aggregating a significantly smaller amount of visual distraction. The contribution of this research is to re-define the methodological approach of measuring visual distraction by (1) measuring distraction multi-dimensionally and (2) establishing a “distraction-safety” system in quantitatively assessing the balance of safety benefits and the HVI-induced visual distraction magnitude under automated driving environment.",0968-090X,Not found

Slot allocation for a multiple-airport system considering airspace capacity and flying time uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104185,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Prior research on slot allocation has focused on a single airport, with little attention paid to the multiple-airport systems (MAS) that consist of at least two major airports. Scheduled flights at different airports may have conflicts regarding shared fixes (i.e., route points) or routes, thus causing airspace congestion and flight delays. Traffic demand at a critical fix depends on both the departure/arrival time of the flights and the flying times between the airport and the fix, whereas flying times exhibit a stochastic nature due to various factors such as air traffic control strategies, aircraft performance, and weather. In this paper, we develop a chance-constrained slot allocation model for an MAS that optimizes slot allocation for multiple airports while considering fix capacity constraints. To capture the uncertainty of flying times, stochastic chance constraints are formulated and a scenario generation method is proposed to solve the model. We apply our model to allocate slots in the MAS of Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay area. The results show that the schedules generated by the proposed model outperform those from the certainty model and the original schedules. Traffic flow at critical fixes is more robust to various operating scenarios with the cost of a small number of increased slot displacements. Our findings highlight the importance of flying time uncertainty in allocating slot and airspace capacity, and the proposed model provides a useful tool for slot coordinators seeking to effectively manage airport slots in an MAS.",0968-090X,Not found
Forecasting passenger flows and headway at train level for a public transport line: Focus on atypical situations,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104195,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper proposes a computer vision framework based on deep learning approaches for the real-time prediction of passenger loads and train headways in a metro line in an urban transit network.

The train journeys on the metro line are represented as images, with the pixels denoting the train data, including the departure location, time, and load. Metro line applicative constraints, e.g., irregular time sampling of trains and univariate space, are considered in the images. Several deep learning-based architectures are investigated, including two new architectures based on transformers. Finally, an in-depth analysis and comparison of the models is performed based on a real test case of Paris metro line 9, for which a large database was collected over three years. This allowed us to include numerous instances with atypical transport system performance indicators (e.g., strikes, lockdowns, and disruptions) and to design a methodology (based on a latent space representation of the dataset) to identify and label interesting test cases.

Structure-free model-based predictive signal control: A sensitivity analysis on a corridor with spillback,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104174,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Model-based predictive signal control is a popular method to pro-actively control traffic and to reduce the effects of congestion in urban networks. In combination with structure-free controllers, which adapt signal settings in arbitrary order and combination (no imposed cycles), these predictive control methods have a high potential to increase system performance by adapting to individual vehicle patterns, which are increasingly available due to new technology. However, most of these control methods assume perfect predictions, while in practice there are prediction errors due to various reasons. In this paper, the sensitivity of the system performance to these prediction errors is analyzed, for an urban corridor with spillback. In a microscopic simulator, first the ideal world is created for the structure-free model-based predictive signal controller, in which perfect predictions are made and the controller can reach its optimal performance. Then prediction errors are introduced in this perfect world, distinguished in aggregation errors that arise using a macroscopic prediction model and biases that represent structural errors in the prediction model or in its demand and state input. The effects of these prediction errors on the system performance are analyzed, as a function of the prediction horizon and update frequency of the control system. The results show that, even under errors, longer prediction horizons lead to better performance, up to a certain optimal prediction horizon length. A high update frequency dampens the influence of prediction errors, enabling the structure-free controller to correct mistakes faster. However, there remains a significant performance loss due to aggregation errors and biases in the prediction model, indicating a promising performance gain of more reliable predictions and the incorporation of information on individual vehicles in future control applications. Moreover, for all model quantities one direction of the bias has more impact on the system performance than the other direction, indicating guidelines towards a more robust control system that suffers less from erroneous predictions.",0968-090X,Not found
TD3LVSL: A lane-level variable speed limit approach based on twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient in a connected automated vehicle environment,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104221,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Variable speed limit (VSL) control plays a vital role in the emerging connected automated vehicle highway (CAVH) system, which can alleviate recurrent traffic congestion caused by capacity drop and accidents. However, the effect of the VSL on improving traffic efficiency is still controversial. It is necessary to study how to explore the potential benefits of the VSL by balancing its influence on reducing crash risk and enhancing traffic efficiency. To fill the technological gap above, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based lane-level VSL (LVSL) control approach to conduct refined traffic control on the mainlines. Firstly, an actor-critic framework is developed to generate and evaluate the discrete speed limits of each lane in continuous action space. To optimize traffic control performance, a hybrid reward function is developed by synchronously considering traffic safety and traffic efficiency of the bottleneck area. Then, to solve the overestimation bias problem of the actor-critic methods caused by function approximation error, a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method is introduced to train the framework of the LVSL method. Finally, a real-world recurrent bottleneck of the State Route 91 highway in California is simulated with consideration of the connected automated vehicles to examine the performance of the TD3-based LVSL (TD3LVSL) controller. The simulation results reveal that the proposed method is capable of reducing crash risk and improving traffic efficiency synchronously. Compared with the LVSL controller based on the deep deterministic policy gradient approach, the TD3LVSL controller shows better performance in terms of traffic safety and efficiency.

An exact method for vessel emission monitoring with a ship-deployed heterogeneous fleet of drones,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104198,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Using drones to monitor vessel emissions has received a lot of attention currently because of its advantages in ensuring compliance with the regulations of Emission Control Areas (ECAs) in the shipping industry. In the existing literature, drones are assumed to be identical and deployed at fixed base stations, resulting in sub-optimal or even infeasible solutions for vessel inspections. This paper investigates a variant of the vessel emission monitoring problem in an ECA, in which drones are deployed on Coastal Patrol Ships (CPSs) to extend their monitoring coverage of vessels, and each drone may have a different flight speed and endurance. We formulate the problem on a time–space network, based on which a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented, aiming to maximize the inspection benefit of the vessels. An exact method is proposed for solving the model. It relies on a structure-based reformulation of the original model, as well as structure enumeration, column generation, and row generation. Computational results show that this exact method can solve large-scale instances with up to 100 vessels, three CPSs, and six drones within one hour, and outperforms the Gurobi solver, the Lagrangian relaxation-based approach developed in the existing literature, and the policies adopted in reality.",0968-090X,Not found
Predicting electric vehicle charging demand using a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph convolutional network,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104205,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Short-term Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand prediction is an essential task in the fields of smart grid and intelligent transportation systems, as understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of charging demand over the next few hours could help operators of charging stations and the grid to take measures (e.g., dynamic pricing) in response to varying charging demand. This study proposed a heterogeneous spatial–temporal graph convolutional network to predict the EV charging demand at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Specifically, we first learned the spatial correlations between charging regions by constructing heterogeneous graphs, i.e., a geographic graph and a demand graph. Then, we used graph convolutional layers and gated recurrent units to extract spatio-temporal features in the observations. Further, we designed a region-specific prediction module that grouped regions based on graph embedding and point of interest (POI) data for prediction. We used a large real-world GPS dataset which contained over 76,000 private EVs in Beijing for model training and validation. The results showed that, compared with recently popular spatio-temporal prediction methods, the proposed model had superior prediction accuracy and steady performance at different scales of regions.

Departure delay prediction and analysis based on node sequence data of ground support services for transit flights,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104217,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Delays frequently occur during ground support services for transit flights. Due to the limitation of related data acquisition, the delay occurred during this process has seldom been explored. Toward the purpose of departure delay mitigation, the present research provides the node sequence data to identify the critical ground support service nodes that associate with departure delay. Machine learning techniques are used for accurate departure delay prediction of transit flights. First, the topological structure of the neural network is constructed according to the ground service support procedure of transit flights. The flight data from Shanghai Pudong and Kunming Changshui International airports are collected for delay description and model evaluation. Then, similarity of delay scenarios are illustrated and the typical delay patterns are explored based on clustering methods. It is found that there are some node sections that delays routinely occur. Third, a Bayesian network is constructed for delay probability analysis. The conditional probability table describing the impact of delay occurred during each section on the departure delay for transit flights is provided.

Optimal feedback control law for automated vehicles in the presence of cyberattacks: A min–max approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104204,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"While automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to bring a wide range of benefits to future transportation systems, emerging AV technologies open a door for cyberattacks, where a select number of AVs are compromised to drive in an adversarial manner. This could result in network-wide increases in traffic congestion and energy consumption, degrading the performance of transportation systems. Hence, it is necessary to develop attack mitigation strategies for AVs as AVs gradually become a reality. However, this is rather challenging due to the lack of knowledge of adversaries. Limited prior studies have assumed attacks with a given probability distribution without considering their malicious intention, which is far from realistic due to the adversarial nature of potential attacks. In this study, we derive an optimal feedback control law for AVs in the presence of cyberattacks. Notably, attacks are only assumed to have a bounded magnitude without being subject to any specific statistical distribution, which is not only of theoretical interest but also relaxes the assumptions seen in prior studies. More importantly, to deal with lack of knowledge of malicious attacks, we, for the first time, formulate a min–max control problem to minimize the worst-case disturbance to traffic flow. Specifically, we present a mathematical framework for describing mixed-autonomy traffic involving AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs), considering two typical types of attacks, namely false data injection attack on sensor measurements and malicious attack on AV control commands. Based on the framework presented, we derive a set of necessary conditions of optimality for the min–max control problem, based on which an iterative computational algorithm is developed for determining the optimal control (driving) strategy of AVs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via extensive numerical simulations.",0968-090X,Not found
Reducing disparities in transportation distance in a stochastic facility location problem,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104199,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper focuses on improving equity in a well-known stochastic facility location problem (FLP). Specifically, given sets of potential facility locations and customers with random demand, traditional stochastic optimization models for the FLP seek to determine the number and location of facilities to open that minimize the total cost, including the fixed cost of opening facilities, expected transportation cost from customers to facilities, and expected unmet demand cost. We show that such models lead to inequitable distribution of facilities across different regions and disparities in transportation distance needed to reach those facilities. To mitigate such disparities, we first analyze a set of measures to gauge the level of equity of location decisions. Then, to investigate the impact of the method of modeling uncertainty on equity, we formulate and analyze stochastic programming (SP) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) models that employ these measures to minimize disparities in transportation distance needed to access open facilities, assuming known and unknown distributions of the demand. Finally, we use a case study based on the Lehigh region in Pennsylvania to compare the impact of location decisions obtained using the traditional and the proposed models on equity and efficiency. Our results demonstrate how different methods of modeling equity under uncertainty can result in different location decisions with varying impacts on equity and efficiency. Notably, while prior literature shows that equity-neutral DRO models for the FLP yield robust location decisions, our results additionally demonstrate that the proposed DRO models produce equitable distributions of facilities and more effectively mitigate disparities in transportation distance than their SP and equity-neutral counterparts.",0968-090X,Not found

"Robust maritime disruption management with a combination of speedup, skip, and port swap strategies",10.1016/j.trc.2023.104146,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"A large volume of global transportation is carried out annually by liner shipping companies and it includes a large portion of global trade. Accordingly, due to the countless number of these voyages, precise planning in this field is vital to prevent severe loss. One of the noticeable issues that occur during the voyage can be natural or human disruption which is interpreted as a “delay” in the liner shipping services. Therefore, there is a need to reschedule the pre-established plan to compensate for the delays and reduce the costs including the penalties and exceeding fuel consumption. In this paper, a novel recovery model is proposed for container ship problems. This mixed-integer programming model with the use of speedup, skip, and swap ports strategies not only attempts to mitigate the dire financial consequence of the disruption but also reduces the carbon footprint. Furthermore, to ensure customer satisfaction, the alternative transshipment decision for the skipped ports cargo is considered in the model. The nonlinear model is linearized through the exact techniques, then solved in CPLEX software. As a result, the primary deterministic model could act as a “wait-and-see” solution to reduce disruption losses by up to 66% using simultaneous recovery strategies of speedup, skip and swap. However, a robust optimization approach is proposed owing to the uncertainty in delay time, type, severity, and point of disruption. This approach enables the model to face a wide variety of disruptions (that are predicted under different scenarios each of which is associated with an occurrence probability) and recommends an augmented schedule that guarantees to be feasible, optimal, and resistant. The robust model is applied in a real case from the maritime industry, and the value of robustness is reported. The results demonstrate the superiority of this model compared with others.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated design of a bus-bike system considering realistic route options and bike availability,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104192,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper examines the design of a transit system that integrates a fixed-route bus service and a bike-sharing service. Bike availability – the average probability that a traveller can find a bike at a dock – is modelled as an analytical function of bike utilization rate, which depends on travel demand, bike usage and bike fleet size. The proposed system also recognizes the greater flexibility provided by biking. Specifically, a traveller can choose between the closest bus stop and a more distant stop for access, egress or both. Whether the closest stop is a better choice depends on the relative position of the traveller’s origin and destination, as well as system design parameters. This interdependence complicates the estimation of average system cost, which is conditional on route choice. Using a stylized analysis approach, we construct the optimal design problem as a mixed integer programme with a small number of decision variables. Results from our numerical experiments show the integrated bus-bike system promises a modest but consistent improvement over several benchmark systems, especially in poorer cities with lower demand density. We find a large share of travellers, more than 20% in nearly all cases tested, opt not to use the nearest bus stop in an optimally designed system. The system also tends to maintain a high level of bike availability: the probability of finding a bike rarely drops below 90% except in very poor cities.",0968-090X,Not found
Spatio-temporal pricing algorithm for ride-hailing platforms where drivers can decline ride requests,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104200,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This study develops an algorithm to determine the pricing policy and matching rate for ride-hailing platforms to maximize their profitability by considering: (a) drivers’ decisions to accept or decline requests, (b) the spatio-temporal characteristics of networks, and (c) dynamic fleet size. We take into account the impact of pricing policy on demand, matching rate, drivers’ income, fleet size, and the distribution of drivers as the result of relocations and accepted rides, in a time-varying interconnected network. First, we transform the problem into an equivalent time-invariant one. Then, we illustrate the relationship between the optimal fares and the optimal compensation and develop an iterative algorithm to efficiently determine a near-optimal amount for fare, compensation, and matching rate for each ride. Moreover, we introduce a balanced demand pattern to highlight concordant inbound and outbound ride flows in network locations and show that the maximum profit is obtained with a balanced demand in the network. We prove that in a balanced network, drivers earn their expected income with less traveled distance if they have the option to decline rides, which implies a higher expected profit for drivers. The performance of our proposed algorithm is evaluated by applying it to the data of a real-world ride-hailing platform. We also show that the recommended pricing policy leads to profit as high as 99% of a similar case with balanced demand (as an upper limit), when applied to a real network with a light demand imbalance.",0968-090X,Not found
Mind the gap: Modelling difference between censored and uncensored electric vehicle charging demand,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104189,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Electric vehicle charging demand models, with charging records as input, will inherently be biased toward the supply of available chargers. These models often fail to account for demand lost from occupied charging stations and competitors. The lost demand suggests that the actual demand is likely higher than the charging records reflect, i.e., the true demand is latent (unobserved), and the observations are censored. As a result, machine learning models that rely on these observed records for forecasting charging demand may be limited in their application in future infrastructure expansion and supply management, as they do not estimate the true demand for charging. We propose using censorship-aware models to model charging demand to address this limitation. These models incorporate censorship in their loss functions and learn the true latent demand distribution from observed charging records. We study how occupied charging stations and competing services censor demand using GPS trajectories from cars in Copenhagen, Denmark. We find that censorship occurs up to 61% of the time in some areas of the city. We use the observed charging demand from our study to estimate the true demand and find that censorship-aware models provide better prediction and uncertainty estimation of actual demand than censorship-unaware models. We suggest that future charging models based on charging records should account for censoring to expand the application areas of machine learning models in supply management and infrastructure expansion.",0968-090X,https://github.com/fbohu/CensoredTGCN

An optimal speed suggestion and informative advice are indicated to the driver using a visual feedback. Moreover, the warning alerts during unsafe car-following situations are provided through an auditory feedback. pEDAS provides continuous feedback and encourages the drivers to perform energy-efficient car-following while tracking a preceding vehicle, travel at safe speeds at turns and curved roads, drive at energy-optimal speed determined using dynamic programming in freeway scenarios, and travel with a green-wave optimal speed to cross the signalized intersections at a green phase whenever possible. Furthermore, to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed eco-driving assistance system, user studies were conducted with 41 participants on a dynamic driving simulator. The objective analysis revealed that the drivers achieved mean energy savings up to 10%, reduced the speed limit violations, and avoided unnecessary stops at signalized intersections by using pEDAS. Finally, the user acceptance of the proposed pEDAS was evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).

Anticipatory rebalancing of RoboTaxi systems,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104196,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This study considers a RoboTaxi service, a futuristic transportation system whereby passengers can place transportation requests in real-time for a private ride.

The operation of RoboTaxi systems requires online decisions regarding vehicle dispatching and rebalancing. Dispatching assigns cars to requests. Rebalancing is the initiation of empty trips of idle cars to reduce future requests’ waiting time and take advantage of off-peak traffic hours. This study proposes an advanced method for rebalancing while assuming a simple yet effective dispatching policy. The optimal operation of a RoboTaxi fleet aims to minimize two competing values: the passengers waiting time between requests and pickups and the total distance traveled by empty vehicles. In a RoboTaxi system, vehicles may travel empty either when deadheading to pick up a passenger or while making rebalancing trips. There is a trade-off between the rebalancing effort, which includes various types of costs, and the passengers’ waiting time, representing the quality of the service provided by the system.",0968-090X,Not found

It aims to provide a modeling methodology to represent the spatial behavior of a carrier dealing with the issue of repositioning. Indeed, due to the imbalance of trade, carriers face the difficulty of finding freight for their return trips. When they operate over long distance shipments, repositioning their empty vehicles from the low-demand zone is necessary to sustain their business. Yet the mechanisms at stake by carriers to understand their repositioning decision-making process are mostly unknown and unobservable. This lack of data on carrier repositioning zone choice issues has major consequences for shipper and forwarder resource planning systems. To address this problem we develop a mathematical model to study the spatial repositioning behavior of carriers. We propose a probabilistic approach based on aggregated transport data that consists in a two-steps decision making process. The first one is the probabilistic selection of a set of repositioning candidates based on the microeconomic theory of the consumer. The second step is the choice of a region within this set through the estimation of the spatial distribution of reloading. It makes use of the graph structure of the transport data and combines a spatial interaction model and a random walk model on a graph. Using simulations, we illustrate how our methodology can be used for operational purposes to provide more transparency on carrier behavior.

Landmark selection and path planning for unmanned vehicles with position error corrections,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104186,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Unmanned vehicles have been widely used for sensing, surveillance, surveying, communication, transportation, and many other purposes. Navigation is always an essential operational function in the course of their movements. In the case of the absence of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, the positioning need of an unmanned vehicle is generally empowered by its onboard Inertial Navigation System (INS). An inherent deficiency of INS, however, is that position errors inevitably occur and will gradually accumulate over time. A feasible approach to correcting errors is to use the fixed reference points with known coordinates in the cruising environment, which we call landmarks, to calibrate the vehicle’s position when it passes by. The vehicle must choose a path along which a sufficient number of landmarks can serve the position calibration requirement. In such a context, this paper introduces a joint landmark selection and path planning problem for unmanned vehicles navigating in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) environments, in which the vehicles’ position drifting errors need to be rectified through communicating with preset landmarks. To characterize and tackle the problem, a set of new types of subpaths are defined and a bi-objective integer programming model using this building block is formulated for simultaneously minimizing the landmark deployment cost and the vehicle cruise distance. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm, which features a multi-criterion label-correcting form, is developed for searching for the Pareto-optimal solution set of landmark and path selections. Numerical and computational analyses are conducted in both 2D and 3D scenarios, in which a pair of origin and destination places are typically hundreds of kilometers apart and 4 datasets of different scales including 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 candidate landmarks are randomly generated. A sensitivity analysis reveals the impact of different position drifting increments caused by external environment interferences, varying correction abilities, and heterogeneous landmark deployment costs on the solution behavior. The influence of the number of candidate landmarks, position error limit, and error increment rate on computing time is also evaluated. All these test results conclude that the algorithm is capable of finding in seconds the entire set of Pareto-optimal landmarks and paths in real-world applications.",0968-090X,Not found
Anti-circulant dynamic mode decomposition with sparsity-promoting for highway traffic dynamics analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104178,153,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Highway traffic state data collected from a network of sensors can be considered as a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system.

Particularly, circDMDsp addresses several issues that hinder the application of existing DMD models: limited spatial dimension, presence of both recurrent and non-recurrent patterns, high level of noise, and known mode stability. The proposed circDMDsp framework allows us to numerically extract spatial–temporal coherent structures with physical meanings/interpretations: the dynamic modes reflect coherent spatial bases, and the corresponding temporal patterns capture the temporal oscillation/evolution of these dynamic modes. Our result based on Seattle highway loop detector data showcases that traffic speed data is governed by a set of periodic components, e.g., mean pattern, daily pattern, and weekly pattern, and each of them has a unique spatial structure. The spatiotemporal patterns can also be used to recover/denoise observed data and predict future values at any timestamp by extrapolating the temporal Vandermonde matrix.

Specifically, our method excludes all non-vehicle returns in each scan and retains the ungrouped vehicle returns. These vehicle returns are stored over time in a spatiotemporal stack (ST stack) and we develop a vehicle motion estimation framework to cluster the returns from the ST stack into distinct vehicles and extract their trajectories. This processing includes removing the impacts of the target's changing orientation relative to the LiDAR sensor while separately taking care to preserve the crisp transition to/from a stop that would normally be washed out by conventional data smoothing or filtering. This proof of concept study develops the methodology using a single LiDAR sensor, thus, limiting the surveillance region to the effective range of the given sensor. It should be clear from the presentation that, provided sufficient georeferencing, the surveillance region can be extended indefinitely by deploying multiple LiDAR sensors with overlapping fields of view.",0968-090X,Not found
"Efficient heuristic methods for berth allocation at multi-line, multi-berth curbside bus stops",10.1016/j.trc.2023.104269,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Transit management agencies often pre-allocate a multi-berth stop’s berths to specific bus lines so that passengers can find the right place to wait for their buses. Developing optimal berth allocation plans that minimize the total bus delay is essential for mitigating bus queues at busy multi-berth stops. However, this problem is challenging due to the huge solution space, the high degree of stochasticity in bus queues, and the resulting extremely high computational cost. In this paper, we first propose a simple heuristic method inspired by queueing theory. It is based on the idea that evenly distributing the total traffic intensity (defined as the total bus arrival rate times the mean dwell time) among all the berths would produce a lower bus delay. Numerical results demonstrate that this simple method generated very good berth allocation plans (with optimality gaps < 6 % for no-overtaking and free-overtaking stops) in seconds! It does not rely on time-consuming simulation surrogate models or numerous input data such as the stochastic bus arrival processes and dwell time distributions of each bus line. To further improve the simple heuristic’s performance (especially for limited-overtaking stops), we develop a cluster-based nested partition algorithm that can find a near-optimal plan (e.g., with an optimality gap of < 3 % ) in a much shorter time than a previous algorithm. The algorithm employs the simple heuristic plan as the initial solution. Our methods can be applied to stops with various berth numbers, different proximities to nearby traffic signals, and under diverse bus queueing rules.",0968-090X,Not found
A quasi-dynamic air traffic assignment model for mitigating air traffic complexity and congestion for high-density UAM operations,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104279,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"In spite of the significant effects of COVID-19, UAM operations are still expected to grow smoothly and healthily in the near future. If such dense UAM traffic relies on tactical planning to resolve conflicts in a decentralized control scheme, urban airspace could soon be heavily congested and airspace complexity could be overwhelming. In this paper, we propose a Quasi-dynamic Air Traffic Assignment (QATA) model, which aims to allocate traffic flows among air routes in the planning horizon in order to organize UAM traffic flows and reduce air traffic congestion and complexity within a centralized strategic planning scheme while meeting the demand and respecting some criteria. Firstly, UAM traffics are modeled as flows that operate on a 3D two-way UAM route network. Next, the QATA problem is formulated as an optimization problem involving network dynamics to minimize the air traffic complexity evaluated by the linear dynamical system and congestion defined by traffic density and energy consumption. A simulation-based rolling horizon framework is introduced to decompose the QATA problem into several modified static air traffic assignment problems in each time interval. In order to overcome the limitations of conventional dynamic traffic assignment algorithms, a simulated annealing algorithm using parallel computing and a novel neighborhood generation strategy is proposed to efficiently optimize the problem. By applying the model to a pre-designed large-scale UAM route network in Singapore’s urban airspace, Experimental studies demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework and its applicability. Parallel computing can achieve up to three times faster than the original algorithm. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the value of the objective function by ( 32 . 20 ± 0 . 29 ) % in 143 . 47 ± 3 . 74 seconds at the 95% confidence interval of 100 experiments, far better compared to the representative conventional dynamic traffic assignment algorithms.

A physics-informed Transformer model for vehicle trajectory prediction on highways,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104272,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have made remarkable developments and are anticipated to replace human drivers. In transitioning from human-driven vehicles to fully AVs, one crucial task is to predict the trajectories of the subject vehicle and its surrounding vehicles in real time. Most existing methods of vehicle trajectory prediction on highways are based on physical models or purely data-driven models. However, they either yield unsatisfactory prediction performance or lack model interpretability and physical implications. This paper proposes a Physics-Informed Deep Learning framework that fully leverages the advantages of data-driven and physics-based models to go beyond the existing models. We use the Transformer neural network architecture with self-attention as Physics-Uninformed Neural Network (PUNN) and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as physical model to construct of Physics-Informed Transformer-Intelligent Driver Model (PIT-IDM). Extensive experiments have been conducted on two datasets with different traffic environments, i.e., Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) data in the US and the Ubiquitous Traffic Eyes (UTE) data in China, to verify model accuracy and efficiency. Compared with the three kinds of baselines by relative and absolute measures of effectiveness, the best performing PIT-IDM reduces longitudinal trajectory prediction errors for long horizons by 5%-50%, some even reduced up to 70%. Extensive empirical analyses have been carried out to verify its excellent spatio-temporal transferability and explore the physics-informed mechanism underlying this deep learning method. The training and inference time analysis indicates that although it takes longer to train PIT-IDM, it requires fewer calls and accumulates fewer errors with less computation time in real-world applications. The overall results further validate the efficacy of this Physics-Informed Deep Learning framework in enhancing model accuracy, interpretability, and transferability.",0968-090X,https://github.com/qcl-0218/Physics-informed-Transformer-IDM
A quantile-regression physics-informed deep learning for car-following model,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104275,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Car-following models have been extensively studied using either theory-driven models or data-driven models. On the other hand, theory-driven models have low accuracy, whereas data-driven models have poor interpretability and require a high-quality training dataset. Furthermore, the majority of studies focused on predicting short-term trajectory based on a single vehicle. This paper aims to combine physics knowledge with deep learning and stochasticity to completely capture the genuine regularities of car-following behaviors, leveraging the benefits of both physics-based (interpretability) and deep learning-based (data-efficient and generalizability) models. We design a quantile-regression physics-informed deep learning car-following model (QRPIDL-CF). The physics-informed computational graph is integrated with a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (abbreviated as PIDL). By incorporating the quantile regression to the loss function of the PIDL model, stochastic behaviors can be produced without prior assumptions of drivers. To validate the proposed model, data from a 25-vehicle platoon experiment was used. The prediction results prove that given the first vehicle’s trajectory and other vehicles’ initial states, it can preserve the high precision in learning car-following behaviors and introduce small disturbances into car-following in a vehicle-platoon just the same as the real driving process. The trajectory prediction of the whole platoon shows that the proposed hybrid QRPIDL-CF model can better perform the macro-traffic behavior of car-following than every single model from the hybrid QRPIDL-CF model.",0968-090X,Not found
A parsimonious enhanced Newell's model for accurate reproduction of driver and traffic dynamics,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104276,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This paper investigates the stimulus–response behavior between leader and follower in car-following, based on vehicle trajectories in the prevailing field experiments. The analysis result indicates that the follower’s reaction time is time-varying, which can change significantly or keep a constant value for some time; and the follower cannot accurately track the leader in car following, which results in a residual from the follower’s speed. Inspired by the findings, this paper proposes a parsimonious enhanced Newell’s car-following model incorporating the stochastic reaction time and the fluctuation around the vehicle’s desired speed subject to the mean reversion process. The numerical experiment is carried out. It is shown that the proposed model can qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce the following important field observations: (i) the spontaneous formation and evolution of traffic oscillations, (ii) the concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations, (iii) the oscillations’ amplitude and frequency, (iv) the stochastic reproduction of individual trajectories, and (v) the linear speed-capacity relationship.

Optimal convoy composition for virtual coupling trains at junctions: A coalition formation game approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104277,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This paper presents a virtual coupling (VC) train convoy composition optimization framework to create a multiple formation structure maximizing the capacity benefit while considering transportation requirements and system limitations. First, the operational constraints of VC trains in the convoy formation process are mapped as headway time transitions. A coordination strategy is proposed by utilizing the natural deceleration process at junctions to minimize the negative effects of the coupling process. Multiple composition structures are created by forming varied potential convoys that adhere to these constraints and transportation schedules. Second, a utility function for convoy composition is modeled using the coalition formation game theory to quantify the operational efficiency of VC trains passing through bottleneck sections. It reveals that coupling time and convoy structure are interdependent factors that jointly impact the capacity benefits. Thirdly, a train convoy formation algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal convoy composition by comparing formation structures, designing preference relations, and estimating lower bounds. This algorithm guarantees the convergence of the optimal structure result. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated on four typical rail transit market segments and transportation organization scenarios. The application results demonstrate that the optimized convoy structures increase capacity benefits in the four typical market segments by 26.1%, 30.7%, 24.7%, and 18.9%, respectively. VC improves the capacity of the bottleneck sections by increasing the operating density.

Ramp metering to maximize freeway throughput under vehicle safety constraints,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104267,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Ramp Metering (RM) is one of the most effective control techniques to alleviate freeway congestion. We consider RM at the microscopic level subject to vehicle following safety constraints for a freeway with arbitrary number of on- and off-ramps. The arrival times of vehicles to the on-ramps, as well as their destinations are modeled by exogenous stochastic processes. Once a vehicle is released from an on-ramp, it accelerates towards the free flow speed if it is not obstructed by another vehicle; once it gets close to another vehicle, it adopts a safe gap vehicle following behavior. The vehicle exits the freeway once it reaches its destination off-ramp. We design traffic-responsive RM policies that maximize the throughput. For a given routing matrix, the throughput of a RM policy is characterized by the set of on-ramp arrival rates for which the queue sizes at all the on-ramps remain bounded in expectation. The proposed RM policies operate under vehicle following safety constraints, where new vehicles are released only if there is sufficient gap between vehicles on the mainline at the moment of release. Furthermore, the proposed policies work in synchronous cycles during which an on-ramp does not release more vehicles than the number of vehicles waiting in its queue at the start of the cycle. All the proposed policies are reactive, meaning that they only require real-time traffic measurements without the need for demand prediction. However, they differ in how they use the traffic measurements. In particular, we provide three different mechanisms under which each on-ramp either: (i) pauses release for a time interval before the next cycle begins, or (ii) adjusts the release rate during a cycle, or (iii) adopts a conservative safe gap criterion for release during a cycle. The throughput of the proposed policies is characterized by studying stochastic stability of the induced Markov chains, and is proven to be maximized when the merging speed at all the on-ramps equals the free flow speed. Simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of our policies and compare with a well-known RM policy from the literature which relies on local traffic measurements.",0968-090X,Not found
A novel spatio-temporal generative inference network for predicting the long-term highway traffic speed,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104263,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Accurately predicting the highway traffic speed can reduce traffic accidents and transit time, which is of great significance to highway management. Three essential elements should be considered in the long-term highway traffic speed prediction: (1) adaptability to speed fluctuation, (2) exploring the spatio-temporal correlation effectively, and (3) prediction of non-error propagation. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal generative inference network (STGIN) driven by data and long-term prediction. STGIN consists of three parts; semantic enhancement, spatio-temporal correlation extraction block (ST-Block), and generative inference. Semantic enhancement is first used to model the contextual semantics of traffic speed, improving the adaptability to speed fluctuations. The ST-Block is then used to extract the spatio-temporal correlations of the highway network. Finally, generative inference is used to pay attention to the correlation between historical- and target-sequences to generate the target hidden outputs rather than a dynamic step-by-step decoding way; it avoids long-term prediction error propagation in the spatial and temporal dimensions. The evaluation experiments use the monitoring data of highway in Yinchuan City, Ningxia Province, China. For long-term highway speed prediction, the experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the baseline methods.",0968-090X,https://github.com/zouguojian/STGIN
Decentralized signal control for multi-modal traffic network: A deep reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104281,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Managing traffic flow at intersections in a large-scale network remains challenging. Multi-modal signalized intersections integrate various objectives, including minimizing the queue length and maintaining constant bus headway. Inefficient traffic signals and bus headway control strategies may cause severe traffic jams, high delays for bus passengers, and bus bunching that harms bus line operations. To simultaneously improve the level of service for car traffic and the bus system in a multi-modal network, this paper integrates bus priority and holding with traffic signal control via decentralized controllers based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). The controller agents act and learn from a synthetic traffic environment built with the microscopic traffic simulator SUMO. Action information is shared among agents to achieve cooperation, forming a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. The agents simultaneously aim to minimize vehicles' total stopping time and homogenize the forward and backward space headways for buses approaching intersections at each decision step. The Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm is applied to manage the continuity of the state space. The tradeoff between the bus transit and car traffic objectives is discussed using various numerical experiments. The introduced method is tested in scenarios with distinct bus lane layouts and bus line deployments. The proposed controller outperforms model-based adaptive control methods and the centralized RL method regarding global traffic efficiency and bus transit stability. Furthermore, the remarkable scalability and transferability of trained models are demonstrated by applying them to several different test networks without retraining.",0968-090X,Not found
Convexification approaches for regional route guidance and demand management with generalized MFDs,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104245,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Traffic congestion is one of the main concerns in big cities with many adverse socioeconomic effects. A promising solution is to simultaneously regulate the admission of vehicles (i.e., demand management) and redistribute traffic flows within the network (i.e., route guidance). In this work, we integrate demand management with route guidance within a Model Predictive Control framework using regional traffic dynamics with generalized Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) shapes. Dealing with generalized MFD shapes is challenging due to the resulting nonlinear and non-convex optimization formulation. To tackle this challenge, we develop two real-time solution approaches: (i) a successive convexification approach that constructs convex bounding sets for all nonlinear terms, and (ii) a linear approximation approach that solves the problem using triangular macroscopic fundamental diagram approximations. The proposed approaches offer a trade-off between execution speed and solution quality, as the linear approximation approach runs faster while the successive convexification approach yields better quality and accuracy solutions. Macroscopic simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the successive convexification and linear approximation approaches yielding an optimality gap of less than 3.5% and 10% in all considered cases, respectively. Furthermore, both approaches outperform a state-of-practice nonlinear solver in terms of solution quality and execution time.

Bi-objective optimization of last-train timetabling with multimodal coordination in urban transportation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104260,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"When urban rail transit (URT) does not provide 24-hour services, passengers who travel at late night may not be able to reach their destinations with only URT trains. As a result, passengers have to find alternative transport means, or combine URT trains with other transport services to fulfill their journeys. This paper investigates the integrated optimization of last train timetabling and bridging service design with consideration of passenger path choices. Two bridging services are considered: taxis and buses. Based on pre-constructed path sets, a bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed, aiming at minimizing total passenger travel time and total passenger travel cost. To reduce the model scale and improve solution efficiency, three path dominance principles are proposed to remove redundant passenger paths without loss of optimality. An adaptive iterative algorithm is designed to obtain the Pareto frontier curve. The proposed model and solution methods are demonstrated on the Chengdu URT network. Results indicate that passenger travel costs and travel times can be significantly reduced by the integrated optimization.

On the assessment of the dynamic platoon and information flow topology on mixed traffic flow under connected environment,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104265,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"It has been well documented that the mixed traffic flow of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) causes an unsound communication environment and weakens the beneficial effect of CAVs. However, the communication heterogeneity in the mixed traffic, which leads to incomplete information flow topology (IFT) and further affects the processes of vehicle control and platoon operation, did not receive its deserved attention. In contrast to previous research related to the IFT and platoons in static size, this study introduced the multi-anticipation and dynamic platoons into a more complex mixture of CAVs and HDVs and jointly considered the mode transition and driver uncertainties, e.g., estimation error and driving compliance. Specifically, we proposed multi-class generic controls to represent the basic longitudinal maneuver for each type of vehicle and developed customized car-following dynamics for each controller. In order to better adapt to the communication heterogeneity in the mixed traffic, we defined a novel controller for CAVs, namely mixed AV-CAV vehicle (MACV) controller and developed the corresponding control algorithm, namely AV-CAV integrated control (ACIC) with multi-source information from both sensors system and inter-vehicle communication. Besides, another important point worth considering in mixed traffic is the spatial distribution of CAVs in platoons. As such, three platoon policies, i.e., the cross policy, the continuum policy, and the random policy, were investigated. To our best knowledge, this is a new attempt to discuss the impact of platoon policies on mixed traffic, with a combination of different IFTs. Finally, multiple traffic flow characteristics, covering robustness, efficiency, safety, and emission, were assessed by calculating their corresponding surrogate measures. Results showed that the proposal of MACV controller and ACIC was expected to efficiently prevent the deleterious degradation from the CAV controller to AV controller and construct a more stable transition for changes in vehicle controls. Furthermore, a high proportion of communicable vehicles could significantly reduce the heterogeneity of mixed traffic and improve traffic flow characteristics. Besides, this study demonstrated the outstanding performance of multi-anticipative IFTs compared to the single-anticipative IFT and revealed the advantage of cross policy in traffic robustness and safety. These findings can help provide feasible solutions for IFTs, platoon operation, and vehicle control in the mixed traffic flow and identify their respective benefits in terms of traffic flow characteristics.",0968-090X,Not found
Deep trip generation with graph neural networks for bike sharing system expansion,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104241,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Bike sharing is emerging globally as an active, convenient, and sustainable mode of transportation. To plan successful bike-sharing systems (BSSs), many cities start from a small-scale pilot and gradually expand the system to cover more areas. For station-based BSSs, this means planning new stations based on existing ones over time, which requires prediction of the number of trips generated by these new stations across the whole system. Previous studies typically rely on relatively simple regression or machine learning models, which are limited in capturing complex spatial relationships. Despite the growing literature in deep learning methods for travel demand prediction, they are mostly developed for short-term prediction based on time series data, assuming no structural changes to the system. In this study, we focus on the trip generation problem for BSS expansion, and propose a graph neural network (GNN) approach to predicting the station-level demand based on multi-source urban built environment data. Specifically, it constructs multiple localized graphs centered on each target station and uses attention mechanisms to learn the correlation weights between stations. We further illustrate that the proposed approach can be regarded as a generalized spatial regression model, indicating the commonalities between spatial regression and GNNs. The model is evaluated based on realistic experiments using multi-year BSS data from New York City, and the results validate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods. We also demonstrate the interpretability of the model for uncovering the effects of built environment features and spatial interactions between stations, which can provide strategic guidance for BSS station location selection and capacity planning.",0968-090X,https://github.com/XikunHuang/daily_paper

In particular, the significant size (i.e., number of distinct flows) and high number of modalities (produced by a high-resolution zoning) of OD-matrices call for an adapted, fast algorithm that can efficiently anonymise them. In this paper, we develop a lightweight approach for the k -anonymisation of OD-matrices that exploits the low dimension of the data to explore a larger solution space than regular generalisation algorithms, while keeping relevant restrictions of the search space in order to be scalable on matrices with high number of flows.

Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) AutoRegresive eXogenous (ARX) prediction models of crowd dynamics have been effectively used in Linear Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) that adaptively regulate the movement of people to avoid overcrowding. However, an open research question is whether Multiple-Input, State-space, and Nonlinear modeling approaches may improve MPC control performance through better prediction capabilities. This paper considers a simulated controlled evacuation scenario, where evacuees in a long corridor dynamically receive speed instructions to modulate congestion at the exits. We aim to investigate Multiple-Input-Single-Output (MISO) prediction models such that the inputs are the control action (speed recommendation) and pedestrian flow measurement, and the output is the local density of the pedestrian outflow. State-space and Input–output MISO models, linear and neural, are identified using a data-driven approach in which input–output datasets are generated from strategically designed microscopic evacuation simulations. Different estimation algorithms, including the subspace method, prediction error minimization, and regularized AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) model reduction, are evaluated and compared. Finally, to investigate the importance of measuring and modeling the pedestrian inflow, the case in which the models’ structure is defined as a Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) system has been explored, where the pedestrian inflow is considered an unmeasured input disturbance. This study has important implications for the design of more effective MPC controllers for regulating pedestrian flows. We found that the prediction error minimization algorithm performs best and that nonlinear state-space modeling does not improve prediction performance. The study suggests that modeling the inner state of the evacuation process through a state-space model positively influences predicting system dynamics. Also, modeling pedestrian inflow improves prediction performance from a predefined prediction horizon value.

On the obtained traffic causal network, percolation is used to identify smaller dependency clusters, which will merge into a giant dependency cluster at the percolation criticality. Critical dependency links contributing to the formation of the giant dependency cluster have been also detected. Moreover, the power-law distribution of finite-size dependency cluster sizes at criticality has been investigated, where the estimated exponent can be related to the log-normal degree distribution of the causal network. Finally, we illustrate how the identified dependency clusters impact the road network reliability.

This paper aims to theoretically justify the best objective function and propose an optimal integrated control model. A speed-maximization trajectory optimization model is proposed based on the queue theory. The optimization model is formulated as a discrete-time mixed integer programming model based on the trajectory analysis. Through extensive numerical simulations with platooning and turning movements, the optimization model achieves better system performance than state-of-the-art methods. The results validate the advantages of maximizing the average speed using the discrete-time trajectory modeling method.",0968-090X,Not found
Effects of loop detector position on the macroscopic fundamental diagram,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104239,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Loop detectors are probably the widest-used technology for traffic state estimation. Previous research has shown that loop detector positions within the link significantly affect the estimation of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) of a given network. This paper examines the biases produced by the positioning of loop detectors on the MFD, using both analytical and simulation methods, as well as empirical data from UTD19. We confirm earlier results that a uniform distribution of loop detector positions reduces the bias. We discovered that: (i) subsets of the MFD determined by the loop detector position can help estimate whether the loop detector MFD will have a bias; (ii) non-uniform distribution of loop detectors is more likely to cause a discrepancy in the position subsets of the MFD, particularly if detectors in the network are positioned more downstream with a greater variation; and (iii) a lower ratio of link length to green signal time increases the possibility of bias in loop detector MFD, while the impact of the aggregation interval was found to be negligible. This research opens the possibility for the bias of MFD induced by the loop detector data to be corrected by only using itself.",0968-090X,Not found
Stochastic conformal anomaly detection and resolution for air traffic control,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104259,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Safety is of the utmost importance in the air traffic system. In recent years, data-driven algorithms have emerged to identify anomalous and potentially unsafe operations based on machine learning techniques. Although many algorithms have shown notable progress in anomaly detection, they have hardly considered the fact that data can be corrupted by noise and uncertainty (e.g., navigation system error) can lead to frequent misdetection and false alarms, which could disturb air traffic controllers and result in system performance degradation. Therefore, an accurate and reliable assessment of emerging safety risks that accounts for and alleviates the effect of uncertainty in data is required for safe and efficient airspace operations. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a conformal prediction-based framework that explicitly examines uncertainty for reliable anomaly detection and learns online from new streaming data. In addition to supporting the monitoring task of air traffic controllers, the proposed method takes one step forward and provides support for the control task, by offering a resolution strategy when anomaly probability violates the predefined threshold. The proposed method is demonstrated with real air traffic data, called automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast data.",0968-090X,Not found

Motivated by a ride service platform, this paper investigates a short-term vehicle rebalancing problem under demand uncertainty in the presence of contextual data. We deploy a novel data-driven robust optimization approach that takes a direct path from “Data” to “Decision” instead of the predict-then-optimize paradigm and leverages the prediction problem structure to seamlessly integrate demand predictions with optimization models. We further develop a risk-based uncertainty set to evaluate how well uncertain demand is estimated from contextual data by prediction models, and discuss the classes of prediction models that are highly compatible with robust optimization models. Based on the convex analysis and duality theory, we reformulate the original models into equivalent Mixed Integer Second Order Cone Programmings (MISOCPs) that are solvable via state-of-the-art commercial solvers. To solve large-scale instances, we utilize the affine decision rule technique to derive polynomial-sized reformulations.

However, a lack of individual-level data on driver behavior has thus far impeded a deeper understanding. This paper taxonomizes and estimates perceived switching and multi-homing frictions on mobility platforms. Based on a structural model of driver labor supply, we estimate switching and multi-homing costs in a platform duopoly using public and limited high-level survey data. Estimated costs are sizeable, and reductions in multi-homing and switching costs significantly affect platform market shares and driver welfare. Driver labor supply elasticity with respect to platform wage is also discussed considering both multi-homing and switching frictions.",0968-090X,Not found

A safe automatic train control model is introduced, and a novel control framework consisting of two levels is designed to give an overall virtual coupling train control architecture. For the leading train, we deploy an automatic train control system based on dynamic programming. Then, considering parameter uncertainties, we design an adaptive nonlinear controller that ensures safety and control efficiency for the following trains.

Hybrid perimeter control with real-time partitions in heterogeneous urban networks: An integration of deep learning and MPC,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104240,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Network-wide perimeter control strategies have been shown promise in recent years.

This study proposes a hybrid MPC-based perimeter control method to tackle traffic congestion with uneven traffic demand loading by an MPC-based perimeter control framework in which the control boundary between reservoirs is dynamically altered. The framework integrates dynamic partitions into the prediction model to formulate an optimization, in which optimal traffic performance is achieved by iteratively finding the appropriate partitions as well as the control decision variables. Moreover, a Deep Learning (DL) based estimator is incorporated into the framework to address the hefty computational burden caused by the nesting of optimization loops. In the hybrid scheme, the DL-based prediction replaces the model-based prediction if a confidence condition can be fulfilled.

Multivariate time-varying Kalman filter approach for cycle-based maximum queue length estimation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104238,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Real-time queue length is a crucial information, increasingly needed for signal operation and signal optimization purposes. This paper proposes a novel multivariate time-varying Kalman filter approach to estimate the cycle-based maximum queue lengths in real-time by only using high-resolution vehicle loop detector data and signal timing data. The modeling framework builds on state changing points that can be identified at detector site and shockwave theory that models the propagation of traffic states in the space–time domain. The times at which traffic states change at the detector site, known as break points (e.g., free flow to jam condition, jam to saturation condition, etc.) are identified using high resolution detector data and the end of the queue is estimated using linear models that build on the shockwave theory. Nevertheless, this deterministic approach, which is previously proposed in the literature, does not account for measurements errors associated with traffic state changing points or the assumptions in the shockwave theory. Therefore, we propose a multivariate time-varying Kalman filter approach to produce a robust estimate for the cycle-based maximum queue length in both undersaturated and oversaturated conditions. Further, the developed algorithm can estimate the residual queue length and inform its occurrence in case of oversaturation. The proposed methodology can easily be adapted in practice, as it relies solely on measurements from a single loop detector that may be located close to the stop line.",0968-090X,Not found

Quadratically Constrained Linear Programming-based energy-efficient driving for High-speed Trains with neutral zone and time window,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104202,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Among the numerous challenges that are faced during the daily operation of high-speed rail, the management of the neutral zones in the catenary during unexpected disturbances remains underinvestigated. This study proposes a computerised method for managing the operations of a high-speed train with regenerative braking for passing neutral zones under disturbance to minimise energy consumption. For the first time, different mechanism-based Automatic Passing Neutral Zone systems, including the Magnetic Induction System and Automatic Train Protection, are analysed and modelled as location-based and time-based constraints, respectively. Motion constraints caused by disturbances are described by time windows. Forced coasting and air brake-allowed passing neutral zone rules are considered in these models. The original nonlinear model with location-based constraints is transcribed as a quadratically constrained linear model and then solved. The optimality consistency and its establishment condition between the original and transcribed models are analysed based on the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. A high-quality solution is obtained when the establishment condition holds. The model with time-based constraints is novelly transformed into an optimal switching point problem.

Assessing safety functionalities in the design and validation of driving automation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104243,154,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This paper aims to contribute to the comprehensive and systematic safety assessment of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) by identifying unknown hazardous areas of operation. The current methodologies employed in this domain typically involve estimating the distributions of situational variables based on human-centered field test, crash databases, or expert knowledge of critical values. However, due to the lack of a-priori knowledge regarding the influential factors, their critical ranges, and their distributions, these approaches may not be entirely suitable for the assessment of emerging automated driving technologies. To deal with this challenging problem, here we propose a testing methodology incorporating realistic yet unobserved driving conditions, distinguished by numerous situational variables, so to encompass unknown unsafe conditions comprehensively. Our methodology utilizes stochastic simulation and uncertainty modeling techniques to account for the variability of realistic driving conditions and their impact on ADSs' performances. By doing so, we aim to identify unsafe operational regions and triggering conditions that can lead to hazardous behaviors, thus improving the development and safety of automated driving functions.

Specifically, we utilize control barrier functions (CBFs) to impart collision-free behavior with formal safety guarantees to the closed-loop system. The safety of both the CAV and HVs is incorporated into the framework through a quadratic program-based controller that minimizes deviation from a nominal stabilizing traffic controller subject to CBF-based safety constraints. Considering that some state information of the following HVs may be unavailable to the CAV, we employ state observer-based CBFs for STC.

Upstream-gating merge-control for maximising network capacity: With an application to urban traffic management,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104287,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"This paper considers a simple network with a merge and a downstream bottleneck, which corresponds to a very congested part of the City of York road network - Gillygate. We focus on “upstream-gating” control strategies which hold traffic back at traffic signals just ahead of the merge to prevent the formation of a queue at a downstream bottleneck; and we also consider different ways of further, additionally, controlling the two inflows to the merge. We show, by considering the simple network, that if the added upstream merge-control uses only flows to control the two approaches to the merge then equilibrium may not exist. For example, with the “zipper” rule (which equalises the two inflows at the merge) an equilibrium cannot exist for certain feasible demands on this network. On the other hand, we show that adding upstream merge-control which equalises the two delays felt at the merge allows an equilibrium for all feasible demands on this network, and so maximises the network capacity, notwithstanding the upstream gating. This suggests that, in general, delays should probably be used to control merges and downstream queues, rather than only flows, if network capacity is to be maximised. This observation may help the design of good control strategies, using both flows and delays, for upstream-gating designed to remove or reduce queues at specific downstream locations. The equilibrium analysis in our example is supported by (i) a dynamic analysis allowing for the dynamic growth of queues in the example network and (ii) real-life results of upstream-gating applied to Gillygate in York (UK) which provided motivation for this paper. The analysis here makes reasonable allowance for the spatial extent of queues but does not consider within-cycle or cycle-to-cycle queueing dynamics.",0968-090X,Not found

Network equilibrium of battery electric vehicles considering drivers’ resting behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104305,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Driving fatigue cost is a major component of vehicle drivers’ travel costs in an intercity or regional network. The charging behavior of electric vehicle (EV) drivers, which is generally synchronized with drivers’ resting behavior, can contribute to the mitigation of drivers’ fatigue, especially after a prolonged driving period. Overlooking the impact of driving fatigue on the travel cost may overestimate the side-effects of the charging behavior for EV drivers, and result in biased flow and charging demand distribution. In this study, by considering the fatigue as part of the travel cost, we make the first attempt to investigate the impact of EV drivers’ charging and resting behaviors on their fatigue cost, and thus their travel plans and resultant flow distribution across the network. To this end, a novel network equilibrium modeling framework is first developed to capture the interaction among EV drivers’ travel plans, which specify the routing, recharging, and resting plans on a general intercity or regional network where charging stations and rest stops are deployed. When traveling between their origins and destinations, EV drivers are assumed to determine their travel plans to minimize their individual travel cost composed of driving time, rest time, charging cost, and fatigue cost, while preventing their batteries from being exhausted. The equilibrium model is then formulated as a variational inequality and transformed into a nonlinear optimization problem. An efficient solution algorithm integrating column generation and Benders decomposition approach is proposed to solve the established optimization problem. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models and solution algorithm. Numerical results validate that considering the impact of driving fatigue on the travel cost emphasizes the need for en-route charging for EV drivers with long-distance trips, and has an appreciable impact on the network flow and charging demand distribution. In addition, large-sized batteries and fast chargers may not necessarily reduce drivers’ travel costs for long-distance travel since charging behavior can be synchronized with drivers’ resting behavior and thus contribute to the mitigation of drivers’ fatigue.",0968-090X,Not found
Jointly estimating the most likely driving paths and destination locations with incomplete vehicular trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104283,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"With an ever-increasing deployment density of probe and fixed sensors, massive vehicular trajectory data is available and show a promising foundation to improve the observability of dynamic traffic demand pattern.

This paper proposes a probabilistic method to jointly reconstruct the missing driving path and destination location of vehicles with incomplete trajectory data.

Two algorithms, namely candidate set generation and best-match search algorithms, are developed to seek the most possible one as matching result. It can implement end-to-end processing from incomplete trajectory data to complete and connective paths and destinations for the target vehicle. The proposed method is tested based on field-test data and city-wide road network.

Leveraging ride-hailing services for social good: Fleet optimal routing and system optimal pricing,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104284,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"With the penetration of ride-hailing services, the impacts of transportation network companies (TNC) on network performance grow. TNC comes with a ubiquitous sensing and pricing system that may be leveraged by public agencies to improve transportation system performance. This study first formulates and solves a mixed equilibrium (ME) of personal driving vehicles and ride-hailing vehicles, where TNCs centrally assign routes to ride-hailing vehicles to achieve fleet-wide optimum. We propose a novel fleet behavior desired by TNCs, named fleet-optimal behavior with service constraint (FOSC), which provides a good compromise between total fleet cost minimization and fairness among riders. However, we show that the system state of FOSC can be far from the system optimum state. To this end, we propose a novel Optimal Ride-hailing Pricing (ORHP) scheme for public agencies as an efficient manner to intervene ride-hailing online platforms. The essential idea of ORHP is to regulate and subsidize TNCs, in exchange for guaranteed network performance improvement. Under ORHP, public agencies set the value of a subsidy for each link for any TNC rider using this link. The subsidies are provided to TNCs, not directly to riders. TNC receives subsidies, and determines the best way to provide compensations for each rider who deviates from his/her ”shortest” route, determined by FOSC. TNC’s ultimate goal is to reduce their total cost, including total fleet vehicle travel time and total compensations, subtracted by the total subsidy received from public agencies. The ORHP is likely less controversial than other pricing schemes, since it calls for voluntary participation of travelers who are provided with multiple route options. Because it is built into the TNCs’ fare system, it is cost effective to implement and hard to game. This would be a win-win: a win for public agencies to cost-effectively improve system performance leveraging TNC’s platform without building physical infrastructure or services; and a win for TNC to profit from subsidies and improve service quality. ORHP is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, solved with a sensitivity analysis based algorithm and tested on two networks implying the ORHP scheme can be effective: a small total subsidy provided to TNC can lead to significant improvement in system performance.",0968-090X,https://github.com/Jimmy-Ke404/ORHP
On the benefits of ex-post pricing for ride-pooling,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104290,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Today’s digital ride-hailing systems experienced significant growth. In this context, ride-pooling promises more sustainable on-demand transportation by allowing customers with similar transportation requests to share a ride and, accordingly, a more efficient use of resources. In practice, mobility service providers that allow for ride-pooling offer customers an ex-ante fixed price regardless of whether the customers eventually share their rides. This can lead to lost profits for providers or to customers only participating in pooling because they gamble on a cheaper solitary ride, while an eventual pooling might decrease their utility. We study the implementation of an ex-post pricing (EPP) scheme for ride-pooling that accounts for individual customers’ pooling benefits. Within this mechanism, customers receive a maximum price-to-pay information up-front, which may decrease in the event of a profitable pooling. We study the benefit of this mechanism from a customer, fleet operator, and system perspective, and compare it to the existing ex-ante pricing (EAP) mechanism. We prove that it is individually rational and weakly dominant for a customer to participate in a pooling service with EPP, but not for a mechanism with EAP. We substantiate this analysis with complementary numerical studies, implementing a simulation environment based on real-world data that allows us to assess both mechanisms’ benefits. Our results allow to analyze the difference between EAP and EPP pricing from a holistic perspective, and thus to provide decision support for mobility service operators. We analyze in which cases an EPP mechanism Pareto dominates an EAP mechanism and show that an EPP mechanism is preferable from a mobility service provider perspective. Moreover, we show that EPP mechanisms can lead to a win-win situation for operators and customers while improving system performance and reducing emissions up to 32% compared to not pooling customers.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperative bus holding and stop-skipping: A deep reinforcement learning framework,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104308,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The bus control problem that combines holding and stop-skipping strategies is formulated as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. Traditional MARL methods, designed for settings with joint action-taking, are incompatible with the asynchronous nature of at-stop control tasks. On the other hand, using a fully decentralized approach leads to environment non-stationarity, since the state transition of an individual agent may be distorted by the actions of other agents. To address it, we propose a design of the state and reward function that increases the observability of the impact of agents’ actions during training. An event-based mesoscopic simulation model is built to train the agents. We evaluate the proposed approach in a case study with a complex route from the Chicago transit network. The proposed method is compared to a standard headway-based control and a policy trained with MARL but with no cooperative learning. The results show that the proposed method not only improves level of service but it is also more robust towards uncertainties in operations such as travel times and operator compliance with the recommended action.",0968-090X,Not found
What motivates the use of shared mobility systems and their integration with public transit? Evidence from a choice experiment study,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104286,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Shared mobility, including bike-sharing, shared e-scooter, and ride-hailing, could improve transportation sustainability when substituting private car use and integrating with public transit. However, if shared mobility competes with other green modes, it cannot guarantee sustainability benefits. The competing and synergistic relationships between conventional modes and shared mobility are complex and not well-studied to date. Understanding users’ preferences in mode choice decisions among shared mobility, conventional modes, and multimodal systems can help better evaluate the impact of shared mobility adoption and support related policies. This paper presents the design and results of a stated-preference choice experiment study conducted in Indianapolis, Indiana. An integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model was estimated to identify attributes that affect travelers’ mode choices for both non-commuting and commuting purposes. Results show that (1) travel cost and travel time are significant variables and their impact on mode choice for system integration and competition is elastic; and (2) user heterogeneity can be observed through three latent variables (perceptions of shared mobility, travel attributes importance, and social values) to identify traveler’s preferences and concerns for mode choice. The contributions from this study include: (1) developing quantitative models to estimate mode choice behavior with regard to shared mobility use, and (2) identifying a set of policy guidelines for system development to encourage multimodal usage and decrease car dependency.",0968-090X,Not found
Inferring vehicle spacing in urban traffic from trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104289,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"This study presents a new method to infer the average two-dimensional (2D) spacing between interacting vehicles in urban traffic from trajectory data. In this context, 2D spacing reflects the amount of road space consumed by pairs of interacting vehicles, and is related to 2D density at the macroscopic level. Due to complex interaction and conflicts in urban traffic, the inherent assumptions in traditional traffic flow models, such as unidirectional flow and homogeneity, are often violated. Such violation challenges direct measurement of urban vehicle spacing. The proposed method addresses this challenge by focusing on the relative movement between interacting vehicles and aggregating the accumulated presence of vehicles in similar scenarios. We apply the method to a large-scale urban trajectory dataset called pNEUMA, and validate the consistency of the method through bootstrapping. By applying the method we obtain a new empirical relation between the average 2D spacing and the relative speeds between interacting vehicles. There are similarities between this empirical relation with the classical Fundamental Diagram of traffic flow in terms of shape and interpretation, and so we term it the “interaction Fundamental Diagram” (iFD). However, there are also key differences. The iFD does not represent steady-state (homogeneous and stationary) longitudinal behaviour; it describes the average amount of road space needed for vehicle interactions at different relative speeds. We believe these iFD relations contribute to understanding vehicle interaction in urban traffic, and can offer new insights for designing safer and more efficient urban intersections.",0968-090X,https://github.com/topics/two-dimensional?o=desc&s=updated
A two-layer integrated model for cyclist trajectory prediction considering multiple interactions with the environment,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104304,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Interacting with complex environments is a major challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially interacting with bicycles, because bicycle trajectories are difficult to predict. Bicycles typically interact with multiple traffic participants simultaneously, resulting in diverse and random trajectories, even sudden-change behavior. Sudden-change behavior of bicycles, which is hazardous for AVs but with sparse data, cannot be well learned by current deep-learning models due to the characteristics of “learning average behavior”. Furthermore, the current domain knowledge of explicit trajectory laws integrated into the deep learning modes cannot be used to describe the implicit decision-making of cyclists which is a major factor affecting cyclists’ sudden change behavior. Based on these observations, this paper develops a two-layer integrated framework for bicycle trajectory prediction. The trajectory generation layer is used to provide a kinematically feasible set of candidate trajectories, and then the trajectory selection layer is performed to select a reasonable trajectory by analyzing the cyclists’ decision-making. In the trajectory generation layer, the kinematic laws are first used to determine a feasible set of endpoints, and then deep learning is utilized to learn and generate each complete trajectory under the known start and endpoints. In the trajectory selection layer, a utility-based model is proposed to analyze the decision-making for cyclists, which is defined as the cyclist’s tradeoff between path efficiency and risk in the multiple interactions of the environment. Finally, the candidate with the maximum utility serves as the predicted trajectory. The reasonableness of the proposed model has been verified using the bicycle trajectory data from an intersection in Shanghai, China. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the integrated model not only exhibits significantly lower errors but also fewer long-tail samples for the prediction error. In addition, it demonstrates a higher validity of predicting cycling decisions during sudden changes in behaviors.",0968-090X,Not found
Distributed model predictive control for heterogeneous vehicle platoon with unknown input of leading vehicle,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104312,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"In this paper, a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm for a platoon of heterogeneous vehicles is proposed. The leading vehicle is allowed to be driven by a non-zero and time-varying input, rather than traveling at a constant velocity. Except for individual state and input constraints for each vehicle, all vehicles are coupled via state-coupled inter-vehicular spacing constraints and state-coupled cost functions, which maintain the unidimensional platoon formation with satisfactory transient performance. Each vehicle communicates with its neighboring vehicles, and may not know the leading vehicle’s kinetic status information. The control input of each following vehicle is computed by a local optimization problem established by each vehicle’s local information and the assumed state information from its neighbors. By designing distributed terminal control laws for following vehicles, dividing each state-coupled set into several specific subsets, and then forcing each following vehicle to optimize its state constrained in the assigned subsets, the coupled constraints and cost functions can be decoupled, and thus a distributed and parallel computing method can be adopted to compute the control inputs of all following vehicles. Based on the tailored terminal equality constraints together with the tailored terminal control laws, the recursive feasibility of local MPC optimization problems is achieved at all time steps and the asymptotic stability of each vehicle is also guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed DMPC method is demonstrated in simulation, and the advantage of the proposed DMPC dealing with the leading vehicle’s non-zero, inaccessible, and time-varying input is highlighted by a comparison simulation for heterogeneous vehicle platoon with a continuously changing leading vehicle velocity.",0968-090X,Not found
Data-driven distributionally robust timetabling and dynamic-capacity allocation for automated bus systems with modular vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104314,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The collaborative design of the timetable and dynamic-capacity allocation plan of emerging modular vehicles (MVs) is a promising solution to the mismatch between supply and demand in public transportation studies; however, such efforts are subject to high-level dynamics and uncertainty inherent in operating environments. In this study, we focus on the timetabling and dynamic-capacity allocation problem of MVs within the context of distributionally robust optimization under time-dependent demand uncertainty. The dynamic capacity refers to the number of modular units (MUs) comprising an MV can be potentially changed at different times and stops. A Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set with a time-dependent and station-wise perturbation parameter is adopted to incorporate all potential distributions within a 1-Wasserstein distance for addressing the uncertainty of passenger demand. Further, a data-driven distributionally robust optimization model that considers time-varying capacity is formulated to minimize passenger waiting costs and dispatching costs of operators over all possible demand distributions within the ambiguity set. Subsequently, an expansion that allows for flexible formations of MVs assigned to each trip at each stop is proposed, and this results in more customized operational plans driven by the passenger demand. To improve the computational efficiency of realistic problems, we design a customized integer L-shaped method to exactly solve the models, which incorporates a class of valid equalities to further speed up the computation. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches in reducing the costs for both passengers and operators compared with the practical fixed-capacity operations is verified by real-world case studies based on the operating data of Beijing Bus Line 468. Furthermore, the superiority of the distributionally robust optimization method in comparison to the stochastic programming and the robust optimization approaches is demonstrated.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-objective multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to reduce bus bunching for multiline services with a shared corridor,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104309,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Bus bunching is a long-standing problem in transit operation and ruining the regularity of transit service. In a typical urban transit network setting of multiple lines with a shared corridor, bus bunching becomes more frequent as there is more uncertainty inside the shared corridor. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been a promising scheme for learning efficient control policy in a multi-agent system, few studies have explored its applicability in multi-line transit control scenarios. In this study, we focus on a basic transit network where there are two bus lines with a shared corridor. An efficient MARL framework is proposed to learn multi-line bus holding control to avoid bus bunching. Specifically, we design observation and reward functions that incorporate multi-line information. In addition, a preference weights producer is introduced to update the objective weights towards a good trajectory evaluation during daily transit operation. In this way, we handle the multi-objective issue in multi-line control. In experimental studies, we validate the superiority of the method in real-world bus lines. Results show that the state and reward augmented with multi-line information benefit MARL in multi-line bus control. Besides, by updating preference weights towards less passenger waiting time, the regularity of transit service is further improved.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimizing the battery charging and swapping infrastructure for electric short-haul aircraft—The case of electric flight in Norway,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104313,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Recent advances in battery technology have opened the possibility for short-haul electric flight. This is particularly attractive for commuter airlines that operate in remote regions such as archipelagos or Nordic fjords where the geography impedes other means of transportation. In this paper we address the question of how to optimize the charging infrastructure (charging power, spare batteries) for an airline when considering a battery swapping system. Our analysis considers the expenditures needed for (i) the significant charging power requirements, (ii) spare aircraft batteries, (iii) the used electricity, and (iv) delay costs, should the infrastructure not be sufficient to accommodate the flight schedule.

The results show that a total investment of 4412 kW in electricity power supply and 25 spare batteries is needed for the considered network, resulting in a daily investment of €11700.

Schedule-based transit assignment with online bus arrival information,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104282,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Most public transportation services deviate from their published schedule. To cope with the delay caused by the unreliable service, passengers use online information about the bus arrival time which affects their route choice behavior. Current schedule-based transit assignment models fail to capture the passengers’ adaptive response to unreliable service, resulting in an inaccurate estimation of passenger wait time and passenger loads on various transit routes. The current study proposes schedule-based transit assignment models that incorporate online bus arrival information when modeling the passenger route choice in a stochastic and time-dependent transit network. The authors propose that passengers employ strategies when traveling between different origin–destination pairs not only due to the limited capacity of vehicles but also to cope with the transit delay. The passenger routing problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, and efficient algorithms are developed to solve this problem. Depending on the vehicle capacity, two types of assignment models are presented, namely, uncapacitated and capacitated assignments. When penalties for arriving at the destination outside the desired arrival time window are not applied, the uncapacitated assignment problem is formulated as a linear program. On the other hand, the capacitated assignment is formulated as a variational inequality problem for which an efficient Method of Successive Averages-based heuristic solution algorithm is proposed. Computational experiments are presented for a small and a large schedule-based transit network. The results show that denied boarding in an unreliable network leads to higher expected costs to passengers compared to the reliable and uncongested network. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the strategies evaluated with reliable schedule assumption lead to unreliable paths in the network and produces more transferring flow than should happen in practice. The application of our method to a subnetwork of the Twin Cities transit network with artificial demand reveals that passengers traveling from a residential area to the University of Minnesota campus may prefer taking a path with transfer in the event of highly unreliable transit service on the direct routes.",0968-090X,Not found

In this study, we address the train scheduling problem for “commuter rail-metro” systems, where the trains from commuter rail lines can go directly into metro systems to provide seamless services for passengers. To optimize the schedule of trains for both commuter rail lines and metro lines, we propose a job shop scheduling model where precedence constraints from commuter-metro networks are taken into account and develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model with quadratic constraints. Our model considers the orders of different types of trains and the safety constraints, due to different types of signalling equipment in commuter and metro systems. Since these constraints involve a set of IF-THEN rules, we prove that these constraints can be equivalently reformulated as linear inequalities, without adding new variables. To solve the proposed model efficiently, we design an iterative solution framework, which generates a feasible solution using dynamic programming, next solves a MIP model, then calculates the train speed profiles, and if train speed profiles violate the safety constraints, re-optimizes the MIP model with modified alternative constraints. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, numerical experiments are performed on small and real-world instances based on the Beijing metro Line 1 and the Batong Line operational data.",0968-090X,Not found
A constrained spectral clustering method for lane identification using trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104270,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The rapid development of information and communications technologies acts as an enabler for the successful implementation of vehicle automation and advanced traffic management applications.

However, existing methods cannot handle certain features, such as, among others, accurate of road lane identification. This paper proposes a constrained spectral clustering method to identify lane information from high-resolution trajectory data. Contrary to state-of-the-art methods, such as the Gaussian mixture model, the proposed method is directly applicable to two-dimensional trajectory data, without assuming a constant number of lanes characterised by the same lane width. The trajectory data is clustered by taking into account the neighbourhood distances and prior knowledge via defining so-called must-link and cannot-link constraints, which significantly improve the clustering results, especially in cases where the number of lanes or the lane width changes.

In this system, AMVs have the capability to detach or join with each other at intermediate stops along the route to dynamically adjust the bus formation (capacity). To increase vehicle utilization, a flexible scheduling strategy is proposed that allows AMVs to detach from one modular bus and join another modular bus in either direction of a bidirectional line. In particular, the penalty cost for each detachment or joining operation, as well as the limited number of available AMVs is explicitly considered. We formulate a unified model for the integrated optimization of the modular bus service (timetable and bus formation) and vehicle scheduling by introducing two types of decision variables. The objective is to minimize overall system costs, including passenger waiting time cost, operational costs, and detachment/joining penalty costs. The two types of decision variables are coupled by a vehicle resource consistency constraint, ensuring the conformity of the modular bus service and vehicle scheduling decisions. To tackle the complexity of our model, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is employed to decompose it into two subproblems, which can be efficiently solved using a customized forward dynamic programming algorithm and a commercial solver. The model is validated using illustrative examples and a real-world instance from the Beijing Public Transport system, and it is compared with two benchmark models.

Behavioral investigation of stochastic lateral wandering patterns in mixed traffic flow,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104310,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The vehicles’ lateral movement exhibits inherent stochastic behavior, and when considered collectively, the traffic flow demonstrates certain lateral wandering pattern which serves a fundamental input for pavement design and sustainability analysis. Naturalistic driving trajectories show that the vehicles on neighboring lanes tend to interact laterally, which leads to correlated wandering on a multi-lane road. Compared with human-driven vehicles (HDV), autonomous vehicles (AVs) have a more centered wandering pattern, which accelerates the pavement fatigue. As the market penetration rate of the AVs changes, the wandering pattern of the mixed AVs flow would evolve accordingly, which further influence pavement performances. The evolutionary wandering pattern of mixed AVs flow which considers the interactions between neighboring lanes’ traffic flow is not fully studied yet. This research fills this gap with a stochastic behavioral lateral movement model that bridges the microscopic behavior and lateral wandering pattern. Firstly, a lateral movement model is developed, which assumes that lateral dynamics are influenced by lane markings, road boundaries, intra-lane interaction, and noise. The model is expressed in a stochastic differential form. The solution of the model which gives the lateral wandering is expressed by the Euler-Maruyama scheme, Fokker-Planck equation and Markov chain. Then the model is employed to investigate the wandering patterns under different scenarios. The results show that the model's outputs are consistent with current research results and empirical observations.

Distributed data-driven predictive control for cooperatively smoothing mixed traffic flow,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104274,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Cooperative control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promises smoother traffic flow. In mixed traffic, where human-driven vehicles with unknown dynamics coexist, data-driven predictive control techniques allow for CAV safe and optimal control with measurable traffic data.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a cooperative DeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control) formulation and its distributed implementation algorithm. In cooperative DeeP-LCC, the traffic system is naturally partitioned into multiple subsystems with one single CAV, which collects local trajectory data for subsystem behavior predictions based on the Willems’ fundamental lemma. Meanwhile, the cross-subsystem interaction is formulated as a coupling constraint. Then, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to design the distributed DeeP-LCC algorithm. This algorithm achieves both computation and communication efficiency, as well as trajectory data privacy, through parallel calculation.

Motion and geometry-related information fusion through a framework for object identification from a moving camera in urban driving scenarios,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104271,155,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Accurate and robust semantic scene understanding for urban driving is challenging due to the complex object types, object motion, and as well as ego-motion. Typical approaches to this problem use the fusion of multiple sensors such as camera, IMU, LiDAR, and radar to identify the state of the surrounding objects, including distance, direction, position, and velocity. However, such sensor modalities are very much complex and costly. This paper proposes a new framework for object identification (FOI) from a moving camera in a complex driving environment utilizing only camera sensor data. The framework is capable of detecting objects, extracting their behavioral features in terms of motion, position, velocity, and distance. All of this information (referred to as object-wise semantic information) are fused in order to acquire a better understanding of the driving scenario. The work addresses ego-motion compensation and extraction of accurate motion information of moving objects from a moving camera using image registration and optical flow estimation. A moving object detection model is designed within the framework by integrating an encoder–decoder network with a semantic segmentation network. The approach involves two mutual tasks: semantic segmentation of objects into specific classes and binary pixel classification to predict whether the detected object is moving or static based on temporal information.

To address this issue, we propose a method that leverages mobile phone data as a cost-effective and rich source of geospatial information to capture current human mobility patterns at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Our approach employs mobile phone application usage traces to infer modes of transportation that are challenging to identify (bikes and ride-hailing/taxi services) based on mobile phone location data. Using data fusion and matrix factorisation techniques, we integrate official data sources (household surveys and census data) with mobile phone application usage data. This integration enables us to reconstruct the official data and create an updated dataset that incorporates insights from digital footprint data from application usage. We illustrate our method using a case study focused on Santiago, Chile successfully inferring four modes of transportation: mass-transit (all public transportation), motorised (cars and similar vehicles), active (pedestrian and cycle trips), and taxi (traditional taxi and ride-hailing services).

We quantify a reduction in mass-transit usage across municipalities in Santiago, except where metro/rail lines have been more recently introduced, highlighting added resilience to the public transport network of these infrastructure enhancements. Additionally, we evidence an overall increase in motorised transport throughout Santiago, revealing persistent challenges in promoting urban sustainable transportation. Findings also point to a rise in the share of taxi usage, and a drop in active mobility, suggesting a modal shift towards less sustainable modes of travel. We validate our findings comparing our updated estimates with official smart card transaction data.

Why did the AI make that decision? Towards an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for autonomous driving systems,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104358,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"User trust has been identified as a critical issue that is pivotal to the success of autonomous vehicle (AV) operations where artificial intelligence (AI) is widely adopted. For such integrated AI-based driving systems, one promising way of building user trust is through the concept of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) which requires the AI system to provide the user with the explanations behind each decision it makes. Motivated by both the need to enhance user trust and the promise of novel XAI technology in addressing such need, this paper seeks to enhance trustworthiness in autonomous driving systems through the development of explainable Deep Learning (DL) models. First, the paper casts the decision-making process of the AV system not as a classification task (which is the traditional process) but rather as an image-based language generation (image captioning) task. As such, the proposed approach makes driving decisions by first generating textual descriptions of the driving scenarios, which serve as explanations that humans can understand. To this end, a novel multi-modal DL architecture is proposed to jointly model the correlation between an image (driving scenario) and language (descriptions). It adopts a fully Transformer-based structure and therefore has the potential to perform global attention and imitate effectively, the learning processes of human drivers. The results suggest that the proposed model can and does generate legal and meaningful sentences to describe a given driving scenario, and subsequently to correctly generate appropriate driving decisions in autonomous vehicles (AVs). It is also observed that the proposed model significantly outperforms multiple baseline models in terms of generating both explanations and driving actions. From the end user’s perspective, the proposed model can be beneficial in enhancing user trust because it provides the rationale behind an AV’s actions. From the AV developer’s perspective, the explanations from this explainable system could serve as a “debugging” tool to detect potential weaknesses in the existing system and identify specific directions for improvement.",0968-090X,Not found

To solve this problem, we propose a dual-mode robust model predictive control (DRMPC) approach. First, by considering uncertain actuator gains and resistance parameters, the VCTS operation is modeled with safety and input constraints. Then, we put forward a dual-mode scheme to adopt a controller from two candidates. Among this, we formulate a feedback controller through the analysis of local and string stability and adopt it in an admissible region to efficiently guarantee the crucial properties. To handle the rest cases with the risk of constraint dissatisfaction, an optimal controller is yielded by solving a constrained optimization framework employing the homothetic-tube technique. Specifically, local tubes are recursively constructed online by the set-membership prediction, while considering the tubes from the preceding unit.

Matheuristics for a multi-day electric bus assignment and overnight recharge scheduling problem,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104360,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"To limit greenhouse gas emissions in the public transportation sector, transit authorities are constantly increasing the proportion of electric buses (EBs) in their fleets. Due to space and budget constraints, more often than not, the number of chargers that can be installed at the depots is less than the number of EBs in the fleet. Moreover, even if there is one charger for each EB, it is virtually impossible to use all the chargers at the same time due to maximum power grid constraints. Thus, there is a need to devise optimization techniques that help to recharge the buses in an efficient and acute way, taking into account these charging infrastructure capacity constraints. In this study, we consider a multi-day electric bus assignment and overnight recharge scheduling problem that can be briefly stated as follows. Given a set of vehicle blocks (sequences of timetabled bus trips performed by the same bus on a given day) to be operated over several days, a set of identical EBs, and a set of chargers available at the depot whose charging function is a piecewise linear function, the problem consists in assigning an EB to each block and to schedule the overnight recharging operations at the depot such that the EBs never run out of energy when performing their blocks and the depot charging capacity is never exceeded. The objective is twofold: minimizing the total charging costs and minimizing the impact of the charging decisions in the long-term health of the batteries. We first model this problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved with a commercial solver. Then, to yield faster computational times, we develop two multi-phase matheuristics based on the MILP. To show the interest of considering a multiple-day horizon, we introduce two other matheuristics that mimic current industrial practices and solve the problem sequentially, one day at a time.

Electric bus fleet scheduling under travel time and energy consumption uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104357,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The public transportation system is experiencing a substantial shift due to the rapid expansion of electromobility infrastructure and operations. This transformation is anticipated to contribute to decarbonizing and promoting environmental sustainability significantly. Among the most pressing planning issues in this area is the optimization of operational and strategic costs associated with electric fleets, which has recently garnered the attention of researchers. This paper investigates the scheduling and procurement problem of electric fleets under travel time and energy consumption uncertainty. A novel mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed, which determines the number of buses required to cover all trips, yields the schedule of the trips, and creates bus charging plans. The robust optimization paradigm is employed to address uncertainty, and a new budget uncertainty set is introduced to control the robustness of the solution. The efficiency of the model is evaluated through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation. Additionally, a case study is conducted on the off-campus college transport network at Binghamton University to demonstrate the real-world applicability of the model. The numerical results have shown that ignoring uncertainty can lead to schedules where up to 48% of the trips are affected, which are either delayed or missed. The proposed approach can also be applied to other transportation networks with similar characteristics and uncertainties.",0968-090X,Not found
No more road bullying: An integrated behavioral and motion planner with proactive right-of-way acquisition capability,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104363,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This research proposes an integrated behavioral and motion planner with proactive right-of-way acquisition capability.

In order to realize the proactive right-of-way acquisition, the game-based interaction-aware decision-making is designed, and Stackelberg competition is adopted as the game rule. The problem is formulated as a differential-game-based Receding Horizon Control (RHC) to integrate both behavioral and motion planning. An online Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is leveraged to identify the individual driving behavior of the competing vehicle in order for the enabling of person-by-person countermeasures. The problem is solved by a highly-efficient quadratic programming algorithm. A simulation evaluation is conducted on the proposed planner. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner is with millisecond-level computational efficiency. It improves travel efficiency by 4.78–25.77% with the proactive right-of-way acquisition, and enhances driving safety by 5.22–36.08% via taking person-by-person countermeasures.

A novel bi-level temporally-distributed MPC approach: An application to green urban mobility,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104334,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely used for traffic management, such as for minimizing the total time spent or the total emissions of vehicles. When long-term green urban mobility is considered including e.g. a constraint on the total yearly emissions, the optimization horizon of the MPC problem is significantly larger than the control sampling time, and thus the number of the variables that should be optimized per control time step becomes very large. For systems with dynamics that involve nonlinear, non-convex, and non-smooth functions, including urban traffic networks, this results in optimization problems that are computationally intractable in real time. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-level temporal distribution of such complex MPC optimization problems, and we develop two mathematically linked short-term and long-term MPC formulations with small and large control sampling times that will be solved together instead of the original complex optimization problem. The resulting bi-level control architecture is used to solve the two MPC formulations online for real-time control of urban traffic networks with the objective of long-term green mobility. In order to assess the performance of the bi-level control architecture, we perform a case study where a rough version of the model of the urban traffic flow, S-model, is used by the long-term MPC level to estimate the states of the urban traffic networks, and a detailed version of the model is used by the short-term MPC level. The results of the simulations prove the effectiveness (with respect to the objective of control, as well as computational efficiency) of the proposed bi-level MPC approach, compared to state-of-the-art control approaches.",0968-090X,Not found

To this end, this paper studies the problem of fixed-time cruise control for VCTS. To begin with, by analyzing the dynamic evolution of the VCTS in an actual environment, a second-order VCTS train-following dynamic model is formulated with considering actuator faults, uncertain resistance, unknown disturbances, and control input saturation. Then, an improved barrier functions-based fixed-time sliding model control method is proposed to deal with the state constraints (i.e., safe distance and speed limit). To deal with parametric uncertainty, adaptive fault-tolerant control and core function technologies are integrated into the same framework. Furthermore, by using a function approximation method to handle the control input saturation, an adaptive fault-tolerant fixed-time cruise controller is designed which not only guarantees the fixed-time stability of the VCTS but also copes with parametric uncertainty, state constraints, and input saturation.

It concerns planning a fleet of homogeneous vehicles to serve all customers, jointly deciding their speed on every arc and the departure time from each node such that the total cost of routes reaches a minimum. To our knowledge, all solution methods for the TDPRP are founded on (meta-)heuristics. In this study, we propose an exact branch-and-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm for the TDPRP. The master problem is a route selection problem formulated as a set-partitioning model, and the pricing problem is a time-dependent elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints (TDESPPRC), in which the speed and start time at each customer need to be decided.

MSGNN: A Multi-structured Graph Neural Network model for real-time incident prediction in large traffic networks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104354,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This study addresses the problem of predicting traffic incidents across a large-scale road network to support network-wide real-time traffic management. To enable network-wide incident prediction, traditional approaches either build a separate model for each target link (road segment) across the network or build one big model containing all the links in the network, which are costly and inefficient. Instead, we propose a sub-area level incident prediction model that can predict an incident occurrence within ‘any’ given sub-area across the network using a single model, where this single network-wide model learns incident occurrence patterns from a large number of randomly sampled sub-areas across the whole network. For this, we develop a Multi-structured Graph Neural Network (MSGNN) model that effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships among links within each sub-area, where multiple graphs with different structures are formed to represent different data sources for the same geographic sub-area and the combined graph embeddings from those multiple graphs are taken as input to predict a binary classification label for incident occurrence as output. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments for model evaluation. When compared with benchmark models, which are chosen from classical machine learning models as well as recent deep learning models, our model outperforms the other models in most of the test cases, showing superior performance consistently across different parameter settings (15-min and 60-min prediction horizons) and different study networks (Brisbane and Gold Coast).

The proposed planning approach re-plans in response to unexpected events and learns from real-time information from various transport modes, including road, railway, and inland waterways. The performance of the proposed planning approach is evaluated in the European Rhine-Alpine corridor under various scenarios with different types and severities of unexpected events. The results demonstrate that the RL approach consistently outperforms other strategies by effectively handling service time uncertainty, leading to reduced costs, emissions, and waiting time, as well as decreased transport delays and improved rewards through accurate decision-making and agile transport re-planning.

Real-time forecasting of driver-vehicle dynamics on 3D roads: A deep-learning framework leveraging Bayesian optimisation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104329,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Most state-of-the-art works in trajectory forecasting for automotive target predicting the pose and orientation of the agents in the scene. This represents a particularly useful problem, for instance in autonomous driving, but it does not cover a spectrum of applications in control and simulation that require information on vehicle dynamics features other than pose and orientation. Also, multi-step dynamic simulation of complex multibody models does not seem to be a viable solution for real-time long-term prediction, due to the high computational time required. To bridge this gap, we present a deep-learning framework to model and predict the evolution of the coupled driver-vehicle system dynamics jointly on a complex road geometry. It consists of two components. The first, a neural network predictor, is based on Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and fuses the information on the road geometry and the past driver-vehicle system dynamics to produce context-aware predictions. The second, a Bayesian optimiser, is proposed to tune some significant hyperparameters of the network. These govern the network complexity, as well as the features importance. The result is a self-tunable framework with real-time applicability, which allows the user to specify the features of interest. The approach has been validated with a case study centred on motion cueing algorithms, using a dataset collected during test sessions of a non-professional driver on a dynamic driving simulator. A 3D track with complex geometry has been employed as driving environment to render the prediction task challenging.

Adaptive control with moving actuators at motorway bottlenecks with connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104319,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to improve the operation of future road traffic systems. In this paper, we propose a control method that uses CAVs as dynamic actuators to improve the capacity at motorway bottlenecks robustly. The proposed approach has been designed for mixed traffic flow using the fundamental diagram model of mixed traffic flow as a control activation tool. In order to implement our approach, we assume that the availability of detectors at motorway are able to obtain the density in real-time. The idea is that assuming a certain percentage of CAVs presence on the road, such vehicles can be used as mobile actuators to perform speed coordination tasks. Furthermore, the aim is to transfer the delays observed at the bottlenecks upstream on the motorway, where the conditions are more homogeneous. The proposed approached can be generalized and used in bottleneck scenarios with or without additional inflow from an on-ramp. According to the designed control strategy, when the traffic density at the bottleneck satisfies the activation condition, the CAVs will shift to moving actuator mode and generate a new speed profile. The objective is to improve traffic flow at the downstream bottleneck and also smooth the upstream arrival vehicle speed, thus improving the overall throughput of the network. The method has been evaluated through microscopic simulation experiments conducted with scenarios on the real-case study, a motorway in Antwerp, Belgium. The results show significant improvements in reducing traffic density and improving travel speed both locally at the control area, as well as at network level. Comparative experiments under different penetration rates show that the proposed method remains robust to the percentage of CAVs on the road. Finally, it can significantly reduce vehicle delays and prevent over-congested conditions, and also improve the traffic flow rate, even for relatively low penetration rates of CAVs.",0968-090X,Not found

With progressing technology, we may see platoons with drivers resting while being in the truck, or even platoons in which not all trucks require drivers. Hence, platooning technology has a significant impact on the jobs of truck drivers especially when driver involvement reduces. Driver acceptance of this emerging technology is therefore an important factor in the implementation of platooning and, consequently, automated driving in general. In this study, we explore the range of perspectives that exist among drivers by conducting focus groups in The Netherlands. These discussions indicate that drivers foresee that platooning will eventually become a reality but believe it will have a negative impact on the quality of their work and their job satisfaction.",0968-090X,Not found
What do we head for while exiting a room? a novel parametric distance map for pedestrian dynamic simulations,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104335,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Identifying effective strategies describing crowd dynamics is crucial to enhance simulations of pedestrians for crowded event planning and management. Various modelling solutions have been proposed to describe how people try to exit from a built environment in normal and emergency. Several of these solutions rely on the use of distance maps or floor fields to account for the positions of existing goals and the location of obstacles to avoid. To date, distance maps are assumed to be static (they do not vary over time) and that pedestrians aim at the actual central coordinate of a door. In this work, we challenge the static goal assumption by proposing a novel parametric distance map which is variable depending on the polar coordinates defining the position of a pedestrian having the centre of an exit as the origin (i.e., the distance of the pedestrian and an angle between its direction and the perpendicular to the exit). In this work, we investigate what pedestrians head for while trying to reach an exit. Different parametric solutions are proposed and calibrated using likelihood-based optimisation methods with over 9000 trajectories of individual pedestrians who navigated through an indoor university atrium building to reach several exits. The results highlight good performance for this modelling approach: pedestrians head for targets in front of an exit when they are away from it, and their targets shift behind the exit as they get closer to it, (i.e., distance impact) while their angle does not have impact on this process. The proposed dynamic goal-based distance map can be applied for future pedestrian simulations for crowded event planning and management.",0968-090X,Not found

This paper proposes an equilibrium assignment method that can capture the passengers’ path choice behaviors considering both the reliability and unreliability of travel time variability in the railway network. The passengers’ travel path choices are modeled using the mean-excess travel cost (METC), which is the combination of the conditional expectation of travel cost exceeding the effective travel cost, and the endogenous advanced ticket booking cost associated with the rigid train capacity. In general, heterogeneous passengers with different risk-aversion attitudes toward stochastic train delays evaluate their travel options differently and have different requirements for successful transfer. Therefore, first, the passengers’ transfer options are modeled with the concept of METC based on the delay distribution of the two connecting trains. Subsequently, the METC of the passenger trips is calculated. A mean-excess passenger flow assignment model is formulated based on the user equilibrium condition. A path-based capacity-constrained passenger assignment algorithm is designed to solve the model.

A prediction and behavioural analysis of machine learning methods for modelling travel mode choice,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104318,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The emergence of a variety of Machine Learning (ML) approaches for travel mode choice prediction poses an interesting question to transport modellers: which models should be used for which applications? The answer to this question goes beyond simple predictive performance, and is instead a balance of many factors, including behavioural interpretability and explainability, computational complexity, and data efficiency. There is a growing body of research which attempts to compare the predictive performance of different ML classifiers with classical Random Utility Models (RUMs). However, existing studies typically analyse only the disaggregate predictive performance, ignoring other aspects affecting model choice. Furthermore, many existing studies are affected by technical limitations, such as the use of inappropriate validation schemes, incorrect sampling for hierarchical data, a lack of external validation, and the exclusive use of discrete metrics. In this paper, we address these limitations by conducting a systematic comparison of different modelling approaches, across multiple modelling problems, in terms of the key factors likely to affect model choice (out-of-sample predictive performance, accuracy of predicted market shares, extraction of behavioural indicators, feature importance analysis, and computational efficiency). The modelling problems combine several real world datasets with synthetic datasets, where the data generation function is known. The results indicate that the models with the highest disaggregate predictive performance (namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forests (RF)) provide poorer estimates of behavioural indicators and aggregate mode shares, and are more expensive to estimate, than other models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Multinomial Logit (MNL). It is further observed that the MNL model performs robustly in a variety of situations, though ML techniques can improve the estimates of behavioural indices such as Willingness To Pay (WTP).",0968-090X,Not found

In doing so, we delve into the heterogeneous behaviors exhibited by pedestrians within a single experiment and the stochastic behaviors seen across different experiments for a single pedestrian. Additionally, we establish a linear model to scrutinize the equilibrium relationship among these behavioral indicators, and further deploy the Gaussian process to shed light on the equilibrium characteristics inherent in pedestrian route choice behavior. Our findings suggest that despite the inherent heterogeneity and stochastic nature of individual behaviors, pedestrian route choice overall operates in a dynamic equilibrium state.

The multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem with interchange and perceived passenger travel times,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104353,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) introduced in the early 1980s is the NP-Hard optimization problem of developing the most cost-efficient vehicle schedules for a number of available vehicles that have to start from a depot, pick up and deliver a set of passengers, and return back to the same depot. DARP has been used in many modern applications, including the scheduling of demand-responsive transit and car pooling. This study departs from the original definition of DARP and it extends it by considering an interchange point where vehicles can exchange their picked-up passengers with other vehicles in order to shorten their delivery routes and reduce their running times. In addition to that, this study introduces the concept of generalized passenger travel times in the DARP formulation which translates the increased in-vehicle crowdedness to increased perceived passenger travel times. This addresses a key issue because the perceived in-vehicle travel times of passengers might increase when the vehicle becomes more crowded (i.e., passengers might feel that their travel time is higher when they are not able to find a seat or they are too close to each other increasing the risk of virus transmission or accidents). Given these considerations, this study introduces the Dial-a-Ride Problem with interchange and perceived travel times (DARPi) and models it as a nonlinear programming problem. DARPi is then reformulated to a MILP with the use of linearizations and its search space is tightened with the addition of valid inequalities that are employed when solving the problem to global optimality with Branch-and-Cut. For large problem instances, this study introduces a tabu search-based metaheuristic and performs experiments in benchmark instances used in past literature demonstrating the computation times and solution stability of our approach.

In this study, the theory of attention resource allocation is introduced to more accurately model the dynamic process of the SA recovery. Moreover, the attention allocation model is further developed, and the affecting factors of attention allocation are quantified. An experiment with 90 participants using driving simulator was conducted for different road scenarios to verify the proposed SA model. The model proposed in this study can accurately predict the SA value of the driver under different road scenarios and the time required for the driver to recover to the maximum SA value, which provides a reference for the scientific design of dynamic takeover lead time.

Most state-of-the-art methods for traffic prediction effectively capture complex traffic patterns (e.g. spatial and temporal correlations of traffic data) by employing spatio-temporal neural networks as prediction models, together with graph convolution networks to learn spatial correlations of prediction objects (e.g. traffic states of road segments, as in this study). Such spatial correlations can be regarded as micro correlations. However, there are also macro correlations between regions, each of which is composed of multiple road segments or artificially partitioned areas. Macro correlations represent another type of interaction within road segments, and should be carefully considered when predicting traffic. The diversity of micro spatial correlations and corresponding macro spatial correlations (e.g. correlations based on physical proximity or traffic pattern similarity) further increases the complexity of traffic prediction. We overcome these challenges by developing a macro–micro spatio-temporal neural network model, denoted ‘MMSTNet’. MMSTNet captures spatio-temporal patterns by (a) utilizing a graph convolution network and a spatial attention network to capture micro and macro spatial correlations, respectively; (b) employing a temporal convolution network and a temporal attention network to learn temporal patterns; and (c) integrating hierarchically learned representations based on designed attention mechanisms.

Ride-sourcing market equilibrium analysis and optimization under immediate matching strategies,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104332,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Supply/demand characteristics and price strategies in the ride-sourcing market are affected by matching strategies. In particular, immediate matching strategies are widely adopted to tackle supply–demand imbalance issues. This paper studies a two-sided ride-sourcing market under two immediate matching strategies: driver-first-come-first-serve and passenger-first-come-first-serve. In the former, the system is considered over-saturated with passengers, such that any driver is matched immediately upon posting their availability. Therefore, the market would be devoid of waiting drivers. In comparison, the latter strategy is oversaturated with drivers, such that any newly arriving passenger is immediately matched, and there are no waiting passengers in the system. We first derive generalized supply and demand functions and prove that the immediate matching strategies are optimal to maximize the number of completed trips under certain conditions based on equilibrium analysis. Then, we characterize the market equilibrium and discuss the properties of the wild-goose-chase phenomenon under two immediate matching strategies. We optimize the ride-sourcing platform's strategies to achieve a joint profit of platform and driver maximization (monopoly optimum), social welfare maximization (social optimum), and second-best optimum (entailing a reservation profit for the platform).

Consequently, here we present a novel constrained multi-objective reinforcement learning technique for personalized decision making in autonomous driving, with the goal of learning a single model for Pareto optimal policies across the space of all possible user preferences. Specifically, a nonlinear constraint incorporating a user-specified preference and a vectorized action–value function is introduced to ensure both diversity in learned decision behaviors and efficient alignment between the user-specified preference and the corresponding optimal policy. Additionally, a constrained multi-objective actor–critic approach is advanced to approximate the Pareto optimal policies for any user-specified preferences while adhering to the nonlinear constraint.

Meanwhile, the human courier, as a traditional player in the last-mile delivery, appears as a typical form of gig economy, which is always available but with less revenue to harvest. To help the retailer with the fleet sizing decision-making, a co-sourcing mechanism is introduced, which is by nature a time-varying queue with a finite waiting space.

Furthermore, three stochastic optimization models are formulated, namely, the pure stability, the pure profit, and the hybrid models, to jointly determine the optimal waiting space threshold and the drone fleet size, which are then approximated with fluid models. Based on the optimal control theory, the optimal decisions are obtained according to the outsourcing probability and time delay. As validated in the simulation, the proposed pure stability model can effectively stabilize the system performance at the control target, while the hybrid model takes into account both the stability and the profit.

However, transportation network companies (TNCs) typically cannot access onboard data owing to privacy and cost concerns. Therefore, TNCs typically perform macroscopic driver profiling using the raw GPS trajectories generated by smartphones. Accurate profiling of ride-hailing drivers can enhance the user experience and order dispatching process by allowing the TNCs to accurately predict various downstream tasks such as time of arrival of rides. Notably, most of the approaches that use raw GPS trajectories for driver profiling directly leverage trajectory data without any comprehensive analysis, resulting in neglect of the rich regional semantic information and underlying correlations among trajectories. Therefore, we study the ride-hailing driver profiling problem and propose a Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL) framework that can automatically learn low-dimensional embeddings encoding driver behaviors from raw GPS data. The HGCL framework consists of a hierarchical graph neural network for capturing the regional features of trajectories and a hierarchical contrastive learning strategy aimed at learning high-quality representations at different levels. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using driver representation embeddings learned from a real-world large-scale dataset for three downstream tasks. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed HGCL framework for driver profiling.",0968-090X,Not found
Nonlinear model predictive control of large-scale urban road networks via average speed control,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104338,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Controlling traffic in large-scale urban road networks is a challenging problem. Aggregated dynamical models, based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) of urban traffic, enable model-based control design. As an alternative to perimeter control actuation commonly used in MFD-based control, in this paper, we propose actuation over regional space-mean speeds, which we name average speed control. The method involves manipulation of regional speeds via instrumentation similar to variable speed limits in freeways, or using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. We develop nonlinear model predictive control schemes considering actuation over average speed and perimeter control. Their performances are compared using simulations on congested scenarios, the results of which suggest potential of the method as an alternative or complementary actuation to perimeter control.",0968-090X,Not found
A safety-enhanced eco-driving strategy for connected and autonomous vehicles: A hierarchical and distributed framework,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104320,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This paper presents a safety-enhanced eco-driving strategy for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which is implemented by a hierarchical and distributed framework. The driving risk field, shockwave theory, and motion planning and control method are integrated into this framework to optimize the trajectories of CAVs on a signalized arterial under mixed traffic flow, with the aim of reducing the driving risk and fuel consumption of CAVs simultaneously, while ensuring traffic efficiency. The optimization procedure is mainly composed of two parts: long-term trajectory planning based on optimal control and short-term trajectory control based on model predictive control, which makes the strategy more adaptable to the various traffic conditions. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively reduce the safety risk that vehicles are exposed to and their fuel consumption by 18%–24% and 20%–27%, respectively. Furthermore, it reveals that conventional eco-driving strategies may result in negative safety issues when only considering the impact of preceding vehicles on the eco-CAV. However, these negative impacts can be eliminated when the impacts of following vehicles on the eco-CAV are taken into account. In addition, the sensitivity analysis on the Market Penetration Rate (MPR) of CAVs and traffic demand is performed. The results show that the framework is robust and can work under various traffic conditions (including under-saturated and over-saturated ones) and different MPRs.",0968-090X,Not found
The drone latency location routing problem under uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104322,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This paper addresses a location routing problem arising in the last-mile drone delivery context, where drones are used to deliver small packages to a set of customers. Each drone is launched from a fulfillment center to serve multiple customers on a single trip. The goal is to find the optimal subset of fulfillment centers to use as drone launching and landing platforms and the optimal drone routes with the aim of minimizing the sum of customers’ waiting times. We study the problem under two realistic assumptions. First, the drone energy consumption is a nonlinear function of the drone load that varies along the route, as parcels are delivered. Second, the drone flight time is not deterministically known. To hedge against drone flight time uncertainty, we adopt a robust optimization approach. Due to the complex nature of the problem, which turns out to be a nonlinear mixed-integer problem, we design an exact method based on a tailored efficient Branch & Check algorithm that uses customized no-good cuts. The computational experiments show the validity of the proposed model and the promising performance of the exact method.

Threshold-based incentives for ride-sourcing drivers: Implications on supply management and welfare effects,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104323,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Ride-sourcing companies have been widely using threshold-based incentive programs to encourage drivers to extend their work hours. In such programs, a driver receives a certain amount of monetary reward if she completes a given supply task within a predetermined time window. However, despite the popularity of these incentives, little is known about how drivers respond to them in practice, and currently, there are no means to comprehensively evaluate and optimize their designs. To fill the void, we develop a dynamic discrete choice model that formulates ride-sourcing drivers’ working decisions influenced by threshold-based incentives and then calibrate it using real-world data from a ride-sourcing company. Our results provide fresh insights into the market and welfare effects of the threshold-based incentive and its various designs. It is found that the threshold-based incentive could increase welfare significantly for full-time drivers but marginally for part-time drivers. In contrast, involving part-time drivers in the incentive programs generally can yield higher profits for the platform, while incentivizing full-time drivers is mostly unprofitable. On incentive design, the incentive threshold and reward must be closely paired for different driver groups to avoid inferior consequences for the platform and drivers. In addition, switching from threshold-based incentives to direct wage increments may benefit both full-time drivers and the ride-sourcing company.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal matching for coexisting ride-hailing and ridesharing services considering pricing fairness and user choices,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104326,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Mobility-on-demand (MoD) has the potential to revolutionise the patterns of urban mobility. Typically, an MoD platform provides both ride-hailing and ridesharing services, exacerbating the challenges of operating a city-scale real-time MoD system. Existing studies assume that travellers are fully compliant with the platform’s decisions regarding pricing and vehicle assignments, whereas, in reality, travellers can choose different modes based on monetary costs and travel experience, which may conflict with the results derived from the system perspective. In this study, we relax this assumption by accounting for pricing fairness and the travellers’ modal choices within a framework designed to optimise vehicle–traveller matching when both ride-hailing and ridesharing services are provided by an MoD platform. Six fairness principles are defined to characterise fair pricing for shared rides. Computationally efficient optimisation problems are formulated accounting for co-existing ride-hailing and ridesharing services.

Dynamic-learning spatial-temporal Transformer network for vehicular trajectory prediction at urban intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104330,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Forecasting vehicles' future motion is crucial for real-world applications such as the navigation of autonomous vehicles and feasibility of safety systems based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Vehicular trajectory prediction at urban intersections remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among traffic agents. This paper proposes a dynamic-learning spatial-temporal Transformer network (DSTTN) with domain adaptation training methods based on two modules for two-dimensional vehicular trajectory prediction at urban intersections. The first module is trajectory maneuver characterization (TMC) which captures latent driving maneuver features and divides trajectory data into different categories with different distributions, which can be regarded as different domains in transfer learning (TL). The second module is trajectory distribution matching (TDM) which adopts a novel spatial-temporal Transformer network with distribution matching loss to dynamically learn domain-invariant maneuvers and achieve accurate trajectory prediction. Experiments and ablation studies collected at two unsignalized urban intersections of the inD dataset first validate the interpretability, transferability, and high prediction accuracy of the proposed DSTTN. The results show that the TMC module has maneuver-representational ability. The proposed STTN achieves good and stable prediction accuracy compared with other baselines, including the state-of-the-art deep learning model, while DSTTN with the TMC and TDM modules further improves accuracy. Additional experiments have been conducted under 70 randomly-selected urban intersection scenarios of the Waymo dataset to validate the good prediction accuracy of the proposed method. The formulation of DSTTN offers new ideas for dividing trajectory data into different domains and general domain adaptation to vehicle trajectory prediction under urban road environments.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal charging station locations and durations for a transit route with battery-electric buses: A two-stage stochastic programming approach with consideration of weather conditions,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104327,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"While the environmental advantages of battery-electric buses (BEBs) are well-known, their significant differences from diesel buses require alterations to both route design (i.e., charging station locations) and operations (i.e., schedule management and holding control). The location, number, charging duration, and types of charging stations must be considered as part of the planning process. Charging stations can be located at depots, termini, or en-route. This paper considers the long-term planning and optimization problem of en-route charging station locations and charging duration to optimize passengers’ waiting time and operation and capital costs while addressing the weather-induced stochasticity of ridership and battery performance of the BEBs. A linear deterministic optimization model and a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) optimization process are developed to place BEB charging stations along the route and estimate their assigned charging time for both one-way and two-way operations. The developed approaches are tested on two high-demand bus routes in Calgary. The impact of the breakdown of the charging station associated with the maximum charging time on the schedule and the cost of the BEB operation is assessed. The solution of the stochastic model is analyzed using the expected value of perfect information as an index. The results indicate that using the SP model helps decrease the expected travel time of the route while the total cost per trip increases compared to the deterministic model.",0968-090X,Not found
Air cargo network planning and scheduling problem with minimum stay time: A matrix-based ALNS heuristic,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104307,156,2023-11-01,2023,11,"In air cargo delivery, cargo usually needs to stay in hubs after unloading operations until the designated outbound flight is ready to leave. The stay time may account for a significant part of the overall delivery time and is closely related to the service level of the cargo delivery. However, the prior studies on the air cargo network planning and scheduling problem mainly focused on the cost and revenue but paid little attention to the stay time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new facet to the air cargo network planning and scheduling literature. The air cargo network planning and scheduling problem with minimum stay time involves the optimization of the hub location, flight deployment, flight timetabling, and flight-sequence-based cargo distribution to minimize the total stay time of freighter cargoes while guaranteeing a rational cost level. We develop a hierarchical modeling framework to handle this problem, where a time–space network is built to model the cargo stay time and the flight departure time. Next, to efficiently address the framework, the concept of the capacity matrix is introduced for model reformulation, and a matrix-based ALNS heuristic is proposed for model solving. The heuristic designs eight destroy operators from the column, row, and element perspectives, and develops a repair model for the repair operation.

Despite the widespread adoption of deep learning models, next location prediction models lack a comprehensive discussion and integration of mobility-related spatio-temporal contexts. Here, we utilize a multi-head self-attentional (MHSA) neural network that learns location transition patterns from historical location visits, their visit time and activity duration, as well as their surrounding land use functions, to infer an individual’s next location. Specifically, we adopt point-of-interest data and latent Dirichlet allocation for representing locations’ land use contexts at multiple spatial scales, generate embedding vectors of the spatio-temporal features, and learn to predict the next location with an MHSA network. Through experiments on two large-scale GNSS tracking datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction models, and reveal the contribution of various spatio-temporal contexts to the model’s performance. Moreover, we find that the model trained on population data achieves higher prediction performance with fewer parameters than individual-level models due to learning from collective movement patterns. We also reveal mobility conducted in the recent past and one week before has the largest influence on the current prediction, showing that learning from a subset of the historical mobility is sufficient to obtain an accurate location prediction result. We believe that the proposed model is vital for context-aware mobility prediction.

A real-time synchromodal framework with co-planning for routing of containers and vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104412,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"This paper considers a decentralized container transport system in which two decision-makers are involved in getting a container from its origin to its destination: a logistics service provider (LSP) and a flexible service operator (FSO). While the LSP receives shipment requests from shippers and controls the movement of containers over a multimodal network by booking scheduled (e.g., barges and trains) and flexible services (e.g., trucks) from service operators, the FSO manages a fleet of vehicles (e.g., trucks) that have flexible routes and departure times to fulfill the transport requests proposed by the LSP. In the literature, most of the studies focus on either container routing, by assuming all services have fixed routes and trucks are unlimited, or vehicle routing in a road network. This paper investigates the integrated problems of routing containers and vehicles through a multimodal network from a decentralized perspective considering the decision authorities of the LSP and the FSO. A synchromodal framework is designed to control the decision process which enables to utilize the benefits of real-time mode and route changes. To investigate the impact of communication, we develop a co-planning method under the synchromodal framework to coordinate the transport plans between the LSP and the FSO in real-time. The co-planning method considers a realistic level of information exchange and adheres to no changes in their responsibilities and authorities compared to current practice. The performance of the co-planning method is evaluated under various scenarios. The experimental results show that co-planning, using expected transport request fulfillment as feedback, reduces the total costs of container transportation and decreases the distance traveled by flexible vehicles under most of the scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found
"What drives the joint demand for ride-hailing and carsharing services? Understanding consumers’ behaviors, attitudes, &amp; concerns",10.1016/j.trc.2023.104373,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Driven by the emerging collaborative consumption trends, new shared ownership-based business models provide more flexible and accessible on-demand mobility options. This study simultaneously analyzes factors correlated with the consumers’ use of two interrelated disruptive on-demand mobility services, including ride-hailing (RH) and carsharing (CS). A comprehensive behavioral framework is presented to explicitly address important methodological concerns regarding the complex stochastic dependence between the use of CS and RH programs and the underlying behavioral heterogeneity in latent factors influencing the use of the two shared mobility options. Using unique data from the California Vehicle Survey, a rigorous elliptical and Archimedean copula-based finite mixture bivariate ordered probit (BOP) modeling methodology is used to understand behavioral, attitudes, and concern-related correlates of households’ participation levels in CS and RH programs. Characterized by a clayton-copula based finite mixture BOP model, participation levels in CS and RH programs exhibited complex (both synergistic and competing) non-linear stochastic dependence patterns. With a stronger left tail dependence, majority of the households having lower levels of participation in RH also had lower participation levels in CS programs. Contrarily, of the households with higher levels of participation in RH programs, the majority had lower levels of participation in CS programs (revealing weaker right tail dependence). Taste heterogeneity was observed in the unobserved determinants of CS use. Results show that current users of CS and/or RH programs tend to be those with greater awareness, owners of plug-in electric vehicles, those making greater transit trips, workers with greater commute distances, and those lacking free parking at their residences. Compared to ride-hailing, the negative effect of more frequent drivers in a household on CS use was less pronounced. Analysis of marginal and joint marginal effects provided deeper insights into the (interactive) effects of other behavioral and socio-demographic correlates. Treatment effects were simulated and discussed to further demonstrate the policy implications of our results. The new empirical insights provide a more granular understanding of the use patterns of on-demand shared mobility services and can inform more context-sensitive travel forecasts for planning and programming purposes.",0968-090X,Not found

A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated in this study for routing the trucks and drones in the fleet so that each customer’s pickup or delivery requirements could be served by either a truck or a drone before their required due time. For solving the MILP model efficiently, this study designs a novel hybrid algorithm by combining the column generation and the logic-based Benders decomposition. Based on the main frame of column generation algorithm, the hybrid algorithm uses logic-based Benders decomposition to solve the pricing problem, and dynamic programming to solve subproblems of logic-based Benders decomposition for the purpose of accelerating the whole algorithm’s solving process. Numerical experiments are also conducted on the context of the Hangzhou city so as to validate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm.

However, realizing the cooperative decision-making of multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) when influenced by the presence of connected manual vehicles (CMVs) is a challenging area in current research. In this study, we propose a coalition game-based (CG-based) model for multi-CAV cooperative decision-making in a connected mixed traffic environment. First, the model integrates the perceived risk field theory, quantifying the driving risk from the perspective of different CMVs; this risk is used to determine the uncertainty of the motion state of CMVs. Second, the model can identify the conflicts caused by multiple lane-changing vehicles and decouple the conflict problem into multiple two-vehicle lane-changing games, including a cooperative game between two CAVs and a non-cooperative game between a CAV and a CMV. To test the proposed model, four scenarios that blocked the passage of multiple CAVs were set up; in these scenarios, the average speed of the CG-based model was 21.05, 16.76, 23.17, and 12.55% higher than that of the LC2013 model.

Increasing traffic capacity of mixed traffic at signalized traffic intersections using delayed self reinforcement,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104403,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The traffic capacity of signalized intersections can be increased using vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication by broadcasting traffic control signals to connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, the potential improvement in traffic capacity with only CAVs can be substantially reduced under mixed traffic environments that include autonomous vehicles (AVs) without V2I communication. The main contribution of this work is to increase the traffic capacity (close to that achieved by CAVs with V2I communication) when there is a substantial number of AVs without V2I communication — by using a delayed-self-reinforcement (DSR) approach for vehicle spacing control with already available history of the AVs own control inputs and sensed information. Moreover, analytical estimates are established to predict the improvements in traffic capacity achieved for AVs with the DSR approach compared to the case without the DSR approach. Simulation results match the analytical predictions and show that AVs using the DSR approach (without V2I communication) are able to recover 88% of intersection capacity achieved with CAVs (with V2I communication) and result in 2.7 times the intersection capacity achieved by AVs without DSR on one way traffic. Moreover, similar improvements with DSR are shown for a real-world intersection using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) platform. AVs with DSR approach are able to recover 96% of intersection capacity achieved with CAVs (with V2I communication) and result in 1.4 times the intersection capacity achieved by AVs without DSR.

How income satisfaction impacts driver engagement dynamics in ride-hailing services,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104418,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"To keep up with the rapid growth in ride-hailing demand in a competitive market, it is critical to cultivating active engagement with drivers so that they would spend more time on the ride-hailing platform and serve more passengers.

To fill this research gap, we develop a hidden Markov model to uncover latent driver engagement dynamics and capture the effects of income satisfaction on them. Specifically, our model differentiates the impacts of incomes above and below expectations through piecewise linear regression utility functions, the breakpoints of which are the latent psychologically expected incomes of drivers. We conduct numerical experiments using real-world ride-hailing data. Results show that our model enhances the goodness of fit and predictive accuracy by more than 35% and identifies the transitions among five distinct driver engagement levels.

Dissolving the segmentation of a shared mobility market: A framework and four market structure designs,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104397,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"In the governance of the shared mobility market of a city or of a metropolitan area, there are two conflicting principles: (1) the healthy competition between multiple platforms, such as between Uber and Lyft in the United States, and (2) economies of network scale, which leads to higher chances for trips to be matched, and thus higher operation efficiency, but which also implies monopoly. The current shared mobility markets, as observed in different cities in the world, are either monopolistic, or largely segmented by multiple platforms, the latter with significant efficiency loss. How to keep the competition between platforms, but to reduce the efficiency loss due to segmentation with new market designs is the focus of this paper.

Optimal deployment of an equitable CAV platoonable corridor on road networks with mixed traffic flow,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104399,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology is expected to increase road capacity and reduce fuel consumption, but it may take time for all human-driven vehicles (HVs) to be replaced by CAVs. During the transition period, CAVs and HVs will continue to coexist. This paper aims to find an optimal deployment of a CAV platoonable corridor to facilitate CAV platooning and better manage traffic congestion on road networks with a mixed traffic flow of CAVs and HVs. Generally, dedicated infrastructure for CAVs, such as CAV lanes, zones, or corridors, may have distributional welfare effects on travelers. Especially, HV users may be worse off because road space is partially converted to dedicated infrastructure for CAVs. To facilitate equitable infrastructure planning, we develop a bi-level program for a Stackelberg game that incorporates the equity concern, where the planner acts as the leader to determine the optimal deployment of an equitable CAV platoonable corridor at the upper level, while travelers are followers who make user-optimal route choices given the CAV platoonable corridor at the lower level. For the lower-level problem, we model the decision-making of travelers as a platoon-embedded network equilibrium with mixed flow (PNEMF) and derive its equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem. The existence and the uniqueness of the VI solution are proved. To solve the bi-level program efficiently, we propose a simulated-annealing-based corridor search (SACS) algorithm. Our numerical experiments on the Nguyen–Dupuis (ND), Sioux Falls (SF), Anaheim, and Winnipeg networks demonstrate the expected benefits of deploying a CAV platoonable corridor if the CAV market penetration ratio exceeds a certain threshold. In the meantime, both CAV and HV users are better off with the deployed equitable corridor. In addition, we find that the degree of the transportation planner’s concern about the inequity issue has a significant impact on the corridor design when the CAV penetration ratio is low. With less concern about the inequity issue, the CAV platoonable corridor is longer and more HVs experience higher generalized travel costs.",0968-090X,Not found
Reinforcement learning for humanitarian relief distribution with trucks and UAVs under travel time uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104401,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Effective humanitarian relief operations are challenging in the aftermath of disasters, as trucks are often faced with considerable travel time uncertainties due to damaged transportation networks. Efficient deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) potentially mitigates this problem, supplementing truck fleets in an impactful manner. To plan last-mile relief distribution in this setting, we introduce a multi-trip, split-delivery vehicle routing problem with trucks and UAVs, soft time windows, and stochastic travel times for last-mile relief distribution, formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. Within a finite time horizon, we aim to maximize a weighted objective function comprising the number of goods delivered, the number of different locations visited, and late arrival penalties. Our study offers insights into dealing with travel time uncertainty in humanitarian logistics by (i) deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as partial substitutes for trucks, (ii) evaluating dynamic solutions generated by two deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches – specifically value function approximation (VFA) and policy function approximation (PFA) – and (iii) comparing the RL solutions with solutions stemming from mathematical programming and dynamic heuristics. Experiments are performed on both Solomon-based instances and two real-world cases. The real-world cases – the 2015 Nepal earthquake and the 2018 Indonesia tsunami – are based on locally collected field data and real-world UAV specifications, and aim to provide practical insights. The experimental results show that dynamic decision-making improves both performance and robustness of humanitarian operations, achieving reductions in lateness penalties of around 85% compared to static solutions based on expected travel times. Furthermore, the results show that replacing half of the trucks with UAVs improves the weighted objective value by 11% to 56%, benefitting both reliability and location coverage.

"Optimising fleet sizing and management of shared automated vehicle (SAV) services: A mixed-integer programming approach integrating endogenous demand, congestion effects, and accept/reject mechanism impacts",10.1016/j.trc.2023.104398,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Shared automated vehicles (SAV) are expected to benefit the sustainable development of urban regions and alleviate the negative impacts brought by the increasing number of private cars. In this paper, we envision a future scenario where non-pooled SAVs replace private cars and provide public on-demand mobility services to satisfy the mobility needs of a city’s residents. To help service providers make profitable fleet sizing and management decisions, we develop a mixed-integer non-linear programming model that considers the congestion effects and the mode choice of urban travellers in different income classes, between SAVs and bicycles. Our model optimises both strategic decisions (fleet size, initial fleet distribution, and service quality level) and operational decisions (trip assignment, vehicle routing, parking, and relocation). Travellers’ preference for both transport modes is described through a binary logit model and congestion effects are described by dynamically varying travel times with respect to traffic flow in a non-linear fashion. In addition, we investigate two types of accept/reject mechanisms (mandatory vs. non-mandatory acceptance) which lead to an endogenously determined acceptance rate that can affect travellers’ willingness to use SAV services. The computational challenge posed by the non-linear and non-convex nature of the model is addressed through reformulation and the use of outer-inner approximation methods combined with a breakpoint generation algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in a case study of the city of Delft in The Netherlands, as well as a scaling analysis on three toy networks with various sizes and demand profiles. A sensitivity analysis of key parameters is carried out to assess system performance. Computational results indicate that fleet sizing decisions are influenced not only by the population’s geographical distribution and land use patterns but also by the pricing strategy, unit operating costs of the SAV fleet, network congestion level, and traveller behaviour. When the price rate of using SAVs is low, the fleet sizing decisions can also be influenced by the trip accept/reject mechanism and the travellers’ sensitivity to the service quality level. In addition, a low price of SAV service will attract more users but may not necessarily bring a higher profit because of the increased traffic congestion.",0968-090X,Not found
Towards explainable motion prediction using heterogeneous graph representations,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104405,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Motion prediction systems play a crucial role in enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in complex traffic scenarios. Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches have emerged as a promising solution for capturing interactions among dynamic agents and static objects. However, they often lack transparency, interpretability and explainability — qualities that are essential for building trust in autonomous driving systems. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a comprehensive approach to enhance the explainability of graph-based motion prediction systems. We introduce the Explainable Heterogeneous Graph-based Policy (XHGP) model based on an heterogeneous graph representation of the traffic scene and lane-graph traversals. Distinct from other graph-based models, XHGP leverages object-level and type-level attention mechanisms to learn interaction behaviors, providing information about the importance of agents and interactions in the scene. In addition, capitalizing on XHGP’s architecture, we investigate the explanations provided by the GNNExplainer and apply counterfactual reasoning to analyze the sensitivity of the model to modifications of the input data. This includes masking scene elements, altering trajectories, and adding or removing dynamic agents. Our proposal advances towards achieving reliable and explainable motion prediction systems, addressing the concerns of users, developers and regulatory agencies alike. The insights gained from our explainability analysis contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between dynamic and static elements in traffic scenarios, facilitating the interpretation of the results, as well as the correction of possible errors in motion prediction models, and thus contributing to the development of trustworthy motion prediction systems.

Trip-based mobile sensor deployment for drive-by sensing with bus fleets,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104404,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Drive-by sensing (i.e. vehicle-based mobile sensing) is an emerging data collection paradigm that leverages vehicle mobilities to scan a city at low costs. It represents a positive social externality of urban transport activities. Bus transit systems are widely considered in drive-by sensing due to extensive spatial coverage, reliable operations, and low maintenance costs. It is critical for the underlying monitoring scenario (e.g. air quality, traffic state, and road roughness) to assign a limited number of sensors to a bus fleet to ensure their optimal spatial–temporal distribution. In this paper we present a trip-based sensor deployment problem, which explicitly considers timetabled trips that must be executed by the fleet while a portion of them perform sensing tasks. To address the computational challenge in large-scale instances, we design a multi-stage solution framework that decouples the spatial–temporal structures of the sensing task through line pre-selection and bi-level optimization. As a result, the computational complexity is reduced to be sub-linear w.r.t. the number of lines, rather than combinatorial w.r.t. the number of buses in existing vehicle-based approaches. A real-world case study covering 400 km 2 in central Chengdu demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in solving large-scale problems. It is found that coordinating bus scheduling and sensing tasks can substantially increase the spatial–temporal sensing coverage.

Towards better traffic volume estimation: Jointly addressing the underdetermination and nonequilibrium problems with correlation-adaptive GNNs,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104402,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Traffic volume is an indispensable ingredient to provide fine-grained information for traffic management and control. However, due to the limited deployment of traffic sensors, obtaining full-scale volume information is far from easy. Existing work on this topic focuses primarily on improving the overall estimation accuracy of a particular method and ignores the underlying challenges of volume estimation, thereby having inferior performance in some critical tasks. This paper studies two key problems with regard to traffic volume estimation: (1) underdetermined traffic flows caused by fully undetected paths that can allow arbitrary volume values without violating the conservation law, where using local side information is insufficient to tackle, and (2) nonequilibrium traffic flows arise when traffic flows vary in density over space and time due to congestion propagation delay, which produce time-shifted volume readings to varying degrees. Here we demonstrate a graph-based deep learning method that offers a data-driven, equation-free, and correlation-adaptive approach to address the above issues and perform accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation. Particularly, in order to quantify the dynamic and nonlinear speed-volume relationships for the estimation of underdetermined flows, a speed pattern-adaptive adjacency matrix based on graph attention is developed and integrated into the graph convolution process, to capture nonlocal correlations between volumes. To measure the impacts of nonequilibrium flows, a temporal masked and clipped attention combined with a gated temporal convolution layer is customized to capture time-asynchronous correlations between upstream and downstream sensors under varying impacts of congestion delay. We then evaluate our model on a real-world highway traffic volume dataset and compare it with several benchmark models. It is demonstrated that the proposed model achieves high estimation accuracy even under 20% sensor coverage rate and outperforms other baselines significantly, especially on underdetermined and nonequilibrium flow locations. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative model analysis is also carried out to justify the model designs. The source code and datasets are publicly available at: .",0968-090X,Not found
Microtransit adoption in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a choice experiment with transit and car commuters,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104395,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"On-demand mobility platforms play an increasingly important role in urban mobility systems. Impacts are still debated, as these platforms supply personalized and optimized services while also potentially exacerbating sustainability challenges. To alleviate these concerns, microtransit projects have emerged, promising to combine the advantages of pooled on-demand rides with more sustainable fixed-route public transit services. Specifically, microtransit provides, dynamic rider-driver matching to serve demand with fewer vehicles and design optimal routes if riders accept to wait to board vehicles at curbside boarding locations. The shift to microtransit calls for new research on user behavior, motivations, and acceptability to understand demand and its role in existing mobility systems. The COVID-19 pandemic context adds an additional layer of complexity. This study investigates the potential demand for microtransit options against the background of the pandemic. We use a pivoted efficient choice experiment to study the decision-making of Israeli public transit and car commuters when offered to use novel microtransit options (sedan vs. passenger van). By estimating commuter group-specific Integrated Choice and Latent Variable models with error component terms for the microtransit alternatives, we investigate the tradeoffs related to traditional fare and travel time attributes, along with microtransit features: walking time to the pickup location, vehicle sharing, waiting time, minimum advanced reservation time, and shelter at designated boarding locations. We analyzed two latent constructs: the attitudes toward sharing and the experiences and risk perceptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal three key takeaways. (1) New modal attributes significantly affect the utility of the microtransit alternatives, with a notable aversion to walking and waiting among drivers; (2) car and transit commuters have structural differences in attribute elasticities; (3) significant differences are noted for the magnitude of the latent variable effects.

Exploring crowd persistent dynamism from pedestrian crossing perspective: An empirical study,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104400,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Crowd studies have gained increasing relevance due to the recurring incidents of crowd crush accidents. In addressing the issue of the crowd's persistent dynamism, this paper explored the macroscopic and microscopic features of pedestrians crossing in static and dynamic contexts, employing a series of systematic experiments. Firstly, empirical evidence has confirmed the existence of crowd’s persistent dynamism. Subsequently, the research delves into two aspects, qualitative and quantitative, to address the following questions: (1) Cross pedestrians tend to avoid high-density areas when crossing static crowds and particularly evade pedestrians in front to avoid deceleration, thus inducing the formation of cross-channels, a self-organization phenomenon. (2) In dynamic crowds, when pedestrian suffers spatial constrained, two patterns emerge: decelerate or detour. Research results indicate the differences in pedestrian crossing behaviors between static and dynamic crowds, such as the formation of crossing channels, backward detours, and spiral turning. However, the strategy of pedestrian crossing remains consistent: utilizing detours to overcome spatial constraints. Finally, the empirical results of this study address the final question: pedestrians detouring causes crowds’ persistent collective dynamism. These findings contribute to an enhanced understanding of pedestrian dynamics in extreme conditions and provide empirical support for research on individual movement patterns and crowd behavior prediction.",0968-090X,Not found
Relocation incentives for ride-sourcing drivers with path-oriented revenue forecasting based on a Markov Chain model,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104375,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Proper positioning of ride-sourcing drivers may improve vacant travel times, waiting times, and matching opportunities. Herein, we evaluate the potential repositioning response of drivers when provided guidance based on estimates of their earnings in a system offering ride-hailing (solo) and ridesplitting (shared) rides. Therefore, we develop a strategy that enumerates the best regional repositioning destination based on the expected number of requests a driver will encounter during the forecast horizon. A mixed continuous-discrete time Markov Chain (MDCTMC) is developed to predict a driver’s activities and the associated revenues. In summary, the developed strategy provides a group of drivers with individualized near-future revenue estimates guiding drivers toward repositioning decisions that are more likely to maximize their earnings. Our main findings indicate that if the operator selects only a fraction of active drivers to provide guidance, these are likely to expect higher earnings than those without guidance. We also show that it manages to decrease the number of unserved requests compared to several state-of-art benchmarks while increasing vehicle occupancy and decreasing the deadheading.",0968-090X,Not found
A suggestion-based hierarchical energy efficient control framework for connected and automated vehicles in mixed stream urban road networks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104388,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and their advanced control systems have the ability to improve energy efficiency and mobility of the transportation system, but hundred percent market penetration of CAVs will not happen in the near future. CAVs are thus expected to share the road with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), which can act in suboptimal manners. Since vehicles on road constitute an interactive system, where actions of one vehicle influence the actions of its surrounding vehicles, suboptimal behavior of HDVs affect all their surrounding vehicles including the CAVs. This paper thus focuses on the development of a suggestion-based control framework for CAVs in interactive mixed traffic environments. Our mixed traffic environment includes both CAVs and connected HDVs that have vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication capabilities. In this suggestion-based control framework, a CAV is considered to provide velocity and lane-change suggestions to multiple surrounding HDVs to follow. These suggestions are the velocities and lane-change actions the CAV wants the HDVs to follow to improve its own and the group’s energy efficiency and mobility. To take into account the interactive nature of the environment, the CAV is considered to jointly plan its own trajectory, evaluate the suggestions to the surrounding HDVs, and predict the actions of its surrounding vehicles. The joint planning requires solving the problem in joint state- and action-space, and in this paper, we develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based trajectory planning approach for the CAV. Since the joint action- and state-space grows exponentially with the number of agents and can be computationally expensive, we propose an adaptive action-space by pruning the actions resulting in unsafe trajectories for each agent. The trajectory planning approach is followed by a low-level model predictive control (MPC)-based motion controller, which aims at tracking the reference trajectory in an optimal fashion. Simulation studies show the proposed control strategy’s efficacy compared with existing baseline methods. Simulation studies show improvements in fuel efficiency ranging from 4% to 50% for HDVs and from 1% to 30% for the CAV compared to the baseline.",0968-090X,Not found
A non-local grouping tensor train decomposition model for travel demand analysis concerning categorical independent variables,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104396,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"With the booming of transportation big data, plenty of spatial and temporal features become available for developing travel demand analysis models. However, existing machine learning based travel demand fitting models could face significant model complexity issues once there are multiple discrete/categorical independent variables. This paper embeds a non-local grouping (clustering) process into the tensor train decomposition (NLG-TTD) to characterize the higher-order and nonlinear relationship between categorical variables and travel demand. That is, the transportation dataset with multiple discrete/categorical independent variables and travel demand is treated as a multi-mode tensor, wherein levels of a discrete/categorical variable are regarded as indexes of a mode in the tensor, leading to a “regression on index”. The proposed NLG-TTD model divides the full tensor into non-local sub-tensors, clusters sub-tensors with similarity, conducts tensor train decomposition (TTD) within each cluster, and aggregates cluster-specific learning results. Compared with a conventional TTD that generally works on image completions, NLG-TTD can reveal non-Euclidean and non-linear patterns between categorical/discrete levels in independent variables. It is expected to discover similar travel demand patterns among categorical levels and provide high-level goodness-of-fit. For numerical studies, we use bike-sharing usage data and metro demand data in New York City (NYC), in which several widely-used machine learning models are trained for comparison. The results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed model. Moreover, we apply the NLG-TTD model to analyze and predict the impact of land use shifts on travel demand.",0968-090X,Not found

Then, the dynamic model is further obtained to satisfy more accurate dynamic swarm performances — collision avoidance and compact formation. The former can be realized by diffeomorphism transformation approach and a safety zone is guaranteed accordingly. As for the compact formation, we creatively convert it into a constraint-following problem between leader and followers. Based on the dynamic model, a novel control consisting of two parts is designed, including the model-based control and the adaptive robust control. On one hand, the trajectory tracking problem of the artificial swarm system is solved. On the other hand, the uncertainties in the artificial swarm system can be compensated perfectly.

Optimal order-k routing policy for adaptive routing in real road networks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104392,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"In uncertain traffic networks, adaptive routing mechanism is essential in adapting to dynamic traffic changes and making effective routing decisions. Most previous work on adaptive routing commonly ignores the realistic requirement of drivers to select and enter a right lane before intersections, and this would lead to urgent lane changing at intersections that not only violates traffic rules but even causes traffic accidents. This paper redefines the adaptive routing problem in real road networks as an optimal order- k routing policy problem by proposing a novel order- k routing policy. It is a routing mechanism that selects the next k arcs at each decision intersection and the first m arcs are the same with the last m arcs of the k arcs selected at the last decision intersection, which are defined as an m -arc-constrained order- k link. This routing mechanism gives sufficient preparation time for lane changing. We develop a two-phase methodology to handle this problem. To address complex spatio-temporal correlations in real road networks, instead of using the random sampling method, we use a copula-based scenario generation method to generate high-quality scenarios for improving solution performances. A two-stage algorithm integrating the enumeration of m -arc-constrained order- k links and the construction of the optimal routing policy is developed to find the optimal order- k routing policy based on the scenarios generated. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the optimal order- k routing policy to simultaneously obtain good performances and meet the realistic requirement of drivers’ lane changing.",0968-090X,Not found

On the stability of a heterogeneous platoon-based traffic system with multiple anticipations in the presence of connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104389,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have attracted substantial research attention in heterogeneous traffic settings due to their inherent traffic-stabilizing characteristics. However, insufficient focus has been directed towards the heterogeneity in communication topologies of CAVs, particularly in the presence of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Consequently, our comprehension of traffic stability in such heterogeneous environments remains constrained, overlooking crucial aspects such as CAV platooning and multi-anticipation controls. To address these gaps, this study presents a first attempt to extend the frequency-based characterizations of string stability, i.e., L p norms, to the heterogeneous traffic of CAVs and HDVs operating in a multi-anticipation multi-platoon system. The proposed adaptive mode conversions and platooning under incomplete communication environments are also incorporated into research scenarios. Our contribution involves establishing a comprehensive modeling framework for analyzing the propagation of deviations within platoons amidst heterogeneous traffic.

Additionally, a comprehensive comparison was conducted among different stability characterizations and various multi-anticipation topologies of CAVs, with the commonly researched single-anticipation topology (predecessor-following) used as a baseline. The numerical results, utilizing specific models and calibrated parameters, demonstrated the significant superiority of multi-anticipation topologies over the single-anticipation one in ensuring head-to-tail stability.

To capture these features, we put forward a continuous agent-based model (dubbed ANDA) hinging on a transparent delineation of a decision-making process, wherein a desired velocity is selected as the optimum of a perceived cost, and a mechanical layer that handles contacts and collisions. Altogether, the model includes less than a dozen parameters, many of which are fit using independent experimental data. The versatility of ANDA is demonstrated by numerical simulations that successfully replicate empirical observations in a very wide range of scenarios. These scenarios vary from collision avoidance involving one, two, or more agents, to collective flow properties in unidirectional and bidirectional settings, and to the dynamics of evacuation through a bottleneck, where contact forces are directly accessible. Remarkably, the model is able to replicate the enhanced chaoticity of the flow observed experimentally in ’smartphone-walking’ pedestrians, by reducing the frequency of decisional updates, replicating the digital distraction effect.

These concepts are developed as distinct control frameworks to address inequity issues of earlier RG schemes in a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for a heterogeneous urban network, which is divided into multiple pockets of congestion. The modelling approach uses a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), which relates aggregated traffic variables, such as vehicle accumulation and trip completion rate. The proportionally fair RG control (FC) scheme is developed as a two-level RG advisory controller that focuses on maximizing the proportion of travellers utilities to effectively prevent the network from becoming congested while also considering fairness in the distribution of network resources. In addition, an anticipatory control (AC) RG scheme is devised as a two-level optimization model by incorporating road users routing behaviour as an integral part of the control scheme. Intensive sensitivity analysis is conducted under high-demand profiles and for different compliance rates and MFD parameters to analyze and evaluate the performance of these two fairness-centered routing schemes compared to a basic MPC based control scenario.

Drone delivery and the value of customer privacy: A discrete choice experiment with U.S. consumers,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104391,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Drone delivery services are becoming increasingly available, but they introduce new consumer privacy risks. As a result of safety regulations that require drones to broadcast their locations, third-party observers may link customers to their purchases by following a delivery from vendor to customer. These privacy risks can be reduced with routing strategies that aggregate customer orders, at the potential cost of additional delivery wait times or fees. This study measures the importance of these privacy risks to delivery service customers, their willingness to pay for privacy, and how this differs across consumer groups and product types. We developed a discrete choice experiment and mode choice logit models using data from over 3700 U.S. consumers who chose between ground vehicle versus drone delivery across a range of privacy, delivery fee, and wait time options. Preferences were tested for various product types: take-out food, liquor store items, groceries, and prescription medications. Results show offering privacy enhancements significantly increased consumers’ likelihood of choosing drone delivery. Without privacy enhancements, when fees and wait times were the same, consumers chose ground vehicle 4 times more often than drone. Offering privacy for the drone option closed this gap. Yet preferences differ by demographic group. Males and frequent e-commerce users were more likely to prefer drone regardless of privacy, while privacy improvements had a significantly larger impact on females and younger consumers. We measured consumers’ value of privacy in both money and time. The value of privacy for medications delivery was about twice that for other product types. The value of privacy was then highest for liquor store items, then groceries, then take-out food.

Fair collaborative vehicle routing: A deep multi-agent reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104376,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Collaborative vehicle routing occurs when carriers collaborate through sharing their transportation requests and performing transportation requests on behalf of each other. This achieves economies of scale, thus reducing cost, greenhouse gas emissions and road congestion. But which carrier should partner with whom, and how much should each carrier be compensated? Traditional game theoretic solution concepts are expensive to calculate as the characteristic function scales exponentially with the number of agents. This would require solving the vehicle routing problem (NP-hard) an exponential number of times. We therefore propose to model this problem as a coalitional bargaining game solved using deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, where – crucially – agents are not given access to the characteristic function. Instead, we implicitly reason about the characteristic function; thus, when deployed in production, we only need to evaluate the expensive post-collaboration vehicle routing problem once. Our contribution is that we are the first to consider both the route allocation problem and gain sharing problem simultaneously — without access to the expensive characteristic function. Through decentralised machine learning, our agents bargain with each other and agree to outcomes that correlate well with the Shapley value — a fair profit allocation mechanism.

Modified dynamic programming algorithms for GLOSA systems with stochastic signal switching times,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104364,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"A discrete-time stochastic optimal control problem was recently proposed to address the GLOSA (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) problem in cases where the next signal switching time is decided in real time and is therefore uncertain in advance. The corresponding numerical solution via SDP (Stochastic Dynamic Programming) calls for substantial computation time, which excludes problem solution in the vehicle’s on-board computer in real time. In this context, the present paper concentrates on the challenge of developing numerical algorithms to solve efficiently the stochastic GLOSA problem. As a first attempt to overcome the computation time bottleneck, a modified version of Dynamic Programming, known as Discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDDP) was recently employed for the numerical solution of the stochastic optimal control problem and was demonstrated to achieve results equivalent to those obtained with the ordinary SDP algorithm, albeit with significantly reduced computation times. After an outline of the DDDP approach, the present work considers a second modified version of Dynamic Programming, known as Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). For the stochastic GLOSA problem, it is demonstrated that DDP achieves quasi-instantaneous (extremely fast) solutions in terms of CPU times, which allows for the proposed approach to be readily executable online, in an MPC (Model Predictive Control) framework, in the vehicle’s on-board computer. The novel numerical approach is tested and demonstrated by use of realistic examples and is compared to the SDP and DDDP solutions.

The application of advanced black-box models in the shipping industry remains limited and it is necessary to develop both accurate and interpretable ship fuel consumption prediction models. This study uses domain knowledge to develop two innovative methods for predicting ship fuel consumption—the first is a physics-informed neural network (PI-NN) model that improves the interpretability of the black-box model while maintaining accuracy and the second is a mixed-integer quadratic optimization (MIO) model that considers more forms of feature variable expressions in an additive white-box model. The proposed approaches address the tradeoff between model interpretability and model accuracy in ship fuel consumption prediction. The experiment results demonstrate that the PI-NN model improves the interpretability of the black-box model while preserving accuracy. The MIO model considers alternative variable expressions, leading to the flexibility of the white-box model. Finally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to explain how each feature value contributes to the predictions of the black-box model, thereby providing insights into how each value of feature variables affects fuel consumption. This study provides a solution to the tradeoff between model interpretability and model accuracy and can promote the application of data-driven models in ship fuel consumption prediction. Moreover, this study gives implications for the application of explainable machine learning models in practice.",0968-090X,Not found
Coordination of drones at scale: Decentralized energy-aware swarm intelligence for spatio-temporal sensing,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104387,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Smart City applications, such as traffic monitoring and disaster response, often use swarms of intelligent and cooperative drones to efficiently collect sensor data over different areas of interest and time spans. However, when the required sensing becomes spatio-temporally large and varying, a collective arrangement of sensing tasks to a large number of battery-restricted and distributed drones is challenging. To address this problem, this paper introduces a scalable and energy-aware model for planning and coordination of spatio-temporal sensing. The coordination model is built upon a decentralized multi-agent collective learning algorithm (EPOS) to ensure scalability, resilience, and flexibility that existing approaches lack of. Experimental results illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. Analytical results contribute a deeper understanding of how coordinated mobility of drones influences sensing performance. This novel coordination solution is applied to traffic monitoring using real-world data to demonstrate a 46.45% more accurate and 2.88% more efficient detection of vehicles as the number of drones become a scarce resource.",0968-090X,Not found
Dynamic and Pareto-improving swapping of vehicles to enhance integrated and modular mobility services,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104366,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Efficiency of many mobility services depends on effective matching of service vehicles and customers over time and space. New technologies, such as those related to service integrators and modularized autonomous vehicle platforms (i.e., chassis with built-in power and control systems), further allow pooling of vehicles from traditionally separate service operators to flexibly serve multiple types of customers (e.g., passengers and freight). Dynamic matching systems, if not carefully managed, suffer from the so-called wild goose chase (WGC) phenomenon, which describes an inefficient system equilibrium with a large number of vehicles trapped in unproductive deadheading. This paper proposes a new dynamic vehicle swap strategy that can be used to enhance system efficiency by reducing the expected waiting/deadheading time. This strategy can not only mitigate the WGC and reduce the needed fleet size, but also ensure that the vehicle swap achieves a Pareto improvement for each involved participant. Approximate analytic formulas are derived from a series of differential equations and spatial probability models to estimate the expected system performance in the steady state. This system of nonlinear equations can be solved numerically to yield the equilibrium points and the associated system performance metrics. Agent-based simulations are used to verify the accuracy of the derived formulas, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic and Pareto-improving swap strategy in a variety of application contexts (e.g., taxi, service integrator, or pooled modular chassis).",0968-090X,Not found
Simulating intra-household interactions for in- and out-of-home activity scheduling,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104362,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Various interactions, time arrangements, and constraints exist for individuals scheduling their day as a member of a household, which affect their in-home as well as out-of-home activity schedule. However, the existing activity-based models are mostly based on the individual decision-making process, which are limited in their demonstration of behaviour. We simulate multiple intra-household interaction dimensions within the same framework and capture the coordination of the activity scheduling decisions among all household members. Our approach adopts the Optimisation-based Activity Scheduling Integrating Simultaneous choice dimensions (OASIS) framework, which is at the level of isolated individuals and focuses on out-of-home activity schedules. We jointly simulate in- and out-of-home activities and incorporate interactions into the framework. Our framework contributes to the state-of-the-art in activity-based modelling by explicitly capturing multiple interactions within the same model, such as the allocation of the private vehicle to household members, dividing household maintenance responsibilities, escorting, joint activity participation, and sharing rides. We operationalise the model using time-use-survey data from the United Kingdom. The simulation results demonstrate the ability of the framework to capture complex intra-household interactions. We then demonstrate how these interactions can cause individuals to deviate from their schedules planned in isolation. This is a general framework applicable to different household compositions and available resources.",0968-090X,Not found
Understanding causal effects of ride-sourcing subsidy: A novel generative adversarial networks approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104371,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Ride-sourcing platforms offer subsidies for drivers to ensure stable supply capacity for on-demand ride services. These subsidies guarantee minimum surges in advance to help drivers plan to drive, thus more efficiently coping with the spatial–temporal imbalance between supply and demand than surge wage. Understanding the causal effects of ride-sourcing subsidy is a prerequisite for precision targeting when deploying driver promotion activities. We propose a novel generative adversarial networks based model GANIRC to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) of ride-sourcing subsidy on drivers' online time. It captures counterfactual distributions via adversarial learning and generates individual response curves (IRCs) in the form of neural networks. The generator acts as a metafunction of responses, and the analytical constraints of IRCs are relaxed. Wasserstein distance is adopted to measure the closeness between counterfactual and factual distributions, and improve the stability of the minimax game between the generator and discriminator. In addition to the theoretical proof that our model approximately minimizes the upper bound on the ITE estimation error, the model performance is verified by leveraging ride-sourcing subsidy activity data in four cities with varying scales. Results show that our proposed model can generate accurate counterfactual distributions based on limited observational data. In the case study of the four cities, the drivers with neoclassical behavior, who increase working time with income, dominate in the ride-sourcing market, and inactive drivers respond more positively to subsidies than active drivers. Very few drivers in large cities are identified to have income-targeting behavior, who have income targets and stop working when reaching these targets. Our study reconciles the controversy of whether neoclassical theory or income-targeting theory is appropriate for ride-sourcing drivers, and has practical implications for understanding behavior and optimizing ride-sourcing operations.",0968-090X,Not found
General real-time three-dimensional multi-aircraft conflict resolution method using multi-agent reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104367,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been studied for solving the conflict resolution (CR) problem in air traffic management, leveraging their potential for computation and ability to handle uncertainty. However, challenges remain that impede the application of RL methods to CR in practice, including three-dimensional manoeuvres, generalisation, trajectory recovery, and success rate. This paper proposes a general multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for real-time three-dimensional multi-aircraft conflict resolution, in which agents share a neural network and are deployed on each aircraft to form a distributed decision-making system. To address the challenges, several technologies are introduced, including a partial observation model based on imminent threats for generalisation, a safety separation relaxation model for multiple flight levels for three-dimensional manoeuvres, an adaptive manoeuvre strategy for trajectory recovery, and a conflict buffer model for success rate. The Rainbow Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) is used to enhance the efficiency of the RL process. A simulation environment that considers flight uncertainty (resulting from mechanical and navigation errors and wind) is constructed to train and evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can resolve conflicts in scenarios with much higher traffic density than in today’s real-world situations.",0968-090X,Not found
Stability analysis and connected vehicles management for mixed traffic flow with platoons of connected automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104370,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Recently, the market has witnessed the emergence of intelligent vehicles equipped with diverse functionalities. Among these are connected automated vehicles (CAVs) boasting a comprehensive platooning capability, and connected vehicles (CVs), which essentially refer to human-driven vehicles (HVs) equipped with connectivity features. As a result, CAVs, CVs, and regular human-driven vehicles (RVs) will form a mixed CAV-CV-RV flow to affect stability of existing traffic flow, which is an important characteristic of traffic flow operations. This paper investigates stability of this new mixed CAV-CV-RV flow, explores effect of CVs on stability, and proposes CV management strategy aimed at achieving a stable traffic flow. We firstly establish definition of the novel mixed flow comprising CAVs, CVs, and RVs. Subsequently, we present a general analytical approach for evaluating stability of this mixed flow. Then we undertake an empirical study that incorporates car-following models, validated using real experiments involving the aforementioned vehicle types. Based on findings from our stability analysis, we proceed to propose a CV management strategy designed to guarantee stable conditions within this mixed traffic flow. Results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed general analytical method in assessing influences of various system factors on stability of this new mixed flow. Subsequent to an application of the analytical method, empirical study uncovers a noteworthy finding that CVs prove to be more effective than CAVs in ensuring stable conditions within the mixed flow. Then we can manage market proportion of CVs in order to achieve stable mixed flow, according to varying CAV penetration rates. Specifically, some interesting lessons are learned based on the empirical study: (i) to guarantee stable operations of mixed traffic flow, about one third of CVs are needed to be among HVs, before CAVs running on road (CV-RV mixed flow); (ii) management strategy for stable flow requires an increase of minimum CV proportion among HVs from 33% to 55%, as CAV penetration rates increase up to 50%; (iii) when CAV penetration rates are greater than 50%, the required minimum CV proportion for ensuring traffic flow stability decreases with the increase of CAV penetration rates.",0968-090X,Not found
To share or not to share? Revealing determinants of individuals’ willingness to share rides through a big data approach,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104372,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Ridesplitting has been widely recognised as a promising mobility mode for sustainable transportation, but its success largely depends on a sufficient number of passengers who are willing to share their rides. To uncover the determinants of willingness to share (WTS), prior studies typically relied on either individual-level survey-based or aggregate-level data-driven methods. To combine the former’s strength in capturing individual choice preferences and the latter’s advantage in utilising available multi-source big data, this study proposes a big data approach to modelling individual choices between the solo and shared options for each trip. To reconstruct the choice process, we leverage large-scale real-world trip records and propose a learning framework to not only retrieve the trip time and fare of the chosen option (solo or shared), but also impute the likely time and fare of the alternative option. These reconstructed trip attributes are then integrated with the sociodemographic, built environment and traffic features from other data sources. Finally, all these variables are fed into a random coefficient logit model to reveal passengers’ ridesplitting preferences. Through a case study of Manhattan, New York City, we reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of WTS and its determinants. Results show that WTS varies greatly across space and time. The time-fare trade-off is identified as the most essential factor, with the value of time revealed to be about $28-36/h. WTS decreases with longer trip distance/commuting time/distance to the urban centre, lower road speed, and higher speed fluctuation/bus station/crime density, but increases with a higher proportion of middle-class/female/young residents, residential land use and metro station. The proposed methodology can be used to explain and monitor WTS in a cost-effective way, complementing traditional survey-based methods to better design and promote ridesplitting services.",0968-090X,Not found
The electric on-demand bus routing problem with partial charging and nonlinear function,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104368,157,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The electric vehicle routing problems (EVRPs) with recharging policy consider the limited range of electric vehicles and thus include intermediate visits to charging stations (CSs). In general, minimizing the resultant charging costs such as charging duration or charging amount is also part of the objective of the EVRP. Accordingly, the EVRP has received considerable attention over the past years. Nevertheless, this type of problem in the domain of passenger transportation, a VRP variant, has been rarely studied in the literature, especially with time windows, a realistic nonlinear charging function or a partial charging policy. Hence this research extends the existing work on the EVRP to the on-demand bus routing problem (ODBRP) which transports passengers with the bus station assignment (BSA). The resultant problem is the electric ODBRP (EODBRP). Specifically, each passenger can have more than one stations to board or alight, and they are assigned to the ones with the smallest increase in the total user ride time (URT). In the EODBRP, frequent intermediate visits to CSs are considered. Moreover, a nonlinear charging function is used and the partial charging strategy is applied. To solve the EODBRP, a greedy insertion method with a ‘charging first, routing second’ strategy is developed, followed by a large neighborhood search (LNS) which consists of local search (LS) operators to further improve the solution quality. Experimental data are generated by a realistic instance generator based on a real city map, and the corresponding results show that the proposed heuristic algorithm performs well in solving the EODBRP. Finally, sensitivity analyses with divergent parameters such as the temporal distributions of passengers and bus ranges may provide practical guidance.",0968-090X,Not found
Analyzing scenario criticality and rider's intervention behavior during high-level autonomous driving: A VR-enabled approach and empirical insights,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104451,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The safety of autonomous driving systems (ADS) has been attracting extensive attentions of research and practice worldwide. One major concern on the existing ADS is the failure to identify and react to certain situations, resulting in either critical fatalities or urgent intervention by riders. There is an increasing need to understand the characteristics of such situations and scenarios. This paper sheds light on this direction by defining and measuring the “criticality” of typical driving scenarios during high-level autonomous driving in a mixed traffic environment. Autonomous driving simulations and human-in-the-loop experiments are conducted using a virtual reality enabled simulation platform. We correlate ADS-involved traffic conflicts with environmental features via autonomous driving simulations from over 10,000 testing scenarios and statistically evaluate the criticality level. We collect people’s behavioral data from 900 representative scenarios to observe the differences in reactions between ADS and human riders when facing the same situation. Our results demonstrate apparent differences in criticality perceptions between humans and ADS. The risk perception and action by ADS are mainly governed by on-road dynamics according to other road users’ behavior, whereas human riders are affected by both on-road dynamics and environmental features such as traffic, lighting, and weather conditions. To gain more insights, we analyze the intervention behavior performed by the riders. Interestingly, riders tend to intervene more under seemingly “uncritical” scenarios with low criticality values compared to scenarios with high criticality values. These are useful insights for rethinking and enhancing the intelligence of the current ADS. Our work advocates for the creation of a library of critical scenarios and emphasizes the importance of incorporating human perceptions into the system’s decision-making process. Furthermore, our results suggest that the adoption of the ADS depends on the role of the riders. People tend to intervene less and thus show more trust while “feeling” as a passenger.",0968-090X,Not found
3-Strategy evolutionary game model for operation extensions of subway networks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104349,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"With the growing demand for night travel and the development of the night-time economy, extending the operation time of metropolitan subway networks has become essential. This paper proposes a 2-population 3-strategy evolutionary game model for subway network operation extension decisions, which considers the interests of subway companies, passengers, and the government while addressing transfer failure between lines due to uncoordinated subway operation time adjustments. The study resolves the Evolutionary Equilibria (EEs) of the replicator dynamics system and identifies key factors influencing the evolutionary path using theoretical calculations and a ternary phase diagram. Additionally, an extended game model investigates the impact of adjustment minutes. To verify the models, a case study based on the Beijing subway network is conducted. We show that the rule of maximum total fitness ensures the priority of EE strategies for all lines, selecting Nash equilibrium strategies for the lines which cannot select EE in a vastly reduced network strategy profile space (from 729 to 2). The study concludes that combining subsidy measures can eliminate multiple equilibria produced by implementing only penalty measures, and combining penalty measures can have the effect of making small subsidies as effective as large subsidies. The variation of the satisfaction/loyalty affects the system equilibrium only when both game players value passenger satisfaction/loyalty. Finally, we find that the proper adjustment minutes not only can make operation extension a long-term best strategy but also increase the payoff (106,158 RMB/year) and enhance the occupancy rate (20 %) of the last train. The study provides a theoretical foundation for the government to regulate the operation extension of subway companies from multiple perspectives.",0968-090X,Not found
Demand forecasting and predictability identification of ride-sourcing via bidirectional spatial-temporal transformer neural processes,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104427,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Understanding the spatial–temporal stochasticity in shared mobility is crucial for ride-sourcing demand forecasting, supply–demand management, and vehicle dispatch optimization. In contrast to conventional deep learning methods that typically provide point predictions or deterministic predictions, this paper introduces the bidirectional spatial–temporal Transformer neural processes (Bi-STTNP) prediction model, which stands out from conventional deep learning methods by providing probabilistic predictions and uncertainty estimations for ride-sourcing demand. Bi-STTNP captures the multivariate spatial–temporal Gaussian distribution of demand, offering not only demand expectations but also comprehensive uncertainty representations. We propose a predictability identification process based on predictive distributions to assess varying predictability across time slots and regions, improving interpretability. Our model, consisting of the bidirectional supply–demand attention module and spatial–temporal Transformer module, maintains interpretability while ensuring accurate demand expectation predictions. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 15 million ride-sourcing orders in Hangzhou, China, demonstrate that Bi-STTNP outperforms baseline models in predicting demand expectation and quantifying demand uncertainty. Furthermore, we compute loose spatial–temporal predictability lower bounds and categorize regions by predictability, providing insights for optimizing passenger pricing strategies, driver incentives, and vehicle dispatching in ride-sourcing platforms.",0968-090X,Not found
Privacy-preserving adaptive traffic signal control in a connected vehicle environment,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104453,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Although Connected Vehicles (CVs) have demonstrated tremendous potential to enhance traffic operations, they can impose privacy risks on individual travelers, e.g., leaking sensitive information about their frequently visited places, routing behavior, etc. Despite the large body of literature that devises various algorithms to exploit CV information, research on privacy-preserving traffic control is still in its infancy. In this paper, we aim to fill this research gap and propose a privacy-preserving adaptive traffic signal control method using partially connected vehicle data. Specifically, we proposed a privacy-preserving mechanism to protect CV data against three types of attacks: CV collusion attacks, database attacks, and inference attacks. The mechanism leverages secure Multi-Party Computation and differential privacy to aggregate individual-level CV data to calculate key traffic parameters without compromising the privacy of CV users. For seamless integration with the privacy-preserving mechanism, we develop a traffic signal optimization model and an arrival rate estimator relying only on aggregated CV data, being applied to both undersaturated and oversaturated traffic conditions. The optimization model is further extended to a stochastic programming problem to explicitly handle the noises added by the privacy-preserving mechanism. Evaluation results show that the linear optimization model preserves privacy with a marginal impact on control performance, and the stochastic programming model can significantly reduce residual queues compared to the linear programming model, with almost no increase in vehicle delay. Overall, our methods demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating privacy-preserving mechanisms in CV-based traffic modeling and control, which guarantees both utility and privacy.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal en-route charging station locations for electric vehicles with heterogeneous range anxiety,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104459,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This paper addresses a new optimal charging station location problem for intercity highway networks where electric vehicles are of heterogeneous driving ranges and usually need to be charged multiple times in their long-haul trips. Driving range heterogeneity can be measured in practice by sampling the driving population under a variety of physical, environmental and psychological conditions and is characterized in this study by a continuous distribution of some appropriate forms. The behavioral assumption underlying this problem is that all individual drivers choose their optimal route-and-charge choices if they can make a trip by driving an electric vehicle or cancel their trips or switch to other transportation modes if they cannot. By explicitly taking into account the impact of limited driving ranges on both route and trip/mode choices, we constructed a mixed integer linear programming model for formulating the charging station location problem, the goal of which is to maximize the networkwide travel efficiency and preference subject to a limited infrastructure investment budget. To tackle this integer programming model, we developed a branch-and-bound algorithm and a neighborhood search heuristic, in both of which a multi-criterion label-correcting algorithm is embedded for deriving the underlying route-and-charge flow pattern. For justifying the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, a synthetic network and two real-world networks are employed as numerical examples. The computational results obtained from the numerical analysis show that the heuristic is capable of obtaining optimal solutions in most test scenarios and is much more computationally efficient than the branch-and-bound algorithm, with a computing time that is only about one tenth of the latter.",0968-090X,Not found
Quantifying periodic railway network capacity using petri nets and macroscopic fundamental diagram,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104436,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The infrastructure occupation of many European railway networks appears to be at its limits, whilst recent public discussions aim to shift even more traffic towards the railway system. Thus, the question of the railway network’s capacity is gaining increasing attention. In this paper, we assess the capacity of periodic railway networks on the strategic level, using a newly developed petri net (PN) based approach: the railway network utilization model (RNUM). The model builds upon individual lines which are connected to more complex networks. The network’s emerging elementary circuits are then used for utilization analysis. To assess the networks capacity, the model is applied in the enumeration-based railway network capacity (RNC) framework. By evaluating the maximum utilization of different scenarios, the capacity of the periodic network is identified. This framework provides the minimal operable frequency of the network and corresponding train flows, as well as the average scheduled waiting times per train. It thereby assesses the capacity and the corresponding network effects, which are quantified in a network-specific macroscopic fundamental diagram for the railway network (MFD-R). Experiments on different generic networks demonstrate the RNC framework’s applicability and reveal additional insights into the connections between train flow, waiting times and the total number of trains. The results show sensitivity between the networks throughput performance and the networks saturation. The evaluation also shows that the maximum utilization just emerges under very specific conditions and might result in unstable operations. Additionally, the results illustrate dependencies between network capacity and the network’s structure. Furthermore, a case study performed at a real life railway network in the Netherlands proves the realism of the results. It is thus shown, that the presented model can contribute to prepare railway networks for tomorrows traffic and thus support the recent ambitions for eco-friendly transport.",0968-090X,Not found
A two-stage stochastic programming approach for dynamic OD estimation using LBSN data,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104460,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Estimating origin–destination (OD) demand is essential for urban transport management and traffic control systems. With the ubiquity of smartphones, location based social networks (LBSN) data has emerged as a new rich data source with broad urban spatial and temporal coverage highly suitable for OD estimation. Its nature of confirmed trip purpose (activity) and activity chain host makes it more advantageous than other data (e.g., household travel surveys and traffic network detection). On the other hand, LBSN data is a more direct and accurate representation of demand patterns and can remove the significant burden of developing traffic models and estimating simulation-based objective functions. However, thus far, most LBSN-based estimation models only focus on static (day-level) OD estimation, making less use of those characteristics. To this end, this paper establishes a two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP) framework integrating the activity chains to model activity-level dynamic mobility flows using LBSN data. The first-stage model aims to minimize the errors introduced by the inter-zone OD flows alongside the expected errors of the check-in patterns. The second-stage model attempts to minimize the errors produced by the considered check-in pattern scenarios. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is used to generate plausible check-in scenarios. A generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) algorithm is presented to solve the two-stage stochastic programming model. We conduct the experiments on the case study of Tokyo, Japan, under the employment of the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator. The results show that algorithm convergence can be guaranteed within several iterations. The approach can provide satisfactory estimations of check-in patterns, zonal production and attraction, and OD flows. Furthermore, multiple objective function states are tested for evaluating the completeness of the proposed framework and exploring its potential for simplification and extension. Incorporating specific penalty terms into the objective function also provides a way to verify the reliability of the two-stage structure and validate the effectiveness of the model. Finally, we discuss the model enhancement from the perspectives of online OD estimation by integrating with LBSN simulations, network-wide OD extrapolation using appropriate scaling methods, and removing the user-side data requirement by leveraging activity chain modeling.

Strategic driver repositioning in ride-hailing networks with dual sourcing,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104450,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"In ride-hailing markets, the spatial mismatch between supply and demand characterizes one of the most fundamental operational bottlenecks. The voluntary customer search of drivers is oftentimes inadequate for narrowing the demand-supply gaps and falls short in responding timely to the dynamic market conditions. To facilitate better supply management, some ride-hailing platforms now adopt a dual-sourcing strategy by converting some freelance drivers as contractors, who would then follow platforms’ guidance on repositioning movements when idle. This paper thus aims to analyze the implications of such a dual-sourcing strategy on the overall operations of ride-hailing services. We consider a monopolistic platform that owns a blended workforce, with freelance drivers searching for customers following their own preferences whilst contracted drivers repositioning in a centralized manner as system actuators. A mixed network equilibrium model is devised to capture the interplay between the idle repositioning movements of both parties. The theoretical existence of the mixed equilibrium is proved, and real-world data is invited to quantify the effects of dual sourcing on various market sectors. Our numerical results confirm the effectiveness of dual sourcing in smoothing operations, increasing customer demand, and driving up the revenue of ride-hailing services. However, the benefit of dual sourcing to the platform remains sensitive to the proportion of contractors in the entire workforce as well as the stimulative commission beyond their regular service income.",0968-090X,Not found

This study presents a real-time control system for operating JAD against multiple moving jams on freeway sections under a partial CAVs and heterogeneous (mixture of cars and trucks) traffic environment. The system dynamically predicts absorbing end points by estimating the propagation of multiple moving jams without using a traffic model. Subsequently, it selects suitable CAVs as absorbing cars in traffic via vehicle-to-infrastructure communication to absorb moving jams. A control model embedded with complete/synergetic JAD strategy decision-making and moving jams–CAVs matching process was developed to guarantee moving jams can be properly absorbed as early as possible. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed JAD system successfully reduced successive multiple moving jams in the toy model (with two artificial successive moving jams) and hypothetical bottleneck (with series moving jams generated by a speed limit zone) scenarios. Moreover, sensitivity analysis indicated that the JAD system effectively reduced moving jams and enhanced traffic performance (e.g., about 10% fuel consumption reduction) under approximately 1% to 10% CAV market penetration rates (MPRs).

Infrastructure-Assisted cooperative driving and intersection management in mixed traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104443,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Infrastructure-assisted cooperative driving, which consists of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) trajectory planning and traffic signal control, can greatly improve the efficiency of signalized intersection operations. In existing studies, the CAV trajectory planning problem is simplified to only modeling longitudinal vehicle behaviors or assuming the lane changing can be executed instantaneously. The generated CAV trajectories are not realistic and can’t be implemented at the vehicle level. Instantaneous lane changing process may also lead to safety issues or uncomfortable driving behavior of following vehicles in a mixed traffic environment. To fill this research gap, we propose an optimization framework that integrates a full CAV trajectory planning model with traffic signal control in a cooperative driving environment with both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). A two-level optimization model is formulated based on discrete time. The high-level model optimizes traffic signal parameters, CAV arrival time, and lane assignment at the stop bar, to minimize total vehicle delay. Given arrival time and lane assignment, the low-level model generates trajectories with integrated car-following and lane-changing maneuvers to mimic a human driving policy based on imitation learning. Numerical experiments from a real-world intersection show that the proposed model outperforms adaptive and fixed time signal control by as much as 63.06% in terms of reduction of average vehicle delay, due to better utilization of lane capacity and reduced lost time. In addition to mobility benefits, fuel consumption is also significantly reduced under the proposed infrastructure-assisted cooperative driving framework.",0968-090X,Not found

To this end, we use a queueing-theoretic model to characterize the vehicle waiting time at charging stations and battery swapping stations, respectively. The model is integrated into an economic analysis of the electric AMoD system operated by a transportation network company (TNC), where the incentives of passengers, the charging/operating shift of TNC vehicles, the operational decisions of the platform, and the planning decisions of the government are captured. Overall, a bi-level optimization framework is proposed for charging infrastructure planning of the electric AMoD system. Based on the proposed framework, we compare the socio-economic performance of plug-in charging and battery swapping, and investigate how this comparison depends on the evolving charging technologies (such as charging speed, battery capacity, and infrastructure cost). At the planning level, we find that when choosing plug-in charging, increased charging speed leads to a transformation of infrastructure from sparsely distributed large stations to densely distributed small stations, while enlarged battery capacity transforms the infrastructure from densely distributed small stations to sparsely distributed large stations. On the other hand, when choosing battery swapping, both increased charging speed and enlarged battery capacity will lead to a smaller number of battery swapping stations. At the operational level, we find that improved charging speed leads to increased TNC profit when choosing plug-in charging, whereas improved charging speed may lead to smaller TNC profit under battery swapping.

Integrated self-consistent macro-micro traffic flow modeling and calibration framework based on trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104439,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Calibrating microscopic car-following (CF) models is crucial in traffic flow theory as it allows for accurate reproduction and investigation of traffic behavior and phenomena. Typically, the calibration procedure is a complicated, non-convex optimization issue. When the traffic state is in equilibrium, the macroscopic flow model can be derived analytically from the corresponding CF model. In contrast to the microscopic CF model, calibrated based on trajectory data, the macroscopic representation of the fundamental diagram (FD) primarily adopts loop detector data for calibration. The different calibration approaches at the macro- and microscopic levels may lead to misaligned parameters with identical practical meanings in both macro- and micro-traffic models. This inconsistency arises from the difference between the parameter calibration processes used in macro- and microscopic traffic flow models. Hence, this study proposes an integrated multiresolution traffic flow modeling framework using the same trajectory data for parameter calibration based on the self-consistency concept. This framework incorporates multiple objective functions in the macro- and micro-dimensions. To expeditiously execute the proposed framework, an improved metaheuristic multi-objective optimization algorithm is presented that employs multiple enhancement strategies. Additionally, a deep learning technique based on attention mechanisms was used to extract stationary-state traffic data for the macroscopic calibration process, instead of directly using the entire aggregated data. We conducted experiments using real-world and synthetic trajectory data to validate our self-consistent calibration framework.",0968-090X,Not found
Development and experimental validation of a humanoid pedestrian model that captures stepping behavior and body rotation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104446,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This paper presents a novel humanoid pedestrian model (HPM) incorporating stepping behavior and body rotation. The HPM is composed of two main components: (a) body modeling and (b) gait planning. A pedestrian is represented as a three-dimensional skeleton with 11 degrees of freedom in the body modeling component, which provides a universal approach for explaining the mathematical correlations between joint rotation angles and critical gait parameters such as step length, step width, and projected shoulder width. A framework for designing gaits that accounts for step-synchronization behavior and the effect of body rotation on stepping behavior is offered by the gait planning process. To validate the model, two types of experiments were conducted: nine sets of single-file experiments and 10 sets of bidirectional flow experiments, in which pedestrians walked in a 0.5-m-wide circular corridor and rotated their bodies to avoid collisions. It was suggested by the fundamental diagrams that body rotation reduces the walking speed of a pedestrian and consequently affects the overall flow rate. Furthermore, it was found that pedestrians were more resistant to moving forward in narrow bidirectional flow environments and tend to wait for a larger gap in front to take a longer or faster step. This behavior led to the formation of stop-and-go waves in the narrow-corridor scenario. The simulation results were consistent with the experimental findings in terms of flow-density relationships and the reproduction of stop-and-go waves. Additionally, synchronized steps were detected in the simulation and quantitatively compared with a publicly available dataset. The HPM offers a new perspective on modeling pedestrian dynamics and emphasizes the necessity of accounting for micro-characteristics at the step level in pedestrian models.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimization of container allocation and yard cranes dispatched under delayed transshipment,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104429,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Due to variations in carrying capacity and visiting periods of vessels calling at terminals, certain transshipped containers may not be able to be transported immediately after arrival. Instead, they must be temporarily stored in the yard and scheduled for later transportation. Increased container storage time in the yard as a consequence of transit delays not only incurs additional costs for shipping companies, but also introduces new issues for terminal yard management. Therefore, this study investigates the daily storage yard management challenges that arise in marine container terminals that integrate space allocation and yard crane deployment decisions while considering the delayed transshipment of containers. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to describe the problem, whose objectives are to minimize the transportation costs for container loading and discharge operations, penalty costs associated with the delayed transshipment of containers, transportation costs associated with containers not transshipped within the planning horizon, and yard crane inter-block movement costs. The Benders decomposition algorithm is applied to address this problem, and the traditional decomposition approach is improved by adding characteristics such as the development of strong optimality cuts and the generation of a powerful initial solution to the master problem. Extensive experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the model and efficiency of the proposed improved Benders decomposition algorithm.",0968-090X,Not found

In view of the above concerns existing in the trajectory planning of logistics drones, this paper presents a parallel automatic delivery model following the cyber-physical social system (CPSS) for the last mile delivery of superchilling products, revealing the social value of logistics drone operations. Considering the operational constraints of logistics drone, a multi-objective optimisation model is established to balance the social value, energy efficiency and productivity of using logistics drones in the last-mile superchilling delivery. To effectively achieve the above optimisation, improved strategies, including the material exchange mechanism based on the random proportion rule and the Universe-Particle search strategy, are developed, resulting in an improved two-stage heuristic algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out in a simulated environment with 154 buildings, and compared with other frontier algorithms used for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning.

Stabilizing traffic flow by autonomous vehicles: Stability analysis and implementation considerations,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104449,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is expected to revolutionize road transportation and it has been demonstrated that AVs can be employed as mobile actuators to effectively dissipate stop and go waves. This paper proposes a comprehensive theoretical framework including stability and implementation considerations for analyzing traffic platoon control via sparse AVs and discussing the number of HDVs that can be stabilized by one AV. Considering multiple disturbance sources, we first discuss the output error composition and analyze traffic dynamics in a platoon system. Then we discuss the Lyapunov asymptotic stability (LAS) of the system based on eigenvalue analysis and propose a novel ring string stability (RSS), which ensures the boundedness of disturbance error and guarantees that the effect of disturbance will not be amplified over a lap. The proposed RSS is flexible and applicable to mixed traffic, since the string instability for predecessor-follower pairs are allowed, provided they can be compensated by AVs. In addition, the practical constraints including driving safety and vehicle physical limitations are modeled. The worst-case evaluation of constraints is conducted to reproduce the critical scenarios in real life. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments and analyze the traffic platoon control from the aspects of both stability and practical implementations. New findings include: (1) The introduction of AVs is beneficial to dampen the waves and stabilize the HDV flow. (2) Considering the implementation issues, there is an upper bound of HDVs that can be stabilized by one single AV. (3) As the number and amplitudes of exogenous disturbances increase, it will be more challenging for sparse AVs to ensure stability and meanwhile satisfy the practical constraints.",0968-090X,Not found

A state-based inverse reinforcement learning approach to model activity-travel choices behavior with reward function recovery,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104454,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Behaviorally oriented activity-travel choices (ATC) modeling is a principal part of travel demand analysis. Traditional econometric and rule-based methods require explicit model structures and complex domain knowledge. While several recent studies used machine learning models, especially adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) models, to learn potential ATC patterns with less expert-designed settings, they lack a clear representation of rational ATC behavior. In this study, we propose a data-driven IRL framework based on the maximum causal approach to minimize f-divergences between expert and agent state marginal distributions, which provides a more sample-efficient measurement. In addition, we specify a separate state-only reward function and derive an analytical gradient of the f-divergence objective with respect to reward parameters to ensure good convergences. The method can recover a stationary reward function, which assures the agent to get close to the expert behavior when training from scratch. We validate the proposed model using cellular signaling data from Chongqing, China by comparing with baseline models (behavior cloning, policy-based, and reward-based models) in aspects of policy performance comparison, reward recovery, and reward transfer tasks. The experiment results indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods and is relatively less sensitive to the number of expert demonstrations.

Machine learning-enhanced aircraft landing scheduling under uncertainties,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104444,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Aircraft delays lead to safety concerns and financial losses, which can propagate for several hours during extreme scenarios. Developing an efficient landing scheduling method is one of the effective approaches to reducing flight delays and safety concerns. Existing scheduling practices are mostly done by air traffic controllers (ATC) with heuristic rules. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-enhanced methodology for aircraft landing scheduling. Data-driven machine learning (ML) models are proposed to enhance automation and safety. ML enhancement is adopted for both prediction and optimization. First, the flight arrival delay scenarios are analyzed to identify the delay-related factors, where strong multimodal distributions and arrival flight time duration clusters are observed. A multi-stage conditional ML predictor is proposed for improved prediction performance of separation time conditioned on flight events. Next, we propose incorporating the ML predictions as safety constraints of the time-constrained traveling salesman problem formulation. The scheduling problem is then solved with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Additionally, uncertainties between successive flights from historical flight recordings and model predictions are included to ensure reliability. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our method using the flight track and event data from the Sherlock database of the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC ZTL). The case studies provide evidence that the proposed method is capable of reducing the total landing time by an average of 17.2% across three case studies, when compared to the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) rule.

Trajectory planning at a signalized road section in a mixed traffic environment considering lane-changing of CAVs and stochasticity of HDVs,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104441,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are projected to bring significant benefits to traffic efficiency and driving comfort. However, the realization of full CAV penetration rate will take a long time. In this paper, a framework is proposed for planning the trajectories of vehicles at a signalized road section in a mixed traffic environment consisting of CAVs, human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected and automated buses (CABs). In the proposed trajectory planning framework (TPF), both the lane-changing (LC) behavior of CAVs and the stochasticity of HDVs are considered. The whole TPF is composed of a planning module, a running module, and a switching module. In the planning module, the mixed integer programming (MIP) models for trajectory planning with/without LCs are formulated to optimize the trajectories of CAVs/CABs. A parsimonious algorithm is designed to determine a suitable planning time horizon for the MIP models. The running module and the switching module are designed to ensure the driving safety of vehicles. To consider the stochasticity of HDVs, the concept of α -trajectory is employed in simulations to produce predicted trajectories of HDVs, while the actual trajectories of HDVs are generated by a stochastic car-following model. Here, α is a parameter between 0 and 1 related to one randomly changing parameter of HDVs, and α -trajectory is a series of predicted trajectories generated for HDVs based on the value of α . A rolling time horizon scheme is applied for TPF to account for the time-varying traffic situations. Numerical experiments under different traffic states and market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs/CABs are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed TPF. The average improvement in travel time and fuel consumption can reach up to 28.9 %, 17.8 % and 52.2 %, 35.3 % under medium and heavy traffic, respectively, and the average improvement in driving comfort is over 20 % in most traffic scenarios. The comparison experiment without fixed rolling time window (FTW) shows the advantage of setting FTW in adapting to the time-varying traffic situations, especially under heavy traffic. The sensitivity analysis shows that the values of α 1 and α 2 associated with α -trajectory can affect the performance of the proposed TPF in varying degrees.

In container terminal operations, uncertainty in equipment operating time poses challenges to effective scheduling, as even small fluctuations can create cascade effects throughout the operations, rendering the original schedule ineffective. This research aims to develop a new method that enables a balance between optimization and robustness in container terminal scheduling. Additionally, the double-cycling operation mode and U-shaped port layout, known for their improved efficiency in container terminals, are gaining increasing attention and hence are incorporated into this study. It creates a three-stage hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with bi-directional flows, waiting time, and uncertain operation time. To address the complex problem, a mixed integer programming model is proposed to characterize the integrated scheduling problem, and an index based on complex network structure entropy is designed to evaluate the anti-cascade effect as well as the robustness of the schedule.

Regional route guidance with realistic compliance patterns: Application of deep reinforcement learning and MPC,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104440,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Solving link-based route guidance problems for large-scale networks is computationally challenging and faces practical issues, such as spatial–temporal data coverage. Thus, regional route guidance has emerged as a promising strategy, which utilizes regional approaches (i.e., network-level macroscopic traffic models) to capture traffic dynamics. Existing regional route guidance models have mainly focused on macroscopic flows and aggregated splitting rates, employing uniformly sampled vehicles as controllable targets. These models, however, overlook the inherent nature of individual drivers’ compliance. It may deteriorate the guidance performance as existing route guidance models cannot effectively generate customized route plans for compliant vehicles. This paper aims to introduce a regional route guidance framework with the utilization of different solution approaches, i.e. model-based and data-driven, considering the compliance pattern. In particular, MPC-based and deep reinforcement learning-based schemes are proposed for the information service provider to send customized route plans to compliant individuals. Within each solution approach, different route guidance strategies are developed for specific purposes and evaluated through numerical experiments under low- and high-congestion scenarios.

Our model learns time-specific O-D matrices and utility functions and network flow parameters such as link flows, path flows, and travel times. To increase the model’s representational capacity for reproducing observed link flows and travel times, the parameters of the link performance functions are assumed link-specific. More importantly, the utility function in the route choice model is enriched with (i) link-specific parameters to capture the effect of unobserved attributes on route choices and (ii) period-specific parameters weighting the observed features in the utility function to capture the heterogeneity of travelers preferences among periods of the day. Experiments on synthetic data show that the parameters of the models can be consistently recovered and that the solution of the model satisfies the SUELOGIT conditions with high accuracy.

Nowadays, all kinds of traffic modes gradually become interconnected and form a complex multi-traffic modes system, while extensive studies focus on the single-traffic mode and ignore the correlations among different traffic modes. There exist some challenges for short-term inflow prediction of multi-traffic modes: (1) the interaction mechanism among multi-traffic modes is difficult to learn and few studies explore the mechanism, (2) the data of multi-traffic modes are usually heterogenous due to the different spatial units of different traffic modes, and (3) it is challenging to extract the complex and dynamic features of the multi-traffic modes and most existing methods apply static spatiotemporal correlations among multi-traffic modes, while the genuine correlations among different traffic modes might be missing.

Dynamic routing for the Electric Vehicle Shortest Path Problem with charging station occupancy information,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104411,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"We study the problem of an Electric Vehicle (EV) having to travel from an origin to a destination in the shortest amount of time. We focus on long-distance settings, where the shortest path between the origin and the destination has energy requirements exceeding the EV autonomy. The EV may charge its battery at public Charging Stations (CSs), which are subject to unknown arrivals of exogenous vehicles requiring uncertain charging times. Thus, the waiting times at CSs are uncertain. Similar to other contributions in the literature, we model CSs using appropriately defined queues, whose status is revealed upon the EV arrival. However, following recent technological advances, we also consider that the status of each CS is updated in real-time via binary Occupancy Indicator (OI) information signaling if a CS is busy or not. Therefore, we assume that the EV continuously receives OI updates on all CSs. At each update, we determine the sequence of CSs to visit along with associated charging quantities. We name the resulting problem as the Electric Vehicle Shortest Path Problem with charging station Occupancy Indicator information (EVSPP-OI). In this problem, we consider that the EV is allowed to partially charge its battery, and we model charging times via piecewise linear charging functions that depend on the CS technology. We propose a Markov Decision Process formulation for the EVSPP-OI, which aims at optimizing the EV routing and charging policy. To solve the problem, we develop a reoptimization algorithm that establishes the sequence of CS visits and charging amounts based on system updates. Specifically, we propose a simulation-based approach to estimate the waiting time of the EV at a CS as a function of its arrival time. As the path to a CS may consist of multiple intermediate CS stops, estimating the arrival times at each CS is fairly intricate. To this end, we propose an efficient heuristic that yields approximate lower bounds on the arrival time of the EV at each CS, which are used to derive an estimation of the waiting time at each CS. We use these estimations to define a compatible deterministic version of the EVSPP, which we solve with an existing algorithm. We conduct a comprehensive computational study and compare the performance of our methodology with a benchmark that observes the status of CSs only upon arrival (i.e., with no OI information).

Metrics for quantifying shareability in transportation Networks: The Maximum Network Flow Overlap Problem,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104420,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Cities around the world vary in terms of the structure of their transportation networks and travel demand patterns. Despite these variations significantly impacting opportunities for travelers to share trips, no metrics are available to jointly characterize a region’s transportation network and travel demand in terms of the potential for travelers to share space with each other on network links, or what we call person-trip shareability. This study proposes metrics to quantify the shareability of person-trips in a city subregion, as a function of three inputs—the underlying transportation network, origin–destination (OD) travel demand, and a maximum permissible detour parameter. After defining person-trip shareability and providing principles for operationalizing this definition, we formulate a fundamental metric, called flow overlap. Flow overlap measures, for a person-trip traversing a given path, the weighted (by link distance) average number of other person-trips sharing the links along the original person-trip’s path. We then formulate the Maximum Network Flow Overlap Problem (MNFLOP), a math program that assigns person-trips to network paths that maximize network-wide flow overlap. We utilize the MNFLOP output to calculate shareability metrics at various levels of aggregation: person-trip level, OD level, origin or destination level, network level, and link level. The study applies the MNFLOP and associated shareability metrics to different OD demand scenarios in the Sioux Falls network. The computational results verify that MNFLOP (i) assigns person-trips to paths such that flow overlaps significantly increase relative to shortest path assignment, (ii) can meaningfully differentiate between different OD trip matrices in terms of flow overlap, and (iii) metrics can meaningfully quantify demand dispersion from a single network node/location considering the underlying road network. Finally, we validate MNFLOP’s ability to quantify shareability by showing that demand patterns with higher flow overlap are strongly associated with lower mileage routes for a last-mile microtransit service. The paper includes an extensive discussion of other potential future uses of the MNFLOP and its associated shareability metrics.",0968-090X,Not found
Partial trajectory method to align and validate successive video cameras for vehicle tracking,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104416,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This paper develops the partial trajectory method to align the views from successive fixed cameras that are used for video-based vehicle tracking across multiple camera views. The method is envisioned to serve as a validation tool of whatever alignment has already been performed between the cameras to ensure high fidelity with the actual vehicle movements as they cross the boundaries between cameras. The strength of the method is that it operates on the output of vehicle tracking in each camera rather than secondary features visible in the camera view that are unrelated to the traffic dynamics (e.g., fixed fiducial points). Thereby providing a direct feedback path from the tracking to ensure the quality of the alignment in the context of the traffic dynamics. The method uses vehicle trajectories within successive camera views along a freeway to deduce the presence of an overlap or a gap between those cameras and quantify how large the overlap or gap is. The partial trajectory method can also detect scale factor errors between successive cameras. If any error is detected, ideally one would redo the original camera alignment, if that is not possible, one could use the calculations from the algorithm to post hoc address the existing alignment. This research manually re-extracted the individual vehicle trajectories within each of the seven camera views from the NGSIM I-80 dataset. These trajectories are simply an input to the algorithm. The resulting method transcends the dataset and should be applicable to most methods that seek to extract vehicle trajectories across successive cameras. That said, the results reveal fundamental errors in the NGSIM dataset, including unaccounted for overlap at the boundaries between successive cameras, which leads to systematic speed and acceleration errors at the six camera interfaces. This method also found scale factor errors in the original NGSIM homographies. In response to these findings, we identified a new aerial photo of the NGSIM site and generated new homographies. To evaluate the impact of the partial trajectory method on the actual trajectory data, the manually re-extracted data were projected into the new coordinate system and smoothed. The re-extracted data shows much greater fidelity to the actual vehicle motion. The re-extracted data also tracks the vehicles over a 14% longer distance and adds 23% more vehicles compared to the original NGSIM dataset. As of publication, the re-extracted data from this paper will be released to the research community.",0968-090X,Not found
Data-driven preference-based routing and scheduling for activity-based freight transport modelling,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104413,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,Understanding preferences and behaviours in road freight transport is valuable for planning and analysis. This paper proposes a data-driven vehicle routing and scheduling approach for use as a descriptive tool to study road freight transport activities. The model developed seeks to capture planners’ or drivers’ preferences in order to reproduce observed road freight activities. The model is based on a parametrized time-dependent vehicle routing problem whose parameters can be estimated from a set of observed planned tours. We propose a Bayesian optimization technique for parameter estimation of the model. Empirical results show that the model can fit real-world data accurately and synthesize tour flows close to reality.,0968-090X,Not found
Range-constrained traffic assignment for electric vehicles under heterogeneous range anxiety,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104419,158,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This paper studied the range-constrained traffic assignment problem (RTAP), where heterogeneous range anxiety is considered among the driving population by electric vehicles (EVs). In order not to get stranded en-route, each EV driver is assumed to have his/her own driving range limit for being able to complete the trip. As a result, two types of multi-class RTAP can be defined through discrete or continuous distributed range anxiety. Given path-based side constraint structures, we proposed two variational inequality (VI) formulations for modeling discrete and continuous RTAPs, where the former is finite-dimensional according to a discrete number of user classes and the latter is infinite-dimensional accounting for an infinite number of user classes. We reformulate the continuous RTAP into finite-dimensional by merging adjacent EV drivers into one group. A unified path-based solution framework is developed to solve the two RTAPs, built upon the gradient projection algorithm. We design column generation and dropping schemes to adaptively maintain compact path sets and an inner equilibration strategy to accelerate convergence. Finally, a small network is used to examine the correctness and effectiveness of proposed models, and a large Winnipeg network is adopted to evaluate the impacts of stochastic driving range on network flows and computation costs. Numerical results provide compelling evidence of the outstanding superiority of the proposed algorithm, and show that EV drivers with heightened sensitivity towards range anxiety may contribute to the emergence of critical links experiencing severe congestion.",0968-090X,Not found
A behaviourally underpinned approach for two-dimensional vehicular trajectory reconstruction with constrained optimal control,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104489,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Vehicle trajectory reconstruction is an indispensable step before using the observed trajectory data for analysis. A recurrent challenge of the existing smoothing/filtering-based methods is the design of the smoothing parameters to avoid over-smoothing while ensuring realistic vehicle dynamics, but they often fall short in two-dimensional (2D) vehicle movements with coupled longitudinal and lateral vehicle motion. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach to reconstruct vehicle trajectories based on constrained optimal control. The proposed approach outputs 2D trajectories to minimize the errors of the reconstructed trajectory with respect to the measured trajectory while respecting the vehicle dynamics and motion constraints. Bounded curvature and acceleration are used as the control variables that resemble human driver behaviour, and plausible ranges of the 2D motion variables are set as the state constraints of the optimal control problem. The proposed model is validated using both the pNEUMA trajectory dataset and a new high-precision trajectory dataset. Results show that the average Euclidean distance between the reconstructed and measured trajectory points is 0.040 m and the vehicle motion variables are all strictly within the permitted range.",0968-090X,Not found

By drawing on the success of standardized freight containers in the international shipping industry, swap containers can be used to substitute low-capacity vehicles in the first delivery echelon with large-capacity vehicles such as buses or trams. Standardization of swap containers can also encourage collaboration and bring economies of scale. The study proposes a 2E Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-CVRP) and a modified multi-start heuristic solution algorithm to analyze the impact of (1) container standardization, (2) large-scale shipping of containers overnight with on-street and high-capacity public vehicles, and (3) decentralized deployment of satellites in Melbourne. Results indicate that standardization can stimulate collaboration and reduce the required bike fleet by 8 %.

Using car parking spaces as storage satellites can decrease operational costs by 8 % and travel distances by 27.4 %.",0968-090X,Not found
Demonstration-guided deep reinforcement learning for coordinated ramp metering and perimeter control in large scale networks,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104461,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Effective traffic control methods have great potential in alleviating network congestion. Particularly, in an urban network consisting of heterogeneous roads (e.g., freeways and urban roads), how to integrate and coordinate control policies on different roads is a critical issue in large-scale networks. This study addresses this question from two aspects: modeling and control. From the modeling aspect, we formulate the hybrid traffic modeling in heterogeneous networks with the Asymmetric Cell Transmission Model (ACTM) for freeways and the generalized bathtub model for urban roads. For the control aspect, this study considers two representative control approaches: ramp metering for freeways and perimeter control for urban roads, and we aim to develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based coordinated control framework for large-scale networks. However, there are two significant challenges in the coordinated control in large-scale networks with DRL methods: non-stationary environment and large search space. To address both issues, we incorporate the demonstration to guide the DRL method for better convergence by introducing the concept of “teacher” and “student” models. The teacher models are traditional controllers that provide control demonstrations. For instance, ALINEA and Gating are two representative feedback controllers for ramp metering and perimeter control which can be “teacher” models. The student models are DRL methods, which learn from teachers and aim to surpass the teachers’ performance. Additionally, we develop a parallel training scheme to accelerate the proposed DRL method. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct two case studies in a small-scale network and a real-world large-scale traffic network in Hong Kong. Numerical results show that the proposed DRL method outperforms demonstrators as well as DRL methods, and the coordinated control is more effective than just controlling ramps or perimeters respectively. The research outcome reveals the great potential of combining traditional controllers with DRL for coordinated control in large-scale networks.",0968-090X,Not found
Towards robust car-following based on deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104486,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"One of the biggest challenges in the development of learning-driven automated driving technologies remains the handling of uncommon, rare events that may have not been encountered in training. Especially when training a model with real driving data, unusual situations, such as emergency brakings, may be underrepresented, resulting in a model that lacks robustness in rare events. This study focuses on car-following based on reinforcement learning and demonstrates that existing approaches, trained with real driving data, fail to handle safety–critical situations. Since collecting data representing all kinds of possible car-following events, including safety–critical situations, is challenging, we propose a training environment that harnesses stochastic processes to generate diverse and challenging scenarios. Our experiments show that training with real data can lead to models that collide in safety–critical situations, whereas the proposed model exhibits excellent performance and remains accident-free, comfortable, and string-stable even in extreme scenarios, such as full-braking by the leading vehicle. Its robustness is demonstrated by simulating car-following scenarios for various reward function parametrizations and a diverse range of artificial and real leader data that were not included in training and were qualitatively different from the learning data. We further show that conventional reward designs can encourage aggressive behavior when approaching other vehicles. Additionally, we compared the proposed model with classical car-following models and found it to achieve equal or superior results.",0968-090X,Not found

An ADAS with better driver satisfaction under rear-end near-crash scenarios: A spatio-temporal graph transformer-based prediction framework of evasive behavior and collision risk,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104491,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Current advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) do not consider drivers’ preferences of evasive behavior types and risk levels under rear-end near-crash scenarios, which undermines driver satisfaction, trust, and use of ADASs. Additionally, spatio-temporal interactions between vehicles are not fully involved in current evasive behavior prediction models, and the influence of evasive behavior is ignored while predicting collision risk. To address these issues, this study aims to propose an ADAS with better driver satisfaction under rear-end near-crash scenarios by establishing a spatio-temporal graph transformer-based prediction framework of evasive behavior and collision risk. A total of 822 evasive events are extracted from 108,000 real vehicle trajectories on highways, and variables from three sources (i.e., road environment features, evading vehicle features, and interactive behavior features) are used to construct rear-end near-crash scenario knowledge graphs (RNSKGs). By utilizing RNSKGs embedding and multi-head self-attention mechanism, spatio-temporal graph transformer networks can effectively capture the spatio-temporal interactions between vehicles. The results show that the prediction accuracy of evasive behavior (i.e., braking-only or braking and steering) and collision risk (lower, medium, or higher risk) is 96.34% and 92.12%, respectively, superior to other commonly-used methods. After including the selected evasive behavior in predicting collision risk, the overall accuracy increases by 10.91%. Then, an autonomous evasive takeover system (AET) based on the prediction framework is developed, and its effectiveness and satisfaction are verified by driving simulation experiments. According to the self-reported data of participants, the safety, comfort, usability, and acceptability of AET proposed in this study all significantly outperform existing autonomous takeover systems (i.e., autonomous emergency braking and autonomous emergency steering). The findings of this study might contribute to the optimization of ADASs, the enhancement of mutual understanding between ADASs and human drivers, and the improvement of active driving safety.",0968-090X,Not found
A multi-vehicle cooperative control scheme in mitigating traffic oscillation with smooth tracking-objective switching for a single-vehicle lane change scenario,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104487,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This paper proposes a multi-vehicle cooperative control scheme in mitigating traffic oscillation (MCCS-MTO) for a single-vehicle lane change (LC) scenario applied to connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with guaranteed executing applicability. Specifically, a hierarchical structure is applied in the proposed MCCS-MTO to dampen traffic oscillation on both original and target lanes. It decomposes the MCCS-MTO into two subsets of controllers (i.e. upper-layer and low-layer). The upper-layer controller first regards the LC vehicle and the following vehicle on the target lane as control objects and optimally controls their movements by considering the ambient traffic conditions. The lower-layer controller consecutively controls the moving status of the following vehicle on the original lane according to the LC vehicle’s optimized predictive state outputs obtained from the upper-layer and the surrounding traffic. The vehicle dynamic is modeled by incorporating the lateral and longitudinal movements of the LC vehicle into unified control quantities (i.e. axial acceleration and steering angle) to enhance the executing applicability. Both upper-layer and low-layer controllers in the proposed MCCS-MTO are established by leveraging the model predictive control and considering the longitudinal tracking performance, transient traffic smoothness, and lateral LC efficiency with multiple safety constraints. To guarantee a smooth and collision-free tracking performance when preceding vehicles switch, a set of innovative negative exponential and S-shaped functions is designed and integrated into both constraints and objective functions. To ensure the successful implementation of the proposed method, the sequential feasibility properties for the proposed MCCS-MTO are theoretically proven. The proposed approach is validated through numerical experiments in Python with multiple LC scenarios from the NGSIM dataset. The results of the numerical experiments indicate that the proposed study can execute a safe and efficient LC while performing a smooth longitudinal movement that will improve traffic efficiency.",0968-090X,Not found

We find two metrics—defined to scale commuters’ time scheduling preferences by investigating relationships among MTR station entry, exit time and work start time—can well indicate arrival penalty risks (early arrival, late arrival, and no penalty), and is common among varying work start times across different cities. Additionally, we explore the varying attractiveness of origin–destination (OD) station pairs to commuters with a rank-flow approach and we develop a realistic determinant to measure the penalty risks with the time reserved for the last-mile trip.

Observer-based event-triggered adaptive platooning control for autonomous vehicles with motion uncertainties,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104462,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Based on the back-stepping technique, this paper designs an observer-based event-triggered adaptive platooning control algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) with motion uncertainties (e.g., unknown AV mass, internal resistance, and external disturbances). To avoid the transmission of excessive multi-vehicle status information (i.e., speed, position, and so on) between AVs, the adaptive platooning control algorithm proposed only uses the imprecise sampled AV positions. A novel sampling observer designed converts the imprecise sampled AV positions into AV speed and position. The event-triggered mechanism with a fixed event-triggered threshold is introduced to reduce the update frequency of AV control laws. Through the newly constructed Lyapunov function, the adaptive platooning control algorithm can achieve the simultaneous tracking of expected position and speed trajectories, and there is a lower bound on the update time interval of the control laws that is greater than or equal to the sampling time interval of the positions. Numerical simulation demonstrates that the adaptive platooning control algorithm can control a heterogeneous AV platoon in a linear/square formation in advance for obstacle avoidance, and that all heterogeneous AVs in the platoon can track the expected position and speed trajectories simultaneously. Additionally, the update time interval of AV control laws is longer than the sampling time interval of AV positions.",0968-090X,Not found
Unlabeled scene adaptive crowd counting via meta-ensemble learning,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104465,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The objective of unlabeled scene adaptive crowd counting (USACC) is to adapt the crowd counting model to a particular scene by utilizing only a handful of unlabeled images from that scene, rather than considering all the diverse scenarios that may occur in the unknown environment at once. The resolution of this problem facilitates the fast widespread deployment of crowd counting models, mitigating the issue of performance deterioration caused by domain shift. To tackle the USACC problem, we propose a novel method called meta-ensemble learning that incorporates ensemble learning into the meta-learning paradigm. Specifically, we pass the input data through the network with stochasticity multiple times, implicitly creating an ensemble of multiple models, to produce multiple distinct outputs which can be averaged as pseudo labels to adapt the model. In an iteration of offline training, the scene-specific parameters are learned by minimizing the consistency loss between the actual predictions and the pseudo labels generated from a few unlabeled images belonging to that scene. Then, we optimize the model using the remaining labeled images from the same scene to alleviate error accumulation caused by pseudo labels, and thus improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels in subsequent iterations. The training process explicitly simulates the process of adapting to a particular scene during the test. Therefore, the model is able to adapt to the target scene using a handful of unlabeled images by minimizing the consistency loss during the test.

Routing of multi-modal autonomous vehicles for system optimal flows and average travel cost equilibrium over time,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104483,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"In the emerging era of autonomous vehicles (AVs), an important question is how to integrate AVs in a multi-modal framework. Recent studies on Transportation Management Centres (TMCs) for future AVs addressed the issue of providing system optimal (SO) solution. However, none of them considered the possibility of developing a multi-modal SO-based solution. In this regard, we propose a novel multi-modal Transportation Management Centre (MMTMC) for future AVs, which controls both the routing and mode use of each traveller and distributes the AVs in such a way that SO flows are maintained for the whole network every day, while travellers on the same origin-destination (OD) have the same Multi-modal Average Travel Time (MMAVT) over a cycle or period of time (in days). That is, travellers on the same OD may encounter different travel times or costs on different days, but over the planning cycle of many days, their travel times will all average to be the same MMAVT, hence preserving the MMAVT equilibrium. Travellers will travel on single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) or high occupancy vehicles (HOVs) on different routes for different days within the planning cycle, while maintaining the same MMAVT overall for the cycle. Travellers on SOVs will experience no crowdedness while on HOVs will experience crowdedness. We model both the cases of minimum system time and minimum system cost (including crowdedness cost), and provide link-based solution first for both cases. For minimum system time, we apply the conventional Frank Wolfe algorithm to generate feasible link flows, whereas for the minimum system cost problem, we incorporate a sensitivity-based equilibrium procedure to derive the SOV, HOV link flows and demand profiles. Afterwards, we utilize the most likely path method to compute unique SOV and HOV path flows and solve the MMAVT equilibrium. Then, we investigate the case of mixed-equilibrium (ME), where some travellers are given the option not to subscribe to the MMTMC and do their own private routing, i.e. user equilibrium (UE) travellers, who are penalized by a toll. The tolls imposed on these MMTMC non-subscribers are defined by the travel time/cost difference between the MMAVT of subscribers and UE users based on their value-of-time (VOT) distribution.

The geometric driver risk field (GDRF) method is proposed for human-like, interpretable, and fast risk estimations. The method models the driver’s subjectively perceived risk with fields formed by sets of geometric shapes. Unlike current safety measures adopted in trajectory planning algorithms, the proposed method aligns with driver risk perception properties. It provides risk estimations based on probable future vehicle states and the risk consequences at different locations. Compared with existing potential field methods for risk estimations, the mathematical form of the method has a high calculation efficiency while keeping the ability to model the details of the risk information. Influences of different obstacle types, multiple regions with different risk levels, and the relative motions between vehicles are modeled in a unified manner. The graph-search and optimization trajectory planning algorithms with a hierarchy framework are also designed to attain desired risk objectives in the planned trajectories. The framework mitigates the possible suboptimality problems in previous hierarchy trajectory planning algorithms.

High-statistics pedestrian dynamics on stairways and their probabilistic fundamental diagrams,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104468,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Staircases play an essential role in crowd dynamics, allowing pedestrians to flow across large multi-level public facilities such as transportation hubs, shopping malls, and office buildings. Achieving a robust quantitative understanding of pedestrian behavior in these facilities is a key societal necessity. What makes this an outstanding scientific challenge is the extreme randomness intrinsic to pedestrian behavior. Any quantitative understanding necessarily needs to be probabilistic, including average dynamics and fluctuations. To this purpose, large-scale, real-life trajectory datasets are paramount. In this work, we analyze the data from an unprecedentedly high statistics year-long pedestrian tracking campaign, in which we anonymously collected millions of trajectories of pedestrians ascending and descending stairs within Eindhoven Central train station (The Netherlands). This has been possible thanks to a state-of-the-art, faster than real-time, computer vision approach hinged on 3D depth imaging, sensor fusion, and YOLOv7-based depth localization. We consider both free-stream conditions, i.e. pedestrians walking in undisturbed, and trafficked conditions, unidirectional/bidirectional flows. We report on Eulerian fields (density, velocity and acceleration), showing how the walking dynamics changes when transitioning from stairs to landing. We then investigate the (mutual) positions of pedestrian as density changes, considering the crowd as a “compressible” physical medium. In particular, we show how pedestrians willingly opt to occupy fewer space than available, accepting a certain degree of compressibility. This is a non-trivial physical feature of pedestrian dynamics and we introduce a novel way to quantify this effect. As density increases, pedestrians strive to keep a minimum distance d ≈ 0 . 6 m (two treads of the staircase) from the person in front of them. Finally, we establish first-of-kind fully resolved probabilistic fundamental diagrams, where we model the pedestrian walking velocity as a mixture of a slow and fast-paced component (both in non-negligible percentages and with density-dependent characteristic fluctuations). Notably, averages and modes of velocity distribution turn out to be substantially different.

There are two parts in this research. In Study 1, the information entropy theory is applied to describe the vehicle cluster situation, and a method is established to quantify the cognitive uncertainty of the vehicle cluster situation for drivers in diverse emotions. In Study 2, with consideration of bounded rational and emotional cognition, the impacts of the vehicle cluster situation and drivers' features, which are their demands for the driving goals including safety, efficiency and comfort, emotional states, and cognitive characteristics, on driving behavior are uniformly expressed as the behavioral driving force, and a prediction model for driving behavior is proposed based on Dynamics Psychology. The results of validation based on the virtual driving data show the prediction accuracy of the proposed model for various driving behaviors of drivers in diverse emotions is over 80%. The results of verification based on NGSIM data suggest that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model for the natural driving behaviors is 82.07%.

To this end, a stated choice (SC) experiment was designed and deployed in the city of Beijing, China. Attitudinal statements were also designed to measure four latent variables: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived safety, and attitude toward waiting. Using a hybrid choice model framework, the estimation results reveal that the choice of letting the PAV self-park at a non-destination location is significantly influenced by the location of such parking, the potential delay in re-taking the vehicle, and the fuel/energy consumption to and from the non-destination parking place. Attitudes toward AVs also play a crucial role, with perceived safety and perceived usefulness having the greatest impact. Our results can help managers and planners understand how PAVs affect people’s travel mode choices and the corresponding parking options and assist them in developing strategies in preparation for the widespread use of AVs.",0968-090X,Not found
Optimal control strategy for traffic platoon longitudinal coordination around equilibrium state enabled by partially automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104463,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This paper presents an internal model-Kalman filtering-based optimal hybrid feedforward/feedback control strategy for traffic platoon control coordination enabled by SAE Automation Level 2 or Level 3 vehicles, i.e., partially automated vehicles (PAVs). Based on the Helly linear car-following model, a PAV platoon is established. Taking each vehicle’s characteristic polynomial as the dominant internal model polynomial, an augmented system state model with filtered inputs is formed, and then both the system states and the external disturbance/internal perturbation from previous vehicle can be estimated by a delicately designed Kalman filter. By using a linear quadratic regulation approach, a distributed hybrid optimal feedforward/feedback controller utilizing the local estimated states is constructed to achieve a practically decoupled platoon regulation around an equilibrium state. String stability of the control system thus obtained is further analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical simulations verified the theoretical analysis in decoupling between successive vehicles, in suppressing the influence of various external disturbances, and in maintaining string stability.",0968-090X,Not found
Anomalous ride-hailing driver detection with deep transfer inverse reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104466,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The rapid expansion in group size of online ride-hailing drivers has made anomalous driver detection become a critical issue, which substantially affects the safety and operation aspects of ride-hailing services Existing studies mainly focus on the identification of abnormal trajectories, while none of them investigate anomalous driver detection. The former evaluates a specific trajectory, while the latter comprehensively evaluates a driver. The driving preferences of anomalous ride-hailing drivers differ from those of most ride-hailing drivers. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) mines the hidden preference of an agent from its observed behavior Although existing IRL models can mine the driver’s route preference from trajectories, they depend on massive trajectories. To deal with insufficient trajectories, we propose deep transfer inverse reinforcement learning, which reuses the partial pre-trained common reward network and transfers it to be a part of the personalized reward network. Then, we use an autoencoder network to reduce the dimension of personalized route preference and combine it with K-means clustering to distinguish all the drivers into two categories (i.e., normal and abnormal). Numerical experiments using ride-hailing trajectories in Chengdu, China are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate that precision and recall of our proposed approach are 91.7% and 97.1%, respectively.",0968-090X,Not found
Improving deep-learning methods for area-based traffic demand prediction via hierarchical reconciliation,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104410,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Mobility services require accurate demand prediction in both space and time to effectively manage fleet rebalancing, provide quick on-demand responses, and enable advanced ride-sharing with minimum fleet size. Although the optimization of mobility services is a widely studied topic, the demand prediction side has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we aim to develop an efficient method for traffic demand forecasting by means of deep learning and hierarchical reconciliation approaches. The concepts, as well as the theories behind the proposed approach, are founded on Hierarchical Time Series (HTS), which also adopts Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) as a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn from the associated time series and produce reliable demand predictions. The proposed approach relies on the proper design of the HTS structure to get accurate forecasts for the number of trip departures and their associated uncertainty within predefined zones and aggregated collections of these zones. Moreover, the error analysis is essential for accomplishing the reconciliation in the HTS structure optimally. The proposed approach, consisting of deep learning, error analysis, and optimal reconciliation stages, has a remarkable ability to predict demand and control the forecasting quality at all levels of the hierarchical structure. We evaluate the proposed approach using a large-scale GPS tracking dataset from Lyon, France. The proposed method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 13.92% and 14.77% for predefined and aggregated zones, respectively, compared with the LSTM using the historical demand and external features of time at the quarter-hour time step. Similarly, the corresponding improvements in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 14.87% and 19.23%, respectively.",0968-090X,Not found
Planning dynamic wireless charging infrastructure for battery electric bus systems with the joint optimization of charging scheduling,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104469,159,2024-02-01,2024,2,"To address the battery-related shortcomings of battery electric buses (BEBs), dynamic wireless charging (DWC) technology that allows BEBs to charge while in motion has emerged, thereby extending the driving range and reducing the size of onboard batteries. The introduction of DWC technology raises a critical problem, namely, the deployment of DWC facilities. To resolve the infrastructure planning problem, this study first proposes a (higher-level) strategic planning model that optimizes the deployment of DWC facilities and battery capacity of BEBs, and then establishes a (lower-level) tactical planning model of optimal charging scheduling under the time-of-use (TOU) tariff mechanism considering the interdependence between infrastructure design and charging activities of BEBs.

Recognizing the role of conflicts in air traffic flow, we relate vehicle density to the frequency of conflict occurrence in airspace using a gas-kinetic analogy. The number of conflicts is then related to vehicle speeds using an average speed loss per conflict. The effects of the speed reductions are coupled with density to explore the fundamental diagram between flow rate and density. The theoretical models are tested and validated with simulated results for a number of parameter levels. The models can be applied for quick predictions of future traffic flow conditions, which will be especially useful for operators or air traffic flow management systems. The theoretical and simulated findings also provide operational and policy insights for AAM operators, planners, and modelers. Notable insights include the critical role of aircraft density in air traffic flow and the variable impact of that density on traffic flow behavior. AAM operators and planners will need to closely manage the airspace density to avoid large numbers of conflicts simultaneously and maintain acceptable travel times and throughputs. Key operational parameters such as aircraft spacing requirements and maximum aircraft speeds were also found to have significant impacts on traffic flow behavior, and offer policy avenues for managing air traffic.",0968-090X,Not found
Planning and operation of ride-hailing networks with a mixture of level-4 autonomous vehicles and for-hire human drivers,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104541,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This paper investigates the joint planning and operation of a ride-hailing network with a mixture of level-4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) and for-hire human drivers. Distinct from most existing works that focus on fully autonomous vehicles, we envision a more foreseeable future where ride-hailing platform utilizes a fleet of level-4 AVs to provide mobility-on-demand services in selected areas of the city, complemented by a group of for-hire drivers who can pick up or drop off passengers outside of the AV’s service area. The platform not only makes planning decisions regarding the selection of service area of AVs, but also makes operational decisions regarding the ride fares, driver compensations, fleet size, and vehicle relocation strategies, etc., while interacting with passengers and for-hire human drivers on the transportation network. The overall profit-maximization problem of the platform is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is highly non-convex and difficult to address. To tackle this challenge, we developed a decomposition-based algorithm that can compute a near-optimal solution for the optimization problem, while offering a theoretical upper bound on the gap between the derived solution and the unknown globally optimal solution. The proposed method is validated in a numerical study for San Francisco. We show that activating level-4 AVs in selected areas (instead of over the entire network) can improve the platform profit by up to 20%. We also observe that as the cost of AV infrastructures reduces, the spatial diffusion of AV services will follow an interesting pattern, where the platform will first activate all high-demand zones for AV services simultaneously, and then progressively expand AV services to other areas one zone after another as a result of the complex trade-off between demand levels, activation cost, and network connectivity. We further evaluate the impacts of AV diffusion on human drivers and passengers and demonstrate that (a) human drivers will first be incentivized to relocate to lower-demand areas and then be forced to leave the TNC market if the cost of AV infrastructure continues to decline; (b) passengers in remote areas will surprisingly experience higher trip costs even though the cost of AV decreases, particularly after AV is activated in urban areas but before it is activated in remote areas. This finding reveals the unequal distribution of benefits in the autonomous ride-hailing network, underscoring the need for additional regulatory involvement.",0968-090X,Not found
Inferring heterogeneous treatment effects of crashes on highway traffic: A doubly robust causal machine learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104537,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Accurate estimating causal effects of crashes on highway traffic is crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of crashes. Previous studies have built up a series of methods via traditional causal inference theory and machine learning methods to estimate the impacts of crashes. Since the structures and variable dimensions of traditional causal inference models are pre-defined, they can not accommodate the characteristics of individual crashes. They only can estimate the average causal effects for the crashes in certain categories, e.g., crash types, crash severity, and occurring locations. For machine learning-based algorithms, they cannot be used for causal reasoning due to their reliance on correlation rather than causation. However, considering the impacts of crashes on traffic status vary across influential factors, such as time periods and locations, heterogeneous causal effects are essential for a better understanding of the effects on traffic status and crash intervention strategy development. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a novel doubly robust causal machine learning framework to infer heterogeneous treatment effects of crashes on highway traffic status. Doubly Robust Learning (DRL), integrating machine learning techniques to perform predictive tasks, is applied into the framework due to its stronger robustness. Considerning treatment predictors and colliders may bring bias in estimation results, Conditional Shapley Value Index (CSVI) is proposed for selecting confounders from numerous factors. A 3-year crah dataset collected by 3594 real highway crashes in Washington is utilized for demonstrating the designed experiments, including construting confidence intervals, estimated errors evaluation, and sensitivity analysis of variable selection for various thresholds of CSVI. According to the results, the distinctive propagation and dissipation processes of congestion caused by various types of crashes can be achieved. The results also validate the effectiveness of variable selection, and the superiority in estimation accuracy compared to the selected baseline models.

For illustration, we study a multi-agent system, where agents have a plurality of different, and mutually inconsistent goals. We then allow agents in the system to vote on which traffic signal controllers, which were trained on different goals using deep reinforcement learning, would control the intersection. Taking decisions based on suitable voting procedures turns out to lead to favorable solutions, which perform highly for several goals rather than optimally for one goal and poorly for others. This opens up new opportunities for the management or even self-governance of complex systems that require the consideration and achievement of multiple goals, such as many systems involving humans.

Usage-aware representation learning for critical information identification in transportation networks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104538,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Extracting meaningful information from noisy high-dimensional data is attracting increasing attention as richer and higher resolution data is being collected and used for transportation system planning and management purposes. Discovering critical information via effective data representation learning not only helps reduce data dimension, it also enables a deeper understanding of the underlying properties of noisy data, which could then lead to better planning and operations decisions. In this study, we present a new perspective that, unlike most existing approaches in the general data science literature, the design of data representation should go beyond the data itself; it should incorporate an understanding of how the data is used in the domain-specific applications. We further argue that this design philosophy is particularly important for transportation data because of the high spatial correlations of transportation data brought by network interdependence. We propose a usage-aware representation learning framework by incorporating the information loss for downstream application into the data encoding-decoding process. The proposed approach is formulated as a Stiefel manifold optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated in two network applications: modeling transportation network flows and estimating network-level vehicular emissions. The performance of the learned representation from our approach is compared with existing approaches using multiple evaluation context, including data reconstruction quality, clustering, anomaly detection, and critical information identification, through case studies implemented in Sioux Falls, Boston, and San Jose networks. The good performance of our approach consistently observed in those experiments indicates the importance of incorporating the downstream data usage in the process of data representation learning.",0968-090X,Not found

The main challenge of a crowdsourced delivery platform is to meet a service level for their customers (e.g., 95% on-time delivery) by serving dynamically arriving delivery tasks with time windows. The two critical courier management decisions for a platform are how to schedule couriers and how to assign delivery tasks to couriers. These two decisions can be centralized (i.e., decided by the platform) or decentralized (i.e., decided by the couriers). Centralizing these decisions produces a more reliable workforce while decentralizing them may come with cost savings to the platform and allows more freedom to couriers in deciding when and where to work. Crowdsourced delivery platforms have begun to utilize both courier types simultaneously (i.e., a hybrid system) with the hope of reaping the advantages of each. In this paper, we address the challenge of capacity planning for a crowdsourced delivery platform that utilizes both centralized (committed) and decentralized (ad-hoc) couriers.

Modular vehicle-based transit system for passenger and freight co-modal transportation,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104545,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The emergence of vehicle modularity technologies provides an opportunity to develop flexible public transport services that allow en-route vehicle capacity adjustments to meet fluctuating demands. Given the largely imbalanced demands for passenger and freight transport in urban areas, the use of modular vehicles in collaborative passenger and freight transport (co-modality) is expected to increase overall transport efficiency. This study explores the potential of integrating modular vehicles into a co-modal transit system that serves both passengers and freight. Specifically, we consider a bi-directional transit corridor where modular vehicles are scheduled to meet time-dependent passenger and freight demands. Each modular vehicle comprises identical modules that can be assigned to either passengers or freight individually. Moreover, a modular vehicle can adjust (i) the number of composed modules by docking and undocking modules, and (ii) module allocation between passengers and freight at intermediate stations. To minimize passenger waiting costs and vehicle operating costs, a mixed integer programming formulation is established that optimizes vehicle dispatch times, (un)docking operations, module allocation, and freight allocation. Given the solution complexity, we propose a two-stage algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. In the first stage, we address vehicle dispatch times, and in the second stage, vehicle formation and freight allocation are optimized. Numerical experiments verify that the proposed two-stage algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art solvers and can obtain near-optimal solutions in an acceptable time for large-scale problems. A case study based on a transit line in Hong Kong validates the effectiveness of co-modal modular transit systems, where station-wise (un)docking and co-modality lead to a cost reduction of 8.2% and 11.2%, respectively.

Robust aircraft maintenance routing with heterogenous aircraft maintenance tasks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104518,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Robust aircraft maintenance routing problems (RAMRPs) have been extensively studied due to their significance on flight schedule reliability. In the current practice, the traditional huge A-check program is divided into multiple Heterogeneous small maintenance packages (with different maintenance durations and risk levels) and performed differently during the ground time between two connected flights. As the available maintenance time becomes relatively shorter, maintenance becomes a new source of disruption. Thus, the assignment of maintenance packages-to-ground times becomes more critical. Accordingly, this paper proposes a robust strategy to alleviate the disruption due to maintenance risk. The strategy is to provide each package the appropriate amount of buffer time based on the fuzzy risk assessment. Correspondingly, a robustness measure is developed to construct the RAMRP model. As its impact can be better illustrated in large scale problems, we adopt matheuristic approach. We examine 500 disruption scenarios, the results show that the proposed strategy can greatly reduce flight delays (i.e., an 82.7% reduction in the number of delayed flights) while maintaining an acceptable decrease in aircraft utilization (i.e., a 32.42% increase in average unused flying times) compared to those obtained from the traditional model. Additionally, the proposed model is further investigated from the perspectives of aircraft utilization constraints and the risk-averse attitude of airlines.

Adaptive robust electric vehicle routing under energy consumption uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104529,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have been highly favoured as a mode of transportation in recent years. EVs offer numerous benefits over traditional fuel-based vehicles, particularly in terms of the environmental impact. Although electric vehicles offer several advantages, there are certain restrictions that limit their usage. One of the significant issues is the uncertainty in their driving range. The driving range of EVs is closely related to their energy consumption, which is highly affected by exogenous and endogenous factors. Since those factors are unpredictable, uncertainty in EVs’ energy consumption should be considered for efficient operation. This paper proposes a two-stage adaptive robust optimization framework for the electric vehicle routing problem. The objective is to minimize the worst-case energy consumption while guaranteeing that services are delivered at the appointed time windows without battery level deficiency. We postulate that EVs can be recharged on route, and the charging amount can be adjusted depending on the circumstances. A column-and-constraint generation based heuristic algorithm, which is coupled with variable neighbourhood search and alternating direction algorithm, is proposed to solve the resulting model. The computational results show the economic efficiency and robustness of the proposed model, and that there is a tradeoff between the total required energy and the risk of failing to satisfy all customers’ demand.",0968-090X,Not found
A distributed route network planning method with congestion pricing for drone delivery services in cities,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104536,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based commercial services, exemplified by drone delivery, have captured wide interest in tech companies, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. Structured route-based UAV operations have been implemented for traffic management of UAVs in support of commercial delivery services in cities. Yet, its essence, multi-path planning with constraints is not well solved in the existing literature. Centralized planning might result in inefficiencies and unfairness in the allocation of precious urban airspace to individual routes. This paper describes a novel distributed route planning method to support UAV operations in a high-density urban environment. The method allows each origin–destination (OD) pair to compete against other OD pairs for an optimized route (e.g. shortest distance), coordinated by a system-level evaluation, leading to a network design that maximizes the performance of not only the individual routes but also the entire system. The core concept is the introduction of congestion pricing, a soft constraint to coordinate the allocation of airspace. The method is tested in standard 2D scenarios and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that (1) the method is able to generate routes with short individual distances as well as occupying the least airspace by the route network; (2) in some complex scenarios, the method is able to find a solution in a short period of time while other state-of-the-art method fails.

By adding edge computing nodes, the real-time performance of data collection, transmission, and processing is improved. Our ultimate goal is to guide and regulate train drivers’ activities in the same way, regardless of uncertain factors affecting HST dynamic or kinematic performance.

To evaluate the performance of our approach, some case studies using the real-world railway infrastructure and HST data have been conducted. The results show that the proposed models produce higher prediction accuracy for both speed and throttle handle level prediction tasks.

Various technologies have been applied to reconstruct vehicle trajectories from sparse fixed and mobile detection data. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on single-lane scenarios and neglect lane-changing (LC) behaviors that occur across multiple lanes, which limit their applicability in practical traffic systems. To address this research gap, we propose a macro–micro approach for reconstructing complete vehicle trajectories on multi-lane freeways, wherein the macro traffic state information and micro driving models are integrated to overcome the restrictions imposed by lane boundary. Particularly, the macroscopic velocity contour maps are established for each lane to regulate the movement of vehicle platoons, meanwhile the velocity difference between adjacent lanes provide valuable criteria for guiding LC behaviors. Simultaneously, the car-following models are extended from micro perspective to supply lane-based candidate trajectories and define the plausible range for LC positions. Later, a two-stage trajectory fusion algorithm is proposed to jointly infer both the car-following and LC behaviors, in which the optimal LC positions is identified and candidate trajectories are adjusted according to their weights. The proposed framework was evaluated using NGSIM and HighD datasets, and the results indicated a remarkable enhancement in both the accuracy and smoothness of reconstructed trajectories, with performance indicators reduced by over 30% compared to two representative reconstruction methods.

Although studies over the past decades have provided various methods for analyzing string stability of analytical CF models, no studies have focused on neural network (NN) based CF models despite the fact that these models have exhibited remarkable performance in learning realistic driving behavior in the recent literature. This paper fills this gap by proposing a generic theoretical framework for analyzing the string stability of NN-based CF models through an Estimation-Approximation-Derivation-Calculation process (referred to as EADC framework). Within the framework, we first estimate the steady states of NN-based CF models by solving the corresponding optimization model and obtain the smooth approximation of the NN-based models for linearization, based on which the transfer function is constructed. We then derive the general stability criteria for two commonly used classes of NN in CF modeling, i.e., feedforward NN-based CF models with basic input and recurrent NN-based CF models with multi-step historical information. The string stability is thus obtained by calculating the partial derivatives through the automatic differentiation method. As two case studies, we apply the proposed stability analysis framework on two typical NN-based CF models, the Mo-MLP model (Mo et al., 2021) and the Huang-LSTM model (Huang et al., 2018), and obtained the complete consistency between the theoretical results and the simulation results for both models, which demonstrates the soundness of the proposed EADC framework.

While numerous efforts have been made on the modelling of decision-making of lane-based merging behaviour, little was focusing on the simulation of the complete merging process, which generates two-dimensional merging trajectories allowing for the investigation of merging behaviour’s impact on the traffic flow. This study thus aims to develop a two-dimensional data-driven simulation model for merging behaviour based on the emerging imitation learning framework for generating realistic vehicle trajectories and traffic characteristics. To account for the specific goal of merging vehicles (reaching the planned destination) and the presence of suboptimal behaviours in real traffic, we incorporate goal-conditioned and confidence-aware mechanisms into adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (is referred to as GC-AIRL) to learn the merging behaviour from real-traffic demonstrations. Using the vehicle trajectories data extracted from the NGSIM dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating two-dimensional vehicle trajectories with superior efficiency, safety, and comfort performance compared to human drivers. The superiority of the GC-AIRL model is validated by comparing with several bench-marking models, including the basic AIRL model, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) model, a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Moreover, we examine the transferability of the proposed model in producing merging behaviour at a new site that indicates its applicability in diverse environments. The findings of this study highlight the great potential of the developed two-dimensional merging behaviour model for future application in connected and automated vehicles.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperative traffic signal control through a counterfactual multi-agent deep actor critic approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104528,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Signal control has been effective to alleviate urban traffic congestion. Massive related works about signal timing optimization have been proposed and led to many signal control methods and systems. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have attracted the increasing attention of researchers in the area of signal control optimization, since they can learn the optimal timing policy themselves by analyzing changing patterns between the traffic condition and signal timing plans. Multi-intersection traffic signal control problems face more challenges than classical single intersection problems such as the dimensionality issue as the joint action space of multiple agents grows exponentially with the number of intersections. The existing state-of-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms developed for other areas may not suit well with traffic signal control given the complex spatial–temporal nature of traffic flows. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent counterfactual actor–critic with scheduler (MACS) framework for multiple interactions. In this method, decentralized actors control the traffic signals and the centralized critic combines recurrent policies with feed-forward critics. Additionally, a scheduler module that exchanges information among agents helps the individual agent better understand the entire environment. The proposed method was evaluated using simulation experiments based on a real-world urban street network in Shenzhen, China. Results showed that the proposed method outperforms the classic model-based method and several existing RL-based methods according to different measures such as queue length, average travel time delay, and throughput.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated robust optimization of maintenance windows and train timetables using ADMM-driven and nested simulation heuristic algorithm,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104526,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This research paper focuses on the optimization of train timetables and maintenance windows, both of which significantly impact service quality and cost-effectiveness. Uncertainties in both elements can disrupt established transportation plans, causing train delays and maintenance cancellations. Accordingly, we highlight the necessity of augmenting the robustness of these schedules. In this study, we explored an integrated robust optimization of maintenance windows and train timetables using a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model. The DRO model was established with two types of binary variables and a cross-resolution consistency constraint was introduced to couple them. We innovatively employed a multi-commodity network flow framework to reconstruct the DRO model and designed an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based decomposition mechanism. This mechanism was applied to dualize the cross-resolution consistency and track capacity constraints. To handle the problem, we developed a heuristic algorithm driven by ADMM, along with a nested simulation.

In our study the point data are Wi-Fi data set from sensors at key tourist locations and the trajectories are a small sample of GPS footprints. The approach proves valuable in the context of tour estimation, placing a specific emphasis on determining whether major attractions have been visited. The data fusion approach evaluates the similarity of a sequence of Wi-Fi records with the GPS records which function as a “look-up database”. Based on this, likely missing observations in the Wi-Fi data sequence are estimated. With a Kyoto case study, we demonstrate that the fused data create reasonable tours. Through cross-validation it is verified that missing observations are fairly close to the true location. We then use the fused data with a Recursive Logit approach to estimate parameters that indicate the location attractiveness of touristic areas. The results demonstrate that we can estimate the attractiveness of restaurants and shops to predict tourist routes.",0968-090X,Not found
An integrated model for airport runway assignment and aircraft trajectory optimisation,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104498,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Air traffic management of terminal manoeuvring area involves high complexity as air traffic converges to airports. In addition, air traffic is currently experiencing a remarkable growth despite the COVID19 pandemic effects. This trend, which is expected to continue in the mid and near future, motivates the development of methodologies that improve the efficiency and automatisation of air traffic management processes to efficiently prevent bottlenecks in current airports instead of expanding or building new facilities, which usually implies higher costs. Specifically, runway assignment is of capital importance for the correct exploitation of current airports capacity. In this paper, a mixed integer non-linear model is presented which deals with aircraft approach and landing operations. It integrates decisions regarding runway assignment and trajectory optimisation. Since this problem is difficult to be solved, a Benders decomposition is proposed. The master model deals with runway assignment, resulting in a mixed integer linear programming model. The submodel deals with the trajectory determination problem, resulting in a nonlinear programming model that minimises a combination of fuel consumption and aircraft delay while complying with operational constraints. In addition, a rolling horizon approach is employed for real-size case studies, which systematically optimises operations within 30-min intervals.

An exact algorithm for unpaired pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem with multiple commodities and multiple visits,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104488,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This paper addresses a new multi-commodity unpaired pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem in which each vehicle is allowed to visit each customer more than once for both pickup and delivery of each commodity. It is a complex variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem and comes from resource transfer among different plants in a distributed manufacturing environment. Notably, the pairing decisions of pickup and delivery for each commodity and the routing decisions among customers are interdependent, and they need to be made simultaneously and collaboratively. Firstly, a mixed integer programming model is developed, and then new valid inequalities are derived to improve the linear programming relaxation. Afterwards, a branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed by exploring different branching strategies and tailored separation algorithms. Computational results based on real-case instances from an automobile manufacturing company demonstrate that the costs are considerably reduced by considering the multiple visits compared to the single visit of each customer. In addition, our proposed branch-and-cut algorithm outperforms a manual solution method adopted by the company in practice and two solution methods in the literature. Furthermore, two adaptations of our branch-and-cut algorithm also perform better than two state-of-the-art algorithms in solving two closely-related problems in terms of solution quality and computation time.

Unleashing the two-dimensional benefits of connected and automated vehicles via dedicated intersections in mixed traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104501,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The management of mixed traffic systems is critical to realize the benefits of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Generally, the benefits of CAVs can be categorized into the one-dimensional benefits of improving car-following performance and the two-dimensional benefits of efficiently addressing right-of-way conflicts. Researchers have proposed dedicated lanes that can exploit the one-dimensional benefits of CAVs, but the two-dimensional benefits remain unexplored in mixed traffic environments. To fully release the benefits of CAVs, we introduce an innovative approach for managing mixed traffic in road networks, known as the dedicated intersection strategy. Specifically, the dedicated intersection strategy refers to constructing two-dimensional CAV-dedicated right-of-way within the road network, achieving separation between CAVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs) at the intersection level. However, the deployment problem of dedicated intersections is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, we propose a bi-level solving framework, in which the upper level determines the dedicated intersection deployment scheme and the lower level solves the corresponding traffic assignment problem. To quickly find adequate deployment schemes, we propose an artificial bee colony based intelligent algorithm. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can quickly find near-optimal dedicated intersection deployment schemes within a small number of iterations. Compared to regular intersections, the deployment of dedicated intersections in the road network can improve overall traffic system efficiency, particularly for CAVs. Finally, microscopic traffic simulation experiments further verify the superior performance of the proposed dedicated intersection strategy.",0968-090X,Not found
MAST-GNN: A multimodal adaptive spatio-temporal graph neural network for airspace complexity prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104521,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Airspace complexity is defined as an essential indicator to comprehensively measure the safety of air traffic operational situations. A reliable prediction of airspace complexity can provide practical guidance for formulating air traffic management strategies and resource allocation. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to computing airspace complexity, previous studies can rarely model the multi-dimensional and combined spatio-temporal features within airspace complexity data. In this paper, we propose a multimodal adaptive spatio-temporal graph neural network to simultaneously explore the spatio-temporal dependencies in the airspace sector network. Specifically, we design a multimodal adaptive graph convolution module to effectively learn the diverse spatial relationships and adaptively adjust the impact of different spatial modes on airspace complexity in a data-driven manner. To model dynamic long-short-term temporal patterns, we develop a dilated causal convolution layer with a multiple-time-step self-attention mechanism to accurately predict airspace complexity over a longer time horizon.

"A bivariate, non-stationary extreme value model for estimating opposing-through crash frequency by severity by applying artificial intelligence-based video analytics",10.1016/j.trc.2024.104509,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Multivariate extreme value modelling techniques are widely applied to estimate crash risks from traffic conflicts, with a predominant focus on rear-end crashes. In contrast, the suitability of conflict measures within a multivariate framework for estimating opposing-through crash risks has received less attention. This study proposes a non-stationary bivariate extreme value model to identify a suitable set of traffic conflict measures for estimating opposing-through crashes (i.e., right-turn crashes for left-hand driving conditions and vice versa) by severity levels. In the proposed Generalised Extreme Value model, three crossing course conflict measures were considered, including post encroachment time (PET), gap time (GT), and supplementary time-to-collision ( T 2min ). Artificial intelligence-based video analytics were employed to extract these opposing-through conflict measures from a total of 144 h of video recordings of four permissible right-turn approaches for three signalised intersections in Brisbane, Australia. The models included exposure variables such as conflicting volume, right-turning volume and through volume, and evasive action-based variables like deceleration and relative velocities measured at the signal cycle level to account for non-stationarity in the extreme value models. Results suggested that a bivariate model with PET and GT as the traffic conflict measures performs better than a univariate model or other combinations of traffic conflict measures in the bivariate models. This PET-GT combination of conflict measures also showed better accuracy in estimating opposing-through crash frequencies by severity levels when combined with the (Delta-V) based severity measure. This study demonstrated the importance of accounting for various stages of opposing-through conflicts within a bivariate extreme value model to predict crash risks.",0968-090X,Not found
Evaluating blockchain technology adoption in multi-tier supply chains from an institutional entrepreneurship theory perspective,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104510,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The presence of Blockchain Technology (BCT) and its potential supply chain (SC) and logistic benefits—such as improved resilience or lessened disruption—have motivated organizations to consider BCT investment. BCT is a relatively novel technology and requires multiple participants to meet its greatest potential. Its novelty is a barrier to its adoption and can be dependent on an innovator or leader to convince others to invest in or adopt BCT. Using an institutional entrepreneurship theoretical lens, we determine who should lead the investment (adoption) or whether a collaborative investment is best. Insights into this context can be garnered using a sequential game-theoretic model where lead investment roles switch amongst parties. Four scenarios are evaluated and consider full, partial, or no collaboration between SC entities. Within this framework, the two-stage process of adopting and implementing BCT is introduced to separate cost and demand channels. During the adoption stage, a reduction in marginal production cost via positive net benefits of BCT-based transportation and logistics is considered in the cost channel. In the implementation stage, the optimal level of BCT investment is determined, increasing shipping quality for consumers in transportation and logistics and reducing supply chain disruption simultaneously, which is considered in the demand channel. The results show that greater disruption likelihood will boost retail prices, intermediate prices, and profits of SC entities after BCT is adopted. We also find that traditional SCs with higher disruption levels result in lower BCT investment. When a leader in the sequential game (the manufacturer in our model) is the institutional entrepreneur, collaboration in BCT investment becomes more attractive. One important—and counterintuitive—result reveals that when full SC cooperation doesn’t exist, the entire SC is better off when the follower (not the leader) in a sequential game leads BCT adoption. The unique role of reduction in transportation and logistics costs via the cost channel is to compensate for a lower BCT investment due to lack of competition or reinforce a higher BCT investment by counterbalancing opportunistic behaviors.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling the influence of charging cost on electric ride-hailing vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104514,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Major transportation network companies (TNCs) have promised to shift to 100% electric vehicles (EVs) in the next two decades, which places an increasing need to investigate the issues of ride-hailing services provided by EVs. Existing studies that model the EV charging systems and the TNC service systems omit the influences of the charging costs (i.e., electricity rate, and value of waiting time) on driver supply and passenger demand, which results in inaccurate prediction of system dynamics. This study is the first attempt to understand the influence of the electricity rate on the demand/supply of ride-hailing services and its implications. We compute the charging cost as the sum of the electricity cost based on the charging volume and the values of the expected waiting time. Specifically, we construct a queueing model framework to calculate the expected waiting time with M/M/k/C and synchronized M/M/1 queues, which models the charging and ride-hailing service processes separately. The experiment results from a two-symmetric-unit network show that the system performance metrics, such as platform profit and ratios of passengers served, have decreasing trends with increasing electricity rates. These trends shift when electricity rates and wage/trip fare rates change simultaneously, indicating the TNC platforms are able to achieve high profits by adjusting wage/fare rates to handle changes in electricity rates. Similar performance trends are validated by increasing electricity rates on large-scale experiments based on real-world trip demand. We further undertake sensitivity analysis and conclude that as the passenger demand increases, the system’s performance metrics, such as platform profit and the percentage of served passengers, gradually converge, within the constraints of the number of EVs and their battery capacity; the usage frequencies of charging stations follow the Pareto Principle, where roughly 15% of stations could serve most of the charging demand.",0968-090X,Not found
Tucker factorization-based tensor completion for robust traffic data imputation,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104502,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Missing values are prevalent in spatio-temporal traffic data, undermining the quality of data-driven analysis. While prior works have demonstrated the promise of tensor completion methods for imputation, their performance remains limited for complicated composite missing patterns. This paper proposes a novel imputation framework combining tensor factorization and rank minimization, which is effective in capturing key traffic dynamics and eliminates the need for exhaustive rank tuning. The framework is further supplemented with time series decomposition to account for trends, spatio-temporal correlations, and outliers, with the intention of improving the robustness of imputation results. A Bregman ADMM algorithm is designed to solve the resulting multi-block nonconvex optimization efficiently. Experiments on four real-world traffic state datasets suggest that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods, including the context of complex missing patterns with high missing rates, while maintaining reasonable computation efficiency. Furthermore, the robustness of our model in extreme missing data scenarios, as well as under perturbation in hyperparameters, has been validated.

Estimation of discrete choice models considering simultaneously multiple objectives and complex data characteristics,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104517,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This paper focuses on the discrete choice estimation problem, which involves multiple objectives and testing a broad range of hypotheses that can affect both interpretability and prediction accuracy. Previous studies have proposed mathematical programming formulations to assist with hypothesis testing and estimation. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the effect of in- and out-of-sample model performance criteria during the search for parsimonious specifications. To address this knowledge gap, a multi-objective optimization framework is proposed, including both in-sample goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample predictive accuracy, to generate multiple unique specifications and perform extensive hypothesis testing considering simultaneously potential explanatory variables, their functional forms, nonlinearities, heterogeneous effects, and correlations. A metaheuristic was designed and implemented to solve the proposed multi-objective nonlinear mixed-integer mathematical programming problem. Experiments, including various datasets and discrete choices, were used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The goal was to find specifications that are either similar or dominate those reported in literature, considering both interpretability and prediction accuracy. Important insights regarding potential explanatory factors and heterogeneous preferences, which were not reported in literature, were captured using the proposed framework. In addition, for one of the datasets used in this study, the proposed framework enabled the discovery of three distinct clusters considering specification type and model performance in terms of interpretability and prediction accuracy. For the given dataset, these clusters suggest that the proposed approach allowed extensive exploration of the data across different specification types. In addition, the Mixed-Logit models with correlated parameters were found to perform significantly better in terms of in-sample fit than those without correlation. Similarly, multinomial-Logit models showed the worst performance for the given dataset. In contrast, multinomial-Logit models provided superior out-of-sample fit relative to advanced specifications, which illustrates trade-offs between model in- and out-of-sample fitness. A comparative analysis, including multiple performance measures, was also conducted. The results suggest that model evaluation using in-sample Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and out-of-sample Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and in-sample BIC and out-of-sample Mean Squared Error (MSE) enables estimation of specifications with better in- and out-of-sample performance compared to those estimated using maximum log-likelihood and minimum number of model parameters. In addition, a mostly linear relationship was observed between in-sample and out-of-sample log-likelihood, indicating that the latter does not provide much additional information regarding prediction compared to the in-sample estimates. These results showed the value of using an optimization framework to support modelling decisions by enabling extensive hypothesis testing and including multiple performance criteria as well as complex data characteristics to discover important and reliable insights.",0968-090X,Not found
Recovering traffic data from the corrupted noise: A doubly physics-regularized denoising diffusion model,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104513,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Noise is inevitable in the collection of traffic data, which may cause accuracy and stability issues in smart mobility applications. In the literature, most of the existing studies on traffic data denoising assume that noises follow specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian) or structures (e.g., sparsity). However, various noises may coexist in the traffic data and their distributions or structures are usually unknown in the real world. This leads to the corrupted noise and brings a huge challenge to the traffic data recovery due to the irregular characteristics of such noise. In this research, we develop a doubly physics-regularized denoising diffusion model to address this issue. The proposed denoising diffusion model gradually adds noise to the data and then learns to recover the true value from noises. Each layer of the model can be perceived as a filter that removes noises with different scales, which helps to disentangle the coupling of noises. To make up for the insufficient information of noise distributions or structures, we incorporate prior traffic domain knowledge of the fundamental diagram into the denoising diffusion model using . Under suitable assumptions, we prove that our model can output an unbiased estimation of the true value. We validate our model using two real datasets collected in Japan and China.

Understanding preferences for mobility-on-demand services through a context-aware survey and non-compensatory strategy,10.1016/j.trc.2023.104455,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The potential lack of realism in stated-preference surveys is particularly acute in contexts where disaggregate real-world data is challenging to obtain. Mobility-on-Demand (MOD) services present one such context. The MOD context is unique due to factors such as service reliability (difference in stated vs. actual travel and waiting time) and current mode inertia which affect the choice of MOD services and are difficult to infer from revealed preference data. Further, travel mode choices are repetitive and constitute a relatively easy choice situation. Consequently, individuals may utilize simple non-compensatory strategies. In this study, we design a survey to mimic real-world choice sets using a joint revealed and stated- (RP-SP) preference survey approach. We construct the complete journey of individuals taking into account departure time, access and egress mode, current primary mode and origin–destination pair. A Choquet Integral (CI)-based choice model with endogeneity correction is employed, thereby allowing to approximate non-compensatory behaviour. Results confirm the presence of non-compensatory behaviour across all mode users (car, public transport and bike). Reliability and inertia effects are most pronounced for car users including the potential for a combined departure time-mode shift towards MOD. Owing to non-compensatory behaviour and inertia, higher travel costs cannot be fully compensated by shorter waiting and travel times and a differential pricing strategy may be required to increase MOD market share.

The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical constraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove measurement noises and outliers and impute missing data due to fragmentations.

Public transit agencies typically operate a modest fleet of vehicles to provide first-mile services due to the high operating costs, thus failing to adequately meet the first-mile travel demands, especially during peak hours. At the same time, private cars are underutilized and have a lot of idle time. With the emergence of self-driving vehicles, new opportunities for addressing the current dilemma arise, such as integrating idle private self-driving vehicles to provide first-mile services, which is beneficial for public transportation agencies to provide high-quality services at low costs. This study investigates the first-mile ridesharing problem in which public transit agencies utilize idle privately-owned autonomous vehicles to dynamically inflate their fleet. This problem is more challenging in decision-making than conventional first-mile problems, as it involves decisions on heterogeneous fleet scheduling, vehicle routing, and time scheduling, all while taking into account the service quality for riders. To address this problem, an arc-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a trip-based set-partitioning model are developed, both aiming to minimize total operational costs. To identify promising trips, we propose a tailored labeling algorithm with a novel dominance rule, along with a time window shift algorithm to determine the best schedule. To yield high-quality solutions in a short computation time, a tailored column-generation matheuristic algorithm is introduced. A branch-and-price exact algorithm and an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm are developed to assess the matheuristic algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed models and algorithms.

In this framework, an operator is trained to map heterogeneous and sparse traffic input data to the complete macroscopic traffic density in a supervised learning setting. We chose a physics-informed Fourier neural operator ( π -FNO) as the operator, where an additional physics loss based on a discrete conservation law regularizes the problem during training to improve the shock predictions. We also propose to use training data generated from random piecewise constant input data to systematically capture the shock and rarefaction solutions of certain macroscopic traffic flow models. From experiments using the LWR traffic flow model, we found superior accuracy in predicting the density dynamics of a ring-road network and urban signalized road. We also found that the operator can be trained using simple traffic density dynamics, e.g., consisting of 2 − 3 vehicle queues and 1 − 2 traffic signal cycles, and it can predict density dynamics for heterogeneous vehicle queue distributions and multiple traffic signal cycles ( ≥ 2 ) with an acceptable error.

To solve this gap, we developed a DLCI prediction method based on topological graph constructed by driver behaviors and traffic context. However, challenges trend on the heels of that because of some unavoidable features that are irrelevant to the DLCI prediction in the topological graph, the difficulty of capturing global dependencies in the driver’s head pose sequence, the dynamics of the relationship between different categories, and insufficient of the DLCI dataset. Therefore, we designed a DLCI predicting model based on dynamic graph convolution network with semantic attention module (DGCN-SAM) and self-supervised guided learning based on the understanding of topological graph (SGL-UTG). Specifically, an invert residual module with anthropomorphic attention mechanism (IRM-AAM) was designed to extract important features in topological graphs. The Transformer with multi-head self-attention was used to capture the global dependences of driver’s head pose sequence. DGCN-SAM was developed to model the relationship between different categories or nodes in the graph. And SGL-UTG was proposed to improve the generalization performance and prevent overfitting in the absence of sufficient DLCI data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the DLCI in real-time with high accuracy.",0968-090X,Not found
"A two-dimensional, multi-vehicle anticipation, and multi-stimuli based latent class framework to model driver behaviour in heterogeneous, disorderly traffic conditions",10.1016/j.trc.2023.104458,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This study formulates a latent class-based driving behaviour framework for modelling vehicles’ two-dimensional (2D) movements while considering drivers’ strategic intents and multi-vehicle anticipation (MVA) in heterogeneous, disorderly (HD) traffic conditions. Specifically, five extensions are proposed to a typical stimulus–response based driving behaviour framework. First, the subject vehicle’s 2D movements are represented as a combination of the angular direction of movement with respect to the longitudinal axis and the magnitude of acceleration or deceleration along the angle. Second, a latent class framework is used to recognise drivers’ strategic intents (latent to the analyst) in two aspects: (a) the intent to accelerate, decelerate, or maintain a constant speed, and (b) the intent to steer to the left of, right of, or straight along the longitudinal axis. It is hypothesised that these strategic intents precede tactical decisions, such as how much to accelerate or decelerate and which specific angular direction to move along. Third, the MVA effect is accommodated to recognise that drivers consider stimuli from multiple vehicles in their vicinity. Fourth, a multi-stimuli model of acceleration (deceleration) is formulated, assuming that drivers choose an angle of movement that allows them to move with the highest (lowest) possible longitudinal acceleration (deceleration). Fifth, drivers’ execution errors are recognised as the difference between their planned acceleration and executed acceleration. The proposed framework is applied for an analysis of motorised two-wheeler driver behaviour using a vehicular trajectory dataset from India. The empirical results highlight the importance of incorporating MVA and considering driver’s intents while modelling 2D movements of vehicles in HD traffic conditions. Further, the microscopic traffic environment variables are found to have a stronger influence on drivers’ higher-level, strategic intents than on their lower-level, tactical decisions.",0968-090X,Not found
A strategic approach to handle performance uncertainties in autonomous vehicle's car-following behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104499,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This paper proposes a methodology to estimate uncertainties in automated vehicle (AV) dynamics in real time via Bayesian inference. Based on the estimated uncertainty, the method aims to track the car-following (CF) performance of the AV to support strategic actions to maintain desired performance. Our methodology consists of three sequential components: (i) the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) is adopted to estimate parameter uncertainty relative to vehicular dynamics in real time, (ii) dynamic monitoring of car-following stability (local and string-wise), and (iii) strategic actions for control adjustment if anomaly is detected. The proposed methodology provides means to gauge AV car-following performance in real time and preserve desired performance against real time uncertainty that are unaccounted for in the vehicle control algorithm.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrating shared e-scooters as the feeder to public transit: A comparative analysis of 124 European cities,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104496,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"E-scooter sharing is a potential feeder to complement public transit for alleviating the first-and-last-mile problem. This study investigates the integration between shared e-scooters and public transit by conducting a comparative analysis in 124 European cities based on vehicle availability data. Results suggest that the integration ratios of e-scooter sharing in different cities show significant variations and range from 5.59% to 51.40% with a mean value of 31.58% and a standard deviation of 8.47%. The temporal patterns of integration ratio for first- and last-mile trips present an opposite trend. An increase in the integration ratio for first-mile trips is related to a decrease in the integration ratio for last mile in the time series. Additionally, these cities can be divided into four clusters according to their temporal variations of the integration ratios by a bottom-up hierarchical clustering method. Meanwhile, we explore the nonlinear effects of city-level factors on the integration ratio using explainable machine learning. Several factors are found to have noticeable and nonlinear influences. For example, the density of public transit stations and a higher ratio of the young are positively associated with the integration ratio to a certain extent. The results potentially support transport planners to collectively optimize and manage e-scooter sharing and public transport to facilitate multi-modal transport systems.",0968-090X,Not found
Toward efficient transportation electrification of heavy-duty trucks: Joint scheduling of truck routing and charging,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104494,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The timely transportation of goods to customers is an essential component of economic activities. However, heavy-duty diesel trucks used for goods delivery significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within many large metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. To reduce GHG emissions by facilitating freight electrification, this paper proposes Joint Routing and Charging (JRC) scheduling for electric trucks. The objective of the associated optimization problem is to minimize the cost of transportation, charging, and tardiness. A large number of possible combinations of road segments as well as a large number of combinations of charging decisions and charging durations leads to a combinatorial explosion in the possible decisions electric trucks can make. The resulting mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is thus extremely challenging because of the combinatorial complexity even in the deterministic case. Therefore, a Surrogate Level-Based Lagrangian Relaxation (SLBLR) method is employed to decompose the overall problem into significantly less complex truck subproblems. In the coordination aspect, each truck subproblem is solved independently of other subproblems based on the values of Lagrangian multipliers. In addition to serving as a means of guiding and coordinating trucks, multipliers can also serve as a basis for transparent and explanatory decision-making by trucks. Testing results demonstrate that even small instances cannot be solved using the off-the-shelf solver CPLEX after several days of solving. The SLBLR method, on the other hand, can obtain near-optimal solutions within a few minutes for small cases, and within 30 min for large ones. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that as battery capacity increases, the total cost decreases significantly; moreover, as the charging power increases, the number of trucks required decreases as well.",0968-090X,Not found
A hybrid approach of traffic simulation and machine learning techniques for enhancing real-time traffic prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104490,160,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Accurate traffic prediction is important for efficient traffic operation, management, and user convenience. It enables traffic management authorities to allocate traffic resources efficiently, reducing traffic congestion and minimizing travel time for commuters. With the increase in data sources, traffic prediction methods have shifted from traditional model-based approaches to more data-driven methods. However, accurately predicting traffic under unforeseen events, such as crashes, adverse weather conditions, and road works, remains a challenging task. Hybrid traffic prediction models that combine data-driven and model-based approaches have emerged as promising solutions, considering the advantage of the model-based approach that can replicate unobserved scenarios. This paper proposes a hybrid traffic prediction framework named SMURP (Simulation and Machine-learning Utilization for Real-time Prediction), which overcomes the limitations of the existing methods. The SMURP is a framework that can be applied to any data-driven prediction method. When an event is detected during prediction, the SMURP complements the prediction outcomes with an additional predictor that uses simulated traffic data.

Dynamic joint decision of matching parameters and relocation strategies in ride-sourcing systems interacting with traffic congestion,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104524,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"As the ride-sourcing market expands, ride-sourcing fleets have increased urban traffic congestion, and in turn, road congestion is affecting ride-sourcing operations. It is crucial to incorporate this interaction mechanism into the operational decision of ride-sourcing systems. This mechanism can be described in detail by simulation models. Applying simulation-based optimization methods to the real-time operation of ride-sourcing systems is challenging due to the limitations of simulation efficiency. To tackle this issue, this study first proposes a modular simulation model combining time-driven and event-driven mechanisms. The simulation model comprises two layers: the traffic flow module at the bottom, defined by trip-based and multi-region macroscopic fundamental diagrams and cell transmission models, and the ride-sourcing operation module at the top, which considers the interaction between the traffic congestion and ride-sourcing operation and models the random behavior of passengers and drivers. We verify the efficiency and accuracy of the simulation model. The simulation model is utilized as an evaluator of the objective functions and performance measures. Then, we integrate the Bayesian optimization, parallel sampling, and rolling horizon approaches to develop an efficient and effective simulation-based optimization framework for the dynamic joint decision-making of matching radius, matching intervals, and threshold relocation strategies. Six groups of experiments for the traffic scenario in Berlin reveal some interesting findings. (1) The matching rate first increases and then decreases with the matching radius (a concave function), while the closest study does not think so. (2) As the fleet size grows, passenger waiting time reaches its minimum and then rises because of the increased endogenous congestion generated by ride-sourcing fleets. (3) The optimal operation strategy considering endogenous congestion not only leads to an increase in the system revenue and efficiency but also leads to congestion relief, even though the latter was not our initial objective. This benefit is the most pronounced when the fleet size and background traffic are moderate.",0968-090X,Not found
Backpressure or no backpressure? Two simple examples,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104515,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Many responsive traffic signal control strategies are “pressure-driven”. These strategies move green-time from stages with a lower pressure to stages with a higher pressure, at each junction; often aiming to approximately equalise stage pressures at each junction. In some of these pressure-driven strategies each stage pressure at a junction includes a “backpressure” term, which depends on downstream links. Such backpressure terms reduce the pressure on stages and reduce pressure most for those stages leading toward the most highly congested downstream road links. The expectation is that there will then be a reduction in traffic flow exiting the junction toward already highly congested road links, and that this will reduce queue lengths and network delays. This paper shows that this is not always the case by giving two examples where having backpressure within the control policy on a network with two signal controlled junctions (1) increases both equilibrium delays at one of the junctions for certain demands, and (2) never reduces any of the equilibrium delays at either junction. A simple dynamic evolution with a steady reduction in demand is also shown in which two of the considered policies, one with backpressure, give rise to equilibrium delays and queues which tend to infinity, and reveal a gap; in this gap feasible demands have no equilibrium consistent with the two control policies and in a day-to-day dynamical context delays and queues are unbounded. This paper considers only the simple network shown in figure 1 under certain specified conditions. One main avenue for further research might be to consider whether the results shown here also hold in different networks under different conditions.",0968-090X,Not found

Previous studies have suggested that these phenomena are caused by human behavior. However, existing models have not been able to fully reproduce these dynamic traffic phenomena. The focus of our research is on psycho-physical properties and asymmetric behavior, among other human factors, which provide a theoretical explanation for dynamic traffic phenomena. We propose a new car-following model, Asymmetric Repulsive force Model (ARM), based on the common fundamental mechanisms of the two theories. ARM is evaluated from both microscopic and macroscopic perspectives. ARM exhibited similar driving behavior similar to NGSIM data in the time-distance, speed, acceleration, speed-spacing, and spacing-relative speed domains. Additionally, ARM outperforms comparable models in quantitative evaluations of describing trajectory and hysteresis. From the macroscopic perspective, platoon simulation was performed to analyze stop-and-go situations. The results confirmed that ARM can simulate the processes of speed drop, speed recovery and flow non-recovery, and speed and flow recovery. This finding is consistent with previous research on capacity drop using empirical data and suggests that ARM has the potential to simulate various macroscopic traffic phenomena.",0968-090X,Not found
Geometric information constraint 3D object detection from LiDAR point cloud for autonomous vehicles under adverse weather,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104555,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"3D object detection, as the core of the autonomous vehicle perception module, is essential for efficient transportation and comfortable experiences. However, the challenge of 3D object detection under adverse weather conditions hinders the advancement of autonomous vehicles to higher levels. Hence, achieving accurate 3D object detection under adverse weather conditions is increasingly crucial as it forms the foundation for trajectory planning and driving strategy making in autonomous vehicles, thereby revolutionizing transportation modes for both goods and passengers. Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology have facilitated the development of 3D object detection in the past few years. Adverse weather, which inevitably occurs in real-world driving scenarios, could degrade measurement accuracy and point density of LiDAR and lead to particle interference. Detecting accurate 3D bounding boxes from sparse, incomplete point clouds with particle interference is difficult. Therefore, this research presents a novel geometric information constraint network for 3D object detection tasks from LiDAR point clouds under adverse weather (GIC-Net). In this study, we focus on how to incorporate geometric location information and line geometric feature information into the network against adverse weather. Further, we propose a geometric location constrained backbone module (GLC) to reduce rain and snow particle interference and ensure sufficient receptive fields. Then, we design a line geometric feature constraint module (LGFC) to add line constraints of 3D bounding boxes into the training process. Finally, a line loss function is designed, and features from the GLC and LGFC modules are fed into the multi-task detection head for accurate 3D bounding box prediction. Experiments on the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) autonomous vehicle dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method over six other state-of-the-art methods under adverse weather, which is at least 13.32 %, 4.67 %, and 10.44 % mAP higher than the other compared methods in the car, truck, and pedestrian classes respectively.

Chance-constrained UAM traffic flow optimization with fast disruption recovery under uncertain waypoint occupancy time,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104547,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Trajectory-based operations offer a promising solution for effective urban air mobility (UAM) traffic management with conflict-free four-dimensional trajectories. However, these trajectories generated in strategic phases by existing methods could be significantly disrupted due to uncertainties such as flight delays and trajectory deviations. This paper develops a chance-constrained UAM traffic flow management (UTFM) optimization model with fast disruption recovery to solve observed disrupted trajectories and improve their resilience. Our model introduces a novel concept of waypoint occupancy time to cope with the probabilistic separation constraints induced by variables, notably urban wind field. We then convert the probabilistic constraint into a deterministic one, incorporating risk-bounded separation guarantees derived from flight experiment data. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical stochastic search algorithm for solving the redefined deterministic optimization problem. Our comprehensive numerical studies demonstrate the model's effectiveness in restoring disrupted flights and resolving conflicts within seconds. Additionally, our reliability testing showcases the resilience of the model in managing disruptions, even at levels as high as 50%, and its adaptability in addressing varying levels of uncertainty risk. We further demonstrate the ability of the UTFM model to capture tail risks across Gaussian and non-Gaussian uncertainty distributions. Lastly, our scalability analysis highlights the potential capacity of the model to support up to 3,000 flights per hour in Singapore's urban airspace below 400 ft.

This contribution first attempts to focus on the feasibility of connecting people and freight mobility through the joint usage of transportation options. It builds on the hyperconnectivity principles enabled by the Physical Internet (PI) manifesto for city logistics, referred to as HCL (Hyperconnected City Logistics). To this end, this paper proposes a model-based decision support approach that seeks to produce effective delivery solutions for an on-demand multimodal transshipment problem.

How do active road users act around autonomous vehicles?

Still, many questions linger in the minds of road users that will share the road and interact with these AVs on a daily basis. To answer some of these questions, this study utilized recently collected real-world AV data from the United States, with the focus mainly targeting active road users. Specifically, the 1,492 h of recorded trips were processed to extract AV-pedestrian and AV-cyclist interactions of different movement types. The interactions were then investigated to gain a better understanding of the active road users’ behavior, while excluding any interactions that involved intervention from the AVs’ human test drivers. Through deep maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (DME-IRL), the reward functions describing the utility of active road users were retrieved and assessed for five interaction scenarios, including parallel, opposing, crossing, and turning (left and right) interactions. In addition, the policies developed as part of the solution were used to simulate the behavior of active road users and validate the resulting conflicts in terms of safety and evasive actions. Overall, the utilized approach demonstrated high accuracy in mimicking the interaction behavior of active road users when encountering an AV, with 81–84% accuracy in predicting evasive actions in parallel and opposing interactions and 12–17% mean absolute error for safety indicators in crossing and turning interactions. In addition, the resulting reward functions provided reliable insight onto the preferences and considerations of the active road users in these situations. Overall, cyclists tend to be less cautious around AVs compared to pedestrians, while the AVs tend to slow down and leave sufficient distance from all active road users in most cases. Still, the robotic behavior of the AVs, which can sometimes be inconsistent, leads to risky evasive actions by the active road users, which can affect other road users in busy intersections.",0968-090X,Not found
Electric bus charging scheduling on a bus network,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104553,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This study addresses the electric bus charging scheduling problem (EBCSP) within a bus network comprising multiple bus routes, depots, and a fleet of heterogeneous electric buses (EBs) operated by a public transport (PT) operator. The EBCSP aims to minimize total costs by concurrently determining the assignment of EBs to trips(i.e., EB-to-trip assignment) and their corresponding charging schedules. A partial charging policy allows for flexible charging durations, considering a published timetable consisting of trip tasks. We formulate the EBCSP as a mixed-integer linear programming model and a set-covering formulation.

To enhance the opt-ALNS process, we introduce a labeling method to assess solution feasibility and rebuild solutions. Moreover, we incorporate EB battery degradation effects into the proposed method.

On the important features for a well-shaped reduced network MFD estimation during network loading and recovery,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104539,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Monitoring traffic dynamics at both link and network levels is vital for effective traffic management and control in urban road networks. Traffic monitoring at the network level, though, is an extremely challenging task due to the amount of data (and consequently sensors) needed to represent a good coverage of the network traffic dynamics. This has motivated researchers to investigate where to locate sensors (e.g. loop detectors) within a network to capture the so-called Reduced Network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (NMFD). The existing approaches for reduced NMFD estimation have presented limitations, because of the reliance on solely traffic flow characteristics or single topological features. In response, in this paper, a framework has been proposed to take into account the simultaneous impact of topological and traffic flow features for the estimation of reduced NMFD. Contrary to existing works in literature, which have mainly focused on the loading period, this work considers both loading and unloading periods. The presented framework deploys regression models to identify the set of critical links within the network. The efficiency of the presented method has been validated under both single and multi-reservoir settings and has been compared to two methods that solely consider traffic characteristics. Our findings reveal that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, particularly when dealing with low coverage rates of loop detectors (e.g. 1%). Moreover, results show that during the recovery period, traffic characteristics (e.g. queue distribution) play a more important role in estimating the NMFD. On the other side, a more significant impact has been observed for the topological features (e.g. speed limit distribution) during the loading period.",0968-090X,Not found
Surrogate safety measures for traffic oscillations based on empirical vehicle trajectories prior to crashes,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104543,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Traffic oscillations, also known as stop-and-go driving conditions, commonly emerge due to the alternative deceleration and acceleration of vehicles in congested traffic conditions. This study proposes a surrogate safety measure (SSM) specifically for estimating crash risks related to this phenomenon. The Crash Risk Indicator for Oscillation (CRIO) is established by integrating driving behavior during oscillations into the Time-to-Collision (TTC) framework. A year-long recording of a busy freeway on sunny weekdays at morning peak hours using unmanned aerial vehicles produced over 200 h of empirical trajectories of all vehicles, which encompassed 20 rear-end crashes that happened in the real world. The performance of the CRIO was assessed by comparing it with five commonly used SSMs. It was found that the oscillation amplitude induced by the leading vehicle and the behavior of the following vehicle during its reaction time significantly affected the likelihood of rear-end crashes. The CRIO diminished the false alarm rate from a range of 25% to 91% (by other SSMs) to 6% with a recall rate of 100%. The CRIO was further employed to predict real-time crash risk once the oscillation was formed. The results show that the CRIO can provide an early crash warning with an average time of 1.72 s in advance.

We consider those SAVs likely to replace, in the future, most of the individual vehicles inside urban areas. We address this very large-scale problem with a greedy insertion heuristic that involves a specific filtering system design in order to speed up the decision process and relies on an original network-driven encoding of the routes. Experimental results show that en-route vehicles can be drastically reduced by such systems using a fleet of SAVs of capacity 10, decreasing the vehicle number by more than 98%, compared to a situation where all travel demands would rely on personal vehicles.

An enhanced motion planning approach by integrating driving heterogeneity and long-term trajectory prediction for automated driving systems: A highway merging case study,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104554,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Navigating automated driving systems (ADSs) through complex driving environments is difficult. Predicting the driving behavior of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is a critical component of an ADS. This paper proposes an enhanced motion-planning approach for an ADS in a highway-merging scenario. This method utilizes the results of two aspects: the driving behavior and long-term trajectory of surrounding HDVs, which are coupled using a hierarchical model that is used for the motion planning of an ADS to improve driving safety. An unsupervised clustering algorithm is utilized to classify HDV drivers into two categories: aggressive and normal, as part of predicting their driving behaviors. Subsequently, a logistic regression model is employed for driving style prediction. For trajectory prediction, a transformer-based model that concentrated parallelization computations on longer sequence predictions via a self-attention mechanism is developed. Based on the predicted driving styles and trajectories of the surrounding HDVs, an intelligent decision-making strategy is utilized for ADS motion planning. Finally, real-world traffic data collected from drones on a highway ramp in Xi’an is used as a case study to train and evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can predict HDVs merging trajectories with a mean squared error (MSE) smaller than 0.125 at 30 s away from the merging point, outperforming existing approaches in terms of predictable duration and accuracy. Furthermore, it exhibited safety improvements by adjusting the ADS motion state in advance with good predictive power for the surrounding HDVs’ motion. For both normal and aggressive driving styles, the ADS trajectories reached optimal safety at a prediction horizon of at least 10 s and over 6.67 s, respectively, when evaluating both time-to-collision (TTC) and deceleration rate to avoid a crash (DRAC) metrics. This indicates that our proposed procedures have improved safety for AVs with long-term predictive capabilities (i.e., over 6 s) for surrounding HDVs. Interestingly, the safety performance does not continue to improve with the increase in prediction horizon once the optimal safety performance (highest TTC and lowest DRAC) has been achieved for both normal and aggressive styles. This suggests that an excessively long prediction horizon (e.g., 30 s) is not always beneficial for safety performance of ADS in our case study. When ADS encounter aggressive HDVs, having a predicted surrounding HDV trajectory can extremely reduce crash risk and maintain a safe situation. This demonstrates that planning ADS trajectories with HDV predictions has significant effects on safety, especially for aggressive driving styles as compared to normal driving styles.",0968-090X,Not found

Specifically, MR headsets (Microsoft HoloLens 2) are leveraged to project out-of-tower view of airport traffic onto a 3D printed airport model at a 1:1 scale. The spatially aligned tangible system enables ATCOs to perform typical ATM operations by directly touching the 3D printed airport model. In addition, collaborative features are implemented into the system, which enable multiple ATCOs to have a shared view of the airport traffic and collaboratively perform ATM operations when wearing the MR headsets. Finally, a user study was conducted with the recruitment of ten licensed ATCOs to investigate usability of the system and ATCOs’ workload, situational awareness and trust when using the system. The feedback from the ATCOs in the user study suggested that: (1) The visual and interactive design were acceptable; (2) The ATCOs indicated varied workload under different scenarios; (3) The ATCOs developed a high level of shared situational awareness with shared view of the system; and (4) The ATCOs were open and confident to use the system in its’ mature form. The findings show that the MR-based tangible airport digital tower system has high potential in collaborative ATM operations by improving user performance and user experience.",0968-090X,Not found
Correcting missingness in passively-generated mobile data with Multi-Task Gaussian Processes,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104523,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The prevalence of mobile devices and the ubiquity of network connectivity have generated a massive amount of temporally- and spatially-stamped data. A key characteristic of this mobile data is the prevalence of sparsity—for every recorded user, there is a significant amount of missing data. Sparsity leads to bias in the inferred mobility patterns and thus, correcting bias by imputing the missing data potentially creates opportunities for directly using the corrected mobile trajectory data for large-scale simulations in various applications. We propose a multi-task Gaussian process regression model to correct missingness in mobile data. Gaussian processes (GPs) allow for flexible modeling of diverse (i.e., non-linear, locally periodic) data patterns and quantify prediction uncertainty in an interpretable manner. We develop a methodological framework for applying GPs to mobile data. In doing so, we consider the correlations between users’ coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) through multi-task learning and adjust for individual-level differences in data characteristics through parameter initialization and optimization. We introduce and demonstrate the use of smooth (i.e., rational quadratic) and periodic kernels in modeling human mobility data. Relatedly, we analyze our model’s parameters and imputation accuracy with respect to different types of trips (e.g. slower vs faster trips). We also demonstrate our model’s performance in two experiments with real app-based data, in which it outperforms alternative imputation methods.

In this paper, we present an activity types detection method named the Teacher–Student Cycling model based on a self-training framework. Our model can combine travel survey data with extensive prior knowledge and mobile phone data. We introduce two different resolutions of mobile phone datasets to test the model performance. Our results show that our proposed model can achieve good performance on datasets of different resolutions. Our model, one of the semi-supervised learning models that uses a mixture of labeled and unlabeled knowledge performs better than the supervised learning model that uses labeled knowledge alone.

Personalized dynamic pricing policy for electric vehicles: Reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104540,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"With the increasing number of fast-electric vehicle charging stations (fast-EVCSs) and the popularization of information technology, electricity price competition between fast-EVCSs is highly expected, in which the utilization of public and/or privacy-preserved information will play a crucial role. Self-interest electric vehicle (EV) users, on the other hand, try to select a fast-EVCS for charging in a way to maximize their utilities based on electricity price, estimated waiting time, and their state of charge. While existing studies have largely focused on finding equilibrium prices, this study proposes a personalized dynamic pricing policy (PeDP) for a fast-EVCS to maximize revenue using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We first propose a multiple fast-EVCSs competing simulation environment to model the selfish behavior of EV users using a game-based charging station selection model with a monetary utility function. In the environment, we propose a Q-learning-based PeDP to maximize fast-EVCS’ revenue. Through numerical simulations based on the environment: (1) we identify the importance of waiting time in the EV charging market by comparing the classic Bertrand competition model with the proposed PeDP for fast-EVCSs (from the system perspective); (2) we evaluate the performance of the proposed PeDP and analyze the effects of the information on the policy (from the service provider perspective), and the robustness of the proposed approach; and (3) it can be seen that privacy-preserved information sharing can be misused by artificial intelligence-based PeDP in a certain situation in the EV charging market (from the customer perspective).",0968-090X,Not found
A blockchain-enabled personalized charging system for electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104549,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) has brought about the demand for high-quality charging services.

The personalized charging approach underlines individual preferences for charging station amenities and recommends charging stations offering preferable activities for EV users. In the proposed model, the preferences for charging station amenities can be inferred based on historical activity data using the tensor decomposition technique. With the obtained individual preference, the charging strategy design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model.

Environmental impact estimation of mixed traffic flow involving CAVs and Human-driven vehicles considering the non-equilibrium state,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104542,161,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The impact of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) on the mixed traffic of CAVs and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) has been extensively investigated. Existing network-level research predominantly emphasizes the improvement of road capacity by CAVs, often overlooking their influence on other critical aspects, particularly traffic instability. However, traffic instability is an important yet undesirable feature of traffic flow, where small perturbances grow into stop-and-go waves, resulting in higher emissions. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the enhancements of CAVs on road capacity and traffic stability and estimating their environmental impact. To this end, we develop an improved Dynamic Network Loading (DNL) model for mixed traffic by expanding the discrete form of a velocity gradient model to road networks. The variances in road capacity, shockwave speed, and propagation speed of a small disturbance, arising from the interactions between CAVs and HVs, are considered. Numerical studies showcase the capabilities of this model in several aspects: Firstly, it successfully reproduces stop-and-go waves and illustrates a gradual alleviation of the waves with an increasing penetration rate of CAVs. These are beyond the ability of discretized Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR)-type models, like the Cell Transmission Model (CTM). Moreover, it provides a more accurate estimation of vehicle speeds and emissions compared to the CTM, with simulation results benchmarked against SUMO. Furthermore, this research explores the relationship between CAV penetration rate and aggregate network emissions, using a dynamic user equilibrium model. Our findings reveal that higher CAV penetration rates correlate with reduced emissions. Specifically, a complete transition to 100% CAVs yields a substantial reduction in network emissions, estimated at approximately 20%.",0968-090X,Not found
Enhancing choice-set generation and route choice modeling with data- and knowledge-driven approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104618,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Two central and interconnected problems arise in the specification of a ‘‘complete’’ path-based route choice model: choice-set generation and choice from a choice set. Choice-set generation poses a significant challenge in personalization and the enumeration of the full choice set with large size. Despite the continued prevalence of classic econometric models for modeling choices within a given set, this requirement of knowledge-driven modeling necessitates explicit model structures and intricate domain knowledge, which may result in practical biases. In this study, a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE)-based choice set generation model is developed, which approximates the probability distribution of the underlying choice set generation process conditional on individual and OD characteristics without relying on expert knowledge. In order to facilitate a friendly integration between knowledge-driven econometric and machine learning approaches, a neural-embedded route choice model (IAP-NERCM) with implicit availability/perception (IAP) of choice alternatives is proposed to automatically capture the heterogeneity of taste parameters without assuming any a priori relationship. Results based on synthetic data show that the proposed models are capable of reproducing the pre-defined coefficients. Field data of GPS data collected in Toyota City is used to future test the proposed models compared to classical statistical models.

Pattern diversity based trip-level impact evaluation on mileage and emissions of on-demand ride-splitting,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104616,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Ride-splitting offers significant potential for reducing travel mileage and emissions. However, the patterns of ride-splitting demonstrate both diversity and complexity, yet there remains a deficiency in systematic and in-depth investigations of these patterns. This study aims to explore multiple patterns of ride-splitting and to evaluate the associated impacts on mileage and emission savings based on the pattern diversity. Firstly, two methods that are respectively for calculating the sub-pattern types from every ride-splitting pattern in theory, and for recognizing the actual sub-patterns in reality, are sequentially proposed. Then, the adjusted passenger mileage considering ride-splitting (i.e., APM) is proposed with detailed calculation methods for various ride-splitting patterns. Furthermore, a trip-level method for estimating emission reduction is developed by integrating the comparison of APM with the shortest mileage into the MOVES model. Finally, mileage saving and emissions reduction of ride-splitting in trip-level are investigated using the data sets of Beijing and Xiamen, respectively. The pattern diversity results show that 20 ride-splitting sub-patterns in actual data can be explored in Beijing and Xiamen. The average mileage savings can be obtained at the trip-level, which is 1.32 km for Beijing and 1.36 km for Xiamen. In the 20 sub-patterns, it is indicated that more trips involved in ride-splitting may not result in a more effective reduction, and the three-group-passenger pattern shows the best performance in CO2 reduction.

Social interactions are intuitively heterogeneous and dynamic over time and circumstances, making them hard to explain. In this paper, we creatively investigate modeling interpretable social interactions for pedestrian trajectory, which is not considered by the existing trajectory prediction research. Moreover, we propose a two-stage methodology for interaction modeling - “mode extraction” and “mode aggregation”, and develop a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for long-term trajectory prediction, which naturally takes into account multi-types of social interactions. Different from previous models that do not explain how pedestrians interact socially, we extract latent modes that represent social interaction types which scales to an arbitrary number of neighbors.

The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method is able to capture the multi-modality of human motion and achieve better performance under specific conditions. Its performance is also verified by the interpretation of predicted modes, of which the results are in accordance with common sense.

Optimal cruise airspeed selection and RTA adjustment in the presence of wind uncertainty,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104613,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Flight planning under windy conditions has been a critical problem in air transportation. Wind information is primarily obtained through hourly updated forecasts available prior to the flight. Although flight plans are made based on the forecast, controlling the time of arrival at the destination airport can still be difficult. Furthermore, the imprecision and uncertainty in weather forecasts present additional challenges to flight operations. In view of this, we propose an approach for selecting the optimal cruise airspeed under wind uncertainty to save fuel and maintain the Required Time of Arrival (RTA). The entire flight is first divided into a certain number of segments, and the correlations between wind forecasts and actual observations are utilized by merging Stochastic Programming (SP) and Receding Horizon Control (RHC) frameworks to determine the optimum airspeed. Additionally, we propose a method to reduce fuel consumption across multiple flights by sharing information between aircraft and the air traffic center. This information is then used to determine RTAs and adjust them to achieve fuel efficiency. Through numerical studies, we obtained satisfactory results indicating that the proposed method can lead to improved performance in fuel saving and RTA for all flights in the experiment.",0968-090X,Not found

A Bayesian approach to quantifying uncertainties and improving generalizability in traffic prediction models,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104585,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Deep-learning models for traffic data prediction can have superior performance in modeling complex functions using a multi-layer architecture. However, a major drawback of these approaches is that most of these approaches do not offer forecasts with uncertainty estimates, which are essential for traffic operations and control. Without uncertainty estimates, it is difficult to place any level of confidence in the model predictions, and operational strategies relying on overconfident predictions can lead to worsening traffic conditions. In this study, we propose a Bayesian recurrent neural network framework for uncertainty quantification in traffic prediction with higher generalizability by introducing spectral normalization to its hidden layers. In our paper, we have shown that normalization alters the training process of deep neural networks by controlling the model's complexity and reducing the risk of overfitting the training data. This, in turn, helps improve the generalization performance of the model on out-of-distribution datasets. Results demonstrate that spectral normalization improves uncertainty estimates and significantly outperforms both the layer normalization and model without normalization in both single and multistep prediction horizons. This improved performance can be attributed to the ability of spectral normalization to better localize the latent feature space of the data under perturbations. Our findings are especially relevant to traffic management applications, where predicting traffic conditions across multiple locations is the goal, but the availability of training data from multiple locations is limited. Spectral normalization, therefore, provides a more generalizable approach that can effectively capture the underlying patterns in traffic data without requiring location-specific models.",0968-090X,Not found
Quantifying the dynamic predictability of train delay with uncertainty-aware neural networks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104563,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The digital transformation of railway systems has sparked research in train delay prediction. While efforts have predominantly set on maximizing prediction accuracy, there remains a significant need to explore a deeper understanding of the prediction-associated uncertainty. This study proposes uncertainty-aware neural networks, extended with test-time-dropout and loss attenuation, to predict train delays and also estimate the level of associated confidence. Our approach outperforms commonly-used stochastic methods in terms of accuracy and precision. We further introduce a dynamic prediction horizon framework (DPHF) to systematically compare and validate uncertainty-enhanced predictions over time. We suggest the likeliness of realization (LoR) to evaluate predictions with confidence estimates and to quantify dynamic predictability, which we find to be best described by an exponential decay for an increasing prediction horizon. While the model-driven (epistemic) uncertainty remains relatively small and constant as the prediction horizon increases, the data-inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty is substantially larger and grows significantly. This indicates that the observed decay in predictability is not an artefact of the modelling process but indeed an inherent property of train delays. This study thus provides new insights that can be used to increase the robustness and reliability of railway operations, emphasizing innovative modelling and the utilization of emerging data sources.",0968-090X,Not found

Adaptive generative adjustable electric fence method and internal obstacle detection,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104601,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"It has become a general consensus to design virtual parking stations in dockless bike-sharing systems.

In addition, electric fences can reduce their capacity if they contain obstacles. In this paper, we design an adaptive generative adjustable electric fence system, which can generate electric fences based on constructing an adaptive learning loop of users parking bicycles with system learning feedback. Meanwhile, we define the grid area density to regulate the dynamic change of electric fence capacity. It can dynamically detect and regulate the effect of an obstacle on the capacity of electric fence generation based on the density of parking in the electric fence, regardless of whether the obstacle is permanent or temporary.

Multi-view feature engineering for day-to-day joint clustering of multiple traffic datasets,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104607,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"A common task in traffic data analysis and management is categorizing different days based on similarities in their network-wide traffic states. Given the multifaceted nature of traffic, it is essential to consider multiple attributes for a comprehensive quantification. However, challenges arise when combining these attributes to achieve consistent day-to-day classification across datasets. While various data-driven classification algorithms have been proposed in traffic literature, challenges persist. These include a) applicability limited to univariate datasets, b) incompatibility with datasets containing missing values, c) distance concentration problem in high-dimensional clustering, d) inability to classify outliers, and e) computationally expensive hyperparameter optimization. This research introduces the MCMD (Multi-view Classification based on Consensus Matrix Decomposition) framework, a novel approach for the joint classification of multi-view traffic data. MCMD treats multiple traffic datasets with varying geographical coverage as complementary views of the entire network's traffic state. It then extracts shared hidden features across these datasets and assigns each day classification labels that are consistent across views. MCMD consists of three key modules: the novel Multi-view Uni-orthogonal Non-negative Matrix Factorization (MUNMF) algorithm, an outlier removal module, and the Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) algorithm. A logical integration of the above-stated modules enables MCMD to a) output scale-invariant (SI) and scale-variant (SV) classifications and b) identify outlier days based on the shape and scale of multi-view traffic-state profiles. Compared to existing clustering methods, the design of the MCMD algorithm offers greater versatility in handling both single- and multi-view datasets for SI and SV clustering, computational robustness to missing data, and resilience to the “distance concentration problem” associated with the curse of dimensionality. These advantages stem from its ability to extract relevant cross-dataset features, reduce dimensionality, and eliminate redundancy. Although the primary motivation of the framework is derived from the need to develop a traffic pattern repository to support reliable prior Origin-Destination (OD) selection for online dynamic OD demand adjustment, the paper, through extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic traffic datasets, demonstrates the effectiveness of MCMD from several generic standpoints. These include a) demonstration of the meaningfulness of SI and SV labels, b) assessment of the robustness toward missing information, c) evaluation of its effectiveness in classifying days with special events, d) benchmarking properties against alternative joint day-to-day clustering algorithms, and e) demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed hyperparameter selection method for efficient joint classification of multiple large-scale traffic datasets.",0968-090X,Not found

This paper develops a general modeling framework to optimize train block configuration and operation protocols of a metro line so that extra-long trains can be used under varying demand distribution and infrastructure setting.

These skills are subsequently integrated as sub-policies in the hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to train the meta-controller, which synthesizes these skills to autonomously execute driving tasks in complex scenarios. This training strategy encapsulates the accumulated knowledge into skills, enhancing the transferability and efficiency of learning for similar tasks compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods.

However, maintaining system efficiency while achieving high ridership remains a challenging task in such services. Allowing passengers to be transferred between vehicles within the system is a potential way to improve service availability for customers and increase fleet efficiency. This study proposes a non-myopic state-of-the-art dynamic routing algorithm for operating a ride-pooling service with synchronized so-called intramodal transfers. A non-myopic cost function approximation policy is proposed to control for the opportunity cost of transfer decisions in offering a route with or without transfer to a passenger. The policy approximates this cost with the “time until the potential transfer” as online transfers without such consideration are shown to significantly underperform, while the approximation makes transfers at least as competitive as non-myopic ride-pooling without transfers. The policy is tested in a newly developed simulation platform to investigate various scenarios. Experimental results on real-world trip data in Hamburg, Germany, demonstrate the importance of taking a non-myopic approach in making sequential decisions.

Semantic-fused multi-granularity cross-city traffic prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104604,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Accurate traffic prediction is essential for effective urban management and the improvement of transportation efficiency. Recently, data-driven traffic prediction methods have been widely adopted, with better performance than traditional approaches. However, they often require large amounts of data for effective training, which becomes challenging given the prevalence of data scarcity in regions with inadequate sensing infrastructures. To address this issue, we propose a Semantic-Fused Multi-Granularity Transfer Learning (SFMGTL) model to achieve knowledge transfer across cities with fused semantics at different granularities. In detail, we design a semantic fusion module to fuse various semantics while conserving static spatial dependencies via reconstruction losses. Then, a fused graph is constructed based on node features through graph structure learning. Afterwards, we implement hierarchical node clustering to generate graphs with different granularity. To extract feasible meta-knowledge, we further introduce common and private memories and obtain domain-invariant features via adversarial training. It is worth noting that our work jointly addresses semantic fusion and multi-granularity issues in transfer learning. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our SFMGTL model by comparing it with other state-of-the-art baselines.

Improving robustness of large-scale bus transit networks against cascading failures: A preventive control or an emergency control?,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104602,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Cascading failures of large-scale bus transit networks (LBTNs) often lead to extreme rather than general network performance issues from a network dynamics perspective. Previous studies mostly concentrated on modeling the unfolding process of cascading failures, while little attention was given to controlling such failures, particularly under emergencies. This paper addresses an open problem: is it preferable to employ a preventive control before cascading failures, or to implement an emergency control for real-time cascading failures? Specifically, an emergency route relinking approach that dispatches internal resources (redundancy) without adding external resources (investment) is proposed to handle the operational disruptions caused by cascading failures. Remarkably, an intermediate process, namely non-emergency route relinking, is formulated to reconcile the different study frameworks between the two types of controls, premised on clarifying their differences and interdependencies. This formulation ensures the transition from preventive to emergency controls, as well as from traditional link addition to emergency route relinking. Furthermore, utilizing topological knowledge from network science and operational knowledge from transportation engineering, non-emergency and emergency route relinking strategies are designed to compare the control performance between the two types of controls and among emergency strategies. Case results indicate that (i) The emergency control is better than the preventive control, and operational knowledge is more effective than topological knowledge; (ii) It is insufficient to solely regulate real-time unfolding paths by evacuating failure loads to bypass specific areas, attention should also be given to planning redundancy to reduce the scale of failure loads and handle the adverse fluctuations in failure strength caused by the redundancy dispatching process.

Our proposed controller is founded on reinforcement learning with the reward function embedding the transportation-inspired concept of pressure at the person-level. By rewarding HOV commuters with travel time savings for their efforts to merge into a single ride, HumanLight achieves equitable allocation of green times. Apart from adopting FRAP, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) base model, HumanLight introduces the concept of active vehicles, loosely defined as vehicles in proximity to the intersection within the action interval window. The proposed algorithm showcases significant headroom and scalability in different network configurations considering multimodal vehicle splits at various scenarios of HOV adoption. Improvements in person delays and queues range from 15% to over 55% compared to vehicle-level SOTA controllers. We quantify the impact of incorporating active vehicles in the formulation of our RL model for different network structures. HumanLight also enables regulation of the aggressiveness of the HOV prioritization.

A mixed-integer programming-based Q-learning approach for electric bus scheduling with multiple termini and service routes,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104570,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Electric buses (EBs) are considered a more environmentally friendly mode of public transit. In addition to other practical challenges, including high infrastructure costs and short driving ranges, the operations of EBs are more demanding due to the necessary battery charging activities. Consequently, more sophisticated optimisation models and algorithms are required for effective operations. This paper presents an EB scheduling problem with multiple termini and service routes. Various realistic but complicated factors, such as shared facilities at multiple termini, the flexibility of plugging and unplugging chargers before an EB is fully charged, stochastic travel times, and EB breakdowns, are considered. We propose an integrated learning and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework to overcome the computational difficulties when solving the problem. This framework leverages the strengths of reinforcement learning and MILP for fast computations due to its capability of learning from outcomes of state–action pairs and computational effectiveness guaranteed by the constraints governing the solution feasibility. Q-Learning and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient are adopted as our training methods. We conduct numerical experiments on artificial instances and realistic instances of a bus network in Hong Kong to assess the performance of our proposed approach. The results show that our proposed framework outperforms the benchmark optimisation approach, in terms of penalty on missed service trips, average headway, and variance of headway. The benefits of our proposed framework are more significant under a highly stochastic environment.",0968-090X,Not found
A real-time cooperation mechanism in duopoly e-hailing markets,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104598,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"In a competitive e-hailing market, each participating platform can only utilize a portion of the total demand (passengers) and supply (drivers), in which this fragmentation leads to market inefficiencies. Therefore in this study, we propose a decentralized dynamic cooperation mechanism, inspired by capacity-sharing strategies, between two platforms to mitigate market fragmentation. With the proposed mechanism, the platforms can offer to (i) refer their passengers and (ii) temporarily (for a single trip) lease idle vehicles to the other platform, at varying optimized prices. In its essence, whenever a platform is under-supplied while the other platform is over-supplied in a localized area, the proposed mechanism could help the platforms bridge their supply and demand. The proposed mechanism is constructed as an optimization problem incorporated in the batch-matching algorithm. We test the proposed cooperation mechanism in a disaggregated dynamic model. We consider multiple scenarios, which include symmetrical and asymmetrical duopolies. The performance of the proposed cooperation mechanism is compared to equivalent non-cooperative duopolies and equivalent monopolies. We show that the proposed cooperation mechanism leads to simultaneous improvements in all performance indicators for all stakeholders (passenger pickup time, passenger cancellations, driver income, and platform profitability) compared to equivalent non-cooperative duopolies. Additionally, the proposed cooperation mechanism is shown to be especially effective as the asymmetry between the duopoly increases.",0968-090X,Not found
Flexible rolling stock composition strategy in urban rail transit lines: The influences of various train units and station capacities,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104609,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"This work studies the flexible rolling stock strategy in urban rail transit lines, by which various train units can be coupled to or uncoupled from the trains in certain stations according to the time-varying passenger demand. Due to the use of various train units, coupling and uncoupling train units must respect specific rules related to the shunting rules in adaptation stations, it is important to take into account the order of the train units in the trains. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize the rolling stock compositions together with the train timetable. Additionally, the model includes constraints for passenger assignment to evaluate the number of passengers in train services or stranded at stations. The model aims at reducing the number of stranded passengers, the number of rolling stocks, and the operational costs. To efficiently solve the integrated optimization problem, this study proposes an approximation approach and a two-stage heuristic algorithm. The approximation approach relaxes some calculations and constraints in an approximate manner in order to improve the computational speed. The two-stage heuristic approach divides the integrated optimization problem into two subproblems and solves the two subproblems with a heuristic searching method. The proposed optimization method is examined using the historical operation data of Shanghai Metro Line 16. The results suggest that the proposed approach can well satisfy the passenger travel demand and decrease operational costs. In addition, the influences of train unit types, headway control strategy, and station capacities are studied.

Learning-based modeling of human-autonomous vehicle interaction for improved safety in mixed-vehicle platooning control,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104600,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The rising presence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads necessitates the development of advanced control strategies that account for the unpredictable nature of human-driven vehicles (HVs). This study introduces a learning-based method for modeling HV behavior, combining a traditional first-principles approach with a Gaussian process (GP) learning component. This hybrid model enhances the accuracy of velocity predictions and provides measurable uncertainty estimates. We leverage this model to develop a GP-based model predictive control (GP-MPC) strategy to improve safety in mixed vehicle platoons by integrating uncertainty assessments into distance constraints. Comparative simulations between our GP-MPC approach and a conventional model predictive control (MPC) strategy reveal that the GP-MPC ensures safer distancing and more efficient travel within the mixed platoon. By incorporating sparse GP modeling for HVs and a dynamic GP prediction in MPC, we significantly reduce the computation time of GP-MPC, making it only marginally longer than standard MPC and approximately 100 times faster than previous models not employing these techniques.

Integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling of an intermodal urban transit network: A distributionally robust optimization approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104610,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Integrating emerging shared mobility with traditional fixed-line public transport is a promising solution to the mismatch between supply and demand in urban transportation systems. The advent of modular vehicles (MVs) provides opportunities for more flexible and seamless intermodal transit. The MVs, which have been implemented, are comprised of automated modular units (MUs), and can dynamically change the number of MUs comprising them at different times and stops. However, this innovative intermodal urban transit brings with it a new level of dynamism and uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of jointly optimizing the timetable and the vehicle schedule within an intermodal urban transit network utilizing MVs within the context of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which allows MVs to dynamically (de)couple at each stop and permits flexible circulations of MUs across different transportation modes. We propose a DRO formulation to explore the trade-off between operators and passengers, with the objective of minimizing the worst-case expectation of the weighted sum of passengers’ and operating costs. Furthermore, to address the computational intractability of the proposed DRO model, we design a discrepancy-based ambiguity set to reformulate it into a mixed-integer linear programming model. In order to obtain high-quality solutionss of realistic instances, we develop a customized decomposition-based algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computational results of real-world case studies based on the operational data of Beijing Bus Line illustrate that the proposed integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling method reduces the expected value of passengers’ and operating costs by about 6% in comparison with the practical timetable and fixed-capacity vehicles typically used in the Beijing bus system.",0968-090X,Not found
Risky choice and diminishing sensitivity in MaaS context: A nonlinear logit analysis of traveler behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104603,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"In the rapidly transforming landscape of urban transportation, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has emerged as a potentially transformative solution to adapt to fluctuating travel demand. However, despite arguments in the literature suggesting that uncertainty in travel plans may influence travelers’ preferences for MaaS, the extent and mechanisms of this impact remain relatively underexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by evaluating travelers’ preferences toward MaaS subscriptions, mode choices, and their reactions to uncertainty within a risky-choice modeling framework. We incorporate a linear-specified benchmark model and two nonlinear models (one based on Expected Utility Theory with Constant Absolute Risk Aversion adjustments, and the other on Prospect Theory), to estimate travelers’ risk perceptions and their valuation of gains and losses associated with travel time and costs caused by occasional activities during commute trips. The data utilized in our study originates from a specifically designed stated preference survey carried out in Hong Kong. Our findings present insightful observations into MaaS bundle configurations, socio-demographic patterns, and notably, behaviors under uncertain circumstances. In the face of uncertainty, we observe a noticeable increase in reluctance to adopt MaaS, and a heightened preference for taxis. The models also underscore significant risk aversion and diminishing sensitivity concerning travel time and cost, with these tendencies proving more pronounced for travel time compared to cost. These insights are valuable for policymakers and MaaS operators, offering an enhanced understanding of users’ risk attitudes and the intricate interplay between travelers’ preferences for MaaS and the uncertainties inherent in daily travel.",0968-090X,Not found
A large-scale traffic signal control algorithm based on multi-layer graph deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104582,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Due to its capability in handling complex urban intersection environments, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely applied in Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC). However, most existing algorithms are designed for specific road networks or traffic conditions, making it difficult to transfer them to new environments. Moreover, current graph-based algorithms do not fully capture the geometric and spatial features of intersections, leading to incomplete embedding of the agent's environment depiction. Additionally, the actions adopted by these algorithms are inherently based on fixed-cycle phases, limiting the flexibility of traffic signal control. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a Multi-layer Graph Mask Q-Learning (MGMQ) algorithm for multi-intersection ATSC to optimize traffic and reduce delay. Unlike previous graph-based algorithms, this paper introduces a method for computing multi-layer graphs, dividing the traffic environment into upper-level traffic network-layer graphs and lower-level intersection-layer graphs, and employs the graph attention algorithm and an improved GraphSAGE algorithm for computation. This method not only enables the generation of embedded state for intersections that include geometric and spatial features, but also allows the algorithm to adapt to different traffic conditions and road networks. Additionally, we introduce an action masking mechanism, allowing this algorithm can be adapted to different action spaces. As a result, the algorithm uses arbitrary signal phases as actions to achieve flexible traffic flow control, and can be directly applied to intersections with arbitrary geometry. The final test results demonstrate that a model trained solely on synthetic road networks can be directly transferred to other synthetic network configurations or real-world urban road networks, outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms.",0968-090X,Not found
RoutesFormer: A sequence-based route choice Transformer for efficient path inference from sparse trajectories,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104552,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Sensor and machine learning technologies have improved the perception of traffic systems by providing detailed data about individual vehicle trajectories. Combining data from different types of sensors shows promise for comprehensive perception of global traffic, but it remains challenging. Stationary roadside units only gather sparse trajectories of passing vehicles, while crowd-sourced data records entire trajectories but only consists of a very low sample rate of vehicles. Therefore, there is a need to learn route choice behavior from crowd-sourced data to infer complete paths for the sparse trajectories. Existing route choice models assume path set enumeration or the Markovian property for simplicity, which leaves room for capturing the long sequence of choice behavior from data for added precision. Additionally, the path inference problem is often broken down into multiple independent route choice problems between any consecutive sparse observations, leaving room for exploring one-shot long-sequence inference. To address these challenges, we propose RoutesFormer, an efficient sequence-based, data-driven route choice Transformer that requires minimal assumptions due to the capacity of the model architecture. By being sequence-based, RoutesFormer unifies the route choice and path inference problems, accommodating all observations together and avoiding the need to break down the problem into separate route choices, thereby improving optimality. Experiments conducted on the Shanghai taxi dataset demonstrate that RoutesFormer has made significant improvements over six existing baseline models in various challenging path inference tasks. Specifically, RoutesFormer has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy with an average total link length accuracy of 0.914/0.870 compared to the baselines’ best average accuracy of 0.896/0.845, and it ranks first across all tasks.

Nonreciprocal interactions in crowd dynamics: Investigating the impact of moving threats on pedestrian speed preferences,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104586,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems, such as human–human, human–vehicle, and human–robot systems, often have serious impacts on pedestrian safety and social order. A more comprehensive understanding of these systems is needed to optimize system stability and efficiency. Despite the importance of these interactions, empirical research in this area remains limited. Thus, in our study we explore this underresearched area, focusing on scenarios where nonreciprocity plays a critical role, such as mass stabbings, which pose a substantial risk to public safety. We conducted the first experiments on this system and analysed high-accuracy data obtained from these experiments. Specifically, we conduct laboratory experiments on three scenarios: single exits, dual exits, and obscured chases. Then, we introduce an equation to describe the mechanism behind a direct threat zone, which significantly affects pedestrian behaviour. The extent of the direct threat zone is determined by the speed of the moving threat and the radius of danger occurrence. The equation can provide insights for different nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems, where the subjects of the nonreciprocal interactions can be a pedestrian, an autonomous robot or a vehicle. We further categorize potential threats into direct, adjacent, and rear-view zones, quantifying the level of threat for pedestrians. Our study revealed that a pedestrian’s desired velocity correlated positively with potential threat intensity, increasing until near the direct threat zone. An emerging steady state is observed when escape routes are blocked by moving threats. This deviation affects the density–velocity relationship, making it distinct from the general relationship. This deviation signifies unique pedestrian behaviour in the presence of moving threats. Additionally, the rate of change in the angle for pedestrian motion in various desired directions is synchronized. This indicates the emergence of collective intelligence in nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems. As a result, our study may constitute a pioneering step towards understanding nonreciprocal interactions in crowd systems through laboratory experiments. These findings may enhance pedestrian safety and inform not only government crowd management strategies but also individual self-protection measures.",0968-090X,Not found
Microscopic modeling of attention-based movement behaviors,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104583,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"For transportation hubs, leveraging pedestrian flows for commercial activities presents an effective strategy for funding maintenance and infrastructure improvements.

Analysis and modeling of detours in pedestrian operational navigation,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104584,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Traditional operational navigation models for pedestrian dynamics demonstrate limitations in reproducing the circle antipode experiment, an artificially designed multi-directional flow scenario. In the experiment, pedestrians take detours to avoid the congestion caused by others taking straight paths. Although the pedestrian detour action is commonly incorporated into the route choice model, it frequently goes unaddressed in the operational navigation model, resulting in a disparity between simulation outcomes and empirical observations. To reveal the mechanism underlying pedestrian detours in the circle antipode experiment, this study employed the K-means clustering method rather than using a threshold approach to categorize the experimental participants into groups taking direct or detour routes. Following this, a heuristic function is formulated to determine the desired direction of agents in a collision-free velocity model, reflecting the trade-off between shorter routes and faster speeds. The parameter of the proposed function is calibrated using the proportion of agents choosing detours, where the route types of agents are identified by a classifier based on the random forest. Compared to two traditional models that do not consider detours, the proposed model can more realistically reproduce the trajectory distributions, the travel time, the route length, and the time series of relevant variables in the circle antipode experiment. The study offers insights into employing machine learning methodologies for analyzing pedestrian flow, validating pedestrian dynamics models, and providing an accurate simulation tool for designing transportation facilities and crowd management at large events.",0968-090X,Not found
Analysis of safe and effective next-generation rail signalling systems,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104573,162,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Moving Block (MB) and Virtual Coupling (VC) rail signalling will change current train operation paradigm by migrating vital equipment from trackside to onboard to reduce train separation and maintenance costs. Their actual deployment is however constrained by the industry’s need to identify configurations of MB and VC signalling equipment which can effectively guarantee safe train movements even under degraded operational conditions involving component faults. In this paper, we analyse the effectivity of MB and VC in safely supervising train separation under nominal and degraded conditions by using an innovative approach which combines Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN). An FTA model of unsafe train movement is defined for both MB and VC capturing functional interactions and cause-effect relations among the different signalling components. The FTA is used as a basis to apportion signalling component failure rates needed to feed the SAN model. Effective MB and VC train supervision is analysed by means of SAN-based simulations in the specific scenario of an error in the Train Position Report (TPR) for five rail market segments featuring different traffic characteristics, namely high-speed, mainline, regional, urban and freight. Results show that the thresholds of the design variables depend on the considered signalling system alternative and the investigated market segment. In particular, the TPR delay threshold allowed for MB is higher than for VC. This means that to ensure a safe train movement, VC cannot absorb a TPR delay of longer than 1.5 s, which corresponds to the mainline market segment. For MB instead, the results show that the maximum TPR delay can reach 3.9 s for high-speed and freight railways. In addition, results showed that the integration of an FTA in a SAN model can provide a better understanding of the safety-performance behaviour of a system where VC showed a higher number of braking indications with respect to MB for the same TPR error failure rate. This means that for VC to effectively supervise the train separation at the same safety level as MB, we would need to have a much higher reliability of the TPR. The overall approach can support infrastructure managers, railway undertakings, and rail signalling suppliers in investigating the effectiveness of MB and VC to safely supervise train movements in scenarios involving different types of degraded conditions and failure events. The proposed method can hence support the railway industry in identifying effective and safe design configurations of next-generation rail signalling systems.",0968-090X,Not found

Prior research has made two main assumptions to simplify the problem which are the availability of empty trailers at each yard and predetermined movements for empty trailers. In contrast, this paper proposes a demand-dependent trailer repositioning framework that considers delay penalties and limited available trailers while also addressing ad-hoc changes in orders. To address this problem, we formulate a novel drayage operation pickup and delivery framework (Dray-Q) that optimizes the just-in-time movement of empty trailers in response to the prevailing demand. The main objective is to avoid scenarios where there is either a surplus of empty trailers or a deficit, ensuring that the provisioning of trailers in each yard is both timely and adequate. In order to train the agent, our framework utilizes the advanced Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Rainbow-DQN, to learn efficient the real-time trailer repositioning policy. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that balances empty trailer supply and demand, minimizes delays, and considers customer priorities in the dispatching of empty trailers. Dray-Q is flexible and adaptable to changes in customer order settings and can be scaled to accommodate different combinations of order, trailer, and yard sizes.

Physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a recently proposed advanced scheme for solving partial differential equations (PDE) that can approximate the solution values by minimizing the initial values, boundary values, and residuals of the PDE. However, few studies have discussed how the performance of PINN changes in the face of macroscopic pedestrian flow equations with high-order derivatives and multiple variables. In this study, we propose to compare the performance of three schemes, i.e., the vanilla PINN, the extended-variable PINN (ev-PINN), and the reduced-order PINN (ro-PINN), by solving the macroscopic pedestrian flow equations coupled by the conservation equation and Eikonal equation in the steady-state and transient cases. The results show that the comparison of the PINN models under different hyperparameters indicates that the ro-PINN is the most stable in training, while the other two schemes have a certain degree of fluctuation in the face of different hyperparameters. Secondly, when the traditional numerical solution scheme is used as the reference solution, the ro-PINN solution works best in the steady-state and transient cases, and the solution results of different solution variables such as density and flow are closest to the reference solution, which can make the whole solution process easier and the solution results more accurate by reducing the derivative order in the automatic differentiation part and increasing the output dimension of the neural network. On the contrary, compared with vanilla PINN, ev-PINN not only did not improve the solution results, but even reduced the performance. Finally, we compare the running time of the three PINN schemes, and although increasing the output dimension and decreasing the order of PDE increase the computing time, it is not significant.

Moreover, prior research has primarily concentrated on idealized settings, such as isolated intersections or corridors that solely consist of fully connected automated vehicles (CAVs), making it challenging to be applied to real-world traffic systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper aims to design an innovative learning framework based on arrival timing vectors (ATVs) and traffic signal synchronization for platooning control that can improve traffic throughput and reduce fuel consumption through four basic platoon maneuvers: split, acceleration, deceleration, and no-op.

We used actual control rules, L1 median-HMM model, and A*-SALNS algorithm to extract corresponding taxiing paths. Next, considering aircraft operational safety, efficiency, and green emissions, we constructed a TOPSIS evaluation model for surface taxiing efficiency based on AHP-entropy comprehensive weights.

We obtained quantitative values for the comprehensive efficiency of each taxiing rule, then flexibly configured aircraft taxiing rules to traffic flow. Experimental results indicate that for early departure peak and late arrival peak periods, adapting empirical taxiing rules is preferable. For arrival-departure balanced operational periods, adapting fixed taxiing rules is recommended. In high-density traffic scenarios, the performance of empirical taxiing rules is significantly better compared to fixed and shortest taxiing rules. Specifically, the taxiing time is reduced by 8.2% and 28.1%, taxiing conflicts are reduced by 2.1% and 22.3%, and aircraft fuel efficiency is increased by 1.4% and 15.0%, respectively.

Optimized locating of sensors for approximating the macroscopic fundamental diagram: A PCA-based approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104627,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) describes the traffic state of a relatively large urban network by relating aggregated traffic variables. More research effort needs to be carried out to determine the set of links whose traffic data optimize the MFD estimation. This research approaches the MFD estimation problem as a network sensor location problem (NSLP). The link flow and density data acquired from loop detectors are first reduced into a smaller set of data with fewer dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), an unsupervised machine learning tool for feature reduction. Based on PCA results, criticality coefficient (CC) is introduced as a novel measure to quantify the total variation in traffic variables that each link captures. Thereafter, a combined criticality coefficient (CCC) is calculated as a weighted average of criticality of flow and density and is used as a measure for selecting the links to be equipped with traffic sensors. Finally, using spectral clustering technique, the network is divided into several homogeneously congested clusters for which regional MFDs are recalibrated. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using simulated traffic data from the City of Edmonton based on a DYNAMEQ simulation. The results indicate that the CC-based selection approach consistently outperforms the benchmark method by reducing the error between 35 and 45% when a reasonable number of sensors is selected. Likewise, the CCC-based approach produces promising results in reconstructing regional MFDs with low errors. Further, the post-clustering recalibration reduces the resulting errors by an additional 50–90%, depending on the cluster.

However, the current pedestrian simulation method is difficult to depict the rotation, which results in insufficient authenticity of the simulation effect. This paper proposes a systematic work on the modeling and simulation problem of rotation behaviors under multiple scenarios. Firstly, we improve the body model based on elliptical structure to simulate the microscopic behavior of pedestrians in the most realistic way. Then, we modeling the pedestrian rotation behavior in multiple scenarios by proposing two indexes: rotation angle and rotation timing, which include the Case I : Traversing behavior in narrow areas, Case I I : Avoidance behavior in counter flow and Case I I I : Overtaking behavior in medium density flow. After that, we propose a torsional social force model (T-SFM), which significantly improves original model from two aspects: (a) fusing the torsional force; (b) adding the rotation willingness. More than 500 times real experiments are conducted, and according to the analysis results of real experiments, this paper verifies the authenticity of rotation model from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Moreover, we calibrate the general parameters to verify the generality of the rotation model. The simulation results show that the T-SFM can not only simulate the rotation behavior with high authenticity, but also has good generality. Our research significantly improves the authenticity of pedestrian simulation and provides support for heterogeneous pedestrians modeling in complex environments.",0968-090X,Not found
Signal optimization at an isolated intersection under cyclic vehicle arrivals using spatially sparse trajectory data,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104643,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Existing trajectory-based signal timing studies either assume time-invariant vehicle arrivals or require high penetration rates of connected vehicles (CVs). However, vehicle arrivals at an urban intersection typically follow a cyclic pattern in the real world due to the impacts of traffic signals at upstream signalized intersections. And the penetration rates of CVs are likely to remain at low levels in the near future. This study develops two time-slot based signal optimization models for isolated intersections under cyclic vehicle arrivals using spatially sparse CV trajectories. The number of sub-cycles within a generalized cycle, along with phase sequence, cycle length, and green splits in each sub-cycle, is optimized. The minimization of the weighted sum of over-saturated phase numbers and total vehicle delays is used as the objective function taking into consideration both under- and over-saturated traffic. The consideration of the over-saturated phase number is to increase vehicle throughput and reduce queue length. The cyclicity of vehicle arrivals is identified by Autocorrelation Function with the aid of the aggregation of spatially sparse trajectories. An aggregated-trajectory-based mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to estimate the shockwaves under the initial signal timing plan. The evolution of shockwaves with varying signal timings is predicted based on the estimated profiles of queueing shockwave speeds under the cyclic demand as well as total vehicle delay and residual queue length. Two mixed integer non-linear programming models are formulated to optimize the time-slot based signal schemes with a fixed and a flexible cycle structure. Aggregated-trajectory-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (ATI-MCTS) and Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms are designed for solutions, respectively. Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed models over the one in Synchro Studio, vehicle-actuated control, and longest-queue-first control in terms of average vehicle delay and intersection capacity under both under- and over-saturated traffic. The model with ATI-MCTS algorithm can achieve better trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality compared with the one with DP algorithm. Sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed model with ATI-MCTS algorithm: 1) can achieve a satisfactory performance under a low penetration rate of CVs (e.g., 3 %) and a long sampling interval (e.g., 15 s) if a sufficient number of CV trajectories are aggregated; and 2) is robust to the demand cycle length with under- and over-saturated traffic. Further, the proposed model with ATI-MCTS algorithm is implemented using field data to demonstrate its applicability in the real world.",0968-090X,Not found
A variable-splitting Lagrangian decomposition for train timetabling and skip-stopping with train-type decision,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104645,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"While designing the train timetabling and skip-stopping plan in a space–time network shared by multi-type trains, a prevailing approach is to predesignate a specific type for each train to simplify the problem. However, such a setting is unreasonable and inaccurate to a considerable extent. This paper focuses on how to jointly optimize the train timetabling and skip-stopping problem with train-type decision for a high-speed rail corridor. With the help of a time-dependent and preference-grouped demand representation, this problem is formulated as an integer linear programming model, in which the optimization objective is to minimize the total train- and passenger-related costs. Under the Lagrangian relaxation framework, we employ a variable-splitting technique to decompose the proposed model into several solvable subproblems. By further exploiting the dual solution information, a three-stage heuristic method is developed to generate the expected feasible solution to the problem under consideration.

Heuristic solutions to the single depot electric vehicle scheduling problem with next day operability constraints,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104656,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"This study focuses on the single depot electric vehicle scheduling problem (SDEVSP) within the broader context of the vehicle scheduling problem (VSP). By developing an effective scheduling model using mixed-integer linear programming, we generate bus blocks that accommodate electric vehicles (EVs), ensuring successful completion of each block while considering recharging requirements between blocks and during off-hours. Next day operability constraints are also incorporated, allowing for seamless repetition of blocks on subsequent days. The SDEVSP is known to be computationally complex, deriving optimal solutions unattainable for large-scale problems within reasonable timeframes. To address this, we propose a two-step solution approach: first solving the single depot VSP, and then addressing the block chaining problem (BCP) using the blocks generated in the first step. The BCP focuses on optimizing block combinations to facilitate recharging between consecutive blocks, considering operational constraints.

Order–disorder phase transitions in front of the exit during human crowd evacuations,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104649,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Human crowds often exhibit collective behaviors through self-organization, such as orderly queueing and disordered congestion at exits. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms behind these behaviors is crucial for pedestrian traffic management and the handling of mass crowds. Although current models and experiments have provided profound insights into ordered and disordered pedestrian groups separately, the transition mechanism from order to disorder within pedestrian crowds in front of exits remains unclear. In this study, a pedestrian queueing evacuation experiment was presented to demonstrate the phase transition process of pedestrian movement states as urgency levels in the environment change. We discovered the migration pattern of the phase transition point under evacuation control and identified different propagation modes of pedestrian velocity waves. Furthermore, a pedestrian motion model based on experimental data and observed phenomena was established. This model not only replicates the observed phenomena and regularities from the experiments but also reveals the quantitative phase transition mechanism of pedestrian movement under the influence of a single factor (i.e., urgency level or queueing ratio).

Comparison of pedestrian wayfinding behavior between a real and a virtual multi-story building – A validation study,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104650,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Although numerous studies used Virtual Reality (VR) to study pedestrian behavior, there is an ongoing debate about the validity of using VR for studying pedestrian behavior. This study aims to contribute toward the validation of immersive VR systems for pedestrian wayfinding behavior studies by conducting a direct comparison of a field experiment and a matched virtual experiment. Both experiments feature three identical wayfinding assignments across multiple floors in a building. To evaluate the ecological validity of VR, three metrics of three different levels of wayfinding behavior are adopted, namely travel time (level: wayfinding performance), wayfinding strategy (level: decision-making), and angular speed of the head (level: observational behavior). Our findings show that VR can be used to study pedestrian wayfinding strategy in buildings with a single floor. However, there are significant differences in pedestrian wayfinding strategy between the field experiment and the VR experiment. Additionally, we found significant differences in the angular speed of the head between the two experiments. It suggests that researchers should take caution when using VR as a research tool to study the wayfinding strategy and the observational behavior of pedestrians in multi-story buildings.",0968-090X,Not found

The use of virtual reality technology presents an efficient approach for investigating pedestrian wayfinding behavior in large public spaces, offering numerous advantages for data collection. However, the impact of different scenario dimensions on pedestrian wayfinding behavior in large public spaces remains unclear. Additionally, the selection of virtual experiment scenario dimensions currently relies primarily on researchers’ experience and practical conditions, lacking sufficient evidence to support their rational. Another challenge is the limited focus on spatial knowledge’s effect on wayfinding behavior, with insufficient analysis of the utility of pedestrian visual information and a lack of precise methods to quantify visual field information accurately. This study addresses these gaps by incorporating spatial knowledge at multiple scales and pedestrian visual field information as influencing factors in the analysis of wayfinding behavior. Furthermore, it distinguishes between three-dimensional and two-dimensional scenarios to compare the impact of dimensional differences on pedestrian wayfinding behavior. By analyzing behavior data from non-immersive wayfinding experiments, this research employs statistical analysis methods and a deep learning framework to derive results regarding the factors influencing wayfinding behavior. The findings demonstrate that considering both spatial and visual field information effectively enhances the predictive ability of the wayfinding model. Additionally, dimensional differences significantly influence the pedestrian wayfinding process. These results offer empirical evidence to guide researchers in selecting experimental scenarios of pedestrian behavior and provide insights for public space layout, signage design, and improving pedestrian efficiency.",0968-090X,Not found
Unravelling uncertainty in trajectory prediction using a non-parametric approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104659,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Predicting the trajectories of road agents is fundamental for self-driving cars. Trajectory prediction contains many sources of uncertainty in data and modelling. A thorough understanding of this uncertainty is crucial in a safety-critical task like auto-piloting a vehicle. In practice, it is necessary to distinguish between the uncertainty caused by partial observability of all factors that may affect a driver’s near-future decisions, the so-called aleatoric uncertainty, and the uncertainty of deploying a model in new scenarios that are possibly not present in the training set, the so-called epistemic uncertainty. They reflect the trade-off between data collection and model improvement In this paper, we propose a new framework to systematically quantify both sources of uncertainty. Specifically, to approximate the spatial distribution of an agent’s future position, we propose a 2D histogram-based deep learning model combined with deep ensemble techniques for measuring aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by entropy-based quantities. The proposed Uncertainty Quantification Network (UQnet) employs a causal part to enhance its generalizability so rare driving behaviours can be effectively identified. Experiments on the INTERACTION dataset show that UQnet is able to give more robust predictions in generalizability tests compared to the correlation-based models. Further analysis presents that high aleatoric uncertainty cases are mainly caused by heterogeneous driving behaviours and unknown intended directions. Based on this aleatoric uncertainty component, we estimate the lower bounds of mean-square-error and final-displacement-error as indicators for the predictability of trajectories. Furthermore, the analysis of epistemic uncertainty illustrates that domain knowledge of speed-dependent driving behaviour is essential for adapting a model from low-speed to high-speed situations. Our paper contributes to motion forecasting with a new framework, that recasts the problem of accuracy improvement in a way that focuses on differentiating between unpredictable components and rare cases for which more and different data should be collected.",0968-090X,Not found
Preferences for automated taxis. A comparison between immersive virtual reality and screen-based stated choice experiments,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104628,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Automated Taxi (AT) services, as a promising business model for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), have paved the way for novel mobility options. Understanding users’ preferences for this innovative alternative is crucial for its success but proves to be challenging, as the lack of a real market mostly requires setting hypothetical situations to elicit respondents’ preferences. Recent applications have seen an increasing use of Virtual Reality (VR), as a way to control the context, or to provide visual representation of some attributes. Research is however still in its infancy, in particular in the transport context, and results often are not comparable or show opposite effects. In this research, we aim to contribute to this limited research by studying the impact of the immersive VR environment in the preferences for AT elicited with Stated Choice (SC) experiments. Differently from previous studies, our experiment is built to ensure that the SC experiment in the VR-based environment is perfectly comparable with the standard SC screen-based, for internal validity. A control group is also used to test the order effect in the presentation of the two surveys, and to control for the carryover effect. Using data collected from a quite large sample, compared to the existing studies, joint mixed logit models are estimated allowing to assess the impact of the immersive VR environment on the choice bias, heterogeneity in the preferences for specific attributes, as well as panel effect, and order effect. Our results show that the immersive VR-based experience has no impact on the preferences for level-of-service attributes, travel time and cost, unless respondents can, to some extent, experience them, like waiting time in our study. On the other hand, the hints and cues provided by the immersive VR environment seem to affect the evaluation of the social aspects, descriptive norms and customers’ reviews. This highlights a significantly high heterogeneity in the preferences, not revealed in the screen-based SC experiment. Finally, differently from previous literature, our results show no difference in the choice bias between VR- and screen-based environment, but only if differences in the preferences for specific attributes between the two environments are properly taken into account.",0968-090X,Not found
Incorporation of adaptive compression into a GPU parallel computing framework for analyzing large-scale vessel trajectories,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104648,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Automatic Identification System (AIS) offers a wealth of vessel navigation data, which underpins research in maritime data mining, situational awareness, and knowledge discovery within the realm of intelligent transportation systems. The flourishing marine industry has prompted AIS satellites and base stations to generate massive amounts of vessel trajectory data, escalating both data storage and calculation costs. The conventional Douglas-Peucker (DP) algorithm used for trajectory compression sets a uniform threshold, which hampers effective compression. Additionally, compressing and accelerating the computation of large datasets poses a significant challenge in real-world applications. To address these limitations, this paper aims to develop a new Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallel computing and compression framework that enables the acceleration of the optimal threshold calculation for each trajectory automatically in maritime big data mining. It achieves this by incorporating a new Adaptive DP with Speed and Course (ADPSC) algorithm, which utilizes the dynamic navigation characteristics of different vessels. It can effectively solve the associated computational time cost concern when using the ADPSC algorithm to compress vast trajectory datasets in the real world. Additionally, this paper proposes a novel evaluation metric for assessing compression efficacy based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method. Comprehensive experiments encompass vessel trajectory datasets from three representative research areas: Tianjin Port, Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and Caofeidian Port. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) the newly developed ADPSC method outperforms in terms of compression, and 2) the designed GPU parallel computing framework can significantly shorten the compression time for extensive datasets. The GPU-accelerated compression methodology not only minimizes storage and transmission costs for data from both manned and unmanned vessels but also enhances data processing speed, supporting real-time decision-making.

To characterize the problem mathematically, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is formulated to simultaneously minimize the passenger waiting cost and operating costs of the bus system. This model is further reformulated equivalently into a mixed-integer linear programming model via the linearization method.

Energy-efficient train control incorporating inherent reduced-power and hybrid braking characteristics of railway vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104626,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"With the increasing awareness of carbon neutrality, the application of energy-efficient train control (EETC) to rail transportation systems continues to attract attention from industry and academia. In many classic EETC studies, train models are commonly simplified with pure regenerative braking and constant power characteristics during high speeds, to simplify the complexity of the model. In this paper, a realistic model incorporating hybrid braking characteristics combining regenerative and mechanical braking, and reduced-power characteristics at high speeds into the EETC problem is proposed to improve control precision of the train and the modeling precision of the energy consumption and time. This study addresses the minimum-time train control (MTTC) problem and EETC problem considering nonlinear traction characteristics based on the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method, and nonlinear traction and braking characteristics are approximated via a piecewise linear (PWL) modeling technique. Results indicate that the proposed alternative models achieves some deviations from the realistic model in terms of time, energy consumption, and control strategies. The deviations between models in energy consumption and time accumulate as the number of operating stations increases. Therefore, the choice of an appropriate model depends on the precision requirements of various scenarios.

Our proposed collaborative vehicle utilization framework allows participating carriers to borrow trucks from each other. The borrowed truck is picked up from the lender’s depot and used to transport goods from the borrower’s depot to the delivery locations based on optimal routing decisions. Although order sharing, where carriers can make deliveries on behalf of each other, is a common approach to carrier collaboration in the literature, it is rarely implemented in practice due to carriers’ reluctance to share sensitive customer information with other carriers and their desire to serve their own customers to preserve service consistency. In contrast, our framework maintains service consistency, and does not require customer information exchange between carriers. We develop two integer programming formulations for the collaborative vehicle utilization problem and design branch-and-price algorithms to solve them. Profits are shared among participating carriers using a cooperative game theoretical approach, which is solved by a constraint generation algorithm. Thanks to short calculation times, our collaborative vehicle utilization framework can solve instance sizes that are more relevant to practical applications, and on average achieves profits within 6.4% of those obtained through order sharing.",0968-090X,Not found
Traffic state estimation from vehicle trajectories with anisotropic Gaussian processes,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104646,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Accurately monitoring road traffic state is crucial for various applications, including travel time prediction, traffic control, and traffic safety. However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the congestion propagation in traffic flow data. The model parameters can be estimated by statistical inference using data from sparse probe vehicles or loop detectors. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs, along with simulated data representing a traffic bottleneck scenario. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation (TSE) scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment.

Therefore, this paper proposes an evolving scenario generation method, employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to construct human-like BVs that interact with AVs, and this evolving scenario is designed to test and evaluate the intelligence of AVs. Firstly, a class of BV driver models with human-like competitive, mutual, and cooperative driving motivations is designed.

In view of this, we present a novel defense-aware robust RL approach tailored for ensuring the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles in the face of worst-case attacks on observations. The proposed paradigm primarily comprises two crucial modules: an adversarial attacker and a robust defender. Specifically, the adversarial attacker is devised to approximate the worst-case observational perturbations that attempt to induce safety violations (e.g., collisions) in the RL-driven autonomous vehicle. Additionally, the robust defender is developed to facilitate the safe RL agent to learn robust optimal policies that maximize the return while constraining the policy and cost perturbed by the adversarial attacker within specified bounds. Finally, the proposed technique is assessed across three distinct traffic scenarios: highway, on-ramp, and intersection.

Real-time prediction of transit flow during underground incidents is vital for ensuring passenger safety, minimizing disruptions, and optimizing resource allocation. This study presents a comprehensive framework to address the considerable challenges associated with short-term origin–destination (OD) flow prediction, particularly during incidents. We propose integrating convolutional long short-term memory cells with self-attention cells to learn the long-range spatiotemporal information of historical OD flows. To overcome the absence of a real-time OD matrix, we introduce an improved graph convolution operation, considering the local connection of ridership, to capture vital spatiotemporal interaction patterns. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance of the framework, providing insights into the role of each module. Experimental results suggest that incorporating incident matrix theory enhances the accuracy of capturing declining OD flows during incidents by up to approximately 25%. Furthermore, integrating external features like weather and time comprehensively assesses the impact of erratic change factors, especially during off-peak periods. Additionally, introducing more than one cycle of historical OD flow as an input may introduce noise, and increased attention is needed for OD flows with average daily flows exceeding 30 passengers.

In practice, many of those trips are scheduled in advance but many others are asked on the fly (online) by the users while the drivers are already on their routes. To answer those online requests, dispatching centers often rely on fast heuristics based on some myopic objectives. However, this deteriorates the flexibility of the dispatch over time.

Pedestrian shuttle service optimization for autonomous intersection management,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104623,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Autonomous intersection management (AIM) has been widely investigated over the past two decades as a solution for signal-free intersections in a fully connected and autonomous environment. However, existing AIM approaches lack consideration for crossing pedestrians, especially in a way that enables pedestrians to cross streets safely while optimizing upcoming vehicles at the intersection to maintain traffic continuity. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Automated Pedestrian Shuttle (APS) service system to transport pedestrians across the street. Using a coupled space–time network modeling method, an optimization model, which incorporates pedestrian ride strategies and aims to minimize the total crossing time, is first established for the APS operation scheme. A Shuttle-by-Shuttle-Planning (SBSP) algorithm is developed for model solving to determine the APS operation route and the departure time from each station along the route. Then, a timing schedule optimization model is proposed to adjust the departure time of APS at each station and the time of main-lane vehicles entering an intersection to avoid vehicle conflicts. To ensure that the main-lane vehicles can enter the intersection on time, a trajectory optimization model is proposed to provide a specific driving strategy for each main-lane vehicle. A rolling horizon strategy is adopted to bridge the different optimization time windows. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed APS service system is demonstrated through numerical simulation experiments. The results show that (1) the APS service can effectively help pedestrians cross the street with minor delays to main-lane vehicles; (2) The dynamic-route scheme is adaptable to the needs of randomly arriving pedestrians due to its demand-responsive nature; (3) The service efficiency of the system is related to the number of APSs, and the more APSs, the higher the service efficiency under the premise of unsaturation; (4) The designed SBSP algorithm significantly reduces the model-solving time compared to the commercial solver, making the APS service system potentially applicable for field implementation.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimization of traffic signal timings and vehicle trajectories considering mandatory lane-changing at isolated intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104614,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Intersections are the predominant bottlenecks in urban areas due to the intricate conflicts among vehicles with different movements. With the advent of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), it is more effective to reorganize urban traffic in a coordinated manner, and integrate the planning of both the traffic signal timings and vehicle trajectories. Most existing studies in this field assume that all vehicles are in their intended lanes initially, and only optimize the trajectories in the longitudinal dimension for simplicity, which is ideal and unrealistic. Therefore, this paper considers mandatory lane-changing for the integrated optimization of traffic signal timings and vehicle trajectories at isolated intersections. The entire planning horizon is segmented into a series of time-slots, based on which we select phases and plan the trajectories. First, a single-layer mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated to obtain global optimal solutions. Nevertheless, for large-scale cases, the MIP model is not applicable due to its computational complexities. Thus, we regulate vehicles into multi-lane platoons that correspond to green phases to reduce the solution space, and propose a beam-search-based platoon formation planning (BPFP) framework for efficient optimization. A beam search procedure is proposed to select phases for each time-slot, which incorporates a vehicle assignment algorithm to design the platoon formation as a subroutine. The two-dimensional vehicle trajectories are subsequently planned according to the platoon formation profiles. Numerical experiments illustrate that BPFP is capable of acquiring near-optimal solutions and considerably outperforms the baselines, while the computation time is within seconds even in over-saturated scenarios.",0968-090X,Not found
SCU-Counting: A large-scale benchmark dataset for multi-class object counting,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104608,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Object counting has been widely studied because of its practicality. However, most currently published object counting datasets contain only a single class of objects, such as crowd or vehicle, which is challenging to meet the usage needs of tasks, such as traffic control. For practical applications, a multi-class object counting (MCOC) dataset that includes transports is increasingly needed. Therefore, this study collected a large-scale MCOC dataset from the Web and live-viewing, called the Soochow university counting (SCU-Counting) dataset. Images from the Web are licensed for free modification, sharing and using for all creative commons. SCU-Counting consists of 2521 images, where 108 images are empty scenes and others are annotated, in a total of 274,199 annotated instances (195,018 humans, 38,831 cars, 2503 trucks, 6445 buses, 10,964 tricycles, 4600 e-bikes, 9729 e-scooters, 3900 bicycles, 2169 motorcycles). Except for empty scenes, each image contains at least one type of objects. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional neural network-based multi-aware feature aggregation network (MAFA-Net) for MCOC. MAFA-Net first uses a front-end module to extract shallow image features, and then designs a multi-aware module that can aggregate contextual, channel and spatial information of features extracted by the front-end. Additionally, a class adaptive weight assignment (CAWA) loss function is developed based on the focal loss function, which can regulate the sample balance between classes in MCOC tasks. We conducted comparative experiments on five public counting datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed MAFA-Net. In addition, we conducted extensive experiments on the SCU-Counting dataset to validate the counting and target localization abilities of MAFA-Net. For the counting task, MAFA-Net achieves the best MAE (mean absolute error) of 20.08 and MSE (mean squared error) of 46.11, which is 1.84 and 1.75 lower in MAE and MSE than the second best method, respectively. For the localization task, MAFA-Net reaches 90.3% normalized average precision (nAP) at the level of 0.5 and 67.5% average nAP at the level set of { 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , … , 0 . 50 } , which suggests that the localization performance of MAFA-Net can meet the requirement of applications. In summary, experimental results demonstrate the usability of the SCU-Counting dataset and the superiority of MAFA-Net.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated operations strategies for shared and privately-owned autonomous vehicles: A deep reinforcement learning framework,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104621,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The shared autonomous vehicle (SAV), combining shared mobility and vehicle automation, will play a pivotal role in urban transportation. Effectively matching SAVs to stochastic customer demand poses a significant challenge, particularly when addressing microscopic multi-AV coordination to prevent conflicts and congestion within a network. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel traffic control scheme called the Integrated Operation Framework for Order Matching and AV Coordination (I-OFOMAC). This scheme introduces a third-party coordinator responsible for integrating online order matching for the SAV platform and real-time AV coordination for the road manager. Our approach utilizes an offline deep reinforcement learning method to train a state value neural network, which facilitates strategic order matching. Additionally, a neural network approximating bisimulation metrics is trained to enhance exploration and accelerate learning. To achieve scalability in network-level AV coordination, we adopt a scheduled transportation scheme. The coordinator solves the I-OFOMAC during each decision epoch, optimizing order matching and AV coordination. The I-OFOMAC aims to balance the goals of minimizing AV travel delay and maximizing SAV service revenue. We conduct extensive simulation studies in the realistic Wangjing network to evaluate the proposed I-OFOMAC scheme. Compared to two-step benchmark frameworks that implement order matching and AV coordination sequentially, the I-OFOMAC achieves an average increase of 13.28% in platform revenue (ranging from 2% to 22.53%) and a 4.48% reduction in average PAV travel delay (ranging from −6.55% to 20.17%).",0968-090X,Not found
Intersection control based on Fine-grained Phases for connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104619,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Traditional traffic signal control is one of the most widely used urban traffic control methods, due to its high efficiency, robustness, and simplicity. However, in the era of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), it is prospective to enhance traffic control precision and achieve vehicle coordination in a more efficient manner. Focusing on an isolated intersection, this study proposes an innovative concept of Fine-grained Phase (FP) for CAV-enabled traffic control, which realizes more refined right-of-way allocation than traditional signal phases while preserving the simplicity and scalability. The development of FP jointly optimizes traffic control strategy and intersection layout design to fully utilize time-space resources, and multiple forms of FP could be generated in response to various traffic demands; meanwhile, vehicle coordination is achieved in an offline–online manner to balance solution quality and efficiency. Under the FP-based control, each lane is assigned with periodical entry time points using FP design results, then vehicles are supposed to catch up with the appropriate time points to fulfill their trips. Theoretical analyses are conducted under stationary vehicle arrival patterns, where the average delay and the intersection capacity associated with different forms of FP can be analytically acquired. For the implementation of FP-based control, we construct a general offline–online framework, consisting of an offline model that optimizes the geometry of the conflict zone at intersections and the control strategy of vehicles simultaneously, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, and an online FP adoption mechanism that can adapt to varying demand patterns. Under the framework, limited online computation is required, facilitating its practical real-time implementation. Simulation studies under a variety of demand settings show that FP-based control is advantageous over benchmark methods in reducing vehicle delay and also improving intersection capacity in most cases; even for cases with extremely imbalanced demands, FP-based control can admit comparable throughput, while the average delay is much smaller. In addition, results of computation time reveal that FP-based control could realize real-time implementation with negligible computation burden.",0968-090X,Not found
Sustainable last-mile distribution with autonomous delivery robots and public transportation,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104615,163,2024-06-01,2024,6,"In recent years, the rapid growth of e-commerce and the need to make last-mile logistics more sustainable have stimulated the development of new distribution paradigms, based on air drones and autonomous delivery robots, which are less sensitive to traffic congestion. In this article we deal with a routing problem in which a fleet of autonomous delivery robots can travel not only on the road network but also on the public transportation system (or part of it) to extend their range of action with a given battery capacity. The problem entails building delivery robot routes synchronized with the rides of the public transportation lines, enabling robots to drop on/off public vehicles, where they use dedicated compartments, to reach customers that would be otherwise out of reach. To this purpose, we develop a tailored destroy-and-repair mechanism that, embedded into a neighborhood search algorithm, allows to effectively explore the feasibility region of large-scale instances. Extensive computational results on instances resembling the distribution of drugs to pharmacies in Rome (Italy) show that the proposed algorithmic mechanism allows to obtain a cost reduction up to about 7.5% with respect to a more traditional approach. Moreover, from a managerial point of view, our experiments show that autonomous delivery robots combined with public transportation can provide huge benefits in terms of costs and emissions reduction, when compared to both traditional and electric vans.",0968-090X,Not found
Improving multi-modal transportation recommendation systems through contrastive De-biased heterogenous graph neural networks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104689,164,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Conventional uni-modal transportation recommendation systems focused on single modes of transportation are limited in providing satisfactory solutions since passengers often undertake journeys involving multiple modes. Multi-modal transportation recommendation systems are becoming increasingly popular within navigation applications. However, these systems face challenges from biased raw data, data sparsity and long-tail distribution, as well as complexities in representing large-scale graph structures, which collectively hinder their optimal performance. This study introduces a novel approach for enhancing multi-modal transportation recommendation systems: the Contrastive De-biased Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (CDHGNN). By integrating contrastive learning, the model generates augmented samples to mitigate bias and overcome the data-skewing problem. The heterogeneous graph neural network adaptively captures temporal and spatial patterns among users and locations, as well as spatial adjacency and attribute relations, leading to enhanced representations of nodes, and consequently, improved model performance. The proposed method was evaluated using real-world data from over 300,000 users’ records in Beijing over two months in 2018. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach outperforms four contemporary state-of-the-art methods.

The asymmetric behavior (AB) model by Chen et al. (2012a) is extended to accommodate a range of CF behaviors by AVs and compare with the baseline of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). The parameters of the extended AB (EAB) model are calibrated using an adaptive sequential Monte Carlo method for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC-ASMC) to stochastically capture various uncertainties including model mismatch resulting from unknown AV CF logic. The estimated posterior distributions of the parameters reveal significant differences in CF behavior (1) between AVs and HDVs, and (2) across AV developers, engine modes, and speed ranges, albeit to a lesser degree.

Beyond behavioural change: Investigating alternative explanations for shorter time headways when human drivers follow automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104673,164,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Integrating Automated Vehicles (AVs) into existing traffic systems holds the promise of enhanced road safety, reduced congestion, and more sustainable travel. Effective integration of AVs requires understanding the interactions between AVs and Human-driving Vehicles (HVs), especially during the transition period in which AVs and HVs coexist in a mixed traffic environment. Numerous recent empirical studies find reduced headways of human drivers following an AV compared to following an HV, and attribute this reduction to behavioural changes of drivers when they follow AVs. However, more factors may be at play due to the inherent inconsistencies between the comparison conditions of HV-following-AV and HV-following-HV. This study scrutinises three alternative explanations for the observed reduction in headways: (1) systematic differences in car-following states during data collection, (2) systematic differences in driving variability between leading AVs and HVs, and (3) systematic differences in driving characteristics of leading AVs versus HVs. We use a large-scale dataset extracted from Lyft AV motion data and examine each of these explanations through data stratification and simulation. Our results show that all three mechanisms contribute to the observed reduction in headways of human drivers following AVs. In addition, our findings highlight the importance of driving homogeneity and stability in achieving reliably shorter headways. Thereby, this study offers a more comprehensive understanding on the difference between HV–AV and HV–HV interactions in mixed traffic, and is expected to promote more effective integration of AVs into human traffic.",0968-090X,Not found

The cooperation among different transport service providers (TSPs) helps to reduce operational costs and improve resource utilization rates by pooling the mobility resources together and facilitating the centralized optimal resource allocation. However, TSPs are selfish entities who seek to maximize their own profits. They will form a coalition only when cooperation brings them more benefits. Hence, to ensure the stability of such a coalition, the key challenge lies in designing revenue-sharing schemes that make TSPs better off and the coalition reaches Pareto efficiency, while accounting for individual TSPs’ decentralized resource allocation decisions. In this study, we propose a two-stage hierarchical game theoretical model to design an efficient revenue-sharing rule that can stabilize the coalition. The first stage solves the revenue-sharing problem in a cooperative game, while the second stage solves TSPs’ resource allocation strategies in a decentralized non-cooperative game.

Our approach builds upon a microscopic traffic model and considers the interactions between CAVs and HVs, as well as the distinctive driving behaviors exhibited by each vehicle type. In particular, acknowledging that CAVs behave differently from HVs, we conduct a thorough analysis of the car-following and lane-changing behaviors of HVs in the presence of CAVs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we carried out extensive numerical simulations on a freeway segment with variable speed controls. The simulation results highlight two key findings: First, the proposed model achieves accurate estimations of mixed traffic states, including both flow and speed parameters. Second, there is a marked improvement in performance with increasing differences in speed control between CAVs and HVs.

Firstly, this paper introduces two principles: the fundamental diagram and spatial density consistency. The method of abstracting from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to the network model is standardized and objective density consistency is achieved using the social force model. Additionally, the consistency between the results of the microscopic and macroscopic network models is verified through simulation experiments of microscopic scenarios. The Macro-Dynamic Propagation Model (MDPM) has been enhanced in three aspects to better suit evacuation scenarios. Furthermore, the quantization of pedestrians’ path selection results is achieved by synchronously propagating node embeddings. Based on the established evacuation case’s fundamental diagram of pedestrian flow, the logic of fundamental diagram matching (LFM) is designed to be applicable to evacuation scenarios. Finally, using the real-time density of the nodes and the node embeddings as attribute terms, this paper designs a pedestrian selection model that enables the MDPM to consider the following effect of the pedestrians in the evacuation case.

This strategy diminishes the time drivers spend searching for parking, thereby mitigating traffic congestion, air pollution, and other negative externalities. However, there is an additional rationale for keeping some curbside parking spaces unoccupied that is unrelated to negative externalities. In urban areas, parking markets often constitute mixed oligopolies wherein curbside parking is publicly operated, and garage parking is privately operated, each with limited capacity. Multiple pricing equilibria exist in such markets. In the equilibrium yielding the highest welfare, certain curbside parking spots remain unoccupied. The city refrains from reducing the curbside parking fee to occupy all available spots, as this could diminish the utilization of garage parking and potentially lead to increased garage fees, thereby reducing overall parking capacity utilization.

This study is dedicated to establishing an advanced methodology for partitioning maritime traffic, aimed at enhancing traffic pattern interpretability and strengthening ship anti-collision risk management. Specifically, three interaction measure metrics, including conflict criticality, spatial distance, and approaching rate, are initially introduced to quantify different aspects of spatiotemporal interactions among ships. Subsequently, a semi-supervised spectral regularization framework is devised to adeptly accommodate both multiple interaction information and prior knowledge derived from historic partitioning structures. This framework facilitates the segmentation of regional traffic into multiple clusters, wherein ships with the same cluster exhibit high temporal stability, conflict connectivity, spatial compactness, and convergent motion. Meanwhile, an adaptive hyperparameter selection model is engineered to seek optimal traffic partitioning outcomes across diverse scenarios, while also incorporating user preferences for specific interaction indicators. Comprehensive experiments using AIS data from Ningbo-Zhoushan Port are undertaken to thoroughly assess the models’ efficacy.

The extensive integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) into TSC, fueled by the advancements in artificial intelligence, has yielded remarkable efficacy. Nevertheless, prevailing DRL models are typically developed within homogeneous road networks, characterized by identical intersection types and relatively balanced traffic flow patterns. This predominant approach often results in an oversight of the impact of intersection heterogeneity, encompassing variations in intersection geometric structure, traffic demands, signal timing design, and other pertinent factors, on action selections by researchers. This paper addresses the aforementioned gap by introducing a value-decomposition-based spatiotemporal graph attention multi-agent DRL model (MARL_SGAT) that expressly accommodates intersection heterogeneity. Specifically, a heterogeneous correlation index is designed using road network structural parameters and serves to formulate a heterogeneous reward function, enabling the quantification of action execution improvements in diverse road network environments. To address the intricate spatiotemporal features of traffic flows within the heterogeneous road network, the model strategically selects and incorporates these features during the formulation by leveraging a spatiotemporal graph attention network. On these bases, double dual networks are introduced to convert the individual-global-max constraint of action selection into a value range constraint of the action advantage function, thereby facilitating model learning.

A novel generative adversarial network for improving crash severity modeling with imbalanced data,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104642,164,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Traffic crash data is often greatly imbalanced with the majority of non-fatal crashes and only a small number of fatal crashes. Such data imbalance issue poses a challenge for crash severity modelling, especially for classifying and interpreting fatal crashes with very limited samples. To address the data imbalance issues, the data resampling techniques are commonly used methods to rebalance the number of samples among all categories of the dataset, such as under-sampling and over-sampling techniques. However, it is challenging for most traditional and existing deep learning-based resampling methods, e.g., synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to handle both continuous and discrete risk factors in traffic crash datasets, since they are built upon by smooth and continuous functions which are not applicable for processing discrete variables. Though some resampling methods are capable of handling both continuous and discrete variables, they may struggle with mode collapse issues associated with sparse discrete risk factors so that the diversity of the underlying data distribution can not be captured due to oversampling repetitive and similar samples. To address the aforementioned issues, the current study proposes a traffic crash data generation method based on the Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN) to rebalance crash datasets for improving performance of crash severity classification and interpretation. The designed experiments are conducted to evaluate contributions of the synthetic data for improving crash severity classification, the distribution consistency between synthetic and benchmark datasets, and the parameter recovery (i.e., the accuracy of parameter estimation and probability prediction) for various resampling strategies. A 4-year real-world dataset collected in Washington State, U.S., and Monte Carlo simulations are utilized for demonstrating the designed experiments. The results indicate that crash severity modeling using synthetic data generated by the mix-resampling of CTGAN and random under-sampling (CTGAN-RU) outperforms all baseline methods.

While these models have strong theoretical foundations, current network traffic flow models grapple with accurately reflecting intricate and evolving real-world traffic patterns, particularly the variance and heterogeneity seen in expansive urban systems. These challenges arise from the innate dynamics of traffic flows and external factors such as fluctuating travel demands and traffic control measures.

This paper develops a generic duopoly evolutionary game model to capture dynamic decision adjustments and the evolution of market conditions. Bounded rationality and strategic learning are integrated into the modeling to dissect the interaction and competition between two platforms. The existence of stationary points where the system states remain unchanged over time is identified, and simplified stability conditions are derived. A pure strategy pair is found stable when constituting a strict Nash equilibrium and corresponding to positive payoffs. We establish two extended models to capture the nascent service aggregator and mixed electric/fuel fleets and compare them with the basic model. The model is calibrated employing the ride-hailing data of New York and is applicable for analyzing the market evolution under different states. The impacts of potential demand drop, aggregated services, and mixed fleets on platform decision and driver-passenger choice evolution are unveiled. It is found that the platforms possess self-recovery capability when facing a deteriorated external environment. The decision-making of the small platform exhibits a more substantial inertia and volatility since the large platform’s decision can easily influence the market supply and demand. In the initial stage, the service aggregator slightly harms the large platform, but in the long run, it benefits both platforms. Besides, both platforms reduce prices while inflating commission ratios under mixed fleets.

Stochastic Switching Mode Model based Filters for urban arterial traffic estimation from multi-source data,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104664,164,2024-07-01,2024,7,"There has been extensive research in traffic state estimation that accounts for the stochastic nature of traffic flow models. However, these studies often exhibit limitations such as an exclusive focus on motorway traffic and a reliance on a single data source. This paper departs from these methods by introducing a stochastic estimation framework that is specifically designed for urban arterial traffic. The framework has the capability to incorporate multiple data sources, which serves to improve its accuracy and robustness. The framework is composed of three components: (i) a stochastic traffic flow model, (ii) a filtering algorithm, and (iii) an algorithm for incorporating multi-source measurements. In terms of the traffic model, we introduce a new stochastic Switching Mode Model that can be applied to arterial roads that have both signalized and unsignalized intersections. This model does not consider uncertainty in the current mode of operation, which substantially reduces the computational complexity because there is only one mode at each time step. Furthermore, we propose three different filtering algorithms for multi-source traffic estimation, including the incremental stochastic Kalman Filter (SKF), the incremental stochastic Unscented Kalman Filter (SUKF), and the hybrid approach. Since the SKF can only deal with linear functions, non-linear measurement equations need to be linearized using first-order Taylor expansions. The SUKF is based on the Unscented Transform (UT), which enables it to work with a wider range of functions regardless of linearity, non-linearity, or non-differentiability. The hybrid algorithm is a combination of the SKF and the SUKF, in which linear equations are treated similarly to the SKF, and non-linear equations are handled with the UT in the same way as in the SUKF. The performances of these algorithms were similar when applied to the synthetic data of an urban arterial in Christchurch CBD, New Zealand. The hybrid algorithm, however, worked slightly better and was more stable than the other two.",0968-090X,Not found
An integrated neural combinatorial Tabu Search for optimizing school bus scheduling with bell time,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104662,164,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Maintaining a fleet of buses to transport students to school is a major expense for school districts. An efficient bus routing system can greatly reduce the time and cost associated with transportation, while also ensuring the safety and comfort of students. The School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP) is a comprehensive real-world problem that has been studied over decades while the neural combinatorial optimization technique is only developed and caught researchers’ attention in recent years. Optimization on large-scale SBRP instances is challenging due to the huge number of variables and constraints involved. In this paper, we integrate the school bell time decisions with bus scheduling decisions in a multi-criteria optimization model under single load assumption for both heterogeneous and homogeneous bus fleet scenarios. A Tabu Search heuristic, incorporating a deep neural network that is trained through reinforcement learning, is designed to deal with large-scale bell time and bus scheduling optimization. Numerical experiments show that our solution approach outperformed existing heuristics and a state-of-the-art commercial solver with respect to solution quality for a given execution time. The tests on real-world cases demonstrate that adjusting the school bell time in school districts can result in an improvement in terms of deadhead travel distances from 15% to 55% (average 20%–30%), depending on the original bell time allocation, and the proposed bell time policy.",0968-090X,Not found
Deep causal inference for understanding the impact of meteorological variations on traffic,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104744,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Understanding the causal impact of meteorological variations on traffic conditions (e.g., traffic flow and speed) is crucial for effective traffic prediction and management, as well as the mitigation of adverse weather effects on traffic. However, many existing studies focused on establishing associations between meteorological situations and traffic, rather than delving into causal relationships, especially with deep learning techniques. Consequently, the ability to identify specific meteorological conditions that significantly contribute to traffic congestion or delays is still limited. To address this issue, this study proposes the Meteorological-Traffic Causal Inference Variational Auto-Encoder Model (MT-CIVAE) to estimate the causal impact of fine-grained meteorological variations (e.g., rain and temperature) on traffic. Specifically, MT-CIVAE is based on the Variational Auto-Encoder and consists of an encoder to recover the distribution of latent confounders and a decoder to estimate the conditional probabilities of treatments. Transformer encoder layers are incorporated to analyze the spatial and temporal correlations of historical traffic data to further enhance the inference capability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for causal inference, real-world traffic flow and speed datasets collected from California, along with corresponding fine-grained meteorological datasets, are employed. The counterfactual analysis is conducted using artificially generated meteorological conditions as treatments, which allows for the simulation of hypothetical meteorological scenarios and the evaluation of their potential impact on traffic conditions. This study develops deep learning methods for assessing the causal impact of meteorological variations on traffic dynamics, offering explanations and insights that can assist transportation institutions in guiding post-meteorology traffic management strategies.",0968-090X,Not found

Tracking the source of congestion based on a probabilistic Sensor Flow Assignment Model,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104736,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Tracking the source of congestion, namely where the congested traffic flow comes from and goes to, is a key prerequisite to understanding the causes of traffic congestion and facilitates more efficient strategies. In this paper, we track the congestion source by estimating the path flow passing through the congested link. A probabilistic sensor flow assignment model is first developed to infer the whereabouts of each vehicle converging into the congestion. Unlike classical path flow estimation methods, we view path flow as the assigned results of sensor flows rather than OD flows. With this new perspective, an assigned rule, which incorporates route choice preference of drivers and spatial–temporal constraint of vehicular trajectory, is constructed to output more realistic assignments. Moreover, as this model finds most possible destination-path combinations rather than partial paths as assigned results, the complete trip of tracking vehicles, including both driving paths and ODs, can be reconstructed. With the reconstructed trips, disaggregated and hybrid path flow estimation methods are developed to track the source of traffic congestion on the bottleneck link. The open-source pNEUMA dataset is employed to test the proposed and benchmark methods. It demonstrates that our methods can produce a more realistic traffic pattern for congestion tracking. Significant improvements in estimation accuracy have been achieved with the use of sensor flow assignment model. The proposed disaggregated method has also been tested with a city-scale road network. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is more robust to the uncertainty caused by possible destinations than benchmark.",0968-090X,Not found
Training benefits driver behaviour while using automation with an attention monitoring system,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104752,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Attention, or more generally, driver monitoring systems have been identified as a necessity to address overreliance on driving automation. However, research suggests that monitoring systems may not be sufficient to support safe use of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), also evidenced by a recent major recall of Tesla’s monitoring software. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether different training approaches improve driver behaviour while using ADAS with an attention monitoring system. A driving simulator study was conducted with three between-subject groups: no training, limitation-focused training (highlighted situations where ADAS would not work), and responsibility-focused training (highlighted the driver’s role/responsibility while using ADAS). All participants (N = 47) experienced eight events which required the ego-vehicle to slow down to avoid a collision. Anticipatory cues in the environment indicated the potential for the upcoming events. Event type (covered in training vs. not covered) and event criticality (action-necessary vs. action-not-necessary) were within-subject factors. The responsibility-focused group made fewer long glances (≥ 3 s) to a secondary task than the no training and limitation-focused groups when there were no anticipatory cues. Responsibility-focused training and no training were associated with faster takeover time at the events than limitation-focused training. There were additional benefits of responsibility-focused training for events that were covered in training (e.g., higher percent of time looking at the anticipatory cues). Overall, our results suggest that even if attention monitoring systems are implemented, there may be benefits to driver ADAS training. Responsibility-focused training may be preferable to limitation-focused training, especially for situations where minimizing training length is advantageous.",0968-090X,Not found
A districting problem with data reliability constraints for equity analysis,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104759,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"While data plays an important role in transportation research, sampled data is not always reliable. Data reliability issue is significant especially for minority groups. In this study, a districting approach is proposed which improves data reliability through aggregation of basic spatial units (BSU), adapted from a max-p-regions problem. The model generates as many aggregated zones as possible that minimize intrazonal heterogeneity while minimizing data margin of error (MOE) of all aggregated zones using a controlling MOE threshold. The problem is first formulated as an integer programming which selects optimal set of zones from a pre-generated set of candidate zones. The difficulty of solving the formulation lies in the generation of the candidate set, so a heuristic solution algorithm is proposed. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the method and validate its performance by evaluating the resulting data quality in an example subsequent planning model. First is an area in Downtown Manhattan with 62 census tracts, comparing the aggregated zones with Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) and Taxi Zones. Second is the generation of the New York City Equitable Zoning (NYCEZ), which generated 574 Equitable Zones that reduce the average MOE% of demographic data by 48% for seniors, 75% for low-income population, and 46% for long commuters, all with a district number that is higher than NTAs (221) and Taxi Zones (263). NYCEZ and census tracts are then compared in a subsequent model, synthetic population generation, showing an improvement of 6.2% in standard deviation across simulated populations under the proposed zone design. NYCEZ showed smaller variation in the generated population data. The algorithm can help the decision making of public agencies and the service design of mobility providers by producing reliable and equitable data. The algorithm can also be applied to data-sharing between mobility providers and agencies to alleviate privacy concerns.",0968-090X,Not found

Predicting hurricane evacuation behavior synthesizing data from travel surveys and social media,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104753,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Evacuation behavior models estimated using post-disaster surveys are not adequate to predict real-time dynamic population response as a hurricane unfolds. With the emergence of ubiquitous technology and devices in recent times, social media data with its higher spatio-temporal coverage has become a potential alternative for understanding evacuation behaviour during hurricanes. However, these data are often associated with selection bias and population representativeness issues. To that extent, the current study proposes a novel data fusion algorithm to combine heterogeneous data sources from transportation systems and social media, in a unified framework to understand and predict real-time population response during hurricanes. Specifically, Twitter data of 2300 users are collected for evacuation response during Hurricane Irma and augmented behaviourally (probabilistically) with a representative National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data, thus creating a hybrid dataset to improve the representativeness as well as provide a rich set of explanatory variables for understanding the evacuation behavior. The fusion process is conducted using a probabilistic matching method based on a set of common attributes across NHTS and Twitter. The fused dataset is employed to estimate the evacuation model and a comparison exercise is conducted to evaluate the performance of the model via fusion. The model fitness measures clearly demonstrate the improvement in data fit for the evacuation model through the proposed fusion algorithm. Further, we conduct a prediction assessment to illustrate the applicability of the proposed fusion technique and the results clearly highlight the improvement in the evacuation prediction rate achieved through the fused models. The proposed data-driven methods will enhance our ability to predict time-dependent evacuation demand for better hurricane response operations such as targeted warning dissemination and improved evacuation traffic management, allowing emergency plans to be more adaptive.",0968-090X,Not found
Theory-data dual driven car following model in traffic flow mixed of AVs and HDVs,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104747,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"To model the car following (CF) behavior of mixed traffic flow composed of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driving vehicles (HDVs) in the future, this paper calibrated the lower control algorithm of AVs and proposed a model named theory-data dual driven stochastically generative adversarial networks (TDS-GAN) to describe the CF behavior of HDVs based on experimental data from mixed traffic flow. Firstly, the experimental scenario and collected data were introduced. Secondly, two transfer functions for the lower control algorithm of AVs were compared. Then, to account for the stochasticity of HDVs, the idea of physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) was used to improve generative adversarial networks (GAN) and integrate it with two-dimensional intelligent driver model (2D-IDM). Finally, the effectiveness of the model was verified from both a micro prediction and a macro simulation perspective. The influence of AVs on the stability of mixed traffic flow at different Market Penetration Rate (MPR) was also observed. The results show that TDS-GAN can effectively describe the following behavior and stochasticity of HDVs. When combined with CF model of AVs, it can depict the evolution of mixed traffic flow more accurately. Additionally, AVs can improve traffic flow stability under different penetration rates, and the effect is more significant with higher MPR.

Noise-aware and equitable urban air traffic management: An optimization approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104740,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Urban air mobility (UAM), a transformative concept for the transport of passengers and cargo, faces several integration challenges in complex urban environments. Community acceptance of aircraft noise is among the most noticeable of these challenges when launching or scaling up a UAM system. Properly managing community noise is fundamental to establishing a UAM system that is environmentally and socially sustainable. In this work, we develop a holistic and equitable approach to manage UAM air traffic and its community noise impact in urban environments. The proposed approach is a hybrid approach that considers a mix of different noise mitigation strategies, including limiting the number of operations, cruising at higher altitudes, and ambient noise masking. We tackle the problem through the lens of network system control and formulate a multi-objective optimization model for managing traffic flow in a multi-layer UAM network while concurrently pursuing demand fulfillment, noise control, and energy saving. Further, we use a social welfare function in the optimization model as the basis for the efficiency-fairness trade-off in both demand fulfillment and noise control.

Hi-SCL: Fighting long-tailed challenges in trajectory prediction with hierarchical wave-semantic contrastive learning,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104735,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is a pivotal aspect in achieving collision-free driving for autonomous vehicles. Although the overall accuracy of existing prediction methods appears promising, most of them overlook the long-tailed challenge in trajectory prediction. They tend to excuse or overlook the disastrous performance in rare yet safety-critical tail events. This paper puts forward a novel framework called hierarchical wave-semantic contrastive learning (Hi-SCL), which attempts to fight the long-tailed challenge in the trajectory prediction task. Our approach innovatively represents each traffic scene as “waves”, and implicitly models traffic multi-stream interactions through wave superposition at both local and global levels. This pioneering incorporation of the wave concept enhances the in-depth comprehension of the traffic scene. On this basis, we introduce the feature hierarchical reshaping method, empowering our network to cope with formidable infrequent cases effectively. This module maintains a collection of feature-enhanced hierarchical prototypes, dynamically steering trajectory samples closer or pushing them farther away in an unsupervised learning setup. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate Hi-SCL’s robust overall prediction performance and its effectiveness in addressing long-tailed challenges. Compared to several baseline models, Hi-SCL demonstrates remarkable improvements in general predictive accuracy, with long-term prediction error reductions ranging from 14% to 54% for minADE and 27% to 79% for minFDE. The outcomes of long-tailed experiments further underscore the capacity of Hi-SCL, offering accuracy gains ranging from 2% to 17% in tailed samples. The thorough empirical analyses confirm Hi-SCL’s exceptional capability of wave-semantic representation learning and its effectiveness in reshaping the feature space via hierarchical contrastive learning mechanisms. The proposed new paradigm paves the way for substantial advancements in trajectory prediction, especially in overcoming long-tailed issues, bringing us closer to realizing safer autonomous driving systems.",0968-090X,Not found
Connected automated vehicles orchestrating human-driven vehicles: Optimizing traffic speed and density in urban networks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104741,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have untapped potential to regulate mixed traffic by orchestrating the movement of human-driven vehicles (HVs) at intersections. This research introduces a new controller role for CAVs as regulators of mixed traffic in connected environments. Coordinating the movement of HVs by synchronizing the speed and alignment of CAVs acting as platoon leaders at intersections is a stochastic process with state transition probabilities that vary with traffic speed and vehicular density at the network level. We tackle the problem of regulating mixed traffic at intersections at a macroscopic scale and develop a stochastic model to enhance the operation of mixed traffic consisting of HVs and CAVs by optimizing traffic speed and vehicular density at the network level. Traffic speed and vehicular density are interdependent and vary together at the network level. Therefore, we employ the concept of the network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) to optimize vehicular density by adjusting the spacing between vehicle platoons, led by CAVs, to maximize intersection capacity and network flow at a larger scale. The proposed model is premised on a first-in-first-out reservation-based approach developed for coordinating the movement of vehicle platoons across multiple lanes moving together in cohorts, led by CAVs, at intersections. We account for the randomness in the size, alignment, and arrival time of platoons at intersections in heterogeneous traffic conditions and develop a Markovian approach to capture the stochasticity in modeling the coordination process at intersections. We capture the interrelationship between traffic speed, vehicular density, and inter-cohort spacing at the network level and estimate the upper bound of the flow as a function of density under different CAV penetration rate scenarios. Our numerical results show that optimizing traffic speed and density by adjusting the average spacing between platoons led by CAVs, when the CAV penetration rate in mixed traffic is as low as 20%, can increase the network flow up to 54% of the maximum capacity achievable under uniform CAV traffic conditions.",0968-090X,Not found
Fusion of multi-resolution data for estimating speed-density relationships,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104742,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Estimating traffic flow models, such as speed-density relationships, using data from multiple sources with different temporal resolutions is a prevalent challenge encountered in real-world scenarios. The resolution incompatibility is often intuitively addressed by averaging the high-resolution (HR) data to synchronize with the low-resolution (LR) data. This paper shows that ignoring the variability of HR data within the LR interval during the averaging process could lead to systematic data point distortions, resulting in biased model estimations. The average absolute biases of models estimated from the average data increase with the lost variability of HR data within the LR intervals. Subsequently, it proves that for any given complete average data dataset, there must exist an optimal dataset that minimizes the average absolute bias in model estimations introduced by the averaging process. A novel procedure for determining the practical optimal dataset is proposed. To test the proposed method, real-world HR data from four sites in Hong Kong and Nanjing, China were collected to mimic situations with multi-resolution data. Results demonstrated that the proposed method can significantly reduce the average absolute biases of models estimated from the determined practical optimal dataset, as compared to models estimated from the complete average dataset.",0968-090X,Not found

Competition of ride-hailing platforms in the era of autonomous vehicles: Heavy or light asset?,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104732,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Business modes of ride-hailing services in the era of autonomous vehicles (AVs) could be vastly different from those of current human vehicles (HVs). In addition to the asset-heavy mode, wherein platforms both operate and have ownership of the AV assets, a new business mode known as the asset-light mode is emerging. The asset-light mode involves AV crowdsourcing, where private AV owners rent out their vehicles to platforms (Wang et al., 2021). This paper establishes a game-theoretical framework to model the competition between an asset-heavy platform and an asset-light platform. We first examine the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium between the two AV ride-hailing services, considering that only the asset-light platform can crowdsource AVs, and then extend the model to allow both platforms to crowdsource AVs. Our analyses demonstrate that, in scenarios with insufficient AV supply, once the number of private AVs exceeds a small threshold, at least one of the platforms will crowdsource AVs, even though they cannot derive economic benefits. As the private AV market grows, the asset-light platform becomes more profitable. We then use numerical results to study the impact of price regulations on market participants and find that when urban planners aim to enhance social surplus, it is best not to regulate maximum trip fare, minimum rental payment, or maximum rental payment. These insights offer guidance for AV ride-hailing service providers and government regulators in the future era of AV commercialization.",0968-090X,Not found
Navigating the non-compliance effects on system optimal route guidance using reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104721,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"We consider a scenario where the transportation management center (TMC) guides future autonomous vehicles (AVs) toward optimal routes, aiming to bring the network in line with the system optimal (SO) principle. However, achieving this requires a joint decision-making process, while users may be non-compliant with the TMC’s route guidance for personal gain. This paper models a future transportation network with a microscopic simulation, to introduce a novel concept of mixed equilibrium. In this framework, AVs follow the TMC’s SO route guidance, while users can dynamically choose to either comply or manually override this autonomy based on their own judgment. We initially model a fully compliant scenario, where the centralized Q-network, analogous to a TMC, is trained using reinforcement learning (RL) to minimize total system travel time (TSTT), providing optimal routes to users. Subsequently, we extend the problem setting to a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenario, where users can comply or deviate from the TMC’s guidance based on their own decision-making. Through neural fictitious self-play (NFSP), we employ a modulating hyperparameter to investigate the impact of varying degrees of non-compliance on the overall system. Results indicate that our RL approach holds significant potential for addressing the dynamic system optimal assignment problem. Remarkably, the TMC’s route guidance retains the essence of SO while integrating some level of non-compliance. However, we also demonstrate that dominant user-centric decision-making may lead to system inefficiencies while creating disparities among users.

An efficient ranking-based data-driven model for ship inspection optimization,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104731,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Maritime safety and environmental protection are fundamental considerations within the shipping industry. In this context, port state control (PSC) inspection is globally implemented by port authorities as a mechanism to enforce both maritime safety standards and environmental regulations. This study proposes an innovative optimization framework based on machine learning (ML) and operations research models for high-risk vessel selection, aiming to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of PSC inspection. The essence of the optimization framework is to accurately rank all ships with respect to their risk levels predicted by ML models. The loss functions of the tailored ML models follow a “smart predict then optimize” (SPO) criterion named cumulative detected deficiency number (CDDN), which is motivated by the characteristics of the decision problem. This inventive measurement transforms the assessment of ranking accuracy to the area of the segmented histogram of the recognized deficiency number, which bypasses the computationally intensive training step of rankings and is easy to compute. Following this, three types of decision tree (DT) models are developed, which differ from each other in the varying integration levels of CDDN. Particularly, we rigorously prove that one integration method yields a tree structure identical to that of traditional DT models. The proposed models are validated and compared with the traditional DT model on different scales of instances from real inspection records at the Hong Kong port. The experiment results indicate that our tailored DT models improve the ship selection efficiency significantly when the decision is complex, i.e., when we need to optimize the selection of a small number of ships for inspection from a large number of foreign visiting ships.

By utilizing aircraft performance-related states, the success rate increases by an average of 49.64%, with a corresponding average fuel consumption decrease of 4.42%. Additionally, employing a separate critic network training structure results in an average success rate increase of 16.10%, with an average fuel reduction of 1.09%.

Origin–destination matrix estimation for public transport: A multi-modal weighted graph approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104694,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Estimating the large-scale Origin–Destination (OD) matrices for multi-modal public transport (PT) in different cities can vary largely based on the network itself, what modes exist, and what traffic data is available. In this study, to overcome the issue of traffic data unavailability and effectively estimate the demand matrix, we employ several data sets like the total boarding and alighting, smart card as well as the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) in order to capture the PT dynamic patronage patterns. First, we propose a new method to model the dynamic large-scale stop-by-stop OD matrix for PT networks by developing a new enhancement of the Gravity Model via graph theory and Shannon’s entropy. Second, we introduce a method entitled “Entropy-weighted Ensemble Cost Features” that incorporates diverse sources of costs extracted from traffic states and the topological information in the network, scaled appropriately. Last, we compare the efficiency of a single travel cost versus various combinations of travel costs when using traditional methods like the Traverse Searching and the Hyman’s method, alongside our proposed “Entropy-weighted” method; we demonstrate the advantages of using topological features as travel costs and prove that our method, coupled with multi-modal PT OD matrix modelling, is superior to traditional methods in improving estimation accuracy, as evidenced by lower MAE, MAPE and RMSE, and reducing computing time.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated real-time signal control and routing optimization: A two-stage rolling horizon framework with decentralized solution,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104734,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This paper presents an integrated framework for optimizing signal control and vehicle routing. An important feature of the proposed framework is the ability to simultaneously determine signal states and individual vehicle routes in real time. The general objective is to minimize the network travel time, which can be represented as a trade-off between the total route length of all vehicles and traffic conditions at signalized intersections. A two-stage rolling horizon framework is proposed to explicitly describe the relationship between individual vehicle routes and predicted traffic flow dynamics at signalized intersections. The first stage involves a signal optimization problem, while the second stage optimizes a joint signal control and vehicle routing problem. Both stages are formulated as mixed integer linear programming problems. The optimization procedure is decentralized, and the effects of vehicle routing on control performance is considered by incorporating the route length cost into the objective function. Simulation experiments validate the advantages of the proposed framework over advanced signal control strategies and dynamic user-optimal routing strategies in various scenarios. The effectiveness in improving network capacity, alleviating spillback, and decreasing congestion dissipation time under over-saturation conditions is discussed. The results of vehicle routing suggest that the total travel time can be reduced at a low rerouting cost.

Gaining insights into the nuances of this transmission mechanism can pave the way for more strategic and effective interventions. While previous studies have delved into the subject, an integrated spatial and temporal modeling framework, specifically tailored to distinct phases of COVID-19 and its variants, has yet to be fully explored. This research aims to address this gap by exploring the spatial and temporal impacts of the air transport network on the spread of COVID-19 and its Omicron variant. We introduce an improved effective distance metric to assess the spatial correlation between various distance metrics and the onset of infectious diseases in selected nations. Subsequently, we employ a network-based heterogeneous susceptible-unreported infectious-confirmed-recovered-death (SUCRD) mathematical model to delineate the temporal evolution of infections by country. Our findings underscore the air transport network’s instrumental role in the pandemic’s spatial dynamics. Moreover, our model has been validated, demonstrating robustness and reliability. Through rigorous validation and simulation experiments, we discern the significance of the timing and intensity of interventions in shaping the pandemic’s trajectory. Notably, while the air transport network exerts a profound influence during the phases of both COVID-19 and Omicron, international travel restrictions exhibit diminishing returns once the disease achieves widespread prevalence. Through comparative analysis and discussion, we highlight the advantages of our experimental outcomes and methodological approach compared to previous studies.

Modelling level 1 situation awareness in driving: A cognitive architecture approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104737,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The goal of this research is to computationally model and simulate the situation awareness (SA) of drivers. A computational model in a cognitive architecture was developed that can interact with a driving simulator to infer quantitative predictions of drivers’ SA. The model uses the Queueing Network Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (QN-ACTR) framework as a foundation and integrates a dynamic visual sampling model (SEEV) to create QN-ACTR-SA, which simulates attention allocation patterns of human drivers at SA Level 1 (i.e., perception of critical elements). QN-ACTR-SA also incorporates a driver model that can interact with a driving simulator. A validation study was conducted to determine whether Level 1 SA results produced with the QN-ACTR-SA model correspond to empirical data collected from human drivers (14 participants) for the same tasks.

A comparative assessment demonstrated that QN-ACTR-SA could reasonably simulate drivers’ Level 1 SA for two driving conditions: easy (with few vehicles and signboards) and complex (with dense traffic and signboards). QN-ACTR-SA fit for human SAGAT scores (possible range 0–100) resulted in a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 5.0% and the root means square error (RMSE) of 3.5.

Competition between autonomous and traditional ride-hailing platforms: Market equilibrium and technology transfer,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104728,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Autonomous ride-hailing platforms, such as Waymo and Cruise, are quickly expanding their services, but their interactions with the existing ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, are rarely discussed. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on the competition between an emerging autonomous ride-hailing platform and a traditional ride-hailing platform by characterizing the equilibrium of their competition and the impact of technology transfer. In particular, we consider an autonomous ride-hailing platform that owns the AV technology and offers ride-hailing services to passengers through a fleet of AVs. In the meanwhile, it competes with a traditional ride-hailing platform that primarily relies on a fleet of human-driver vehicles (HDVs) but may rent a sub-fleet of AVs from the autonomous ride-hailing platform to complement the human-driver fleet (referred to as AV technology transfer). A game-theoretic model is formulated to characterize the competition between the autonomous ride-hailing platform and the traditional ride-hailing platform over a transportation network, encapsulating the passengers’ mode choices, the drivers’ job options, the network traffic flows and the strategic decisions of the platforms. An algorithm is proposed to compute the approximate Nash equilibrium of the game and conduct an ex-post evaluation on the performance of the obtained solutions. The proposed framework and solution algorithm are validated through a realistic case study for Manhattan. Based on numerical simulations, we find that technology transfer of AVs between the two platforms can lead to a win-win situation where both two platforms get a higher profit, but this comes at the cost of reduced surpluses for human drivers and passengers. In the simulation, a critical trade-off is revealed for the autonomous ride-hailing platform: it strategically forfeits some of its market share in ride-hailing services to encourage the traditional ride-hailing platform to rent more AVs, thereby increasing its rental revenue and consequently, the overall profit. Furthermore, we also find it intriguing that as AV technology improves and operational costs decrease, the traditional ride-hailing platform cannot enjoy any benefit in its profit although it has the option of leasing AVs from the autonomous ride-hailing platform at lower operational costs. Instead, it is compelled to rent a larger fleet of AVs from the autonomous ride-hailing platform at a higher rental price, consequently suffering a reduced profit. Conversely, the autonomous ride-hailing platform significantly benefits from the reduced AV operational cost by capturing a larger market share in the ride-hailing market and earning higher revenue from the AV technology transfer.",0968-090X,Not found

Existing studies exploring battery electric vehicle (BEV) charging behaviour are typically based on either non-representative samples or stated choices experiments. This paper analyses observational data from a representative sample of German BEV owners who provided information on mileage and charging activities over a timeframe of eight weeks. BEV charging patterns, related vehicles kilometres travelled (VKT) and battery charging behaviour are assessed via a multifaceted empirical framework that pairs a hazard survival-based model with a log linear regression approach. A latent class method is also employed to segment BEV owners into different charging segments. The model suggests two types of charging behaviour exist, consisting of regular and irregular chargers. Charging frequencies and patterns are found to be radically different between the two groups under study, with regular chargers estimated to charge their vehicles 1.5 times more than irregular chargers. Lastly, the framework proposed is used to explore how charging behaviour will mutate due to both technology advancements (BEV driving range improvements) and user-centric factors (VKT variations). Neither technological or user factors are predicted to substantially affect the inter-charging duration of irregular chargers, whereas both increasing BEV driving ranges and reducing VKT results in a longer elapsed time between two consecutive charges for regular chargers.",0968-090X,Not found

Based upon which, Proactive Traffic Safety Management (PTSM) systems have been developed and implemented. The current crash risk evaluation models relied on high dense traffic detectors, which limited the applications of PTSM to infrastructures with enough sensing devices. To address such application limitation issue, this study employed the widespread abnormal driving event information that is generated by emerging driving monitoring and vehicle connection techniques to develop the crash risk evaluation model. Specifically, to characterize abnormal driving events, a six-tuple embedding method was proposed to store their space, time and kinetics features. Given their irregular and discrete distributions on roadways, a Transformer model with self-attention mechanism was proposed to extract the spatial distribution characteristics. In addition, a time-decay function was integrated to fit the temporal impacts of abnormal driving events on crash risk. Empirical data from a freeway in China were utilized for the analyses. The results showed that abnormal driving events with lower speed, larger acceleration and duration are more likely to cause crashes. The accumulation of multiple events in the time period of less than 3 min would lead to a sharp increase of crash risk. Besides, compared to the average metrics of the widely adopted Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), XGBoost, and logistic regression models, the proposed model achieved higher accuracy (0.841) and AUC (0.777), with average improvement of 2.5 % and 9.1 % respectively.",0968-090X,Not found

It is critical to explicitly model the two-dimensional driving behaviours and capture the interactions among vehicles. However, little effort has been made to develop microscopic traffic simulation models at unsignalised intersections, which can generate realistic vehicle trajectories. To fill this gap, this study aims to develop a two-dimensional data-driven simulation model at an unsignalised intersection based on multi-agent imitation learning for generating realistic trajectories of vehicles crossing the intersection and macroscopic traffic characteristics. We propose a multi-agent adversarial inverse reinforcement learning model with four policies (MA-AIRL-4) to separately learn the driving behaviours with different directions (East-bound, West-bound, South-bound, and North–bound) by capturing the interactions between the vehicles.

Motivated by the critical need for supply and demand management in the on-demand food delivery market, we focus on the optimization of customer service area and driver dispatch area for on-demand food delivery services. Specifically, for each restaurant, the platform needs to decide the (1) customer service area (CSA), i.e., the surrounding area within which customers can see the restaurant’s information and order food from it; and (2) driver dispatch area (DDA), i.e., the surrounding area within which drivers can see the restaurant’s information and deliver orders from it.

The CMPLC strategy involves two lane change steps and a gap widening step. Initially, a safety criterion for lane changes is proposed, integrating the merits of the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and the Gipps model, to constrain the gaps that the CAVs in the platoon can safely move into. Guided by this criterion, the strategy identifies the largest gap in the GPL near the platoon as the target gap in the first step. A subset of CAVs in the platoon performs rapid lane changes into the target gap, avoiding collision with HDVs. The following gap widening step employs a trajectory planning model based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) to widen two gaps in the GPL while considering the uncertain behavior of HDVs. Simultaneously, guided by another two trajectory planning models, the remaining CAVs in the DL sequentially move into their target gaps during the second lane change step. To validate the proposed strategy, a visual simulation platform integrating SUMO and MATLAB was developed. Numerical experiments were conducted on a two-lane highway featuring a DL on the inner side and a GPL on the outer side. The experimental results show that the proposed CMPLC strategy can always achieve higher lane change success rate and shorter execution time compared to the Individual Vehicle Lane Change (IVLC) strategy, under various settings of traffic demand, platoon size, and starting location.

Existing cooperative merging strategies typically focus on determining the merging sequence of vehicles in specific merging areas, overlooking the influence of the macroscopic traffic flow conditions on the merging process. In this paper, we innovatively introduce the Dynamic Cooperative Merging Assistance (DCoMA) strategy, a traffic management approach designed to enhance merging operations under variable traffic demands. At the macroscopic level, DCoMA employs the fundamental diagram of traffic flow to develop a platoon formation algorithm for mainline vehicles, tailored to the dynamic macroscopic states of traffic. The algorithm adaptively adjusts the size of platoons based on the volumes of both the mainline and the on-ramp. Subsequently, the spatio-temporal dynamics of these platoons function as the ’red phase’ of traffic signals, with the intervals between platoons analogous to the ’green phase’. This information is then converted into a time-series format and transmitted to all vehicles on the on-ramp. At the microscopic level, vehicles on the on-ramp alter their driving strategies in response to this time-series data, ensuring a seamless merging into the mainline flow without causing halting. Through simulations and comparative analysis with three existing strategies (i.e., CoopMA, ALINEA, and X-ALINEAQ), the proposed DCoMA strategy exhibits considerable potential for application across diverse traffic volumes and CAV penetration rates. The results indicate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the efficiency of the mainline and on-ramp, achieving a maximum improvement of 18.32%. More importantly, the DCoMA strategy effectively enlarges merging gaps and, coupled with the speed control capabilities of CAVs, significantly mitigates the risk of accidents and reduces exhaust emissions.",0968-090X,Not found
Urban rail-bus-walk network service integration towards accessibility and heat exposure consideration: Models and column generation solution approaches,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104693,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The evolution of urban transportation systems is increasingly driven by the integration of rail, bus, and walking pathways, forming a cohesive service network. This urban rail-bus-walk service network integration is pivotal in addressing urban challenges and ensuring seamless mobility. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of such integrated systems depends on their accessibility and the willingness of individuals to take them as their primary transportation mode. In the context of climate change, extreme heat events pose an increasing threat to passenger comfort and health, which in turn, affects individuals’ decisions to use public transit. Additionally, walking to transit stops or waiting for transportation becomes more challenging during such extreme heat conditions. This paper tackles the challenge of comprehensively addressing the evolving issues related to public transit accessibility in response to rising temperatures, an area of research that has received limited attention until now. This paper introduced an approach aimed at optimizing the urban rail-bus-walk service network with a focus on both accessibility and heat exposure considerations. By calculating the transportation accessibility level under varying temperature conditions and identifying its vulnerability to high temperatures, this paper presents a methodology to enhance the transit service. Such improvement involves not only adjustments to the integration network but also considering of cooling facilities, such as shaded routes and shelters. Column generation is applied to solve this problem and the optimization result demonstrates improvement of accessibility under the extreme heat condition.",0968-090X,Not found
Competitive pricing for ride-sourcing platforms with MARL,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104697,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"With the advancement of autonomous driving, the competition between shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and the existing human-driven vehicles (HVs) ride-sourcing platforms has emerged as a prominent research area within the fields of transportation and management. Solving the pricing problem, considering the competition between HV and SAV platforms, is critical for the platform’s operation. The competitive pricing problem is hard to solve since it is a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), that is, only the strategies of other platforms (such as price and wage) are observable, while their states are unobservable. It is also a multivariable sequential problem pricing since spatial-temporal pricing varies with region and time. To tackle this complex problem, this paper implements the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to an mesoscopic simulation system. The simulation replicates the intricate dynamics within a competitive environment where SAV and HV platforms coexist. MADDPG effectively resolves the competitive pricing issue using data derived from simulation. The findings indicate that the SAV platform secures greater profits with a smaller fleet, as it eliminates the need to compensate drivers. Meanwhile, for the same reason, even with fewer vehicles, the SAV platform can set lower prices to attract more passengers and thereby generate higher profits. We further evaluate the efficacy of dynamic pricing versus spatial-temporal pricing and discover that spatial-temporal pricing yields greater profits.",0968-090X,Not found
Stochastic programming models for a fleet sizing and appointment scheduling problem with random service and travel times,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104692,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"We propose a new stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model for a home service fleet sizing and appointment scheduling problem (HFASP) with random service and travel times. Specifically, given a set of providers and a set of geographically distributed customers within a service region, our model solves the following problems simultaneously: (i) a fleet sizing problem that determines the number of providers required to serve customers; (ii) an assignment problem that assigns customers to providers; and (iii) a sequencing and scheduling problem that decides the sequence of appointment times of customers assigned to each provider. The objective is to minimize the fixed cost of hiring providers plus the expectation of a weighted sum of customers’ waiting time and providers’ travel time, overtime, and idle time. We compare our proposed model with an extension of an existing model for a closely related problem in the literature, theoretically and empirically. Specifically, we show that our newly proposed model is more compact (i.e., has fewer variables and constraints) and provides a tighter linear programming relaxation. Furthermore, to handle large instances observed in other application domains, we propose two optimization-based heuristics that decompose the HFASP decision process into two steps. The first step involves determining fleet sizing and assignment decisions, and the second constructs a routing plan and a schedule for each provider. We present extensive computational results to show the size and characteristics of HFASP instances that can be solved with our proposed model, demonstrating its computational efficiency over the extension. Results also show that the proposed heuristics can quickly produce high-quality solutions to large instances with an optimality gap not exceeding 5% on tested instances.

Conflict management at urban bus stops through cooperative trajectory planning,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104696,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Conflicts due to frequent bus dwelling and entering/exiting maneuvers at bus stops have significantly undermined the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of the urban bus system. This paper proposes a cooperative trajectory planning strategy in a Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) environment for conflict management between buses and cars at bus stops. A dynamic multi-stage-based model along with solution algorithm is developed to search trajectories that eliminate the conflicts between cars and buses entering and leaving the bus stop in real time. The assessment of the proposed strategy is carried out at both the bus stop and corridor levels within a simulated environment. In-depth trajectory analyses during a typical weaving process at a bus stop reveal that the proposed strategy effectively eliminates bottlenecks and enhances operational performance across multiple approach lanes affected by the bus stop. A thorough evaluation involving multiple cycles of weaving among buses and vehicles at the bus stop reaffirms the strategy’s effectiveness under varying levels of bus occupancies, traffic demand, and bus stop locations. The case study at the corridor level illustrates that the proposed strategy successfully improves operational performance and bus schedule adherence across diverse scenarios, encompassing different roadway link lengths, traffic demands, bus headways and dwelling times, and bus stop locations. It notably excels in enhancing the performance of an urban corridor with longer link distances and near-side located bus stops, particularly under high traffic demand levels and shorter bus dwelling times.",0968-090X,Not found

Initially, we proposed a progressive vehicle projection method based on matching degree, formulated to engender smooth longitudinal accelerations. Building upon this foundation, a virtual risk-based longitudinal planning model named V-RQM was established, furnishing longitudinal accelerations with robust stability and safety to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Results from four diverse simulation experiments corroborate that V-RQM is aptly versatile, suited for conventional one-dimensional car-following environments as well as pre-merging control in heterogeneous traffic flow.

Integrated capacity allocation and timetable coordination for multimodal railway networks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104681,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Modern transportation systems are moving towards shared mobility with diverse demands, and resource aggregation and coordination among different transport modes have become more and more significant. In this study, we investigate the integrated train capacity allocation and timetable coordination for multimodal railway networks to release the congestion of transfer hubs between metro and mainline rail networks. We consider that a part of vehicles can be dynamically allocated to some metro trains to increase their capacity to take more passengers at transfer hubs alighting from mainline rail trains. We formulate this problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, which simultaneously generates the coordinated timetables of both metro and mainline rail trains, as well as the train capacity allocation strategy in the network. The objectives are to minimize the passenger travel time, passenger transfer time at the hubs and the operational costs for rail managers. To tackle computational challenges in real-world instances, we develop an exact branch-and-cut solution algorithm to generate (near-)optimal solutions more efficiently. In our algorithm, we propose five sets of valid inequalities that are dynamically added to the model to strengthen the linear relaxation bounds at each node. We also design a customized branching strategy in the search tree by imposing branching on the key decision variables regarding the train sequences at transfer stations. Real-world case studies based on the operational data of a realistic multimodal railway network in Beijing are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results demonstrate that our branch-and-cut-based approach outperforms commercial solvers regarding solution quality and computational efficiency.

Eco-driving strategies using reinforcement learning for mixed traffic in the vicinity of signalized intersections,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104683,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This study proposes autonomous eco-driving strategies for a traffic environment with limited information available based on three popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for continuous actions, i.e., Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) approaches, to address a serious challenge in the literature. The challenge is, despite the potential of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to diminish traffic interruptions caused by traffic signals on urban streets, for a long period of time, the accurate and immediate exchange of information via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication remains a problem because of the low penetration rate of CAVs and communication quality issues. The available information is assumed to only include signal phase and timing (SPaT) information and traffic states of the leading vehicle, respectively. To optimize the overall driving performance, a trade-off among safety, efficiency, energy, and ride comfort is considered in the reward function. Moreover, a hybrid policy is proposed to take advantage of RL and an analytical car-following model. The strategies enable CAVs to safely, efficiently and comfortably traverse signalized intersections while all the other vehicles are unconnected human-driven vehicles (HVs). Trajectories from the pNEUMA dataset are used to train and test the proposed models. The performance of the proposed models is compared to the naturalistic driving data, the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and an eco-driving method based on rules and optimization (Trigo). Testing results show that DDPG and SAC with the hybrid policy (HybridSAC) have the best overall performance, i.e., better than human drivers in all aspects; better safety, energy and comfort than the Trigo model; similar performance to the IDM but better energy efficiency.

The interplay between teleworking choice and commute distance,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104690,165,2024-08-01,2024,8,"In this study, we model the telework-commute distance decision process as a package choice, and use a latent segmentation approach to recognize that some individuals may choose their telework arrangement first and then choose their commute distance (their residential location), while others may adopt a reverse causal behavioral process. The latent segment modeling methodology combines a multiple discrete–continuous probit model for telework adoption/intensity as the proportion of monthly workdays worked from home, from the office, and from a variable third workplace, with a log-linear regression model for commute distance (the home-to-office distance). The data for our analysis is drawn from a 2022 survey of Texas residents. Results suggest that about 20% of the population are likely “movers”, whose telework choices led to a residential move that changed commute distance, while the other 80% are “stayers”, whose commute distance at their predetermined (to telework) residential location changed telework habits. We further quantify the impact of teleworking on commute distances by computing the expected commute distance for several telework distribution preferences. A shift from 100% in-person work to 100% home-based remote work increases average commute distance by 64.8%, while working from a third workplace for any portion of a month reduces commute lengths relative to only home-based telework. In terms of monthly commute vehicle miles traveled (VMT), working from home for less than 18.6% of the month (about once a week) per worker actually increases overall monthly commute VMT. Monthly commute VMT reductions become tangible only at about 30–40% telework for each worker (about two days of telework per week for full-time workers with 22 workdays per month). In general, between 0 and 40% home-based telework per worker (with the remaining percentage at the office), there is a 10% commute VMT reduction for each 10% increase in home-based telework. In the range of 40% to 80% home-based telework, there is about a 13% commute VMT reduction for every 10% increase in home-based telework.

However, CAV driving strategies have the potential to improve significantly this network safety, particularly in critical maneuvers such as overtaking. This paper proposes an overall safety autonomous driving architecture particularly adapted to overtaking maneuver in a two-lane two-way rural road context. The proposed architecture considers vehicle connectivity to share their ego speeds and positions, enabling a rule-based decision-making process coupled with a Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) to manage the maneuver’s tasks and to ensure the feasibility of the maneuver. A safety-oriented abort task facilitates a return to the starting lane in case of potential collisions improving maneuver reactivity. Additionally, an original driving personalization is proposed through one driving style parameter modifying the trajectory shape and the maneuver initiation. Two low level controllers handle the vehicle control signals for braking, throttle, and steering wheel angle completing the architecture and allowing full autonomous driving. The algorithm is evaluated using a high fidelity simulation environment in different driving situations. The obtained results demonstrate its reliability and consistency in producing safe overtaking maneuvers regardless the generated situation.

XALM efficiently uncovers hidden relationships among input and output variables in ATM simulators, which are usually of interest in policy analysis.

Crowdshipping problem with dynamic compensations and transshipments,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104796,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Rapid urban growth and consequent increase in e-commerce demand make urban logistics a harder task than ever. The growing size of urban delivery operations not only entails operational challenges but also generates several negative externalities, such as increased traffic, pollution, noise, and accidents. This trend creates a pressing need for efficient delivery mechanisms that are more economical and environmentally friendly than existing systems. Crowdshipping, wherein ordinary members of the society partake in delivery operations for a small compensation, is one of the answers that cater to this need and has attracted considerable research interest recently. However, designing compensation mechanisms to prompt efficient participation from the public remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this study, we devise a dynamic compensation scheme for crowdshipping operations in a many-to-many express delivery framework, where the crowdshipper compensations are determined based on spatial and temporal distributions of the delivery demand and continually updated during the service time to leverage the crowd participation as needed. To address the resulting complex network management problem, we derive analytical solutions for compensation optimization and use these results along with effective pruning strategies to build a lookup table to simultaneously determine package routes and compensation offers in real time.

Previous relevant studies mainly focused on public parking spot management without consideration of SPPSs. Additionally, limited attention has been paid to the competitive behavior of parking options between two markets in traffic dynamic analysis in the literature. This paper investigates the parking supply and pricing strategies for a linear urban transportation network with both public and shared private parking spots. Firstly, we derive a user equilibrium in terms of departure time and mode-and-parking choice, with sufficient public parking spot provision. Secondly, we explore how the lack of public parking spots pushes some commuters to rent SPPSs and develop a mixed user equilibrium with an internal balance between SPPSs’ market demand and supply in case of inadequate public parking spots. Then, we further investigate how public parking spot provision and public parking fees affect commuters’ mode choice and departure time choice. Thirdly, we propose three management schemes: optimal public parking fee, optimal public parking spot provision, and joint optimization of public parking fee and public parking spot provision. Numerical results show that setting a proper public parking fee and providing sufficient public parking spot provision can effectively reduce total system cost.

A conditional diffusion model for probabilistic estimation of traffic states at sensor-free locations,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104798,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Transportation administrators and urban planners rely on accurate network-wide traffic state estimation to make well-informed decisions. However, due to insufficient sensor coverage, traffic state estimation at sensor-free locations (TSES) poses significant challenges for downstream network-wide traffic analysis. This is because direct observations are not available at these sensor-free locations. Most existing traffic state estimation (TSE) research focuses on inferring several unknown time points based on observed historical data using deterministic models. In contrast, TSES is to infer the entire unknown traffic time series of a given sensor-free node, thereby presenting high predictive difficulty, as we could not learn any historical traffic patterns locally. In this study, we introduce a novel probabilistic model — the conditional diffusion framework with spatio-temporal estimator (CDSTE) — to tackle the TSES problem. When dealing with TSES, deterministic models can only produce point value estimates, which may substantially deviate from the actual traffic states of sensor-free locations. To mitigate this, the proposed CDSTE integrates the conditional diffusion framework with cutting-edge spatio-temporal networks to extract the underlying dependencies in traffic states between sensor-free and sensor-equipped nodes. This integration enables reliable probabilistic traffic state estimations for sensor-free locations, which can be used to quantify the variability of estimations in TSES to support flexible and robust decision-making processes for traffic management and control. Extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CDSTE for TSES over five widely-used baseline models.",0968-090X,Not found
OCC-MP: A Max-Pressure framework to prioritize transit and high occupancy vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104795,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Max-pressure (MP) is a decentralized adaptive traffic signal control approach that has been shown to maximize throughput for private vehicles. However, MP-based signal control algorithms do not differentiate the movement of transit vehicles from private vehicles or between high and single-occupancy private vehicles. Prioritizing the movement of transit or other high occupancy vehicles (HOVs) is vital to reduce congestion and improve the reliability and efficiency of transit operations. This study proposes OCC-MP: a novel MP-based algorithm that considers both vehicle queues and passenger occupancies in computing the weights of movements. By weighing movements with higher passenger occupancies more heavily, transit and other HOVs are implicitly provided with priority, while accounting for any negative impacts of that priority on single occupancy vehicles. And, unlike rule-based transit signal priority (TSP) strategies, OCC-MP more naturally also accommodates conflicting transit routes at a signalized intersection and facilitates their movement, even in mixed traffic without dedicated lanes. Simulations on a grid network under varying demands and transit configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC-MP at providing TSP while simultaneously reducing the negative impact imparted onto lower occupancy private vehicles. Furthermore, OCC-MP is shown to have a larger stable region for demand compared to rule-based TSP strategies integrated into the MP framework. The performance of OCC-MP is also shown to be robust to errors in passenger occupancy information from transit vehicles and can be applied when passenger occupancies of private vehicles are not available. Finally, OCC-MP can be applied in a partially connected vehicle (CV) environment when a subset of vehicles is able to provide information to the signal controller, outperforming baseline methods at low CV penetration rates.",0968-090X,Not found

Unfortunately, most available car-following models ignore the influence of complex road geographical features, such as curvatures and slopes and thereby lack scalability. To fill these gaps, this study presents a framework for the construction of a geometry-aware car-following model. Under the over-alignment assumption, car-following motion on horizontal curves was simplified into seven internal or adjacent car-following scenarios. Two novel alternative vehicle control modes (centralized and decentralized) for car-following motions on a horizontal route were proposed. The structured features of each scenario, considering both lateral and longitudinal information, were defined mathematically. Open-source data with trajectory records and road surface conditions on highways in Japan were collected and used as empirical data sources. First, we analyzed the theoretical proportion of traffic scenarios that conformed to the traditional car-following model for any horizontal route. Several properties of the car-following scenario proportion were proposed and proved. Both empirical statistics and theoretical estimations showed the existence of real-world sizable car-following scenarios that could not be handled by traditional models.

PCAD quantifies task difficulty using the gap between the current velocity and the safe velocity region in 2D, and accounts for the minimal control effort (braking and/or steering) needed to avoid a potential collision, based on visual looming, behavioural uncertainties of neighbouring vehicles, imprecise control of the subject vehicle, and collision severity. The PCAD model predicts both continuous-time perceived risk and peak perceived risk per event.

How simple behavioural modifications can influence evacuation efficiency of crowds: Part 2.

It is, therefore, important to explore and implement any measures or interventions that could streamline and expedite the evacuation process in such scenarios. This study aims to explore how the modification of individual behaviours can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of crowd evacuations, with a specific focus on the physical aspects of movement. We examine three crucial elements of physical movement: behaviours at bottlenecks, the initiation time of individual movement, and the pace of movement. A series of dedicated experiments, each tailored to one of these behavioural aspects, has been conducted. In these experiments, the behaviour of interest is modified incrementally within the crowd, with increases of 20% at each stage. This methodology allows for a detailed assessment of system efficiency at varying levels of instructed behaviour adoption/injection. The findings reveal that changes in each aspect of physical movement significantly influence overall efficiency. Most notably, the relationship between the uptake and increase in efficiency is nearly linear, and the rate of efficiency increase does not notably diminish with uptake, unlike interventions pertaining decision-making aspects of behaviour. This suggests that behavioural interventions targeting physical aspects of movement will likely yield higher efficiency returns. Moreover, in comparison with a related study focusing on decision-making aspects of evacuation behaviour, this research observes that modifying physical aspects of behaviour is generally more straightforward. The success rates of individuals in implementing physical movement instructions are higher, and the impact on the system is more pronounced than that observed in decision-making modifications. These results provide insights for developing simple, actionable instructions that can be effectively communicated to the public. These instructions can be disseminated as part of training and education programs or even provided on the spot during an evacuation.",0968-090X,Not found
One-step Gibbs sampling for the generation of synthetic households,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104770,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The generation of synthetic households is challenging due to the necessity of maintaining consistency between the two layers of interest: the household itself, and the individuals composing it. Hence, the problem is typically tackled in two steps, first focusing on the individual layer and then on the household layer. The existing two-step simulation method proposes generating the households based on their roles which diminishes the generality of the approach and makes it difficult to reproduce despite its beneficial properties. In this paper, we propose an alternative extension of Gibbs sampling for generating hierarchical datasets such as synthetic households, in order to make simulation more general and reusable. We demonstrate the performance of our method in a case study based on the 2015 Swiss micro-census data and compare it against state-of-the-art approaches. We show the influence of modeling decisions on different performance metrics and how the analyst can easily enforce consistency while avoiding generating illogical households. We show that the algorithm maintains the conditional distributions while satisfying the marginals of all variables simultaneously, all while generating consistent synthetic households.",0968-090X,Not found
How simple behavioural modifications can influence evacuation efficiency of crowds: Part 1. Decision making of individuals,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104763,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Crowded environments are inherently vulnerable to a range of risks, including earthquakes, fires, violent attacks, and terrorism. In such scenarios, every second counts in an evacuation, as it can significantly impact the number of lives saved. This paper introduces a novel approach to optimising crowd evacuation processes, focusing on behavioural modification rather than traditional methods such as mathematical optimisation models or architectural adjustments. We propose that by altering the behaviours of individuals within a crowd, overall system efficiency can be enhanced from within. We explore the effects of imparting simple, easily understandable strategies or instructions to individuals that can improve evacuation efficiency. The current work concentrates on how modifications in individual decision-making—namely, exit-choice and exit-choice-changing behaviour—can influence evacuation dynamics. We present the results of six major evacuation experiments, encompassing nearly 100 experimental scenarios and repetitions, which specifically investigate the effect of influencing exit choice and adaptation in exit-choice behaviour. The investigation revolves around three core questions: (a) the impact of effective strategies (b) the potential consequences of detrimental strategies, indicative of common misconceptions or poor advice, and (c) the influence of varying levels of strategy adoption, examining how system efficiency changes as more individuals embrace either beneficial or harmful strategies. The findings indicate that behavioural modification can substantially influence evacuation efficiency. Interestingly, the negative impact of poor strategies outweighs the benefits of effective ones. With respect to beneficial strategies, a significant increase in efficiency is observed at initial and intermediate levels of strategy adoption/uptake, suggesting that complete compliance is not necessary to enhance overall system performance. The benefit of influencing decision adaptation behaviour is considerably more tangible than influencing exit choice behaviour. These insights establish a novel perspective in evacuation safety. They lay a foundational framework for developing targeted public education and training programs based on empirical evidence. They highlight the importance of awareness and self-regulation among crowds, showcasing their potential to significantly increase both efficiency and safety in evacuation scenarios, potentially saving lives.",0968-090X,Not found
“School near workplace” or “school near home”: Which one is better for the morning commute with both individual and household travelers in Y-shaped networks?,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104793,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Household travelers typically need to coordinate their travel decisions in various aspects, such as destination and trip-timing, resulting in distinctive travel patterns compared to individual travelers. This paper investigates the morning commute problem in a “Y-shaped” network featuring “school near workplace” in consideration of both individual and household travelers and further understands the impact of school locations on the morning commute by comparing it with the “school near home” network. We analytically derive all equilibrium cases in the “school near workplace” network and classify them into three traffic patterns. We analyze the welfare effects of the staggering policy, finding that implementing the staggering policy in the “school near workplace” network can achieve a “win–win” scenario for individuals and household travelers in some equilibrium cases. Also, when the capacity ratio of school-constrained bottleneck to common-constrained bottleneck is below a threshold, which one is better (i.e., “school near workplace” or “school near home”) depends on the free-flow travel costs of the two networks. Locating the school “near workplace” is better than “near home” when the difference in the free-flow related costs for children between the two networks is not very large. Furthermore, we analyze the welfare effects of bottleneck expansion in the “school near workplace” network, finding that bottleneck expansion paradox may emerge when expanding the school-constrained bottleneck. Although properly designing the schedule gap can eliminate the paradox, a significant increase in the schedule gap may be needed to escape from the paradoxical cases when the common-constrained bottleneck capacity is slightly larger than the school-constrained bottleneck capacity. Our study sheds light on the importance of school locations in determining the performance of traffic management policies in the morning commute with both individual and household travelers.",0968-090X,Not found
Deep neural networks for choice analysis: Enhancing behavioral regularity with gradient regularization,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104767,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied in travel demand modeling because of their automatic feature learning, high predictive performance, and economic interpretability. Nevertheless, DNNs frequently present behaviorally irregular patterns, significantly limiting their practical potentials and theoretical validity in travel behavior modeling. This study proposes strong and weak behavioral regularities as novel metrics to evaluate the monotonicity of individual demand functions (known as the “law of demand”), and further designs a constrained optimization framework with six gradient regularizers to enhance DNNs’ behavioral regularity. The empirical benefits of this framework are illustrated by applying these regularizers to travel survey data from Chicago and London, which enables us to examine the trade-off between predictive power and behavioral regularity for large versus small sample scenarios and in-domain versus out-of-domain generalizations. The results demonstrate that, unlike models with strong behavioral foundations such as the multinomial logit, the benchmark DNNs cannot guarantee behavioral regularity. However, after applying gradient regularization, we increase DNNs’ behavioral regularity by around 6 percentage points while retaining their relatively high predictive power. In the small sample scenario, gradient regularization is more effective than in the large sample scenario, simultaneously improving behavioral regularity by about 20 percentage points and log-likelihood by around 1.7%. Compared with the in-domain generalization of DNNs, gradient regularization works more effectively in out-of-domain generalization: it drastically improves the behavioral regularity of poorly performing benchmark DNNs by around 65 percentage points, highlighting the criticality of behavioral regularization for improving model transferability and applications in forecasting. Moreover, the proposed optimization framework is applicable to other neural network–based choice models such as TasteNets. Future studies could use behavioral regularity as a metric along with log-likelihood, prediction accuracy, and F 1 score when evaluating travel demand models, and investigate other methods to further enhance behavioral regularity when adopting complex machine learning models.",0968-090X,Not found
Strategizing sustainability and profitability in electric Mobility-as-a-Service (E-MaaS) ecosystems with carbon incentives: A multi-leader multi-follower game,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104758,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Electric Mobility-as-a-Service (E-MaaS) emerges as a promising solution for environmentally-friendly mobility in the future, yet MaaS operators have been struggling to achieve profitability. We introduce a novel E-MaaS ecosystem where platforms can leverage carbon credits revenue from the government’s emissions reduction fund (ERF) by incentivizing travelers to choose more E-MaaS services, thereby reducing carbon emissions. In such an E-MaaS ecosystem, travelers can select either electric (E)-MaaS or traditional (T)-MaaS services and submit heterogeneous requests, such as distance, service time, tolerance for inconvenience, and travel delay budget, which are modeled as inputs. We propose a multi-leader multi-follower game (MLMFG) model where each leader (MaaS platform) competes to maximize its profits by making operational decisions such as pricing, EV acquisition ratio, and E(T)-MaaS bundle allocation while anticipating travelers’ participation levels. In response to the platforms’ decisions, each follower (traveler) aims to minimize her travel costs by determining the participation levels for E(T)-MaaS services via multiple MaaS platforms. We develop a customized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the proposed MLMFG efficiently. Comprehensive numerical experiments based on real-life data in Australia demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the proposed ADMM algorithm. Further, experimental results reveal how factors such as market size, travel demand, ERF budget, subsidy rate, and unit price boundaries impact the profits and operational strategies of different MaaS platforms. Overall, the proposed MLMFG model for the E-MaaS ecosystem provides valuable insights for MaaS operators aiming to balance profitability with environmental responsibility, navigating a future where sustainability and profitability goals could converge.",0968-090X,Not found
Cooperative adaptable lanes for safer shared space and improved mixed-traffic flow,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104748,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"With the rapid increase in the percentage of the world’s population living in cities, the design of existing transportation infrastructure requires serious consideration. Current road networks, especially in large cities, face acute pressures due to increased demand for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Although much attention has been given to improve traffic management and accommodate the increased demand via coordinating and optimizing traffic signals, research focused on adapting the static allocation of street spaces and right-of-way dynamically based on mixed traffic flow is still scarce. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) agent approach that cooperatively adapts the individual lane widths and right-of-way access permissions based on real-world mixed traffic flow. In particular, multiple cooperative agents are trained with mixed temporal data that learn to decide suitable lane widths for motorized vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, along with whether co-sharing space between pedestrians and cyclists is safe. Using a microscopic traffic simulator model of a four-legged intersection, we trained our RL agent on synthetic data, and tested it on realistic multi-modal traffic data. The proposed approach reduces the overall average waiting time and queue length by 48.9% and 37.7%, respectively, compared to the Static (baseline) street design. Additionally, we observe CALM’s ability to gradually adjust lane widths, contrasting with the Heuristic implementation’s erratic lane adjustments, which pose potential safety concerns. Notably, the model learns to adaptively toggle the co-sharing of street space between cyclists and pedestrians as one co-shared lane, ensuring comfort and maintaining the level of service according to the designer’s policy. Finally, we demonstrate CALM’s scalability on a simulated large-scale traffic network.",0968-090X,Not found
Smoothing-MP: A novel max-pressure signal control considering signal coordination to smooth traffic in urban networks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104760,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Decentralized traffic signal control methods, such as max-pressure (MP) control or back-pressure (BP) control, have gained increasing attention in recent years. MP control, in particular, boasts mathematically-proven network throughput properties, enabling it to optimize network throughput and stabilize vehicle queue lengths whenever possible. Urban traffic volume is dynamic and features a non-uniform distribution throughout the network. Specifically, heavier traffic is often observed along arterial corridors or major origin–destination streams, such as those in central business districts (CBD), while less traffic is found on sub-arterial roads. To address these issues, many existing signal plans incorporate coordinated signal timing. Numerous previous studies have formulated signal coordination optimization as mixed-integer programming problems, with most belonging to centralized traffic signal controller categories. However, centralized approaches do not scale well to larger city networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel max-pressure signal control approach called Smoothing-MP, which considers signal coordination in urban networks to achieve both maximum vehicle stability and reduced travel time and delay along specific urban corridors, without altering the original stable region proposed by Varaiya (2013). This study represents a pioneering effort in modifying max-pressure control to incorporate signal coordination. Crucially, this policy retains the decentralized characteristic of the original max-pressure control, relying exclusively on local information sourced from upstream and downstream intersections. To evaluate the proposed Smoothing-MP control, we executed simulation studies on two different types of networks, the Downtown Austin Network and a Grid Network. The results unequivocally show that Smoothing-MP matches the maximum throughput of the original MP control. Moreover, it significantly reduces both travel time and delay along coordinated corridors. This dual accomplishment underscores the efficacy and potential advantages of the Smoothing-MP control approach.",0968-090X,Not found
Emission trading scheme for emission reduction and equity promotion in multimode networks with heterogeneous users,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104771,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Air pollution caused by high transport-related emissions is already a serious problem, whereas user heterogeneity results in most of the existing emission reduction instruments cannot being applied in practice, despite reducing social inequity. In this paper, we propose an emission trading scheme (ETS) based on a dual-market mechanism in a multimode network with heterogeneous users in value of time (VOT), in order to primarily achieve the objective of emission reduction while taking equity promotion into account. Specifically, emission permits are issued in the primary market and travelers trade permits freely in the secondary market by bearing transaction cost which are assumed to be asymmetrically split between buyers and sellers. The High-Occupancy-Vehicle-based cyclic carbon emission permit (HOV-based CCEP) scheme is applied in the ETS as permit charges to better achieve the objectives. Unlike the previous studies of charging scheme, the compensatory permit rates in our model could be charged from private car (PC) passengers, waived for customized bus (CB) passengers and subsidized for public transit (PT) passengers. The market trading processes considering transaction cost and travel choice behaviors are formulated as a variational inequality problem (VIP). The multimode equilibrium solution of which is obtained by developing a relaxation algorithm with a multi-round iteration strategy. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments based on Braess and Sioux Falls networks to demonstrate the merits of the proposed model and reveal the results that highlight the importance of ETS and multiple public transport modes in the heterogeneous system for emission reduction and equity promotion.",0968-090X,Not found
Towards Self-Organizing connected and autonomous Vehicles: A coalitional game theory approach for cooperative Lane-Changing decisions,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104789,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This research introduces a novel approach to cooperative decision-making among self-organizing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In this approach, a coalitional game is played by a group of players who form alliances of different sizes based on the collective payoff they receive. The players continuously evaluate the potential benefits of different coalition formations and adjust their decisions accordingly. The proposed approach utilizes the V2V communication feature of CAVs, which enables CAVs to participate in a cooperative game, thereby resolving conflicting situations that often arise during lane-changing decisions. By working together within the same coalition, CAVs on a hypothetical three-lane freeway segment can collectively determine their target lanes, rather than engaging in individual decision-making that could result in a win-lose situation. The proposed approach considers up to nine CAVs interacting with each other and aims to find Pareto-optimal coalitions in lane-changing decisions. The approach considers lead CAVs that cooperate via acceleration to enlarge the gap between the subject and lead CAVs. The game is modelled as a dynamic transferable utility problem, allowing the utilities obtained from the coalition agreement to be expressed as real numbers and distributed among coalition members. The framework is generalizable to other traffic and demand management problems while the cooperative CAVs can be compensated for reaching an agreement in a universal, collectible, and tradable credit scheme (UCTCS) that can be used in a wide spectrum of traffic and demand management applications. The effects of the proposed coalitional lane-changing decision-making on traffic efficiency are compared to a non-cooperative decision-making model on a simulated road segment. Overall, our analysis suggests that the proposed coalitional approach can positively impact macroscopic traffic characteristics, leading to potentially improved traffic flow, reduced congestion, and enhanced travel time efficiency.",0968-090X,Not found

To address this issue, this paper investigates the collaborative optimization of train timetables and station-based passenger flow control under stochastic demand, which aims to minimize the total system cost while ensuring an adequate service level to each station. We formulate the research problem as a stochastic mixed-integer programming model with expected travel time cost constraints for each station and translate it into a multi-objective attainability problem by imposing a target on the objective value. We develop an efficient operation policy that determines the timetable and flow control decisions in response to each demand scenario, satisfying the objective and service level targets in the long term when feasible. We conduct extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world transit data to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the benchmark first-come-first-served policy in terms of efficiency and service fairness under both exogenous and endogenous demand distributions. The improvement achieved by our approach is attributed to the prioritization of short trips over long ones, effectively exploiting the reusable nature of train capacity.",0968-090X,Not found
The service network design problem with fleet and emissions management,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104769,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"We propose the Service Network Design Problem with Fleet and Emissions Management (SND-FEM). This problem considers fleet management decisions regarding how many vehicles of each type (diesel, electric, hydrogen) a carrier should acquire as well as in what regions they should operate. The impact of these fleet-level decisions on customer service is captured by explicitly modeling the routing of shipments and vehicles while recognizing the consumption of limited onboard resources (diesel fuel, electrical energy, hydrogen). Thus, the problem also prescribes resource replenishment decisions, with an explicit recognition that the emissions and costs associated with resource replenishment can vary by region. The environmental impact of problem decisions is captured with a detailed accounting of Well-to-Wheel (WtW) emissions based on the framework proposed by the Global Logistics Emissions Council, a methodology that has become the industry standard. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation of the problem and consider two objectives: (i) transportation cost, and (ii) WtW emissions.

Movement behaviour of pedestrians in knife-based terrorist attacks: An experimental approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104790,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Terrorist attacks have become both more frequent and deadlier in recent decades. Knife attacks by terrorists in particular are both high impact and relatively frequent. Understanding how individuals move when confronted by an attacker can save lives by informing the planning of transportation hubs, entertainment venues and other spaces where large numbers of people congregate. Using pedestrian dynamics to predict responses to such attacks has the potential to further improve the survival of those involved by providing insights to emergency service responders when a terrorist situation has occurred in a crowded venue. However, given the lack of appropriate data, it is currently impossible to accurately predict pedestrian movement responses to terrorist attacks. This paper describes a practical study that developed a methodology and implemented a set of experiments examining responses to knife-based attacks by an unexpected and hostile individual. The experiments used financial incentives and an ‘aggressor’ to recreate a knife-based terrorist attack in an ethically viable setting. The participants of this study (n = 80) were tracked using ultra wide-band sensors to provide temporal and spatial positional data in relation to the attacker and to each other. Participants subsequently completed a questionnaire to report their psychological response during the experiment, thus allowing psychological perception and movement responses to be compared. The results show that participants were stressed and reported fear during the experiment, indicating that the experimental approach is a potentially valid proxy for a real-life attack. The analysis highlights that participants’ decisions to stay or run away were strongly influenced by the actions of other nearby participants, while participants’ continuous movement response (movement speed) was highly dependent on relative position to the aggressor. Participant demographics were a factor with female participants less likely to move and slower moving, while older participants were also slower moving. From these results we have been able to construct a model of how pedestrians may react when faced with a sudden attack. We discuss our findings and their potential to contribute to emergency planning and response, finally we comment on opportunities for further study.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimization of train timetabling and rolling stock circulation problem with flexible short-turning and energy-saving strategies,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104756,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"In daily operations, passenger demand for metro lines traversing city centers often exhibits pronounced tidal characteristics, particularly during morning and evening peak hours. Given the unbalanced spatial and temporal distribution of passenger demand in a bi-directional metro line, this paper investigates an integrated optimization method for train timetabling and rolling stock circulation plans with flexible short-turning and energy-saving strategies. In particular, this approach simultaneously considers constraints such as limited train capacity, turnaround operations, the finite number of available trains, and regenerative energy utilization. Firstly, by introducing decisions involving service frequency, service headway, train route selection, rolling stock circulation plan, and the overlap time indicator, a nonlinear integer programming (NLIP) model is formulated to minimize the weighted sum of passenger waiting time and energy costs, accounting for both passenger and operator perspectives. Subsequently, the model is reformulated into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) model which can be solved directly by commercial solvers. To address large-scale real-world experiments, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is developed. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on a simplified metro line and Fuzhou Metro Line 1. The results demonstrate that, compared to the full-length strategy, the proposed method reduces total passenger waiting time and energy costs by approximately 8.7% and 5.7%, respectively.

Safety relevant driver and bicyclist behaviors resulting from bicycling rolling stops observed in a networked driving and bicycling simulator,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104754,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Bicycle Rolling Stop (BRS) laws refer to legislation that allows bicyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs.

Previous research has focused on crash data analysis and motivating factors of bicyclists performing a rolling stop when illegal under prevailing law. However, there is still no available research that evaluates the efficacy of BRS laws or analyzes the effect of BRS in states where it is permitted. To that end, this research used a networked driving and bicycling simulator experiment to evaluate drivers and bicyclists understanding of the BRS law. Sixty participants successfully completed a networked simulator experiment where a “live interaction” occurred at a stop-controlled intersection between a participant in the driving simulator and a participant in the bicycling simulator. Participants encountered 16 scenarios while riding or driving in the simulators. Time-space diagrams demonstrated that after receiving education related to the BRS law, bicyclists preferred to yield at stop signs and had a higher average speed through intersections. Driving participants’ trajectories showed that drivers approached intersections either slower or at a similar speed after education of the BRS law. Live interactions in the networked simulators validated results where bicycling participants interacted with virtually controlled passenger cars.

The issue of incomplete traffic volume observed by the LPCs is addressed with a theoretical derivation of the observability-invariant property: The ratio of traffic volume to the critical value (corresponding to the peak of the MFD) is independent of the (unknown) proportion of those detected vehicles. Conditions for such a property to hold are discussed in theory and verified empirically. This offers a practical way to estimate the ratio-to-critical-value, which is an important indicator of network saturation and efficiency, by simply working with a finite set of LPCs.

Incorporation of energy-consumption optimization into multi-objective and robust port multi-equipment integrated scheduling,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104755,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Port operational efficiency and energy consumption are pivotal, but sometimes contradictory factors influencing its competitiveness. In light of this, the simultaneous optimization of these two objectives within the port integrated scheduling of quay cranes, internal vehicles, and yard cranes, can aid in sustaining port development in the era of digitalization and autonomy. Furthermore, given the persistent fluctuations in uncertain operation time of the cranes and vehicles in port, it becomes imperative to consider the robustness of their scheduling plans collectively. This paper therefore aims to develop a new tri-objective mixed-integer programming model for the first time that enables the incorporation of operational uncertainty and energy efficiency into the context of port operation scheduling consideration. The three objectives are makespan, energy consumption, and scheduling plan robustness, which is represented by anti-cascade and robustness evaluation indices.

This mechanism utilizes a new crowding distance operator based on the cosine distance of objective value vectors to enhance population diversity in the early stages of the algorithm’s iterations. At the later stages, it employs a fuzzy correlation entropy operator to ensure rapid convergence and high-quality solutions. Comparative experiments conducted in scenarios involving emerging technologies such as U-shaped ports and double-cycling operational mode demonstrate the evident improvements achieved by the new model in terms of makespan, energy consumption, and computational efficiency.

A fluid–particle decomposition approach to matching market design for crowdsourced delivery systems,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104738,166,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This paper considers a crowdsourced delivery (CSD) system that effectively utilizes the existing trips to fulfill parcel delivery as a matching problem between CSD drivers and delivery tasks. This matching problem has two major challenges. First, it is a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem that is hard to solve in a reasonable computational time. Second, the evaluation of the objective function for socially optimal matching contains the utility of drivers for performing the tasks, which is generally unobservable private information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hierarchical distribution mechanism of CSD tasks that decomposes the matching problem into the task partition (master problem) and individual task-driver matching within smaller groups of drivers (sub-problems). We incorporate an auction mechanism with truth-telling and efficiency into the sub-problems so that the drivers’ perceived utilities are revealed through their bids. Furthermore, we formulate the master problem as a fluid model based on continuously approximated decision variables. By exploiting the random utility framework, we analytically represent the objective function of the problem using continuous variables, without explicitly knowing the drivers’ utilities. The numerical experiment shows that the proposed approach solved large-scale matching problems at least 100 times faster than a naive LP solver and approximated the original objective value with errors of less than 1%.

Space-Time adaptive network for origin-destination passenger demand prediction,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104842,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Short-term origin–destination passenger demand prediction involves modeling spatial and temporal characteristics of urban traffic, such as periodicity in demand rate and directionality in flow path. Meanwhile, spatial and temporal heterogeneities often lead to constantly evolving dynamics in in passenger demand, e.g., passengers may exhibit different mobility patterns at different periods or in different regions. Many models fail to capture these heterogeneities and adjust parameters adaptively, leading to suboptimal prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel space–time adaptive network (STAN) to address these issues. Spatially, an edge-based backbone with a global receptive field is devised. Edge embeddings directly represent pair-wise relations between regions, preserving more fine-grained information and directional interactions. The backbone adaptively updates edge embeddings by fusing static and dynamic information from origin and destination regions, enabling the model to learn intricate spatial relations from simple input data (i.e., basic relation graphs and historical OD matrices). Temporally, a prompter mechanism is proposed to inject temporal information into model parameters, making them time-dependent. The parameter values exhibit periodicity and continuity for all periods, meanwhile, they can be adjusted for each specific period. It makes the model time-aware and enables it to identify similar periods and differentiate dissimilar ones during training.

A network equilibrium model for integrated shared mobility services with ride-pooling,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104837,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"With the growing popularity of transportation network companies (TNC), there remains a gap in network equilibrium models that adequately address the emergence of ride-pooling service that pools two orders into one trip. This challenge arises from the need to enumerate all possible combinations of origin–destination (OD) pooling and sequencing. This paper proposes a network equilibrium framework that integrates ride-hailing platforms’ decision on vehicle dispatching and driver–passenger matching on congested road networks. To facilitate the representation of vehicle and passenger OD flows and ride-pooling options, a layered OD graph is created encompassing ride-sourcing and ride-pooling services over OD nodes. To capture road congestion, a connection between the layered OD graph and road networks is established where the vehicle flows on the OD graph form source demands on road networks. Numerical examples are performed on a toy example and the Sioux Fall network to demonstrate our model and algorithm. The proposed equilibrium framework can efficiently assist policymakers and urban planners to evaluate the impact of TNCs on traffic congestion.",0968-090X,Not found
Modeling lane changes using parallel learning,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104841,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"This paper introduces an innovative approach to model the lane-change (LC) process of vehicles by employing parallel learning, seamlessly integrating conventional physical or behavioral models with data-driven counterparts. The LC process is divided into two distinct steps: the LC decision and the LC implementation, each independently modeled. For the LC decision model, a utility-based model is embedded into a neural network. Simultaneously, the LC implementation model incorporates a conventional car-following model, replicating the behavior of the new follower of the lane-changer, within the training process of a long-short-term memory model. Empirical trajectory data collected from unmanned aerial vehicles, which provides detailed information on the vehicles’ lane-changing process, serves as the basis for training and testing the proposed models. Additionally, data from a different site is employed to assess model transferability. Results demonstrate that the proposed models adeptly predict both LC decisions and implementations, outperforming baseline physical and behavioral models, as well as pure data-driven models, in terms of prediction accuracy and transferability.

Roadside LiDAR placement for cooperative traffic detection by a novel chance constrained stochastic simulation optimization approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104838,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) plays a pivotal role in localization, thereby meeting the imperative to accurately discern vehicle positions and road states for enhanced services in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). As the cooperative perception among multiple LiDARs is necessitated by localization applications spanning extensive road networks, the strategic placement of LiDARs significantly impacts localization outcomes. This research proposes a chance constrained stochastic simulation-based optimization (SO) model for Roadside LiDAR (RSL) placement to maximize the expected value of mean Average Precision (mAP) subject to a budgeted number of RSLs and a chance constraint of ensuring a specific recall value under traffic uncertainties. Importantly, the assessment of a specific RSL placement plan employs a data-driven deep learning approach based on a high-fidelity co-simulator, which is inherently characterized by black-box nature, high computational costs and stochasticity. To address these challenges, a novel Gaussian Process Regression-based Approximate Knowledge Gradient (GPR-AKG) sampling algorithm is designed. In numerical experiments on a bi-directional eight-lane highway, the RSL placement plan optimized by GPR-AKG attains an impressive mAP of 0.829 while ensuring compliance with the chance constraint, and outperforms empirically designed alternatives. The cooperative vehicle detection and tracking under the optimized plan can effectively address false alarms and missed detections caused by heavy vehicle occlusions, and generate highly complete and smooth vehicle trajectories. Meanwhile, the analyses of detection coverage and average effective work duration validate the reasonability of prioritizing the center-mounted RSLs in the optimized plan. The balance analysis of mAP and the number of deployed RSLs confirms the scientific validity of deploying 20 RSLs in the optimized plan. In conclusion, the GPR-AKG algorithm exhibits promise in resolving chance constrained stochastic SO problems marked by black-box evaluations, high computational costs, high dimensions, stochasticity, and diverse decision variable types, offering potential applicability across various engineering domains.",0968-090X,Not found

Optimal decentralized signal control for platooning in connected vehicle networks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104832,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In the last decade, pressure-based schemes such as Back Pressure and Max Weight algorithms have been widely researched and applied for traffic signal control due to their simplicity and proven throughput maximization. In such algorithms, the next chosen signal phase at an intersection in a road network is the one with the highest measured weight, representing the pressure of traffic movements at the intersection, determined based on a single characteristic of the traffic flow or vehicles’ state at that intersection. This paper develops a new optimal Max Weight control mechanism to enhance the network throughput and reduce vehicle delays in a network using a concept of platooning enabled by Connected Vehicles (CVs). To this end, we propose a new proven optimal Max Weight control scheme where the weight consists of several features including the platoon delay, as well as the speed and position of vehicles within the platoon. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a platoon pressure-based concept considering multiple configurable attributes in formulating the pressure. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous stability proof that ensures the throughput optimality of the proposed control scheme. In addition, we also develop a machine learning procedure in this paper to optimize the weighting parameter of each attribute contributing to the total pressure enabling its seamless deployment in practice.

Herein, we use a concurrent scheduler algorithm to generate an initial feasible solution, which serves as a starting point for our iterated local search algorithm. In the sequential case, we first optimize trip assignments and charging locations. Charging schedules are then determined after fixing the optimal decisions from the first level. The joint model, on the other hand, integrates charge scheduling within the local search procedure. The solution quality of the joint and sequential iterated local search models are compared for multiple real-world bus transit networks.

Decentralized human-like control strategy of mixed-flow multi-vehicle interactions at uncontrolled intersections: A game-theoretic approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104835,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"A critical challenge that future autonomous driving systems face is improving the ability to cope with complex real-world interaction scenarios such as uncontrolled intersections. In the near future, a mixed traffic flow of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will coexist in transport networks, which motivates us to explore the interaction between HDVs and CAVs to improve traffic efficiency and safety. To help CAVs better interact with HDVs and adapt to the mixed-flow environment, we propose a human-like decentralized control strategy for CAVs. First, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to model multi-vehicle interactions (including HDV-CAV, CAV-CAV interactions) in the mixed-flow environment. The existence of solutions is proven to ensure the feasibility of the proposed game-theoretic model. Next, a driving style recognition algorithm is embedded into the proposed model to help CAVs understand and predict human drivers’ actions. The proposed model is calibrated via a real-world dataset and used to simulate traffic in several testing scenarios. Real-world vehicle trajectories are used to verify the accuracy of generated vehicle trajectories in simulations. Experimental results indicate that 1) CAVs can take more reasonable actions to determine whether to yield while ensuring safety when competing for the right of way with HDVs using the proposed method compared with conservative driving strategies, 2) a higher penetration rate of CAVs can significantly enhance travel efficiency and lower collision risk at uncontrolled intersections.",0968-090X,Not found

Distributional equity impacts of automated vehicles: A disaggregated approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104828,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Better understanding of the equity impacts of automated vehicles (AV) is needed to design equitable deployment plans for AV technology. The goal of this study was to develop and demonstrate a modeling framework to support distributional equity assessments of AV systems prior to their wide adoption. This modeling framework takes a disaggregated approach that integrates agent-based simulation, diverse transportation outcomes, and equity analyses. The framework uses individual-level data to capture detailed disparities in transportation outcomes, applies a state-of-the-art multi-agent traffic simulation model (MATSim) to simulate privately-owned and shared AVs simultaneously, and considers distributional equity from multiple perspectives. To test and demonstrate the framework, a case study was conducted for the Tampa Bay region. Five scenarios were considered with different AV market shares and integration strategies based on scenario planning by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration. Results reveal that high AV penetration rates were required for substantial reductions in inequality. The introduction of AVs led to a more even distribution of accessibility, but slightly more uneven distribution of traditional mobility and affordability. Impacts of disparities in outcomes for disadvantaged groups were mixed.

Ensemble methods for route choice,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104803,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Understanding travellers’ route preferences allows for the calculation of traffic flow on network segments and helps in assessing facility requirements, costs, and the impact of network modifications. Most research employs logit-based choice methods to model the route choices of individuals, but machine learning models are gaining increasing interest. However, all of these methods typically rely on a single ‘best’ model for predictions, which may be sensitive to measurement errors in the training data. Moreover, predictions from discarded models might still provide insights into route choices. The ensemble approach combines outcomes from multiple models using various pattern recognition methods, assumptions, and/or data sets to deliver improved predictions. When configured correctly, ensemble models offer greater prediction accuracy and account for uncertainties. To examine the advantages of ensemble techniques, a data set from the I-35 W Bridge Collapse study in 2008, and another from the 2011 Travel Behavior Inventory (TBI), both in Minneapolis–St. Paul (The Twin Cities) are used to train a set of route choice models and combine them with ensemble techniques.

A homogeneous multi-vehicle cooperative group decision-making method in complicated mixed traffic scenarios,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104833,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to reshape the transportation system, and cooperative group intelligence of CAVs has great potential for improving transportation efficiency and safety. One challenge for CAV group driving is the decision-making under scenarios mixed with CAV and human-driven vehicles (HDV). Current studies mainly use methods based on single physical rules such as platoon driving or formation switch control, failing to reach a balanced and homogeneous state of optimal efficiency and risk in mixed traffic environments. In addition, most studies focus only on one specific type of scene, lacking the scene adaptability to various surrounding conditions. This paper proposes a homogeneous multi-vehicle cooperative group decision-making method targeting mixed traffic scenarios. A bi-level framework composed of behavior-level and trajectory-level decision-making is established to achieve balanced optimal cooperation. A region-driven behavioral decision mechanism is designed to decompose vehicle actions into a unified form of sequential target regions. Solutions are derived based on Cooperative Driving Safety Field, a risk assessment module inspired by field energy theory. The trajectory-level decision module takes the target regions as input and generates the control quantities of the CAVs through target point selection, conflict reconciliation, and dynamic constraint consideration. Experimental results on 19 various scenarios and continuous traffic flow scenes indicate that the proposed method significantly increases passing efficiency, reduces driving risk, and improves scene adaptability.

However, this type of infrastructure is not the norm in many cities, particularly in developing countries. This paper extends a previously proposed method to estimate this penetration solely from a series of inter-detection times. The improved method is based on Bayesian inference and supports a series of passage times coming from multilane infrastructure, albeit still requiring an uninterrupted traffic regime. The method was applied to actual RFID interdetection times from a four-lane weaving urban freeway segment in Santiago, Chile. The resulting estimated rates are consistent with those reported by the freeway operator, showing the method’s capabilities.

Predicting transit users’ lifecycle behavior pattern transition is vital for enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of transportation systems. Thus, this study incorporates lifecycle analysis in predicting long-term sequential behavioral pattern transition processes to go beyond just examining user churning at a single point in time. Specifically, this study proposes the TripChain2RecDeepSurv, a novel model that pioneers the individual-level analysis of lifecycle behavior status transitions (LBST) within public transit systems.

We evaluate the framework using a nearly six year dataset from Communauto, Montreal. The first 35 months of data are set as training data, while the subsequent 33 months are used for validation of predictive performance. Results demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts adoption dynamics. Prior experience of SBcs and initial information spread are found to be key parameters for demand prediction determining early adoption peaks and, due to follower effects, also impact long-term demand.

This study uses road test data to examine the possible safety and efficiency impacts of intersection conflict resolution involving AVs. The contribution comprises two main aspects. Firstly. we prepare and open a high-quality lateral conflict resolution dataset derived from the Argoverse-2 data, specifically targeting urban intersections. A rigorous data processing pipeline is applied to extract pertinent scenarios, rectify anomalies, enhance data quality, and annotate conflict regimes. This effort yields 5000+ AV-involved and 16000 AV-free cases, covering rich conflict regimes and balanced traffic states.

In addition, a novel concept of Minimum Recurrent Clearance Time (MRCT) is proposed to quantify the traffic efficiency impacts of AVs during conflict resolution. The results show that, for AV–HV and HV–HV conflict resolution processes, the differences in selected safety and efficiency measures for human drivers are statistically insignificant. In contrast, pedestrians demonstrate diverse behaviour adjustments. Some pedestrians behave more conservatively when interacting with AVs than with HVs. Notably, the efficiency of AV-involved conflict resolution is significantly lower than in AV-free instances due to the conservative driving style of AVs. This efficiency gap is particularly large when AVs pass through the conflict point after human drivers in unprotected left turns.

Routing and scheduling of trains and engines in a railway marshalling station yard,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104826,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In a busy railway marshalling station, train and engine traffic management in the receiving/departure yard plays a crucial role in efficient and stable operations. Traditionally, a track assignment problem (TAP) is solved to assign tracks to trains for berthing at a receiving/departure yard. However, the TAP does not encompass shunting operations in the yard (e.g., engine replacement and train disassembly), which can result in additional scheduling challenges for dispatchers and route conflicts between operations. This paper investigates a train and engine routing and scheduling problem (TERSP) in a receiving/departure yard of railway marshalling stations, which involves simultaneously assigning routes and scheduling route-setting start times for both train and shunting operations to be conducted in the yard. By introducing the concepts of task, activity, and pattern, we transform the original problem into assigning pre-generated patterns incorporating both route and route-setting start time alternatives to activities. The transformed problem is formulated into a compact binary integer linear programming model with a linear number of constraints and the objective of minimizing the total time deviation of all involved tasks. An improved technique that relies on listing all maximal (bi)cliques in a constructed graph is designed to effectively model the time coherence and track section occupation constraints. A heuristic that gradually expands the patterns for the identified key activities by adding more start time alternatives is applied to remedy an infeasible model caused by potential route conflicts. In addition, a rolling horizon algorithm that decomposes the original problem into consecutive smaller stages using either a time-rolling or a train-rolling rule is developed to efficiently solve instances. Finally, numerical experiments based on the physical layouts and real timetables of a receiving yard and a departure yard of a large marshalling station in China are conducted to assess the performance and applicability of our proposed approaches.

However, the mixed traffic at unsignalized intersections present huge challenges like MVs’ uncertainties, the chain reaction and diverse interactions. Following the thought of the situation-aware cooperation, this paper proposes a Reasoning Graph-based Reinforcement Learning (RGRL) method, which integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based policy and an environment providing mixed traffic with uncertain behaviors. Firstly, it graphicly represents the observed scenario as a situation using the interaction graph with connected but uncertain (bi-directional) edges. The situation reasoning process is formulated as a Reasoning Graph-based Markov Decision Process which infers the vehicle sequence stage by stage so as to sequentially depict the entire situation. Then, a GNN-based policy is constructed, which uses Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) to capture the interrelated chain reactions and Graph Attentions Networks (GAT) to measure the attention of diverse interactions. Furthermore, an environment block is developed for training the policy, which provides trajectory generators for both CAVs and MVs. A reward function that considers social compliance, collision avoidance, efficiency and energy savings is also provided in this block. Finally, three Reinforcement Learning methods, D3QN, PPO and SAC, are implemented for comparative tests to explore the applicability and strength of the framework. The test results demonstrate that the D3QN outperformed the other two methods with a larger converged reward while maintaining a similar converged speed.

Distributed optimization for multi-commodity urban traffic control,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104823,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"A distributed method for concurrent traffic signal and routing control of traffic networks is proposed. The method is based on the multi-commodity store-and-forward model, in which the destinations are the commodities. The system benefits from the communication between vehicles and infrastructure, providing optimal signal timings to intersections and routes to vehicles on a link-by-link basis. Using the augmented Lagrangian to model the constraints into the objective, the baseline centralized problem is decomposed into a set of objective-coupled subproblems, one for each intersection, enabling the solution to be computed by a distributed-gradient projection algorithm. The intersection agents only need to communicate and coordinate with neighboring intersections to ensure convergence to the optimal solution while tolerating suboptimal iterations that offer more flexibility, unlike other distributed approaches. Through microsimulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in traffic networks with time-varying demand. Computational analysis shows that the distributed problem is suitable for real-time applications. A robustness analysis show that the distributed formulation enables a graceful degradation of the system in case of failure.",0968-090X,Not found
"ACC, queue storage, and worrisome news for cities",10.1016/j.trc.2024.104809,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Rush-period traffic conditions in two idealized settings are forecast into the future, when most drivers will presumably rely on adaptive cruise control (ACC) while operating their cars. Field experiments emulating the full range of congested conditions confirm that, for a given traffic speed, the spacings for ACC-vehicles tend to be larger than those in present-day congestion, where vehicles are fully human-controlled. These larger spacings mean smaller densities, which mean, in turn, that queues will be less compacted than at present. The queues will therefore expand over greater distances in the future, as more ACC-controlled vehicles enter the scene. These wider-spread, uncompacted queues spell trouble for cities, where queue storage during a rush is often a problem already. Simulations calibrated to the field-measured data were used to explore this unintended consequence of ACC for various foreseeable futures. Assumptions favorable to ACC were adopted throughout, to produce what are likely lower-bound estimates of future queue-storage problems. These lower bounds served as simple means to address forecast uncertainties. This is because our best-case outcomes for all futures examined are still far worse than the glowing predictions from elsewhere of how ACC may someday eliminate congestion. The first idealized setting was inspired by Downtown Los Angeles, where moderately high congestion already persists during each rush, but where physically long street links help with queue storage. We predict that, owing to ACC alone, rush-period vehicle hours traveled (VHT) on this first network will grow from present-day levels by as much as 12%. In the second setting, inspired by Midtown Manhattan where congestion is already severe and link lengths are short, VHT is predicted to grow by as much as 87%. Higher bottleneck capacities often promised of ACC are shown to be of little value when spillover queues constrain bottleneck flows from reaching those capacities. Adjusting onboard ACC controllers to produce smaller jam spacings was tested through simulation. The tests show how looming problems might be averted by this intervention, and futures thus improved.",0968-090X,Not found
Multi-level traffic-responsive tilt camera surveillance through predictive correlated online learning,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104804,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In urban traffic management, the primary challenge of dynamically and efficiently monitoring traffic conditions is compounded by the insufficient utilization of thousands of surveillance cameras along the intelligent transportation system. This paper introduces the multi-level Traffic-responsive Tilt Camera surveillance system (TTC-X), a novel framework designed for dynamic and efficient monitoring and management of traffic in urban networks. By leveraging widely deployed pan–tilt-cameras (PTCs), TTC-X overcomes the limitations of a fixed field of view in traditional surveillance systems by providing mobilized and 360-degree coverage. The innovation of TTC-X lies in the integration of advanced machine learning modules, including a detector–predictor–controller structure, with a novel Predictive Correlated Online Learning (PiCOL) methodology and the Spatial–Temporal Graph Predictor (STGP) for real-time traffic estimation and PTC control. The TTC-X is tested and evaluated under three experimental scenarios (e.g., maximum traffic flow capture, dynamic route planning, traffic state estimation) based on a simulation environment calibrated using real-world traffic data in Brooklyn, New York. The experimental results showed that TTC-X captured over 60% total number of vehicles at the network level, dynamically adjusted its route recommendation in reaction to unexpected full-lane closure events, and reconstructed link-level traffic states with best MAE less than 1.25 vehicle/hour. Demonstrating scalability, cost-efficiency, and adaptability, TTC-X emerges as a powerful solution for urban traffic management in both cyber–physical and real-world environments.",0968-090X,Not found

Adopting the relative distance braking mode, a coupled optimal control problem with nonlinear train dynamics and constraints regarding collision avoidance and jerk is formulated for the virtual formation. To handle the non-convex constrained problem efficiently, a distributed augmented Lagrangian based alternating direction inexact newton (ALADIN) method under the model predictive control (MPC) framework is developed. For the execution of the distributed computational process, the copied variables are introduced to reformulate the original coupled problem in an objective separable form. By exploiting the problem separability, the ALADIN method decomposes the reformulation into a coordinated quadratic programming problem of small-scale and several local nonlinear programming problems that can be calculated in parallel, thereby facilitating real-time control and relieving communication burden.

How the strength of social relationship affects pedestrian evacuation behavior: A multi-participant fire evacuation experiment in a virtual metro station,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104805,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In fire evacuation, social groups of pedestrians often maintain proximity, proceeding at a similar pace towards a common destination. However, the effect of social groups on pedestrian evacuation behavior is underexplored due to the lack of quantification of the social relationships and the subsequent inadequate assessment of their influence on pedestrian dynamics during evacuation. To address these issues, an immersive virtual reality (VR)-based multi-participant evacuation experiment was conducted in a virtual metro station. Social groups of different relationship strengths measured by trust were asked to evacuate from a simulated metro station fire emergency scene. Results showed that grouped pedestrians with stronger social relationships had lower stress response to emergency situations, and tended to stay closer to each other during evacuation. In addition, stronger social relationships also led to more coordinated evacuation decisions between grouped pedestrians. In terms of evacuation performance, stronger social relationship sightly delayed pedestrians’ initial response but reduced their overall evacuation time. By quantitatively measuring the strength of social relationships and comprehensively revealing its influence on pedestrians who evacuate in social groups, this study is expected to enhance the understanding of social group dynamics in pedestrian evacuation, and offer significant insights for emergency management in indoor environments, such as transportation facilities, where high footfall and complex crowd patterns demand efficient evacuations to avert massive injuries.",0968-090X,Not found

A generic stochastic hybrid car-following model based on approximate Bayesian computation,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104799,167,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Car following (CF) models are fundamental to describing traffic dynamics. However, the CF behavior of human drivers is highly stochastic and nonlinear. As a result, identifying the “best” CF model has been challenging and controversial despite decades of research. Introduction of automated vehicles has further complicated this matter as their CF controllers remain proprietary, though their behavior appears different than human drivers. This paper develops a stochastic learning approach to integrate multiple CF models, rather than relying on a single model. The framework is based on approximate Bayesian computation that probabilistically concatenates a pool of CF models based on their relative likelihood of describing observed behavior. The approach, while data-driven, retains physical tractability and interpretability. Evaluation results using two datasets show that the proposed approach can better reproduce vehicle trajectories for both human-driven and automated vehicles than any single CF model considered.",0968-090X,Not found
Eco-driving of connected autonomous vehicles in urban traffic networks of mixed autonomy with cut-in and escape lane-changes of manually-driven vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104889,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Urban eco-driving of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) aims to optimize CAVs’ speed trajectories to avoid sharp accelerations/decelerations and stops at signalized intersections for the minimization of energy consumption of mixed traffic of CAVs and manually-driven vehicles (MVs). Existing eco-driving studies rarely considered lane changes of MVs. Besides ordinary lane changes that usually take place in traffic flow, eco-driving CAVs tend to trigger specific types of lane changes of MVs, i.e. cut-in from adjacent lanes to the front of CAVs, or escape from behind CAVs to adjacent lanes. It is significant to investigate the interplay between such extraordinary lane changes of MVs and eco-driving endeavors. This paper has developed a generic and deployable eco-driving strategy for CAVs that can deal with both lateral disturbances (e.g. cut-in and escape lane changes of MVs) and longitudinal disturbances (e.g. MVs moving in front and vehicle queues at downstream intersections), without assuming communications between CAVs and MVs. The eco-driving task was formulated as an optimal control problem with safety constraints, and tackled under a unified rolling-horizon framework, with each cut-in lane change treated as a newly emerging longitudinal disturbance to CAVs. The eco-driving performance was thoroughly evaluated for an urban multilane road network based on SUMO. The eco-driving strategy was demonstrated capable of tackling various disturbances of MVs and effectively achieving the eco-driving purpose. For the eco-driving effects on lane changes of MVs, the numbers of cut-in and escape lane changes ascended until the market penetration rate (MPR) of CAVs reached 30% and then kept decreasing, while the number of ordinary lane changes dropped monotonically with the MPR increase. As to the impact of cut-in and escape lane changes of MVs on eco-driving, the energy saving benefits of all CAVs and MVs grew with the MPR increase, despite the disturbances of MV lane changes.

The difference between upper and lower URTN vulnerability bounds captures the range of URTN performance losses among all possible disruption scenarios. Numerical examples based on the Nanjing and Hong Kong metro networks are conducted to illustrate the properties and verify the applicability of the developed models.

To address this limitation, this study proposes a non-parametric Gaussian process model to formulate the stochastic fundamental diagram.

The computational complexity and high memory requirements of Gaussian process regression are also mitigated by introducing sparse Gaussian process regression. This study also examines the impact of incorporating empirical knowledge into the prior of the stochastic fundamental diagram model and assesses whether such knowledge can enhance the model’s robustness and accuracy. By using several well-known single-regime fundamental diagram models as priors and testing the model’s performance with different sampling methods on real-world data, this study finds that empirical knowledge benefits the model only when small inducing samples are used with a relatively clean and large dataset.

The HD-TAP takes into account the varying preferences of travelers when selecting travel modes and the common occurrence of multiple people traveling together. The use of modular shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) is also considered in the model, which allows for flexibility in combining the number of modules based on the number of group riders. The HD-TAP is formulated as a multimodal, multiclass, multiple equilibrium principles, combined mode split traffic assignment model, incorporating a cross-nested logit model for private vehicle travelers’ route choice behavior and a multinomial logit user equilibrium model for non-private vehicle travelers’ mode and route choice behavior. To solve the HD-TAP, a gradient projection-based algorithm is developed. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently solve large-scale multimodal network problems. Through numerical experiments in real-world networks, the study investigates the impacts of preferred travel modes, the number of group riders, and the modular operation of SAVs on system performance.

Traditionally, traffic micro-simulation frameworks are based on road segments and can only support a limited number of main roads. Efficient traffic simulation on a regional scale remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of urban mobility and the large scale of spatiotemporal data. This paper introduces a Large Scale Multi-GPU Parallel Computing based Regional Scale Traffic Simulation Framework (LPSim), which leverages graphical processing unit (GPU) parallel computing to address these challenges.

Predicting flight arrival times with deep learning: A strategy for minimizing potential conflicts in gate assignment,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104866,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Air transportation is frequently disrupted by factors such as weather and air traffic control, making it difficult for flights to strictly adhere to schedules, leading to frequent early arrivals or delays. These disruptions pose challenges to airport operations management, particularly in gate assignments, where potential conflicts and adjustments are often required. Unlike traditional methods that focus on enhancing robustness to reduce conflicts, this study adopts a Predict-then-Optimize (PO) framework, using predicted flight arrival times for gate assignments to avoid the need for robustness-related objectives. In the prediction phase, a CNN-LSTM-Attention deep learning model is developed to predict flight arrival times based on the historical data of a single airport, enhancing data availability and model practicality. In the optimization phase, a bi-objective gate assignment model is constructed, using predicted arrival times instead of scheduled times as input. An epsilon-constrained branch-and-price algorithm is developed to obtain non-dominated Pareto optimal solutions. Analysis using actual operational data from Beijing Capital International Airport shows that the prediction model achieves an accuracy of 93.27% for early arrivals and 83.6% for on-time flights. The epsilon-constrained branch-and-price algorithm outperforms heuristic algorithms in both the quantity and quality of Pareto solutions. Notably, the gate assignment strategy based on predicted arrival times significantly reduces potential conflicts, with a maximum reduction of 25.33% compared to the schedule-based strategy.

A scalable macro–micro approach for cooperative platoon merging in mixed traffic flows,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104859,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This study presents a new approach to efficiently coordinate platoon movements in mixed traffic environments. The approach synergises macroscopic, network-wide traffic control models with microscopic, individual vehicle dynamics. This overcomes the limitations of using either strategy in isolation: macroscopic models lack detailed vehicle interactions, while microscopic models do not scale. By combining both strategies, the framework provides a scalable solution for mixed traffic networks. At the macroscopic level, the framework dynamically optimises speed limits and ramp metering rates to reduce total travel time and queue lengths, establishing a high-level control mechanism that facilitates microscopic implementations. At the microscopic level, the strategy focuses on the trajectory planning of automated vehicles (AVs). Vehicles are organised into platoons with an AV leader, enabling cooperative behaviour in mixed traffic. The number of platoons and their entry into the merging area are carefully regulated to match macroscopic control references. In addition, we propose a novel passing sequence rule for platoons in the merge area. This is further supported by a virtual platooning method for trajectory planning of AVs. The effectiveness of the integrated approach is demonstrated through rigorous microscopic simulations. Our method reduces the total travel time by more than 30% with a 20% AV penetration rate compared to the no-control scenario. It also outperforms the existing macroscopic approach even at a 10% AV penetration rate. Furthermore, it balances queue lengths across multiple merging areas.

Feedback–feedforward signal control with exogenous demand estimation in congested urban road networks,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104863,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"To cope with uncertain traffic patterns and traffic models, traffic-responsive signal control strategies in the literature are designed to be robust to these uncertainties. These robust strategies still require sensing infrastructure to implement traffic-responsiveness. In this paper, we take a novel perspective and show that it is possible to use the already necessary sensing infrastructure to estimate the uncertain quantities in real time. Specifically, resorting to the store-and-forward model, we design a novel network-wide traffic-responsive strategy that estimates the occupancy and exogenous demand in each link, i.e., entering (exiting) vehicle flows at the origins (destinations) of the network or within links, in real time. Borrowing from optimal control theory, we design an optimal linear quadratic control scheme, consisting of a linear feedback term, of the occupancy of the road links, and a feedforward component, which accounts for the varying exogenous vehicle load on the network. Thereby, the resulting control scheme is a simple feedback–feedforward controller, which is fed with occupancy and exogenous demand estimates, and is suitable for real-time implementation. Numerical simulations for the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, show that, for realistic surges in the exogenous demand, the proposed solution significantly outperforms tried-and-tested solutions that ignore the exogenous demand.",0968-090X,Not found
MetaFollower: Adaptable personalized autonomous car following,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104872,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Car-following (CF) modeling, a fundamental component in microscopic traffic simulation, has attracted increasing research interest in recent decades. In this study, we propose an adaptable personalized car-following framework —– MetaFollower, by leveraging the power of meta-learning. Specifically, we first utilize Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to extract common driving knowledge from various CF events. Afterward, the pre-trained model can be fine-tuned on new drivers with only a few CF trajectories to achieve personalized CF adaptation. We additionally combine Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to reflect temporal heterogeneity with high interpretability. MetaFollower can accurately capture and simulate the intricate dynamics of car-following behavior while considering the unique driving styles of individual drivers. We demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of MetaFollower by showcasing its ability to adapt to new drivers with limited training data quickly. To evaluate the performance of MetaFollower, we conduct rigorous experiments comparing it with both data-driven and physics-based models. The results reveal that our proposed framework outperforms baseline models in predicting car-following behavior with higher accuracy and safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first car-following model aiming to achieve fast adaptation by considering both driver and temporal heterogeneity based on meta-learning.",0968-090X,Not found
Bi-objective robust nonlinear decision approach for en-route bus speed control considering implementation errors and traffic uncertainties,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104870,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This study proposes a bi-objective robust nonlinear decision mapping (Bi-RNDM) approach for en-route bus speed control, aiming to enhance bus service level and reliability. Through a two-stage procedure, the proposed approach addresses the challenges due to traffic flow uncertainties and implementation errors from bus drivers. In the first stage, a bi-objective nonlinear programming model (Bi-NLPM) is built and solved to collect labeled data, which are then used to pre-train the mapping relationship between bus system states and optimal bus control speeds using support vector machines (SVM). This results in a bi-objective pre-trained nonlinear decision mapping (Bi-PNDM) consisting of an SVM-based classifier and an SVM-based regressor. In the second stage, a bi-objective robust critical parameter simulation-based optimization (BRCPSO) model is built within the min–max expectation framework, and it is solved using a modified bi-objective robust simulation-based optimization (MBORSO) algorithm to optimize the critical parameters of Bi-PNDM. The resulting Bi-RNDM improves the operation performance by reducing the deviation in service headway as well as the deviation from service schedule, considering the existence of traffic uncertainties and implementation errors from bus drivers. Numerical experiments are conducted based on the case study of the bus line 406 in Changsha, China, to demonstrate the efficiency of the MBORSO algorithm and the superior bus service level and robustness of the Bi-RNDM method. Results show that the proposed Bi-RNDM method can effectively balance the two competitive objectives, and the produced speed control is implementable for only about 20% of the operation period, suggesting high practicality. The proposed framework is not only applicable in the bus speed control problems, as it promises for addressing other complex multi-objective online optimal decision-making problems that are under various uncertainties and resolvable through data-driven nonlinear decision mapping.",0968-090X,Not found
Integrated optimization of lane allocation and adaptive signal control at isolated intersection under stochastic demand,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104862,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Traffic arrival rate at intersections is usually fluctuating and random. This paper proposes an integrated optimization method for lane allocation and signal control under stochastic demand using the concept of level-of-service (LOS) reliability. First, we develop a two-stage stochastic programming model. In the first stage, a base lane allocation plan that takes account of the arrival uncertainty is derived. The objective is to minimize the expected average delay of the intersection. At the second stage, upon realizations of the random arrivals, the signal timing plan is adjusted in respond to the varying traffic conditions and address the occasional overflows, which may occur with the base lane allocation plan. In view of the intertwined two-stage decisions, we introduce the LOS reliability to decouple the model into two independent subproblems for solution efficiency. A decoupled model is then reconstructed with a LOS reliability constraint, which is associated with a fixed traffic arrival pattern. Then, a gradient descent algorithm is developed to solve the optimal LOS reliability level. Numerical experiments on both a test intersection and a real intersection are conducted and two benchmark methods are introduced for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LOS reliability-based optimization method in terms of reducing the expected average delay. With the benefits from a robust base lane allocation plan, the optimal signal timing plans can better adapt to random traffic demands.",0968-090X,Not found
A cooperative perception based adaptive signal control under early deployment of connected and automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104860,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Connected vehicle-based adaptive traffic signal control requires certain market penetration rates (MPRs) to be effective, usually exceeding 10%. Cooperative perception based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can effectively improve overall data collection efficiency and reduce required MPR. However, the distribution of observed vehicles under cooperative perception is highly skewed and imbalanced, especially under very low CAV MPRs (e.g., 1%). To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive traffic signal control (RL-TSC) method that integrates a traffic flow model, known as the cell transmission model (CTM), denoted as CAVLight. Traffic states estimated from the CTM are integrated with the data collected from the cooperative perception environment to update the states in the CAVLight model. The design of reward function aims for reducing total vehicle delays and stabilizing agent behaviors. Extensive numerical experiments under a real-world intersection with varying traffic demand levels and CAV MPRs are conducted to compare the performance of CAVLight and other benchmark algorithms, including a fixed-time controller, an actuated controller, the max pressure model, and an optimization-based adaptive TSC. Results demonstrate the superiority of CAVLight in performance and generalizability over benchmarks, especially under 1% CAV MPR scenario with high traffic demands. The influence of CTM integration on CAVLight is further explored through RL agent policy visualization and sensitivity analysis in CTM parameters and CAV perception capabilities (i.e., detection range and detection accuracy).",0968-090X,Not found
The Dial-a-Ride problem with meeting points: A problem formulation for shared demand–responsive transit,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104869,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"In this paper, a formulation for the Dial-a-Ride Problem with Meeting Points (DARPmp) is introduced. The problem consists of defining routes that satisfy trip requests between pick-up and drop-off points while complying with time window, ride time, vehicle load, and route duration constraints. A set of meeting points is defined, and passengers may be asked to use these meeting points as alternative pickup or drop-off points if this results in routes with lower costs. Incorporating meeting points into the DARP is achieved by formulating a mixed-integer linear program. Two preprocessing steps and three valid inequalities are introduced, which improve the computational performance when solving the DARPmp to global optimality. Two versions of the Tabu Search metaheuristic are proposed to approximate the optimal solution in large-scale networks due to the NP-hardness of DARPmp. Performing numerical experiments with benchmark instances, this study demonstrates the benefits of DARPmp compared to DARP in terms of reducing vehicle running costs.",0968-090X,Not found
Choice-based macroscopic lane-change prediction model for weaving areas,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104871,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper introduces two macroscopic lane change models, separately for small vehicles (passenger cars and vans) as well as heavy vehicles. The model is structured using a Nested Logit discrete choice framework. The model was estimated and validated using unique trajectory data collected from a busy weaving section in Antwerp, Belgium. The models exhibit an average and maximum rate of inaccurate prediction results, amounting to 11% and 16%, respectively. Additionally, the model underestimates the total number of lane change maneuvers, with a margin of no more than 4.1–7.7%. This study aims to fill the gap in macroscopic lane change models, which mainly depend on theoretical underpinnings, by including empirical data from the analysis of more than 31,000 observed maneuvers. Furthermore, it differentiates among three maneuver intents, a unique alternative-specific discrete choice framework. This differentiation allows for the consideration of drivers’ systematic taste variations. In contrast to other models that utilize empirical datasets and are heavily dependent on expensive video-based data, including the entire traffic flow, this study introduces a novel approach for estimating the position and frequency of maneuvers by using just a small fraction (1–2%) of vehicle trajectories, supplemented by loop detector data, therefore eliminating the need for information from surrounding vehicles. Additionally, the work’s uniqueness is its validation methods extending beyond just numerical evaluations. The practical usability and usefulness of the model are shown in real-world traffic circumstances. Finally, the model is integrated in the context of a macroscopic simulation that represents a highly consistent lane balance based on the Scalable Quality Value statistics.",0968-090X,Not found
Robust optimization of train timetables with short-length and full-length services considering uncertain passenger volume and service choice behavior,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104855,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Train timetables with a combination of short-length and full-length services can adapt to spatial and temporal variations in demand. However, with such timetables, some passengers may choose to catch an earlier short-length service and then transfer to a full-length service to reach their destinations rather than waiting for a crowded full-length service. This uncertain service choice behavior frequently occurs, which, however, was not well considered in most studies on demand-oriented timetabling. Therefore, this study presents a robust timetabling approach based on the scenario-based method considering uncertain passenger volumes and service choice behavior for choosing different types of train services. A customized decomposition-based method with an iterative solution procedure is designed to solve the proposed model. In each iteration, a multi-agent-based simulation algorithm is developed to update passengers’ travel utility and the service choice preference proportion based on the previous iteration’s timetabling results. To obtain high-quality solutions in an acceptable computing time, a hybrid “ALNS + GUROBI” algorithm is developed to handle the timetabling problems for large-scale cases. The proposed method optimizes the train timetables for Xi’an Metro Line 3 in China. Our results indicate that the proposed method can account for uncertain passenger volumes and service choice behavior by adjusting the short-length plans and train headways to match the transport capacity to passenger demand.",0968-090X,Not found
A dynamic macroscopic framework for pricing of ride-hailing services with an optional bus lane access for pool vehicles,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104854,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"On-demand trip sharing is an efficient solution to mitigate the negative externalities e-hailing has on traffic in a network. It motivates platform operators to reduce their fleet size and serves the same demand level with a lower effective distance traveled. Users nevertheless prefer to travel solo and for shorter distances, despite the price discount they receive. By offering them the choice to pool and travel in high-occupancy dedicated bus lanes, we provide them with a larger incentive to share their rides, yet this creates additional bus delays. In this work, we develop dynamic feedback-based control policies that regulate pool vehicle access to bus lanes by adjusting the price gap between solo and pool trips, with the aim of improving multi-modal delays and providing better utilization of network capacity. First, we develop a modal- and occupancy-dependent aggregate model for private vehicles, ride-pooling, and buses based on network production, and we use this model to test different control strategies. To minimize the error between the target and actual speeds in the bus network, we design a PI controller and show that by adjusting pool trip fares, we can, with little input data, minimize this error. We also put forward a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to minimize the total Passenger Hours Traveled (PHT) and Waiting Times (WT) for the different travelers. Moreover, we show how the MPC framework can be utilized to impose a minimum speed in dedicated bus lanes and ensure that buses operate on schedule. The results demonstrate the possibility of improving the overall network conditions by incentivizing or discouraging pooling in the vehicle or bus network.",0968-090X,Not found
Augmented reality safety warnings in roadway work zones: Evaluating the effect of modality on worker reaction times,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104867,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Given the aging highway infrastructure requiring extensive rebuilding and enhancements, and the consequent rise in the number of work zones, there is an urgent need to develop advanced safety systems to protect workers. While Augmented Reality (AR) holds significant potential for delivering warnings to workers, its integration into roadway work zones remains relatively unexplored. The primary objective of this study is to improve safety measures within roadway work zones by conducting an extensive analysis of how different combinations of multimodal Augmented Reality (AR) warnings influence the reaction times of workers. This paper addresses this gap through a series of experiments that aim to replicate the distinctive conditions of roadway work zones, both in real-world and virtual reality environments. Our approach comprises three key components: an advanced AR system prototype, a VR simulation of AR functionality within the work zone environment, and the Wizard of Oz technique to synchronize user experiences across experiments. To assess reaction times, we leverage both the simple reaction time (SRT) technique and an innovative vision-based metric that utilizes real-time pose estimation. By conducting five experiments in controlled outdoor work zones and indoor VR settings, our study provides valuable information on how various multimodal AR warnings impact workers reaction times. Furthermore, our findings reveal the disparities in reaction times between VR simulations and real-world scenarios, thereby gauging VR’s capability to mirror the dynamics of roadway work zones. Furthermore, our results substantiate the potential and reliability of vision-based reaction time measurements. These insights resonate well with those derived using the SRT technique, underscoring the viability of this approach for tangible real-world uses.",0968-090X,Not found
Network-wide speed–flow estimation considering uncertain traffic conditions and sparse multi-type detectors: A KL divergence-based optimization approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104858,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Accurate monitoring and sensing network-wide traffic conditions under uncertainty is vital for addressing urban transportation obstacles and promoting the evolution of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Owing to fluctuations in traffic demand, traffic conditions exhibit stochastic variations by the time of day and day of the year. The joint estimation of stochastic speed and flow is pivotal in ITS, drawing on the symbiotic relationship between these two variables to furnish comprehensive insights into traffic conditions. Nevertheless, constraints such as budgetary limitations and physical boundaries render the coverage of traffic detectors both sparse and inadequate, thereby complicating the precise assessment of network-wide traffic speeds and flows in uncertain scenarios. To address this challenging problem, this paper proposes a novel network-wide traffic speed-flow estimator (SFE) grounded in the Kullback-Leibler divergence optimization method. This SFE harnesses data derived from sparse multi-type detectors, such as point detectors and automatic vehicle identification sensors. Significantly, it leverages the statistical correlation relationships (i.e., covariance matrix) of the speed and flow between observed and unobserved links to estimate stochastic speed and flow on unobserved links (i.e., the links without traffic detectors). In addition, fundamental diagrams, modeling the interdependence between link speeds and flows, are incorporated as constraints in the proposed SFE. This inclusion markedly diminishes discrepancies and elevates estimation precision relative to individual assessments of speeds and flows. Numerical illustrations, encompassing both simulated and real-world road networks, validate the enhanced performance and applicability of the proposed SFE, suggesting its potential role in augmenting data robustness within ITS.",0968-090X,Not found

An environmentally-aware dynamic planning of electric vehicles for aircraft towing considering stochastic aircraft arrival and departure times,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104857,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Introducing electric vehicles that tow aircraft during taxiing is an emerging technology aimed at supporting climate neutrality for aviation. Planning electric towing operations is, however, impeded by the high uncertainty in aircraft arrival and departure times. We address the question of how to plan the operation of a fleet of Electric Towing Vehicles (ETVs) to maximize environmental benefits, given the uncertainty in aircraft arrival/departure times. For this, we propose a stochastic and dynamic planning framework for ETVs, where stochastic aircraft arrival and departure times are updated during the day. With this, the assignment of the ETVs-to-aircraft to replace conventional taxiing, and ETV battery charging times are planned such that the fuel savings are maximized. At the same time, we ensure that aircraft delays induced by the use of ETVs are minimized. We illustrate our framework for a large European airport. The results show that our framework achieves 79.5% of the highest possible cost reduction (fuel and ETV-induced delay), which is obtained when full knowledge of the arrival/departure times is available in advance. Furthermore, we show that considering the uncertainty in the arrival/departure times, rather than using point estimates of these times, leads to a 17.7% additional cost reduction.

This paper proposes MATNEC, a framework for constructing a data-driven Maritime Traffic Network (MTN), represented as a graph that facilitates realistic route generation. Our approach, leveraging Automatic Identification System (AIS) data along with portcall and global coastline datasets, aims to address key challenges in MTN construction from AIS data observed in the literature, particularly the imprecise placement of network nodes and sub-optimal definition of network edges. At the core of MATNEC is a novel incremental clustering algorithm that is capable of intelligently determining the placement and distribution of the graph nodes in a diverse set of environments, based on several environmental factors. To ensure that the resulting MTN generates maritime routes as realistic as possible, we design a novel edge mapping algorithm that defines the edges of the network by treating the mapping of AIS trajectories to network nodes as an optimisation problem. Finally, due to the absence of a unified approach in the literature for measuring the efficacy of an MTN’s ability to generate realistic routes, we propose a novel methodology to address this gap.

Prediction-failure-risk-aware online dial-a-ride scheduling considering spatial demand correlation via approximate dynamic programming and scenario approach,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104801,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The dial-a-ride (DAR) service is a precursor to emerging shared mobility. Service providers expect efficient management of fleet resources to improve service quality without degrading economic viability. Most existing studies overlook possible future demands that could yield better matching opportunities and scheduling benefits, and therefore have short-sighted limitations. Moreover, the effects of correlated demand and potential prediction errors were ignored. To address these gaps, this paper investigates prediction-failure-risk-aware online DAR scheduling with spatial demand correlation. Request selection and cancellation are explicitly considered. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it by approximate dynamic programming (ADP). We further develop a demand prediction model that can capture the characteristics of DAR travel demand (uncertainty, sparsity, and spatial correlation). Deep quantile regression is adopted to estimate the marginal distribution of each OD pair. These marginals are combined into a joint demand distribution by constructing a Gaussian Copula to capture the spatial demand correlation. A prediction error correction mechanism is proposed to eliminate prediction errors and rectify policies promptly. Based on the model properties, several families of customized pruning strategies are devised to improve the computational efficiency and solution quality of ADP. We solve policies over time in the dynamic environment mixed with actual and stochastic future demands via the ADP algorithm and scenario approach. We propose the value function rolling method and multi-scenario exploration method, to address the deviation of the value function and identify the optimal policy from multiple future demand scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate the importance and benefits of incorporating demand forecasting and spatial correlation into the DAR operation. The improvement due to prediction is significant even when the prediction is imperfect, while the demand prediction can hedge against the negative effects of request cancellation. The real-world application result shows that compared to state-of-the-practice, the overall delivery efficiency can be substantially improved, along with better service quality and fleet size savings.",0968-090X,Not found

A time-embedded attention-based transformer for crash likelihood prediction at intersections using connected vehicle data,10.1016/j.trc.2024.104831,169,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The real-time crash likelihood prediction model is an essential component of the proactive traffic safety management system. Over the years, numerous studies have attempted to construct a crash likelihood prediction model in order to enhance traffic safety, but mostly on freeways. In the majority of the existing studies, researchers have primarily used a deep learning-based framework to identify crash potential. Lately, Transformers have emerged as a potential deep neural network that fundamentally operates through attention-based mechanisms. Transformers exhibit distinct functional benefits over established deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). First, they employ attention mechanisms to accurately weigh the significance of different parts of input data, a dynamic functionality that is not available in RNNs, LSTMs, and CNNs. Second, they are well-equipped to handle dependencies over long-range data sequences, a feat RNNs typically struggle with. Lastly, unlike RNNs, LSTMs, and CNNs, which process data in sequence, Transformers can parallelly process data elements during training and inference, thereby enhancing their efficiency. Apprehending the immense possibility of Transformers, this paper proposes inTersection-Transformer (inTformer), a time-embedded attention-based Transformer model that can effectively predict intersection crash likelihood in real-time. The inTformer is basically a binary prediction model that predicts the occurrence or non-occurrence of crashes at intersections in the near future (i.e., next 15 min). The proposed model was developed by employing traffic data extracted from connected vehicles. Acknowledging the complex traffic operation mechanism at intersection, this study developed zone-specific models by dividing the intersection region into two distinct zones: within-intersection and approach zones, each representing the intricate flow of traffic unique to the type of intersection (i.e., three-legged and four-legged intersections). In the ‘within-intersection’ zone, the inTformer models attained a sensitivity of up to 73%, while in the ‘approach’ zone, the sensitivity peaked at 74%. Moreover, benchmarking the optimal zone-specific inTformer models against earlier studies on crash likelihood prediction at intersections and several established deep learning models trained on the same connected vehicle dataset confirmed the superiority of the proposed inTformer. Further, to quantify the impact of features on crash likelihood at intersections, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method was applied on the best performing inTformer models.

Traditional methods, often reliant on target population samples, such as census data or travel surveys, face limitations due to high costs and small sample sizes, particularly at smaller geographical scales. We propose a novel framework based on copulas to generate synthetic data for target populations where only empirical marginal distributions are known. This method utilizes samples from different populations with similar marginal dependencies, introduces a spatial component into population synthesis, and considers various information sources for more realistic generators. Concretely, the process involves normalizing the data and treating it as realizations of a given copula, and then training a generative model before incorporating the information on the marginals of the target population. Utilizing American Community Survey data, we assess our framework’s performance through standardized root mean squared error (SRMSE) and so-called sampled zeros. We focus on its capacity to transfer a model learned from one population to another. Our experiments include transfer tests between regions at the same geographical level as well as to lower geographical levels, hence evaluating the framework’s adaptability in varied spatial contexts. We compare Bayesian Networks, Variational Autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks, both individually and combined with our copula framework.

Consequently, several new delivery concepts have been proposed that increase flexibility for customers and other stakeholders. One of these innovations is crowdsourced delivery, where deliveries are made by occasional drivers who wish to utilize their surplus resources (unused transport capacity) by making deliveries in exchange for some compensation. The potential benefits of crowdsourced delivery include reduced delivery costs and increased flexibility (by scaling delivery capacity up and down as needed). The use of occasional drivers poses new challenges because (unlike traditional couriers) neither their availability nor their behavior in accepting delivery offers is certain. The relationship between the compensation offered to occasional drivers and the probability that they will accept a task has been largely neglected in the scientific literature. Therefore, we consider a setting in which compensation-dependent acceptance probabilities are explicitly considered in the process of assigning delivery tasks to occasional drivers. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear model that minimizes the expected delivery costs while identifying optimal assignments of tasks to a mix of professional and occasional drivers and their compensation. We propose an exact two-stage solution algorithm that allows to decompose compensation and assignment decisions for generic acceptance probability functions and show that the runtime of this algorithm is polynomial under mild conditions. Finally, we also study a more general case of the considered problem setting, show that it is NP-hard and propose an approximate linearization scheme of our mixed-integer nonlinear model. The results of our computational study show clear advantages of our new approach over existing ones.

Pedestrians are modeled as being included in one of two groups: those walking on sidewalks and those queued at intersections waiting to cross. Traffic dynamics models for both groups are developed. Under the proposed control policy, the signal timings are determined based on the queue length of both vehicles and pedestrians waiting to cross the intersection. The proposed algorithm maintains the decentralized control structure, and the paper proves that it also exhibits the maximum stability property for both vehicles and pedestrians. Microscopic traffic simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve the overall operational efficiency—i.e., reduce person travel delays—under various vehicle demand levels compared to the original queue-based MP (Q-MP) algorithm and a recently developed rule-based MP algorithm considering pedestrians. The Q-MP ignores the yielding behavior of right-turn vehicles to conflicting pedestrian movements, which leads to high delay for vehicles. On the other hand, the delay incurred by pedestrians is high from the rule-based model since it imposes large waiting time tolerance to guarantee the operational efficiency of vehicles. The proposed algorithm outperforms both models since the states of both vehicles and pedestrians are taken into consideration to determine signal timings.",0968-090X,Not found
