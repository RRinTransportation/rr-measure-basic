Drone scheduling to monitor vessels in emission control areas,10.1016/j.trb.2018.10.011,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The use of drones to monitor the emissions of vessels has recently attracted wide attention because of its great potentials for enforcing regulations in emission control areas (ECAs). Motivated by this potential application, we study how drones can be scheduled to monitor the sailing vessels in ECAs, which is defined as a drone scheduling problem (DSP) in this paper. The objective of the DSP is to design a group of flight tours for drones, including the inspection sequence and timings for the vessels, such that as many vessels as possible can be inspected during a given time period while prioritizing highly weighted vessels for inspection. We show that the DSP can be regarded as a generalized team orienteering problem, which is known to be NP-hard, and deriving solutions for this problem can be more difficult because additional complicated features, such as time-dependent locations, multiple trips for a drone, and multiple stations (or depots), are addressed simultaneously. To overcome these difficulties, we model the dynamics of each sailing vessel using a real-time location function in a deterministic fashion. This approach allows us to approximately represent the problem on a time-expanded network, based on which a network flow-based formulation can be formally developed. To solve this proposed formulation, we further develop a Lagrangian relaxation-based method that can obtain near-optimal solutions for large-scale instances of the problem. Numerical experiments based on practically generated instances with 300 time points and up to 100 vessels are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that our method derives tight upper bounds on optimal solutions, and can quickly return good feasible solutions for the tested instances. We also conduct experiments based on realistic tracking data to demonstrate the usefulness of our solutions, including those for the cases considering the uncertainty of vessel locations.",0191-2615,Not found
The emergence of macroscopic interactions between intersecting pedestrian streams,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.002,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The interactions between individual pedestrians can lead to emergent effects, such as the formation of lanes in bidirectional flows. Here, we expose properties of an emergent effect at a macroscopic level, namely interactions between pedestrian streams that arise when pedestrians walk into and through four-way intersections from different directions. We propose non-spatial models for the number of pedestrians from different streams inside an intersection. Each model encodes a different hypothesis for how streams interact and can produce dynamics fundamentally distinct from the other models. By fitting our models to large experimental data sets and determining which model explains the data best, we determine when and how entire streams of pedestrians start to interact. We find that as arrival rates increase, streams start to interact and compete for space. Our results suggest that these interactions result in an even balance of pedestrian numbers across two orthogonally intersecting streams. Neither of the streams can dominate. In contrast, for four intersecting streams, our findings suggest that jams in some streams can coincide with higher flow rates in other streams and that the relative dominance of streams can switch stochastically. By adapting existing methodology, we thus present a coherent conceptual approach for investigating emergent effects in temporal dynamics at aggregated levels in pedestrian flows that could be applied to other scenarios. Our approach is flexible and uses easily measured quantities, making it highly suitable for observational data in different scenarios or deployment in applications.",0191-2615,Not found
Efficient calibration of microscopic car-following models for large-scale stochastic network simulators,10.1016/j.trb.2018.09.005,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper proposes a simulation-based optimization methodology for the efficient calibration of microscopic traffic flow models (i.e., car-following models) of large-scale stochastic network simulators. The approach is a metamodel simulation-based optimization (SO) method. To improve computational efficiency of the SO algorithm, problem-specific and simulator-specific structural information is embedded into a metamodel. As a closed-form expression is sought, we propose adopting the steady-state solution of the car-following model as an approximation of its simulation-based input-output mapping. This general approach is applied for the calibration of the Gipps car-following model embedded in a microscopic traffic network simulator, on a large network. To this end, a novel formulation for the traffic stream models corresponding to the Gipps car-following law is provided. The proposed approach identifies points with good performance within few simulation runs. Comparing its performances to that of a traditional approach, which does not take advantage of the structural information, the objective function is improved by two orders of magnitude in most experiments. Moreover, this is achieved within tight computational budgets, i.e., few simulation runs. The solutions identified improve the fit to the field measurements by one order of magnitude, on average. The structural information provided to the metamodel is shown to enable the SO algorithm to become robust to both the quality of the initial points and the simulator stochasticity.",0191-2615,Not found
Robust location-allocation network design for earthquake preparedness,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.009,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"We develop robust models for earthquake preparedness by optimizing the number, location, and capacity of distribution centers (DCs). The goal is to minimize the total social costs, which include setup and initial supplies, as well as the deprivation costs associated with delayed access to supplies. The models incorporate various earthquake magnitude-specific uncertainties, such as facility damage, casualty by severity, and travel time. Examining the concept of social costs in light of an emerging concern in humanitarian logistics - the robustness of relief networks, we model two types of robustness: parameter uncertainty within a scenario and relative regret across scenarios. This unique approach reveals (1) the magnitude of social costs in the aftermath of an earthquake; (2) the hidden risks associated with inaccurate modeling of deprivation costs; and (3) the impact of budgetary constraints. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via a case study featuring the Northridge region in California, which experienced two of the strongest earthquakes recorded in North America in 1971 and 1994.",0191-2615,Not found
Stochastic on-time arrival problem in transit networks,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.013,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This article considers the stochastic on-time arrival problem in transit networks where both the travel time and the waiting time for transit services are stochastic. A specific challenge of this problem is the combinatorial solution space due to the unknown ordering of transit line arrivals. We propose a network structure appropriate to the online decision-making of a passenger, including boarding, waiting and transferring. In this framework, we design a dynamic programming algorithm that is pseudo-polynomial in the number of transit stations and travel time budget, and exponential in the number of transit lines at a station, which is a small number in practice. To reduce the search space, we propose a definition of transit line dominance, and techniques to identify dominance, which decrease the computation time by up to 90% in numerical experiments. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted on both a synthetic network and the Chicago transit network.",0191-2615,Not found
Tolerance-based strategies for extending the column generation algorithm to the bounded rational dynamic user equilibrium problem,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.008,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The column generation (CG) algorithm has been widely applied to traffic assignment problems due to its capability of circumventing path enumeration. Incorporating bounded rationality (BR) and dynamics, this paper proposes four tolerance-based strategies for extending the CG algorithm to the bounded rational dynamic user equilibrium model (BR-DUE): (i) a tolerance-based minimum disutility path search strategy is developed to allow travelers seeking satisfactory paths; (ii) a self-adjusted convergence threshold strategy is applied for fast convergence at the intermediate iterations; (iii) a varied temporal resolution scheme, combining exploration and exploitation, is suggested to assign flows to narrow time regions rather than to the whole time horizon; and (iv) a path search skipping strategy is introduced by comparing the lower bound of travel disutility and the minimum disutility between the OD pairs. With these strategies, an efficient tolerance-based column generation (TBCG) algorithm for BR-DUE is developed. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the TBCG algorithm leads to significant computation time reductions without the expense of solution quality, of which the speedup factors are around two compared with using the original CG algorithm.",0191-2615,Not found
Distributionally robust optimization of an emergency medical service station location and sizing problem with joint chance constraints,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.012,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"An effective Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system can provide medical relief supplies for common emergencies (fire, accident, etc.) or large-scale disasters (earthquake, tsunami, bioterrorism attack, explosion, etc.) and decrease morbidity and mortality dramatically. This paper proposes a distributionally robust model for optimizing the location, number of ambulances and demand assignment in an EMS system by minimizing the expected total cost. The model guarantees that the probability of satisfying the maximum concurrent demand in the whole system is larger than a predetermined reliability level by introducing joint chance constraints and characterizes the expected total cost by moment uncertainty based on a data-driven approach. The model is approximated as a parametric second-order conic representable program. Furthermore, a special case of the model is considered and converted into a standard second-order cone program, which can be efficiently solved with a proposed outer approximation algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the benefit of the proposed approach. Moreover, a dataset from a real application is also used to demonstrate the application of the data-driven approach.",0191-2615,Not found
Network congestion games are robust to variable demand,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.010,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"We consider a non-atomic network congestion game with incomplete information in which nature decides which commodities travel. The users of a commodity do not know which other commodities travel and only have distributional information about their presence. Our main result is that the price of anarchy bounds known for the deterministic demand game also apply to the Bayesian game with random demand, even if the travel probabilities of different commodities are arbitrarily correlated. Moreover, the extension result of price of anarchy bounds for complete information games to incomplete information games in which the set of players is randomly determined can be generalized to the class of smooth games.",0191-2615,Not found
Analytical derivation of the optimal traffic signal timing: Minimizing delay variability and spillback probability for undersaturated intersections,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.004,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,Individual vehicles experience a large variability of delay at signalized intersections in urban networks. Existing traffic signal optimization frameworks often overlook the implications of delay variability and spillback for design and analysis of signal timing plans. This paper presents an analytical solution based on the shockwave theory to estimate delay variability at an undersaturated intersection. We also propose a new optimal signal timing formulation that minimizes the delay variability and probability of spillback in addition to total delay. Several algorithms are proposed to attain the global optimal signal timing for prefixed (given) and dynamic (optimal) cycle length control strategies. Illustrative microsimulation and numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulated models and signal optimization algorithms.,0191-2615,Not found
The urban recharging infrastructure design problem with stochastic demands and capacitated charging stations,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.001,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"In this study we develop an exact solution method to optimize the location and capacity of charging stations to satisfy the fast charging needs of electric vehicles in urban areas. Stochastic recharge demands, capacity limitations of charging stations and drivers’ route preferences (deviation tolerances) are simultaneously considered to address this challenging problem faced by recharging infrastructure planners or investors. Taking a scenario based approach to model demand uncertainty, we first propose a compact two stage stochastic programming formulation. We then project out the second stage decision variables from the compact formulation by describing the extreme rays of its polyhedral cone and obtain (1) a cut formulation that enables an efficient branch and cut algorithm to solve large problem instances (2) a novel characterization for feasible solutions to the capacitated covering problems. We test our algorithm on the Chicago metropolitan area network, by considering real world origin-destination trip data to model charging demands.

Parsimonious trajectory design of connected automated traffic,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.006,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"One challenging problem about connected automated vehicles is to optimize vehicle trajectories considering realistic constraints (e.g. vehicle kinematic limits and collision avoidance) and objectives (e.g., travel time, fuel consumption). With respect to communication cost and implementation difficulty, parsimonious trajectory planning has attracted continuous interests. In this paper, we first analyze the feasibility conditions for a general continuous-time trajectory planning problem and then propose an analytical solution method for two important boundary trajectory problems. We further propose a discrete-time model with a more general objective function and a certain sparsity requirement that helps parsimonious planned trajectories. This sparsity requirement is implemented with a l 1 norm regulatory term appended to the objective function.

Connected infrastructure location design under additive service utilities,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.007,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"An infrastructure system usually contains a number of inter-connected infrastructure links that connect users to services or products. Where to locate these infrastructure links is a challenging problem that largely determines the efficiency and quality of the network. This paper studies a new location design problem that aims to maximize the total weighted benefits between users and multiple services that are measured by the amount of connectivity between users and links in the network. This problem is investigated from both analytical and computational points of view. First, analytical properties of special cases of the problem are described. Next, two integer programming model formulations are presented for the general problem. We also test intuitive heuristics including greedy and interchange algorithms, and find that the interchange algorithm efficiently yields near-optimum solutions. Finally, a set of numerical examples demonstrate the proposed models and reveal interesting managerial insights. In particular, we found that a more distance-dependent utility measure and a higher concentration of users help achieve a better total utility. As the population becomes increasingly concentrated, the optimal link design evolves from a linear path to a cluster of links around the population center. As the budget level increases, the installed links gradually sprawl from the population center towards the periphery, and in the case of multiple population centers, they grow and eventually merge into one connected component.",0191-2615,Not found
Mechanism design for first-mile ridesharing based on personalized requirements part II: Solution algorithm for large-scale problems,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.014,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Ridesharing provides travelers with a low-cost and convenient first-mile mobility service. Our Part I paper designed a mechanism to incentivize more travelers to participate in the first-mile ridesharing service accounting for passengers’ personalized requirements on inconvenience attributes of ridesharing. In order to address the computational challenge of obtaining the mechanism for large-scale transportation networks, this paper develops a novel heuristic algorithm, called the Solution Pooling Approach (SPA) for efficiently solving large-scale mechanism design problems in the first-mile ridesharing context. This paper also extends the SPA to solve generalized mechanism design problems, analyzes specific circumstances under which the SPA can sustain the game-theoretic properties, including “individual rationality” and “incentive compatibility”, and identifies its limitations. For the particular application in first-mile ridesharing, the SPA maintains the properties of “individual rationality” and “incentive compatibility”.

Mechanism design for first-mile ridesharing based on personalized requirements part I: Theoretical analysis in generalized scenarios,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.009,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Ridesharing is an effective transportation mode to provide first-mile accessibility to public transit and a low-cost, environment-friendly, and sustainable mobility service.

The mechanism accounts for passengers’ personalized requirements on different inconvenience attributes (e.g. the number of co-riders, extra in-vehicle travel time, and extra waiting time at the transit hub) of the service in determining the optimal vehicle-passenger matching and vehicle routing plan and customized pricing scheme. The proposed mechanism is proved to be individual rational, incentive compatible, and price non-negative. The three properties respectively indicate that passengers are willing to participate in the service, that honestly reporting personalized requirements is the optimal strategy, and that the service provider is guaranteed to receive revenue from the participants.

Vehicle assignment and relays for one-way electric car-sharing systems,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.004,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"One-way electric car-sharing systems are expected to be an integral part of future transportation systems, playing an important role in reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Owing to limited battery capacities and the lengthy charging process, an electric car-sharing system may not achieve the high vehicle utilization that a non-electric car-sharing system can achieve. We investigate two approaches to vehicle management, in order to circumvent battery constraints and to improve vehicle utilization rates in one-way electric car-sharing systems. In the first approach, we optimize vehicle assignment decisions, and in the second approach, we further allow vehicle relays, enabling users to complete longer trips by sequentially taking two vehicles. We propose a novel space–time–battery network flow model to determine optimal assignment and relay decisions. With an extra dimension for tracking each vehicle’s battery level, the proposed model is a single-commodity network flow model that is computationally amiable. To meet the requirement of quick responses, we propose an efficient algorithm that exploits an innovative diving heuristic to solve the resulting integer program. Numerical results show that when vehicle assignment and relays are optimized in an electric car-sharing system, we may achieve a comparable vehicle utilization rate as in a non-electric car-sharing system. In particular, optimizing vehicle assignment is essential when most trips are short trips, and vehicle relays are critical when users demand more long trips.",0191-2615,Not found
Trajectory-based traffic management inside an autonomous vehicle zone,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.012,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This paper studies a trajectory-based traffic management (TTM) problem for the purpose of managing traffic in a road facility reserved exclusively for autonomous vehicles (AV). The base TTM model aims to find optimal trajectories for multiple AVs while resolving inter-vehicle conflicts in the most generic way. The model is formulated as a mixed integer program (MIP) that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. To improve computational efficiency, a specialized algorithm based on the rolling horizon approach is also developed. We then show that the base TTM model can be easily extended to first accommodate scheduling decisions (the TTMS model) and to further impose equity constraints (the TTMSE model). For the simplest network and homogeneous users, solutions to TTMS and TTMSE are similar, respectively, to system optimal (SO) and user equilibrium (UE) solutions of Vickrey’s bottleneck model. Numerical experiments highlight TTM’s ability to simultaneously generate optimal trajectories for multiple vehicles.

Is more always better? The impact of vehicular trajectory completeness on car-following model calibration and validation,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.016,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This paper investigates the impact of vehicular trajectory completeness on car-following (CF) model calibration and validation. Synthetic data with different levels of trajectory completeness, i.e., different number of driving regimes, generated from carefully designed numerical experiments are mainly used to calibrate and validate the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and the Newell's CF model. Model calibration results suggest that some driving regimes in a trajectory impact calibration errors and the particular regime and its exact impact are model-specific, e.g., the presence of the standstill and the absence of the cruising regimes impacts IDM and Newell's CF model calibration errors, respectively. However, level of trajectory completeness has no impact. The acceleration behaviour of IDM drivers in different driving regimes is determined by more than one parameter, i.e., a one-to-one mapping between the parameters and the driving regimes do not exist. On the contrary, for Newell's CF model, there exists a one-to-one mapping between the cruising regime and the desired speed. Furthermore, level of trajectory completeness impacts IDM and Newell's CF model validation. More specifically, the average calibrated parameters obtained from more complete trajectories performs better in validation and leads to smaller validation errors. These findings can have a profound impact on how future research on CF model calibration and validation using trajectories should be planned and implemented.",0191-2615,Not found
Efficient train re-routing and rescheduling: Valid inequalities and reformulation of RECIFE-MILP,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.008,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The real-time Railway Traffic Management problem consists in finding suitable train routes and schedules to minimize delay propagation due to traffic perturbations.

These valid inequalities link the routing and scheduling binary variables. We also provide an instance in which they are able to represent all the facets of the projection of the convex hull of the problem in the subspace of the binary variables. Moreover, they allow reformulating the model based on a reduced number of scheduling binary variables. In an experimental analysis based on realistic instances representing traffic in four French infrastructures, we observe that the merit of addition of valid inequalities depends on the specific case-study at hand, and that the reduction of the number of binary variables in general boosts the performance of RECIFE-MILP significantly.",0191-2615,Not found
Fleet deployment and demand fulfillment for container shipping liners,10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.011,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This paper models and solves a fleet deployment and demand fulfillment problem for container shipping liners with consideration of the potential overload risk of containers.

Several realistic limiting factors such as the fleet size and the available berth and yard resources at the ports are also considered. A non-linear mixed integer programming (MIP) model is suggested to optimally determine the transportation demand fulfillment scale for each origin-destination pair, as well as the ship deployment plan along each route, with an objective incorporating revenue, fixed operation cost, fuel consumption cost, holding cost for transhipped containers, and extra berth and yard costs. Two efficient algorithms are then developed to solve the non-linear MIP model for different instance sizes.

Stochastic bus schedule coordination considering demand assignment and rerouting of passengers,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.010,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Schedule coordination is a proven strategy to improve the connectivity and service quality for bus networks, whereas current research mostly optimizes schedule design using the a priori knowledge of users’ routings and ignores the behavioural reactions to coordination status. This study proposes a novel stochastic bus schedule coordination design with demand assignment and passenger rerouting in case of transfer failure. To this end, we develop a bi-level programming model in which the schedule design (headways and slack times) and passenger route choice are determined simultaneously via two travel strategies: non-adaptive and adaptive routings. In the second strategy, transfer passengers would modify their paths in case of missed connection. In this way, the expected network flow distribution is dependent on both the transfer reliability and network structure. The upper-level problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program with the objective of minimizing the total system cost, including both operation cost and user cost, while the lower-level problem is route choice (pre-trip and on-trip) model for timed-transfer service. A more generalized inter-ratio headways scenario is also taken into account. A heuristic algorithm and the method of successive averages are comprehensively applied for solving the bi-level model. Results show that when the rerouting behaviour is considered, more cost-effective schedule coordination scheme with less slack times can be achieved, and ignoring such effect would underestimate the efficacy of schedule coordination scheme.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal network-level traffic signal control: A benders decomposition-based solution algorithm,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.012,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"This paper formulates the network-level traffic signal timing optimization problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP) and presents a customized methodology to solve it with a tight optimality gap. The MINLP is based on the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) network loading concept and captures the fundamental flow-density diagram of the CTM explicitly by considering closed-form constraints in the model and thus, eliminates the flow holding-back problem. The proposed solution algorithm is based on the Benders decomposition technique and decomposes the original MINLP to an equivalent Integer Program (IP) (Master problem), and a new MINLP (Primal problem). We will show that the new MINLP has only one optimal non-holding-back solution that can be found by a CTM simulation run. We will prove that the proposed solution technique guarantees convergence to optimal solutions with a finite number of iterations. Furthermore, we propose a dual estimation algorithm for the new MINLP (the Primal problem), which utilizes a simulation-based approach to generate Benders cuts instead of solving a complex optimization program. We applied the proposed solution technique to a simulated network of 20 intersections under various demand patterns and observed an optimality gap of at most 2% under all tested conditions.

Optimization of traffic sensor location for complete link flow observability in traffic network considering sensor failure,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.004,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The full link flow observability problem is to identify the minimum set of traffic sensors to be installed in links in a road traffic network. The sensors are used to both monitor the flow of observed links and to provide flow information for the link flow inference of unobserved links. Unavoidably, the traffic sensors deployed in a traffic network are subject to failure which leads to missing the link flow observation of observed links as well as the inability to infer the link flow of unobserved links. This study aims to identify the minimum set of links in a traffic network to be instrumented with two different types of counting sensors (basic and advanced sensors) to reach full link flow observability while minimizing the effect of sensor failure on the link flow inference of unobserved links. Mathematically, we formulate two objective functions including min-max and min-sum functions. The first function attempts to minimize the maximum effect of sensor failure on the link flow inference of unobserved links while the second one minimizes the expected number of unobserved links where flow cannot be inferred due to the failure of sensors. We select the genetic algorithm (GA) as a well-known heuristic to solve the proposed optimization model. The results recommend minimizing the number of sensors required for the link flow inference of each unobserved link as well as installing advanced sensors on links involved in the link flow inference of multiple unobserved links. We also develop a new objective function to reflect that links in a traffic network can be either minor or major roads with different levels of importance. The results suggest installing more advanced sensors on the major roads as well as minimizing the number of major roads included in the set of unobserved links. Concerning the availability of route flow information in a network, we consider the effect of this information on evaluating the sensor deployment in a network. To maintain full link flow observability of a traffic network if any sensor fails, we study the location and type of additional sensors introduced as redundant sensors, which are more than the minimum required for full link flow observability. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the proposed model for the partial observability problem in which the full link flow observability conditions are not satisfied.",0191-2615,Not found
Morning commute problem with queue-length-dependent bottleneck capacity,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.009,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"When traffic control is demand-responsive, a bottleneck can have a queue-length-dependent capacity.

It has been found that multiple equilibria exist when D 2 < D 1. Their stability has been preliminarily studied via the day-to-day dynamics, and we found it is likely that only the equilibrium state with the lowest cost is stable against large disturbances. In the case where D 2 = D 1, there is no multiple user equilibrium state, and the capacity does not change more than twice. Moreover, there exists a parameter range in which there is no solution unless the bottleneck capacity can switch back and forth instantaneously.

Integrating Lagrangian and Eulerian observations for passenger flow state estimation in an urban rail transit network: A space-time-state hyper network-based assignment approach,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.015,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"In this study, we focus on one of practically important research problems of integrating Lagrangian and Eulerian observations for passenger flow state estimation in an urban rail transit network. The task is accomplished by using a triple of flow, density, and speed to construct a discretized passenger flow state, further constructing a space-time-state (STS) hyper network so that we can utilize a better defined three-dimensional solution space to integrate structurally heterogeneous data sources. The monitoring data include passenger transaction records and identification space-time samples observed over a possible range of a few hours from origins to destinations (Lagrangian observations), and time-dependent passenger counts collected at some key bottleneck locations (Eulerian observations). To describe the complex urban-rail passenger flow evolution, passenger traveling and fixed sensor state transition processes can be unified within a STS path representation. To estimate the consistent system internal states between two different types of observations, we formulate a hyper network-based flow assignment model in a generalized least squares estimation framework. For applications in large-scale transportation networks, we decompose the proposed model into three easy-to-solve sub-problems. The proposed model is applied to a real-world case based on the Beijing subway network with complete smart card data for each passenger at his/her origin and destination and time-dependent passenger counts in several key transfer corridors, while the specific space-time trajectories of all passengers and high-resolution time-dependent congestion levels at platforms, in trains, and in transfer corridors are estimated. This proposed passenger flow state inference method can provide a rich set of state inferences for advanced transit planning and management applications, for instance, passenger flow control, adaptive travel demand management, and real-time train scheduling.",0191-2615,Not found
An algorithm for reliable shortest path problem with travel time correlations,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.011,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Reliable shortest path (RSP) problem reflects the variability of travel time and is more realistic than standard shortest path problem which considers only the average travel time. This paper describes an algorithm for solving the mean-standard deviation RSP problem considering link travel time correlations. The proposed algorithm adopts the Lagrangian substitution and covariance matrix decomposition technique to deal with the difficulty resulting from non-linearity and non-additivity of the Mixed Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP). The problem is decomposed into a standard shortest path problem and a convex optimization problem whose optimal solution is proved and the Lagrangian multipliers ranges are related to the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to further speed up the algorithm. The complexity of the original problem is notably reduced by the proposed algorithm such that it can be scaled to large networks. In addition to the sub-gradient Lagrangian multiplier updating strategy integrated with projection, a novel one based on the deep-cut ellipsoid method is proposed as well. Numerical experiments on large-scale networks show the efficacy of the algorithm in terms of relative duality gap and computational time. Besides, there is evidence showing that, though having longer computational time, the ellipsoid updating method tends to obtain better solutions compared with the sub-gradient method. The algorithm outperforms the existing one-to-one Lagrangian relaxation-based RSP algorithms and the exact Outer Approximation method in the literature.",0191-2615,Not found

A Markov decision process approach to vacant taxi routing with e-hailing,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.013,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The optimal routing of a vacant taxi is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem to account for long-term profit over the full working period. The state is defined by the node at which a vacant taxi is located, and action is the link to take out of the node. State transition probabilities depend on passenger matching probabilities and passenger destination probabilities. The probability that a vacant taxi is matched with a passenger during the traversal of a link is calculated based on temporal Poisson arrivals of passengers and spatial Poisson distributions of competing vacant taxis. Passenger destination probabilities are calculated directly using observed fractions of passengers going to destinations from a given origin. The MDP problem is solved by value iteration resulting in an optimal routing policy, and the computational efficiency is improved by utilizing parallelized matrix operations. The proposed model and an efficient implementation of the value iteration algorithm are tested in a case study with parameters derived from GPS trajectories of over 12,000 taxis in Shanghai, China for a study period of 5:30 - 11:30 am on a typical weekday. The optimal routing policy is compared with three heuristics based on simulated trajectories. Results show that the optimal routing policy improves average unit profit by 23.0% and 8.4% over the random walk and local hotspot heuristic respectively; and improves occupancy rate by 23.8% and 8.3% respectively.

Promoting social equity with cyclic tradable credits,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.002,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"This study manages the network mobility with link-based cyclic tradable credit scheme (CTCS) in a general transportation network. Different from most previous studies on tradable credit schemes, which always assume an independent periodic credit distribution scheme to maintain the circulation of the credits in the system with nonnegative credit charges, in our model the compensatory credits could be charged from (i.e. positive credit rate) or subsidized to (i.e. negative credit rate) the travelers. With the introduction of cyclic tradable credit scheme, we pursue three objectives: system optimization, social equity, and most importantly, credit internal cycling without periodic credit expiration and distribution. We formulate a minimization problem to solve for the scheme to fulfill the three objectives and discuss the existence of the solution via the dual problem. We prove that there is no negative cycle under the proposed CTCS, and when the origin-destination (OD) matrix of the network satisfies certain conditions, the Pareto-improving solution exists. However, for general networks with origins and destinations overlapping with each other, the solution may not always exist. Nevertheless, in contrast to several traditional toll schemes, the equity among the travelers from different OD pairs under the proposed CTCS is still improved.

We formulate it as a fair cost allocation problem through the lens of the cooperative game theory. A special property of the cooperative ridesharing game is that its characteristic function values are calculated by solving an optimization problem. Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special attention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction in the system. Due to its computational intractability, we break the problem into a master-subproblem structure and two subproblems are developed to generate constraints for the master problem. We propose a coalition generation procedure to find the nucleolus and approximate nucleolus of the game. Experimental results showed that when the game has a non-empty core, in the approximate nucleolus scheme the coalitions are computed only when it is necessary and the approximate procedure produces the actual nucleolus. And when the game has an empty core, the approximate nucleolus is close to the actual one. Regardless of the emptiness of the game, our algorithm needs to generate only a small fraction (1.6%) of the total coalition constraints to compute the approximate nucleolus.

Air-rail revenue sharing in a multi-airport system: Effects on traffic and social welfare,10.1016/j.trb.2018.10.002,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The rapid development of high-speed rail (HSR) in the past decade has greatly promoted regional connectivity by linking airports that are previously independent of each other, thus facilitating the formation of a multi-airport system (MAS). As a result, air-HSR complementarity may serve as a way to efficiently re-allocate traffic within the newly generated MAS and relieve airport congestion. This paper develops an analytical framework for a revenue sharing mechanism between an airline and an HSR operator with each retaining its own objective function. We investigate such air-HSR revenue sharing under various scenarios and show that when the HSR operator is social welfare oriented, or when the airlines are monopoly in the MAS, the revenue sharing agreement is more likely to be reached. Furthermore, airport congestion has an important implication for air-HSR revenue sharing in the sense that such cooperation is welfare-enhancing by efficiently diverting passengers from congested airports to uncongested ones. Finally, the Pareto efficient range and Pareto improvement range of revenue sharing amount are identified, and the implication for negotiations between airlines and HSR are discussed.",0191-2615,Not found
Managing connected and automated vehicles at isolated intersections: From reservation- to optimization-based methods,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.002,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Reservation-based methods with simple policies such as first-come-first-service (FCFS) have been proposed in the literature to manage connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at isolated intersections. However, a comprehensive analysis of intersection capacity and vehicle delay under FCFS-based control is missing, especially under high traffic demand. To address this problem, this study adopts queueing theory and analytically shows that such method is incapable of handling high demand with multiple conflicting traffic streams. Furthermore, an optimization model is proposed to optimally serve CAVs arriving at an intersection for delay minimization. This study then compares the performance of the proposed optimization-based control with reservation-based control as well as conventional vehicle-actuated control at different demand levels. Simulation results show that the proposed optimization-based control performs best and it has noticeable advantages over the other two control methods.

Prism-based path set restriction for solving Markovian traffic assignment problem,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.002,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This paper deals with a main limitation of Markovian traffic assignment (MTA) models: when the network includes cyclic structures and the link costs are small enough, the fact that the MTA models assign traffic flows to all feasible paths causes computational challenges. This study addresses this issue by proposing a method of restricting path set based on the concept of choice-based prism. To achieve a prism-based path set, a novel network description and the constraints are introduced. These are flexible and compatible with the MTA operation, meaning that our method does not extinguish the mathematical and computational advantages of the MTA models. Our network description allows the expected minimum cost to take a value specific for each state, or a pair of node and choice-stage. This enables us to perform traffic assignment with a simple solution procedure, regardless of parameter setting or network structure.

In such scenarios, body orientation often differs from walking direction, e.g., a pedestrian may step sideways. The deviation between body orientation and walking direction during collision avoidance was studied by quantitatively evaluating the body rotation for counter-flows in narrow corridors. Simple experiments, in which two pedestrians passed each other, were conducted. It was found that pedestrians rotated their bodies when the corridor width was smaller than the sum of the widths of the two pedestrians. This behavior was explained by analyzing the geometry of two ellipses circumscribing each other in a narrow corridor. A preliminary model was developed, and the deviation between the body orientation and walking direction during passing was successfully simulated. Finally, a cross-flow experiment, which is much more complex and realistic than the passing experiments, was performed; it was confirmed that body rotation behavior is also a critical factor in complex and realistic scenarios.",0191-2615,Not found

The MVADP algorithm reduces labels by integrating the calculation of pricing problems for all vehicle types. In addition, to rapidly obtain a tighter upper bound, we propose an integer branch method. For each branch, we solve the master problem with the integer constraint by the CPLEX solver using the columns produced by column generation. We retain the smaller of the obtained integer solution and the current upper bound, and the branches are thus reduced significantly.

The SPRP is a multi-objective, time and load dependent, fleet size and mix PRP, with time windows, flexible departure times, and multi-trips on congested urban road networks, that aims at minimising three objective functions pertaining to (i) vehicle hiring cost, (ii) total amount of fuel consumed, and (iii) total makespan (duration) of the routes. The paper focuses on a key complication arising from emissions minimisation in a time and load dependent setting, corresponding to the identification of the full set of the eligible road-paths between consecutive truck visits a priori, and to tackle the issue proposes new combinatorial results leading to the development of an exact Path Elimination Procedure (PEP).

This study aims at developing a recoverable robust optimization approach for the weekly berth and quay crane planning problem. In order to build systematic recoverable robustness, a proactive baseline schedule with reactive recovery costs has been suggested. The uncertainty of vessel arrivals and the fluctuation in the container handling rate of quay cranes are considered. The baseline schedule includes berthing positions, times and quay crane assignments for all vessels along with vessel-specific buffer times and buffer quay cranes.

It is found that the user equilibrium coincides with the system optimum when the platform minimizes the system disutility with VCS, and the corresponding platform's profit is negative with high travel demand. Considering this, the optimal VCS when the platform minimizes the system disutility with zero profit is examined. Moreover, to ensure ridesharing participants commute with no queue, they need to depart at the two tails of the departure time window.

Flow exchanges in multi-reservoir systems with spillbacks,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.014,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Large-scale traffic flow models based on the Network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) are usually grounded on the bathtub analogy and a conservation equation for vehicle accumulation inside a given urban area. Recent studies have proposed a different approach where the MFD defines the spatial mean speed that is shared by all vehicles in a region while their traveling distance is tracked individually. The former approach is also referred to as “accumulation-based” while the latter is usually named “trip-based”. While extensive studies of both model properties have been carried out for the single reservoir case (a unique region), the multi-reservoir setting still requires some research effort in particular to clearly understand how inflow merge at a reservoir entry and outflow diverge at exit should be managed. These two components play a significant role in the evolution of the whole system, when flows are exchanged between multiple reservoirs. One of the crucial questions is to ensure that congestion properly propagates backwards through a succession of reservoirs when oversaturated situations are observed. In this paper, we propose a thorough analysis of how to handle congestion propagation in the accumulation-based framework with several trip lengths or categories, e.g. internal and external trips. This allows to derive a congestion propagation model for the trip-based approach in a multi-reservoir setting. Based on theoretical considerations and simulation studies, we develop a consistent framework to restrict the inflow and adapt to oversaturated traffic conditions in a reservoir including several trip lengths. Two inflow merging schemes are investigated. The first one is inspired from the existing literature and shares the available supply based on the demand flow ratio at the entry boundary. It is called “exogeneous” in contrast to the second “endogenous” scheme, which shares the supply with respect to the internal accumulation ratio on the different routes. At the reservoir exit, a new outflow diverging scheme is also introduced to better reproduce the effect of queuing vehicles that are prevented from exiting the reservoir when congestion spills back from neighboring reservoirs. Compared to the conventional outflow model, our new approach proves to avoid unrealistic gridlocks when the reservoir becomes oversaturated. Both entry and exit flow models are investigated in details considering the accumulation-based and trip-based frameworks. Finally, the most consistent approach is compared with two other existing MFD models for multiple reservoirs. This demonstrates the importance of properly handling entry and exit flows at boundaries.",0191-2615,Not found
A stochastic simulation-based optimization method for equitable and efficient network-wide signal timing under uncertainties,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.001,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The equity of right-of-way is an important topic in traffic management and control. With the balance consideration of traffic equity and efficiency, which are respectively evaluated by the Atkinson index and average travel time, this study proposes a bi-objective signal timing simulation-based optimization (SO) model under uncertainties, and solve it by a bi-objective stochastic simulation-based optimization (BOSSO) method. In this method, two types of surrogate models (i.e., regressing Kriging model and quadratic regression model) are used to capture the complicated mapping relationship between decision variables and bi-objectives, respectively in the whole variable domain and in the local trust-region. Meanwhile, the incorporation of the global regressing Kriging model and an adaptive selector helps to predict bi-objective values of untested samples and re-estimate simulated samples in the local trust-region, which can save great computational costs and smooth stochastic noises. Moreover, the non-interactive role of a decision maker is taken to generate more Pareto optimal solutions around his/her desired bi-objective values. Through the algorithm comparison for a benchmark bi-objective stochastic optimization problem, the proposed BOSSO method is validated to outperform three other counterparts (i.e., NSGA-II, BOTR and BOEGO) under the same simulation costs. In real-field experiments, an urban road network with 15 signalized and five non-signalized intersections in Changsha, China is modeled by VISSIM. After the well calibration of the microscopic traffic simulation model, the network-wide bi-objective signal timing stochastic SO problems with and without coordination are solved by BOSSO. Numerical results indicate that compared with the real-field case, the average travel time and Atkinson index are reduced respectively by at most 13.48% and 23.49% for optimized non-coordinated signal plans, and respectively by at most 25.58% and 2.83% for optimized coordinated ones. It is further validated that under variable traffic volumes, the non-coordinated signal plan can well improve both traffic efficiency and equity, and the coordinated one is capable to improve traffic efficiency at a larger degree but sacrifice traffic equity. Moreover, the balance analyses show the existence of competing relationship between bi-objectives, and BOSSO is confirmed to outperform NSGA-II, BOTR and BOEGO in searching the better Pareto optimal signal plans under the same budged simulations. In conclusion, BOSSO is promising to address bi-objective optimization problems characterized by costly evaluation, high dimensions and stochastic noises.",0191-2615,Not found
Capacity investment decisions of two competing ports under uncertainty: A strategic real options approach,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.007,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Ports worldwide operate in an uncertain environment and compete with nearby ports to attract cargo. The extent of competition is influenced by the geographical location and differentiated services offered at ports. In this paper, we study the flexible investment decision of two ports with an option to delay investment in a capacity level that is not ex-ante determined. Ports compete on quantity (Cournot competition) under demand uncertainty and congestion. In a leader-follower timing game, we consider both the entry deterrence and accommodation strategies for the leader port. If one of the ports only has a limited cost advantage, the leader role will be endogenous and will be the result of preemption. Uncertainty is included in the model by a geometric Brownian motion, allowing us to analyse the impact of growth and uncertainty (variability) independently. We find that higher growth, uncertainty and port customers’ aversion to waiting lead to a larger project installed at a later moment. If competition intensifies however, the option value of waiting is reduced, leading to earlier investment, but surprisingly also in less capacity. Finally, if more shares of the ports are publicly owned, the investment will be larger and will take place earlier.",0191-2615,Not found

How to better represent preferences in choice models: The contributions to preference heterogeneity attributable to the presence of process heterogeneity,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.007,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Discrete choice studies, with rare exception, commonly assume that agents act as if sources of observed utility are captured through a linear in parameters and additive in attributes (LPAA) form, with some interactions. A growing number of transport (and other) choice studies have investigated one or more alternative processing rules adopted by agents in arriving at a choice, raising interest in how best to represent the utility expressions in a joint process and outcome choice model. Given the popular and appealing random parameter treatment of LPAA in mixed logit as a way of identifying non-systematic preference heterogeneity in a sample, this paper considers the possibility that we might be able to interact specific process heuristics with LPAA to uncover sources of systematic preference heterogeneity hidden in the standard LPAA form, and hence establish a link between the LPAA form and candidate process heuristics, offering a way to embellish and hence clarify the contributions to preference heterogeneity attributable to the presence of process heterogeneity. Specifically, we are interested in the extent to which there is a systematic relationship between the simple LPAA form and the more complex (albeit behaviourally realistic) process heuristics emerging in the transport literature which we call conditioning by random process heterogeneity (CRPH). In this paper, in addition to LPAA, we consider two process heuristics - Value Learning, and Relative Advantage Maximisation - with an overlay to account for risk attitudes, perceptual conditioning, and overt experience. The findings, using two data sets, suggest that empirically there exists a significant attribute-specific relationship between preference heterogeneity identified through specific process heuristics and through the LPAA assumption.",0191-2615,Not found
Estimation of regional trip length distributions for the calibration of the aggregated network traffic models,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.009,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The calibration of trip lengths is an important challenge for multi-regional MFD-based applications, as it can influence the dynamics of regional densities (and speeds). Existing research has not paid significant attention in the topic, giving opportunities for answering some fundamental questions. In this paper, we propose an original methodology to explicitly determine trip length distributions based on a subset of trips in the city network and its partitioning. Since the full description of all realized trips is difficult to estimate for a large city network, we propose to define a set of virtual trips corresponding to a full coverage of potential local origin-destination pairs and shortest-paths in distance. We investigate how different levels of information can influence the accuracy of the multi-regional dynamic MFD-based models, through the estimated trip length distributions. This information ranges from regional trip lengths without any information of origin, destination, previous or next regions up to the specific regional path associated to each trip. We test this methodology on a simulated environment with a significant amount of real information for a network with 757 links that corresponds to the 6th district of Lyon. We first provide guidance on how to properly define the set of virtual trips. We show that a single average trip length is not representative of all possible trip lengths estimated by the most detailed levels of information for one region. We also highlight that the first level of information assigns similar trip lengths for regional paths that are composed by the same regions, but in a reverse ordered sequence. Nevertheless, this is not the case for the most detailed levels of information since they capture the directed links city network topology. We propose a procedure to update the trip lengths when an update of the regional Origin-Destination matrix changes, without a need for a full recalculation. We also investigate the influence of the trip length tuning on the traffic dynamics of the regional network. The traffic states are modeled by a trip-based MFD model. We show that the setting of the trip lengths influences the traffic dynamics in the regions. Moreover, the traffic conditions predicted by the two most detailed levels of information are close.",0191-2615,Not found
"Quasi-dynamic traffic assignment with spatial queueing, control and blocking back",10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.018,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This paper introduces a steady-state, fixed (or inelastic) demand equilibrium model with explicit link-exit capacities, explicit bottleneck or queueing delays and explicit bounds on queue storage capacities. The model is a quasi-dynamic model. The link model at the heart of this quasi-dynamic equilibrium model is a spatial queueing model, which takes account of the space taken up by queues both when there is no blocking back and also when there is blocking back. The paper shows that if this quasi-dynamic model is utilised then for any feasible demand there is an equilibrium solution, provided (i) queue storage capacities are large or (ii) prices are used to help impose capacity restrictions; the prices either remove queueing delays entirely or just reduce spatial queues sufficiently to ensure that blocking back does not occur at equilibrium. Similar results, but now involving the P0 control policy (introduced in Smith (1979a, 1987)) and two new variations of this policy (i.e., the spatial P0 control policy, and the biased spatial P0 control policy) are obtained. In these results, the control policies allow green-times to vary in response to prices as well as spatial queueing delays. These three policies are also tested on a small simple network. In these tests, the biased spatial version of P0 is much the best in reducing equilibrium delays (on this simple network). The paper further illustrates how the spatial queueing model works on simple networks with different merge models; it is demonstrated that equilibrium may be prevented by certain (fixed ratio) merge models. It is also shown in this case that equilibrium may be imposed on just the controlled area itself by a variety of (merge model, gating strategy) combinations. Opportunities for developing such combined gating and merging control strategies are finally discussed.",0191-2615,Not found
"Steady-state link travel time methods: Formulation, derivation, classification, and unification",10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.014,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Travel times are one of the most important outputs of transport planning models, especially in a strategic context. It is therefore paramount that the methods that underpin the construction of travel times are well understood. A plethora of methods exists to extract and/or construct travel times given some underlying network loading procedure, also known as the traffic flow propagation model. However, the relation between these different travel time methods and the consistency between such methods has received relatively little attention in the literature. This might in part be due to the many different traffic flow propagation models in existence, ranging from vehicle based (microscopic), to flow based (macroscopic), and models that explicitly account for the time varying nature of traffic flows (dynamic) to models that do not (static). In this work, we limit ourselves to flow based, i.e. macroscopic, traffic flow models. Within this modelling paradigm we consider dynamic, semi-dynamic, and static traffic flow propagation formulations used to construct link travel times. The semi-dynamic and static approaches are considered as more aggregate versions of the dynamic formulation. Within this context we formulate a unified (link) travel time formulation that is consistent across these three modelling paradigms under the assumption of steady-state flow conditions. The dynamic link travel time formulation is based on a recent state-of-the-art continuous time macroscopic dynamic network loading model. In the dynamic model we assume steady-state conditions to remain consistent with steady-state semi-dynamic and static approaches. This allows us to derive semi-dynamic link travel time formulations from our dynamic model, while the static formulation is derived from its semi-dynamic counterpart. Throughout this work we explore link travel times from three different perspectives; an experienced perspective, which actively tracks the tail of a physical queue, and two functional perspectives, both of which do not require explicit queue tracking. Based on the existing literature and proposed formulations, a classification framework is proposed allowing one to compare existing (and future) methods in the literature in an objective fashion. We provide a number of explicit derivations of existing model formulations that can be considered special cases of our unified approach. A numerical example across the different perspectives is included and a significant number of representative existing methods in the literature has been classified based on our proposed framework for the reader's convenience.",0191-2615,Not found
Two-phase optimal solutions for ship speed and trim optimization over a voyage using voyage report data,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.004,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"In the daily operations of a shipping line, minimization of a ship's bunker fuel consumption over a voyage comprising a series of waypoints by adjusting its sailing speeds and trim settings plays a critical role in ship voyage management. To quantify the synergetic influence of sailing speed, displacement, trim, and weather and sea conditions on ship fuel efficiency, we first develop a tailored method to build two artificial neural network models using ship voyage report data. We proceed to address the ship sailing speed and trim optimization problem by putting forward three viable countermeasures within an effective two-phase optimal solution framework: sailing speeds of the ship are optimized in an on-shore planning phase, whereas trim optimization is conducted dynamically by the captain in real time when she/he observes the actual weather and sea conditions at sea. In the on-shore speed optimization problem, simultaneous optimization of sailing speeds and trim settings is beneficial in suggesting more informed sailing speeds because both factors influence a ship's fuel efficiency. In the countermeasure 3 proposed by this study, we address speed and trim optimization simultaneously by proposing a two-step global optimization algorithm that combines dynamic programming and a state-of-the-art simulation-based optimization technique. Numerical experiments with two 9000-TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) containerships show that (a) the proposed countermeasure 1 saves 4.96% and 5.83% of bunker fuel for the two ships, respectively, compared to the real situation; (b) the proposed countermeasure 2 increases the bunker fuel savings to 7.63% and 7.57%, respectively; and (c) the bunker fuel savings with Countermeasure 3 attain 8.25% on average. These remarkable bunker fuel savings can also translate into significant mitigation of CO2 emissions.",0191-2615,Not found
Planning facility location under generally correlated facility disruptions: Use of supporting stations and quasi-probabilities,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.001,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Many real-world service facilities are subject to probabilistic disruptions. Such disruptions often exhibit correlations that arise from shared external hazards or direct interactions among these facilities. This paper builds an overarching methodological framework for reliable facility location design under correlated facility disruptions. We first incorporate and extend the concepts of supporting station structure and quasi-probability from Li et al. (2013) and Xie et al. (2015), such that any correlated facility disruptions (positive and/or negative) can be equivalently represented by independent failures of a layer of properly constructed supporting stations, which are virtually added to the original facility system for capturing the effect of correlations among facilities. We then develop a compact mixed-integer mathematical model to optimize the facility location and customer assignment decisions in order to strike a balance between system reliability and cost efficiency. Lagrangian relaxation based algorithms, including modules for obtaining upper bound and lower bounds of relaxed subproblems, are proposed to effectively solve the optimization model. Numerical case studies are carried out to demonstrate the methodology, to test the performance of the framework, and to draw managerial insights.",0191-2615,Not found
Pedestrian crowd flows in shared spaces: Investigating the impact of geometry based on micro and macro scale measures,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.019,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The motion dynamics of humans in crowded built environments during evacuations are impacted by individuals’ interactions with the physical environment particularly when the geometric space of the movement is restrictive. Controlled laboratory experiments have recently been employed as a reliable data provision approach in this field. Using this approach and based on data obtained from 54 experimental scenarios, this study investigates a range of questions in relation to the collective motion of pedestrian crowds in restricted shares spaces. This includes the role of the layout of the spatial constraints as well as the influence of the movement speed level in the evacuation performance of pedestrian facilities. We explored these questions particularly for dense crowds and based on both micro-scale and macro-scale measures of pedestrian traffic. Our analyses showed that traffic efficiency is demonstrably sensitive to the physical features of the merging passages as well as the desired speed level of the crowd. The patterns of influence of the geometric constraints on traffic efficiency were by and large common across all three speed regimes that we examined. Our results also showed that under specific geometric constraints, the formation of blockages (i.e., longer queue or longer time interval between the passage of two consecutive pedestrians) is more likely. An inspection of the trajectory patterns revealed that this could be attributable to the extent to which the two flows had to mix up with each other in order to be able to merge and share the space. Certain layouts, particularly symmetric layouts, allowed the two flows to keep their separate ways after the entered the shared space, whereas other setups engendered a more noticeable mixture of movement trajectories in order for the two flows to be able to travel through the shared area. The findings have applications for the design of safe passageways when dense crowd flows enter restrictive areas.",0191-2615,Not found
Networked sensor data error estimation,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.013,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Nowadays, the effectiveness of any smart transportation management or control strategy would heavily depend on reliable traffic data collected by sensors. Two problems regarding sensor data quality have received attention: first, the problem of identifying malfunctioning sensors; second, reconstruction of traffic flow. Most existing studies concerned about identifying completely malfunctioning sensors whose data should be discarded. In this paper, we focus on the problem of error detection and data recovery of partially malfunctioning sensors that could provide valuable information. By integrating a sensor measurement error model and a transportation network model, we propose a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) based estimation approach to determine the parameters of systematic and random errors of traffic sensors in a road network. The proposed method allows flexible data aggregation that ameliorates identification and accuracy. The estimates regarding both systematic and random errors are utilized to conduct hypothesis test on sensor health and to estimate true traffic flows with observed counts. The results of three network examples with different scales demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in a large variety of scenarios.",0191-2615,Not found
Fundamental diagram estimation by using trajectories of probe vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.005,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The fundamental diagram (FD), also known as the flow–density relation, is one of the most fundamental concepts in the traffic flow theory. Conventionally, FDs are estimated by using data collected by detectors. However, detectors’ installation sites are generally limited due to their high cost, making practical implementation of traffic flow theoretical works difficult. On the other hand, probe vehicles can collect spatially continuous data from wide-ranging area, and thus they can be useful sensors for large-scale traffic management. In this study, a novel framework of FD estimation by using probe vehicle data is developed. It determines FD parameters based on trajectories of randomly sampled vehicles and a given jam density that is easily inferred by other data sources. A computational algorithm for estimating a triangular FD based on actual, potentially noisy traffic data obtained by multiple probe vehicles is developed. The algorithm was empirically validated by using real-world probe vehicle data on a highway. The results suggest that the algorithm accurately and robustly estimates the FD parameters.",0191-2615,Not found
Operational design for shuttle systems with modular vehicles under oversaturated traffic: Discrete modeling method,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.015,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Existing peak/off-peak based schedules in urban mass transit systems feature two types of dispatch headways and a fixed vehicle capacity across the operational horizon, which lowers their service quality and causes significant energy waste. A promising cure to this challenge is to jointly design the dispatch headways and vehicle capacities in urban transit schedules. Chen et al. (2018) propose a continuous modeling method to solve the near-optimum solutions to and shed analytical insights into this joint design problem. Based on the theoretical properties discovered in the preceding paper, this paper formulates the joint design problem as a mixed integer linear programming model that can yield exact solutions to the optimal design with a discretized time representation. Further, a customized DP algorithm is proposed to solve this model. Similar to other problems that can be solved by DP algorithms, the “curse of dimensionality” also exists in the investigated problem since the queue length, as a state variable, may have a large set of possible values at each stage, which may lead to dramatically increasing computational time in solving the problem. To expedite the solution speed of the DP algorithm, we propose a set of valid inequalities based on the relationship between the queue length and vehicle capacity. These valid inequalities can reduce the unboundedly increasing state space into a narrow band and thus dramatically expedite the DP algorithm. With two sets of numerical experiments, we show that the discrete model can be solved by the customized DP algorithm to optimality with much less computation time compared with a state-of-the-art commercial solver, Gurobi. The analysis also reveals that the input parameters affect the effectiveness of dynamic capacity design under oversaturated and unsaturated traffic systems in a similar way despite some minor differences.",0191-2615,Not found
Adaptation to climate change effects and competition between ports: Invest now or later?,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.016,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"We investigate the size and timing of investment in adaptation to climate change effects for ports, when efficiency of investment is uncertain and the market is competitive. We develop a two-period real options game model with two “landlord” ports, each consisting of a port authority (PA) and a downstream terminal operator company (TOC). The two PAs compete with each other at the upstream level, and the two TOCs downstream. The model assumes an accumulation of information about the adaptation projects over time, allowing decision-makers to improve the investment efficiency. The results show that the optimal timing of investment is significantly influenced by the disaster occurrence probability, the potential information gain over time and the level of competition. When competition is intensified, it is optimal for ports to invest earlier than later. However, immediate investments are less preferred when competition is weak, even lesser in the presence of information accumulation. Waiting until the next period to invest is also a better option if the disaster occurrence probability is low or if the shippers’ expected disaster losses are negligible. Moreover, information accumulation reduces the ports’ investment size, while improving the discounted welfare associated with late investments. These results hold for both the private and public ports and for simultaneous investments by the PAs. In most cases, social welfare is much higher with immediate investments, mainly because of the associated positive spillover effects on the surrounding areas and other sectors of economy. The implications of the assumption of Knightian uncertainty for the disaster occurrence probability are discussed.",0191-2615,Not found
The morning commute problem with endogenous shared autonomous vehicle penetration and parking space constraint,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.001,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Morning commuting trips commonly involve a number of transportation modes and departure times. This study extends the standard bottleneck model by considering both regular and shared autonomous vehicles with and without parking space constraint, taking into account the travel time-dependent fuel cost that is associated with each vehicle. In this study the parking space constraint has no effect on shared autonomous vehicles and only commuters who share autonomous vehicles exhibit ridesharing behavior, differing from those utilizing regular vehicles. The dynamic departure patterns and endogenous penetration rates associated with shared autonomous vehicles are determined with respect to parking capacity. Analytical results not only provide several important propositions, but also include the optimal solutions for parking capacity and ridesharing occupancy from the perspective of the system optimum in terms of various indicators, under which parking capacity is a binding constraint, and the first shared autonomous vehicle arrives at the bottleneck as the last regular vehicle leaves. This work is expected not only to motivate related research, but also to promote the development of new strategies and methods for allocating a limited number of parking spaces and regulating the travel behavior of commuters in urban areas.",0191-2615,Not found

We formulate this model by considering two approaches: combining a discrete-time autoregressive process of order one (i.e., a linear stochastic difference equation) with the continuous logit model, which leads to the discrete-time autoregressive continuous logit; and combining a continuous-time autoregressive process (i.e., a linear stochastic differential equation), known in the stochastic process literature as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with the continuous logit model, which leads to the continuous-time autoregressive continuous logit. The autoregressive nature of the model is in its error structure, allowing correlations in unobserved heterogeneity. For both approaches, we study their properties numerically.

Simultaneous correction of the time and location bias associated with a reported crash by exploiting the spatiotemporal evolution of travel speed,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.011,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Accurate occurrence time and location of a reported crash are critical to effective crash analysis. Although there has been a proliferation of studies that attempt to correct the bias associated with a reported crash, most, if not all, of them focus exclusively on correcting the location bias. In this research, we propose to simultaneously correct the time and location bias associated with a reported crash, which is new to the literature. In our approach, we first follow standard procedures to identify the set of candidate links in the vicinity of the reported crash location. We then develop an integer programming model with a set of novel constraints to identify the candidate whose spatiotemporal evolution of travel speed is most congruent with the occurrence of a crash. We subsequently use the time and location where travel speed begins to drop to correct the bias associated with this crash. We prove that the spatiotemporal impact region, which characterizes the evolution of travel speed, estimated by our model is consistent with the propagation of shockwaves even when there are multiple candidate links and the exact occurrence time and location of the crash are unknown. This relaxes the standard assumptions required by existing models in the literature. We validate our model using real crash data in Beijing and find that our model can reduce the average bias in time from 7.3 min to 1.6 min, or a 78.08% reduction; and reduce the average bias in location from 0.156 km to 0.024 km, or a 84.62% reduction.",0191-2615,Not found
A control-function approach to correct for endogeneity in discrete choice models estimated on SP-off-RP data and contrasts with an earlier FIML approach by Train &amp; Wilson,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.022,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"It is common practice to build Stated Preference (SP) attributes and alternatives from observed Revealed Preference (RP) choices with a view to increasing realism. While many surveys pivot all alternatives around an observed choice, others use more adaptive approaches in which changes are made depending on what alternative was chosen in the RP setting. For example, in SP-off-RP data, the alternative chosen in the RP setting is worsened in the SP setting and other alternatives are improved to induce a change in behaviour. This facilitates the creation of meaningful trade-offs or tipping points but introduces endogeneity. This source of endogeneity was largely ignored until Train and Wilson (T&W) proposed a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) solution that can be implemented with simulation. In this article, we propose a limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) approach to address the SP-off-RP problem using a method which does not need simulation, can be applied with standard software and uses data that is already available for the stated problem. The proposed method is an application of the control-function (CF) method to correct for endogeneity in discrete choice models, using the RP attributes as instrumental variables. We discuss the theoretical and practical advantages and disadvantages of the CF and T&W methods and illustrate them using Monte Carlo and real data. Results show that, while the T&W method may be more efficient in theory, it may however fail to retrieve consistent estimators when it does not account properly for the data generation process if, e.g., an exogenous source of correlation among the SP choice tasks exists. On the other hand, the CF is more robust, i.e. less sensitive, to the data generation process assumptions, and is considerably easier to apply with standard software and does not require simulation, facilitating its adoption and the more extensive use of SP-off-RP data.",0191-2615,Not found

This strategy is intuitive due to the use of simple and transparent rules, non-anticipative because it relies on readily available information only, partially decentralized because only the upstream ramps are coordinately optimized, and adaptive due to the self-renewal with traffic condition. It is a combined strategy because it may include priority control strategy or proportional control strategy. Our approach is robust in the sense that it can be easily implemented, and can deal with not only real-time data but also predictive information.

Railway timetable rescheduling with flexible stopping and flexible short-turning during disruptions,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.015,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Railway operations are vulnerable to unexpected disruptions that should be handled in an efficient and passenger-friendly way. To this end, we propose a timetable rescheduling model where flexible stopping (i.e. skipping stops and adding stops) and flexible short-turning (i.e. full choice of short-turn stations) are innovatively integrated with three other dispatching measures: retiming, reordering, and cancelling. The Mixed Integer Linear Programming model also ensures that each train serving a station is ensured with a platform track. To consider the rescheduling impact on passengers, the weight of each decision is estimated individually according to the time-dependent passenger demand. The objective is minimizing passenger delays. A case study is carried out for hundreds of disruption scenarios on a subnetwork of the Dutch railways. It is found that (1) applying a mix of flexible stopping and flexible short-turning results in less passenger delays; (2) shortening the recovery duration mitigates the post-disruption consequence by less delay propagation but is at the expense of more cancelled train services during the disruption; and (3) the optimal rescheduling solution is sensitive to the disruption duration, but some steady behaviour is observed when the disruption duration increases by the timetable cycle time.",0191-2615,Not found

The modeling results suggest that in a Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX)-style market, airlines do not have the incentive to cooperate in offset purchases. However, in an over-the-counter (OTC) market, airlines are willing to form alliance provided that the alliance's bargaining power is sufficiently stronger than the airlines’ independent bargaining power. With coordinated output decision, the alliance increases social welfare when the marginal environmental cost of aviation is high. If the alliance partners do not coordinate their output decision, we show that an internal bargaining mechanism within the alliance can reduce the offset price and increase the alliance's profit compared with the case of output-coordinated alliance. Without such internal mechanism, the alliances’ total profits and the social welfare may decrease.

This motivates a polyhedral study that we perform and that leads to the identification of many families of facets and other valid inequalities to the relaxed problem that, in turn, provide valid inequalities for the original model. Some of these families are too large for being handled directly. For those cases, separation algorithms are also presented.

We develop an integrated game-theoretical decision-making framework to represent multiple co-opetitive decision-makers’ behavior and use the San Francisco Bay Area shoreline with a scenario of a 0.5 m sea-level rise as a numerical simulation study. The decision-makers’ objective is to minimize the traffic delay caused by inundations in the transportation network that lies within their geographical boundaries. Each decision-maker should determine where to build levees either only along their shoreline without cooperation or along a shared shoreline within a coalition. In this framework, each competitive decision-maker can consider cooperation to minimize its traffic delay, so its behavior can be defined as co-opetitive. We define necessary conditions for forming coalitions for multiple co-opetitive decision-makers, as well as cost-distributing rules and incentive negotiation processes within each coalition. Our model considers the effects of hydrodynamic interactions, traffic flow patterns changes as a result of inundations, and budget constraints on the costs of seashore protection. The hydrodynamics in the Bay Area are affected by the shoreline protection strategy, and closure of a highway link in one county affects traffic delays in other counties due to traffic re-routing. Thus, protection decisions made by a county have potential impacts on several other counties, and therefore counties must consider other counties’ actions. In the numerical study, we investigate the results of co-opetitive games for a range of funding scenarios.

A bi-level capacitated P-median facility location problem with the most likely allocation solution,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.013,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"In this paper, a bi-level model is introduced to evaluate the capacitated p-median facility location problem with the most likely allocation solution. The classical capacitated p-median problem is considered in the upper-level to minimize the cost of locating facilities and serving demands while a log-based model resulting from the minimum information approach is used in the lower-level to determine the most likely allocation solution based on the available information. Using Lagrangian dual theory, the proposed bi-level problem is reduced to a new one-level nonlinear mixed-integer problem whose solution is obtained by comparing two mixed-integer linear problems.

New and emerging methods for the improved modelling of travel behaviour: Transportation Research Part B: Special issue of papers from the IATBR 2015 conference,10.1016/j.trb.2018.07.009,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,,0191-2615,Not found
"Short-term travel behavior prediction with GPS, land use, and point of interest data",10.1016/j.trb.2018.06.012,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"In everyday travel, U.S. commuters will each spend 38 h a year stuck in traffic and waste over $800 in fuel (TTI, 2015). Yet, despite this statistic, the regular commute of drivers is often predictable, leading many federal projects to aim at alleviating congestion through traveler information and intelligent transportation systems (e.g., INFLO, Queue WARN, CACC, EnableATIS, ATIS2.0). Short-term destination prediction is a developing field of research that can improve these approaches through real-traveler information, such as route, traffic incidence, and congestion levels. The short-term destination prediction problem consists of capturing vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) traces and learning from historic locations and trajectories to predict a vehicle's destination. Drivers have predictable trip destinations that can be estimated through probabilistic modeling of past trips. To study these concepts, a database of GPS driving traces (260 participants for 70 days) was collected. To model the user's trip purpose in the prediction algorithm, a new data source was explored: point of interest (POI)/land use data. An open source land use/POI dataset is merged with the GPS dataset. The resulting database includes over 20,000 trips with travel characteristics and land use/POI data. From land use/POI data and travel patterns, trip purpose was calculated with machine learning methods. To take advantage of this data source, a new prediction model structure was developed that uses trip purpose when it is available and that falls back on traditional spatial temporal Markov models when it is not. For the first time, there is an understanding of “why” a trip is taken (not just “where” and “when”), allowing the use of “why” in the prediction model. This paper explores the baseline model followed by the inclusion of trip purpose. First, a baseline tiered time origin model was developed using the Markov Chain approach. This modelling structure allows for a short training period of current modeling techniques. The other major advantage to this structure is it allows for easy implementation of the trip purpose module. Then, a machine learning technique derived the trip purpose on 5-, 15- and 30-trip learning sets, followed by results organized by purpose, time, and origin. The machine learning technique does not require future land use data and is feasible for applicable use. This model is the first to use trip purpose to make a short-term destination prediction in pseudo real-time. Results show improved accuracy and speed over the current start-of-trip destination prediction models.",0191-2615,Not found
Interactive online machine learning approach for activity-travel survey,10.1016/j.trb.2017.11.009,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"This article proposes a framework for an interactive activity-travel survey method, implementable on mobile devices such as smartphones. The proposed method was developed to reduce the burden (i.e., frequency of questions) on respondents in long-term behavioral surveys, without relying on external data sources. The method employs an online travel context estimation model and an online machine learning method as interactive processes. The estimation model is used for automatically estimating travel contexts during surveys, while the online machine learning method is used for dynamically updating the estimation model, based on answers from respondents. The proposed method was examined by simulations using data obtained from a past probe person survey. The results suggest that the frequency of inputs by respondents in surveys can be significantly reduced, while maintaining high accuracy of the obtained data. For example, the method successfully estimated certain types of trips (e.g., commuting) and the behaviors of certain respondents (e.g., those whose activity-travel pattern is recurrent) because of the learning process and reduced survey burden on them. Meanwhile, although the method could not always precisely estimate some other types of trips, it eventually obtained accurate results because of the interaction process. Therefore, the proposed method could be useful to reduce the burden on respondents in long-term surveys, while maintaining high data quality and capturing traveler heterogeneity.",0191-2615,Not found
Mode choice with latent availability and consideration: Theory and a case study,10.1016/j.trb.2017.06.016,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Over the last two decades, passively collected data sources, like Global Positioning System (GPS) traces from data loggers and smartphones, have emerged as a very promising source for understanding travel behaviour. Most choice model applications in this context have made use of data collected specifically for choice modelling, which often has high costs associated with it. On the other hand, many other data sources exist in which respondents’ movements are tracked. These data sources have thus far been underexploited for choice modelling. Indeed, although some information on the chosen mode and basic socio-demographic data is collected in such surveys, they (as well as in fact also some purpose collected surveys) lack information on mode availability and consideration. This paper addresses the data challenges by estimating a mode choice model with probabilistic availability and consideration, using a secondary dataset consisting of ‘annotated’ GPS traces. Stated mode availability by part of the sample enabled the specification of an availability component, while the panel nature of the data and explicit incorporation of spatial and environmental factors enabled estimation of latent trip specific consideration sets. The research thus addresses an important behavioural issue (explicit modelling of availability and choice set) in addition to enriching the data for choice modelling purposes. The model produces reasonable results, including meaningful value of travel time (VTT) measures. Our findings further suggest that a better understanding of mode choices can be obtained by looking jointly at availability, consideration and choice.",0191-2615,Not found
Equilibrium in a dynamic model of congestion with large and small users,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.005,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Individual users of transportation facilities often control a significant share of total traffic. Examples include airlines, rail and maritime freight shippers, urban goods delivery companies, taxi companies, and ride-sharing companies. These users have an incentive to internalize the congestion delays their own vehicles impose on each other by adjusting the timing of their trips. We investigate simultaneous trip-timing decisions by large users and small users in a dynamic model of congestion. Unlike previous work, we allow for heterogeneity of trip-timing preferences and for the presence of small users such as individual commuters and fringe airlines. We derive the optimal fleet departure schedule for a large user as a best-response to the aggregate departure rate of other users. We show that when the vehicles in a large user’s fleet have sufficiently diverse preferred arrival times, there may exist a pure-strategy Nash-equilibrium (PSNE) in which the large user schedules vehicles when there is a queue. This highlights that the problem of non-existence of a PSNE identified in Silva et al. (2016) for the case of symmetric large users hinges on the assumption that all vehicles in each fleet have the same preferred arrival time. We also develop some examples to identify under what conditions a PSNE exists, and when the large user departs. The examples illustrate how self-internalization of congestion by a large user can affect the nature of equilibrium and the travel costs that it and other users incur.",0191-2615,Not found
Route-cost-assignment with joint user and operator behavior as a many-to-one stable matching assignment game,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.008,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"We propose a generalized market equilibrium model using assignment game criteria for evaluating transportation systems that consist of both operators’ and users’ decisions. The model finds stable pricing, in terms of generalized costs, and matches between user populations in a network to set of routes with line capacities. The proposed model gives a set of stable outcomes instead of single point pricing that allows operators to design ticket pricing, routes/schedules that impact access/egress, shared policies that impact wait/transfer costs, etc., based on a desired mechanism or policy. The set of stable outcomes is proven to be convex from which assignment-dependent unique user-optimal and operator-optimal outcomes can be obtained. Different user groups can benefit from using this model in a prescriptive manner or within a sequential design process. We look at several different examples to test our model: small examples of fixed transit routes and a case study using a small subset of taxi data in NYC. The case study illustrates how one can use the model to evaluate a policy that can require passengers to walk up to 1 block away to meet with a shared taxi without turning away passengers.",0191-2615,Not found
High-dimensional offline origin-destination (OD) demand calibration for stochastic traffic simulators of large-scale road networks,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.005,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"This paper considers high-dimensional offline calibration problems for large-scale simulation-based network models. We propose a metamodel simulation-based optimization (SO) approach. The proposed method is formulated and validated on a simple synthetic toy network. It is then applied to a high-dimensional case study of a large-scale Singapore network. Compared to two benchmark methods, a derivative-free pattern search method and the SPSA method, the proposed method improves the objective function estimates by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, this improvement is achieved after only 2 simulation runs. Hence, the proposed method is computationally efficient. The main idea of the proposed approach is to embed, within the SO algorithm, information from an analytical (i.e., lower-resolution) yet differentiable and tractable network model. It is this analytical structural information that enables the SO algorithm to become both suitable for high-dimensional problems and computationally efficient. For a network with n links, the analytical network model is implemented as a system of n nonlinear equations. Hence, it scales linearly with the number of links in the network and independently of link attributes (such as link length) and of the dimension of the route choice set.",0191-2615,Not found
Reliable facility location design with round-trip transportation under imperfect information part II: A continuous model,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.002,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The Part I paper (Yun et al., 2019) of this study developed a discrete model and a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm for the reliable problem of facility locations considering round-trip transportation when customers are not aware of facility states in real time until they visit them on site. Since the investigated problem is an NP-hard problem, large-scale instances of this problem may not be solved efficiently by the discrete model. To address this issue, this paper proposes a counterpart continuous model to solve large-scale instances of the investigated problem. The continuous model assumes that all the settings are continuous and adopts the continuum approximation (CA) technique to obtain a near-optimum solution to this investigated problem. The CA technique also reveals theoretical insights into solution structures of each sub-problem on a customer's pattern of visiting facilities on a homogeneous plane. Numerical experiments find that the continuous model with the CA technique has superior computational efficiency for large-scale instances.

A latent-class adaptive routing choice model in stochastic time-dependent networks,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.018,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Transportation networks are inherently uncertain due to random disruptions; meanwhile, real-time information potentially helps travelers adapt to realized traffic conditions and make better route choices under such disruptions. Modeling adaptive route choice behavior is essential in evaluating real-time traveler information systems and related policies. This research contributes to the state of the art by developing a latent-class routing policy choice model in a stochastic time-dependent network with revealed preference data. A routing policy is defined as a decision rule applied at each link that maps possible realized traffic conditions to decisions on the link to take next. It represents a traveler’s ability to look ahead in order to incorporate real-time information not yet available at the time of decision. A case study is conducted in Stockholm, Sweden and data for the stochastic time-dependent network are generated from hired taxi Global Positioning System (GPS) readings. A latent-class Policy Size Logit model is specified, with routing policy users who follow routing policies and path users who follow fixed paths. Two additional layers of latency in the measurement equation are accounted for: 1) the choice of a routing policy is latent and only its realized path on a given day can be observed; and 2) when GPS readings have relatively long gaps, the realized path cannot be uniquely identified, and the likelihood of observing vehicle traces with non-consecutive links is instead maximized. Routing policy choice set generation is based on the generalization of path choice set generation methods. The generated choice sets achieve 95% coverage for 100% overlap threshold after correcting GPS mistakes and breaking up trips with intermediate stops, and further achieve 100% coverage for 90% overlap threshold. Estimation results show that the routing policy user class probability increases with trip length, and the latent-class routing policy choice model fits the data better than a single-class path choice or routing policy choice model. This suggests that travelers are heterogeneous in terms of their ability and/or willingness to plan ahead and utilize real-time information, and an appropriate route choice model for uncertain networks should take into account the underlying stochastic travel times and structured traveler heterogeneity in terms of real-time information utilization.",0191-2615,Not found

Stochastic stability of dynamic user equilibrium in unidirectional networks: Weakly acyclic game approach,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.015,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The aim of this study is to analyze the stability of dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) with fixed departure times in unidirectional networks. Specifically, stochastic stability, which is the concept of stability in evolutionary dynamics subjected to stochastic effects, is herein considered. To achieve this, a new approach is developed by synthesizing the three concepts: the decomposition technique of DUE assignments, the weakly acyclic game, and the asymptotic analysis of the stationary distribution of perturbed dynamics. Specifically, we first formulate a DUE assignment as a strategic game (DUE game) that deals with atomic users. We then prove that there exists an appropriate order of assigning users for ensuring equilibrium in a unidirectional network. With this property, we establish the relationship between DUE games in unidirectional networks and weakly acyclic games. The convergence and stochastic stability of better response dynamics in the DUE games are then proved based on the theory of weakly acyclic games. Finally, we observe the properties of the convergence and stability from numerical experiments. The results show that the strict improvement of users’ travel times by the applied evolutionary dynamics is important for ensuring the existence of a stochastically stable equilibrium in DUE games.",0191-2615,Not found

Instead, visitors may park in adjoining locales where they impede through traffic, take parking space from other users, and create environmental externalities. We develop a model to study spillover parking generated by a major retailer (e.g., a mall) that provides limited on-site parking. Some customers park at the mall, some park on the street, and others who live or work nearby visit the mall on foot. The retailer chooses its parking lot capacity, the parking fee, and the retail markup. We compare the effectiveness of four policies for dealing with spillover parking: on-street parking fees, on-street parking bans (aka residential parking permits), regulating mall parking fees, and regulating mall parking capacity (aka minimum/maximum parking requirements). Policy effectiveness depends on the severity of congestion, the amount of mall shopping by local and nonlocal shoppers, and the mall’s market power. A curbside parking ban is harmful unless congestion is severe. If the mall has no market power, both on-street parking fees and mall parking fee regulation can support the social optimum, whereas mall parking lot capacity regulation is useless. In contrast, if the mall has substantial market power, capacity regulation in the form of a minimum parking requirement can be the most effective policy. The benefits of implementing pairs of policies can be larger, or smaller, than the sum of the benefits from applying them individually.",0191-2615,Not found
Robust local and string stability for a decentralized car following control strategy for connected automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.003,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper presents a robust car-following control strategy under uncertainty for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The proposed control is designed as a decentralized linear feedback and feedforward controller with a focus on robust local and string stability under (i) time-varying uncertain vehicle dynamics and (ii) time-varying uncertain communication delay. The former uncertainty is incorporated into the general longitudinal vehicle dynamics (GLVD) equation that regulates the difference between the desired acceleration (prescribed by the control model) and the actual acceleration by compensating for nonlinear vehicle dynamics (e.g., due to aerodynamic drag force). The latter uncertainty is incorporated into acceleration information received from the vehicle immediately ahead. As a primary contribution, this study derives and proves (i) a sufficient and necessary condition for local stability and (ii) sufficient conditions for robust string stability in the frequency domain using the Laplacian transformation.

A pricing versus slots game in airport networks,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.013,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper considers networks with two or three complementary airports. In each case, two airports independently choose between slot and pricing policies, where slot policies involve grandfather rules. We show that equilibrium policies involve slots when airport profits do not matter and pricing policies when airport profits matter. We further show that the equilibrium slot policies reach the first-best passenger quantities when congestion effects are absent. Otherwise, equilibrium slot policies will lead to excessive and equilibrium pricing policies to too low passenger quantities relative to the first best. Numerical examples indicate that slot policies can be beneficial relative to pricing policies when time valuations are low and vice versa when time valuations are high. The analysis formally distinguishes the sources for the different outcomes under slot and pricing policies by distinguishing between a variable effect and a distribution effect. The variable effect captures that decision variables are quantities in the case of slot policies and prices in the case of pricing policies. The distribution effect captures that airport slot allocation is based on grandfather rules.",0191-2615,Not found

A predictive headway-based bus-holding strategy with dynamic control point selection: A cooperative game theory approach,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.001,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Bus holding is a widely used control method to regularize bus headways and reduce bus bunching. The method works in such a way by delaying buses at control points if their departure times or headways deviate from the planned ones. However, it may result in reduced bus commercial speeds and increased passenger onboard travel time. To avoid this problem, researchers have suggested that control points be spaced cautiously along the route such that only a few are needed. This study proposes a predictive headway-based bus holding strategy with dynamic control point importance ranking and selection based on the cooperative game theory. The framework considers not only individual control points’ impact but also the collective group control effects. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of two components: a performance model and a cooperative game model. The performance model predicts headway performances of all running buses when different control point combinations are in effect. Dynamic bus running times and passenger demands are reflected in the model. Then, these headway performances are passed to the cooperative game model with control points being players and improvements in headway performances compared with that under no holding control being the utility function. The game is solved by Myerson value, a concept that extends Shapley value used for the normal cooperative game and considers the cooperation structure and potential worth of coalitions. We use Myerson value to rank the importance of control points on regularizing headways, as it measures the average marginal utility contribution of a control point to all possible coalitions that exclude that point. We prove that Myerson value lies in the Ω-core of the game and thus satisfies allocation efficiency, individual and coalition rationality. The proposed framework is applied to target headway control and two-way-looking self-equalizing headway control. Simulation results show that the framework can significantly reduce passenger waiting time and bus headway variation.",0191-2615,Not found
Capacity approximations for near- and far-side bus stops in dedicated bus lanes,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.010,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,We develop analytical approximations for the bus-carrying capacities at near- and far-side stops with one or multiple curbside berths where buses operate in a dedicated bus lane.

Model and analysis of labor supply for ride-sharing platforms in the presence of sample self-selection and endogeneity,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.004,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"With the popularization of ride-sharing services, drivers working as freelancers on ride-sharing platforms can design their schedules flexibly. They make daily decisions regarding whether to participate in work, and if so, how many hours to work. Factors such as hourly income rate affect both the participation decision and working-hour decision, and evaluation of the impacts of hourly income rate on labor supply becomes important. In this paper, we propose an econometric framework with closed-form measures to estimate both the participation elasticity (i.e., extensive margin elasticity) and working-hour elasticity (i.e., intensive margin elasticity) of labor supply. We model the sample self-selection bias of labor force participation and endogeneity of income rate and show that failure to control for sample self-selection and endogeneity leads to biased estimates. Taking advantage of a natural experiment with exogenous shocks on a ride-sharing platform, we identify the driver incentive called “income multiplier” as exogenous shock and an instrumental variable. We empirically analyze the impacts of hourly income rates on labor supply along both extensive and intensive margins. We find that both the participation elasticity and working-hour elasticity of labor supply are positive and significant in the dataset of this ride-sharing platform. Interestingly, in the presence of driver heterogeneity, we also find that in general participation elasticity decreases along both the extensive and intensive margins, and working-hour elasticity decreases along the intensive margin.",0191-2615,Not found
An integrated train service plan optimization model with variable demand: A team-based scheduling approach with dual cost information in a layered network,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.017,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"A well designed train timetable should fully utilize the limited infrastructure and rolling stock resources to maximize operators’ profits and passenger travel demand satisfaction. Thus, an internally coherent scheduling process should consider the three main aspects: (1) dynamic choice behaviors of passengers so as to evaluate and calculate the impact of variable passenger demand to (2) underlying train service patterns and detailed timetables, which in turn are constrained by (3) infrastructure and rolling stock capacity. This paper aims to develop an integrated demand/service/resource optimization model for managing the above-mentioned three key decision elements with a special focus on passengers’ responses to time-dependent service interval times or frequencies. The model particularly takes into account service-sensitive passenger demand as internal variables so that one can accurately map passengers to train services through a representation of passenger carrying states throughout a team of trains. The added state dimension leads to a linear integer multi-commodity flow formulation in which three closely interrelated decision elements, namely passengers’ response to service interval times, train stopping pattern planning and timetabling for conflict detecting and resolving are jointly considered internally. By using a Lagrangian relaxation solution framework to recognize the dual costs of both passenger travel demand and limited resources of track and rolling stock, we transfer and decompose the formulation into a novel team-based train service search sub-problem for maximizing the profit of operators. The sub-problem is solvable efficiently by a forward dynamic programming algorithm across multiple trains of a team.

Multiple model stochastic filtering for traffic density estimation on urban arterials,10.1016/j.trb.2019.06.009,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Traffic state estimation plays an important role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It provides the latest traffic information to travelers and feedback to signal control systems. The Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) filtering provides a powerful estimation method to deal with the non-differentiable nonlinearity caused by the phase transitions between the under-critical and above-critical traffic density regimes. The IMM filtering also accounts for the uncertainty in the current ‘mode of operation’. In this paper, we develop an enhanced IMM filtering approach to traffic state estimation, with an underlying Cell Transmission Model (CTM) for traffic flow propagation. We improve the IMM filtering with CTM in two ways: (1) We apply two simplifying assumptions that are highly likely to hold in urban roads in incident-free conditions, which makes the computational complexity to grow with the number of cells only polynomially, rather than exponentially as reported in prior work. (2) We apply a novel approach to noise modeling wherein the process noise is explicitly obtained in terms of the randomness in more fundamental quantities (e.g., free-flow speed, maximum flow capacity, etc.), which not only makes noise calibration using real data convenient but also makes the computation of the cross-correlation between the process and measurement noises transparent. However, it leads to ‘process dynamic’ and ‘measurement’ equations that involve multiplier matrices whose elements are random variables rather than deterministic scalars, and hence, standard filtering equations cannot be applied. We derive the appropriate filtering equations from first principles. We calibrate the traffic parameters and the total inflow and outflow on the links using the SCATS loop detector data collected in Melbourne and report significant improvements in accuracy, which is due to the accurate computation of the cross-covariance of process and measurement noises.",0191-2615,Not found

The electric vehicle routing problem with energy consumption uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2019.06.006,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Compared with conventional freight vehicles, electric freight vehicles create less local pollution and are thus generally perceived as a more sustainable means of goods distribution. In urban areas, such vehicles must often perform the entirety of their delivery routes without recharging. However, their energy consumption is subject to a fair amount of uncertainty, which is due to exogenous factors such as the weather and road conditions, endogenous factors such as driver behaviour, and several energy consumption parameters that are difficult to measure precisely. Hence we propose a robust optimization framework to take into account these energy consumption uncertainties in the context of an electric vehicle routing problem. The objective is to determine minimum cost delivery routes capable of providing strong guarantees that a given vehicle will not run out of charge during its route. We formulate the problem as a robust mixed integer linear program and solve small instances to optimality using robust optimization techniques. Furthermore, we develop a two-phase heuristic method based on large neighbourhood search to solve larger instances of the problem, and we conduct several numerical tests to assess the quality of the methodology. The computational experiments illustrate the trade-off between cost and risk, and demonstrate the influence of several parameters on best found solutions. Furthermore, our heuristic identifies 42 new best solutions when tested on instances of the closely related robust capacitated vehicle routing problem.",0191-2615,Not found
A general model of demand-responsive transportation services: From taxi to ridesharing to dial-a-ride,10.1016/j.trb.2019.06.001,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The paper presents a general analytic framework to model transit systems that provide door-to-door service.

In the latter we include both, paratransit services such as dial-a-ride (DAR), and the form of ridesharing (shared taxi) currently being used by crowd-sourced taxi companies like Lyft and Uber.

A combined simulation-optimization approach for minimizing travel time and delays in railway timetables,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.003,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Minimal travel time and maximal reliability are two of the most important properties of a railway transportation service. This paper considers the problem of finding a timetable for a given set of departures that minimizes the weighted sum of scheduled travel time and expected delay, thereby capturing these two important socio-economic properties of a timetable. To accurately represent the complex secondary delays in operational railway traffic, an approach combining microscopic simulation and macroscopic timetable optimization is proposed. To predict the expected delay in the macroscopic timetable, a surrogate function is formulated, as well as a subproblem to calibrate the parameters in the model. In a set of computational experiments, the approach increased the socio-economic benefit by 2–5% and improved the punctuality by 8–25%.",0191-2615,Not found
On the estimation of connected vehicle penetration rate based on single-source connected vehicle data,10.1016/j.trb.2019.06.003,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"With more connected vehicles (CVs) in the networks, the big data era leads to the availability of abundant data from CVs. CV penetration rate is the fundamental building block of tremendous applications, such as traffic data estimation, CV-based adaptive signal control and origin-destination estimation. While CV penetration rate is a random variable unknown in nature, the current estimation method of penetration rate mainly relies on two sources of data —detector and CV data. Penetration rate across the link is computed as CV flow divided by all traffic flow over a certain period of time. However, the current method is constrained by availability and quality of detector data. This paper proposes a simple, analytical, non-parametric, and most importantly, unbiased single-source data penetration rate (SSDPR) estimation method for estimating penetration rate solely based on CV data. It subtly and simultaneously fuses two estimation mechanisms—(1) the measurement of the probability of the first vehicle in a queue being a CV and (2) the direct estimation of the penetration rate of a sample queue—to constitute a single estimator to handle all the possible sample queue patterns. Applicability of the proposed method is not confined to a specific arrival pattern. It solely utilizes the number of the observed CVs and the number of vehicles before the last observed CV in a sample queue. Combining with bridging the queue algorithm, the proposed SSDPR estimation method is extended to overflow or oversaturated conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed method is able to accurately estimate penetration rate as low as 0.1% for all the situations considered. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, a case study of fundamental diagram estimation of a link without being installed with any detector is presented.",0191-2615,Not found
Multiclass traffic assignment model for mixed traffic flow of human-driven vehicles and connected and autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.022,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Compared to existing human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer users the potential for reduced value of time, enhanced quality of travel experience, and seamless situational awareness and connectivity. Hence, CAV users can differ in their route choice behavior compared to HDV users, leading to mixed traffic flows that can significantly deviate from the single-class HDV traffic pattern. However, due to the lack of quantitative models, there is limited knowledge on the evolution of mixed traffic flows in a traffic network. To partly bridge this gap, this study proposes a multiclass traffic assignment model, where HDV users and CAV users follow different route choice principles, characterized by the cross-nested logit (CNL) model and user equilibrium (UE) model, respectively. The CNL model captures HDV users’ uncertainty associated with limited knowledge of traffic conditions while overcoming the route overlap issue of logit-based stochastic user equilibrium. The UE model characterizes the CAV's capability for acquiring accurate information on traffic conditions. In addition, the multiclass model can capture the characteristics of mixed traffic flow such as the difference in value of time between HDVs and CAVs and the asymmetry in their driving interactions, thereby enhancing behavioral realism in the modeling. The study develops a new solution algorithm labeled RSRS-MSRA, in which a route-swapping based strategy is embedded with a self-regulated step size choice technique, to solve the proposed model efficiently. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed model is performed to gain insights into the effects of perturbations on the mixed traffic equilibrium, which facilitates the estimation of equilibrium traffic flow and identification of critical elements under expected or unexpected events. The study results can assist transportation decision-makers to design effective planning and operational strategies to leverage the advantages of CAVs and manage traffic congestion under mixed traffic flows.",0191-2615,Not found
Bus transit network design with uncertainties on the basis of a metro network: A two-step model framework,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.011,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The metro systems of some megacities are facing serious oversaturation problem due to the heavy passenger flow during high peak hours. We consider the bus transit network design problem based on an existing metro network that can balance the modal split between metro and bus transit systems. The challenges facing this problem lie in that passengers have a different preference between metro and bus services, and the bus travel time and passenger demand may exhibit significant variations. This paper develops a two-step model framework to determine a bus transit network and departure frequency with consideration of travel time and passenger demand uncertainties. Firstly, we develop a column generation method to identify the candidate set of bus transit lines and passenger paths. Then a stochastic linear programming model is developed to optimize the bus line frequency and passenger path flow under demand and bus travel time uncertainty. To solve this model, a primal-dual online algorithm based on the online convex optimization theory is built to obtain the optimal solution with a theoretical performance guarantee. Finally, we implement the developed framework into an illustrative network and a real-world Beijing Second Ring public transit network to demonstrate its applicability and promising effects.

Properties of equilibria in transport problems with complex interactions between users,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.006,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"It is well known that uniqueness and stability are guaranteed properties of traffic equilibria in static user-equilibrium traffic assignment problems, if the link travel utilities are assumed to be strictly monotonically decreasing with respect to the link traffic volumes. However, these preferable properties may not necessarily hold in a wide range of transport problems with complex interactions, e.g. asymmetric interactions (including dynamic traffic assignment), social interactions, or with economies of scale. This study aims to investigate such solution properties of transport models with complex interactions between users. Generic formulations of models are considered in this study, both for utility functions and for the evolutionary dynamics relevant to the stability analysis. Such an analysis for a generic formulation is mathematically challenging due to the potential non-differentiability of the dynamical system, precluding the application of standard analyses for smooth systems. To address this issue, this study proposes a transport system with two alternatives and two user groups. While it is a simple model whose dynamics can be depicted on a plane, it also includes the core components of transport models, i.e. multiple choices and user-classes. This study classifies all possible formulations into nine cases with respect to the signs (i.e. positive or negative) of interactions between users. Then, the evolutionary dynamics of each case is mathematically analysed to examine stability of equilibria. Finally, the solution properties of each case is revealed. Multiple equilibria exist in many cases. In addition, cases with no stable equilibrium are also found, yet even in such cases we are able to characterise the circumstances in which the different kinds of unstable behaviour may arise.",0191-2615,Not found

Multiline Bus Bunching Control via Vehicle Substitution,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.009,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Traditional bus bunching control methods (e.g., adding slack to schedules, adapting cruising speed), in one way or another, trade commercial speed for better system stability and, as a result, may impose the burden of additional travel time on passengers. Recently, a dynamic bus substitution strategy, where standby buses are dispatched to take over service from late/early buses, was proposed as an attempt to enhance system reliability without sacrificing too much passenger experience. This paper further studies this substitution strategy in the context of multiple bus lines under either time-independent or time-varying settings. In the latter scenario, the fleet of standby buses can be dynamically utilized to save on opportunity costs. We model the agency’s substitution decisions and retired bus repositioning decisions as a stochastic dynamic program so as to obtain the optimal policy that minimizes the system-wide costs. Numerical results show that the dynamic substitution strategy can benefit from the “economies of scale” by pooling the standby fleet across lines, and there are also benefits from dynamic fleet management when transit demand varies over time. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability and advantage of the proposed strategy. The substitution strategy not only holds the promise to outperform traditional holding methods in terms of reducing passenger costs, they also can be used to complement other methods to better control very unstable systems.",0191-2615,Not found
A deteriorating inventory routing problem for an inland liquefied natural gas distribution network,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.014,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is natural gas that is converted into its liquid state for logistical benefits. It is also becoming a more viable alternative energy source due to its price competitiveness and environmental friendliness. We study an inventory routing problem for inland distribution of LNG from a storage facility to several filling stations. Here, a transport planner is responsible for the inventory management at the storage facility and filling stations, as well as for the routing and scheduling of a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. LNG evaporates at a constant rate over time at the storage facility and at the filling stations, and this characteristic relates to the inventory management problems with deterioration described in the literature. Therefore, the problem under study is denoted an LNG Deteriorating Inventory Routing Problem (LNG-DIRP). As a solution method, we propose a matheuristic that combines a mixed integer programming formulation and an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm. Results of extensive computational experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed solution method and provide managerial insights to promote LNG as an alternative clean energy solution for the future of transportation.

Rolling stock scheduling with maintenance requirements at the Chinese High-Speed Railway,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.013,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Efficient rolling stock schedules have always been the focus of railway companies. At the Chinese High-Speed Railway, rolling stock scheduling is usually done manually by dispatchers. Such an approach often makes it difficult to quickly obtain an optimal rolling stock schedule that can be used to operate the proposed timetable and which is also feasible with respect to the rolling stock maintenance requirements. In this paper, we consider the problem of rolling stock scheduling with maintenance requirements and propose a heuristic approach that decomposes the problem into two main stages. In the first stage, the maintenance restrictions are ignored and a conventional Mixed Integer Programming model is used to generate multiple candidate rolling stock schedules. In the second stage, we check to see whether any of the candidate rolling stock schedules are feasible when maintenance restrictions for the individual rolling stock units are also considered. Checking a candidate rolling stock schedule can be performed using an assignment problem. To provide some structure to the search, candidate rolling stock schedules generated in the first stage are sorted in descending order according to their objective values. The two stages can be iteratively performed to avoid generating all schedules in the first stage before proceeding to the second stage. We analyze the performance of the proposed approach on real-life instances provided by the Chinese High-Speed Railway. These instances focus on the railway network within the Zhengzhou Group, which is one of the busiest transportation networks in China. Comparisons with the manual approach that is currently used in practice show that the proposed approach yields far superior schedules. The optimized schedules improve rolling stock efficiency and lead to a reduction in operating cost of approximately 10.5%.",0191-2615,Not found
When is it beneficial to provide freelance suppliers with choice? A hierarchical approach for peer-to-peer logistics platforms,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.008,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper proposes and evaluates a new hierarchical approach to peer-to-peer logistics platforms, recasting the platform’s role as one providing personalized menus of requests to freelance suppliers. A bilevel optimization formulation explicitly models the two stage decision process: first, the platform determines which set of requests to recommend to which suppliers, and second, suppliers have a choice to select which request (if any) to fulfill. By harnessing the problem’s structure, the computationally expensive mixed-integer linear bilevel problem is transformed into an equivalent single-level problem that is computationally superior. A computational study based on ride-sharing quantifies the value of providing suppliers with choices. When a platform’s knowledge of suppliers’ selections is imperfect, our hierarchical approach outperforms existing recommendation methods, namely, centralized, many-to-many stable matching, and decentralized approaches. We show that a platform’s lack of knowledge over suppliers’ selections can be compensated by providing choices in environments with either inflexible suppliers or when suppliers’ utilities have higher variance than the platform’s utilities. In these environments, providing choices and recommending alternatives to more than one supplier can be beneficial to not only the platform, but also freelance suppliers and demand requests.",0191-2615,Not found
An online shortest path algorithm for reliable routing in schedule-based transit networks considering transfer failure probability,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.009,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Most schedule-based transit assignment models assume deterministic vehicle arrival/departure times, in contrast to random vehicle arrival assumption in frequency-based models. This assumption simplifies user route choice behavior and fails to capture users’ response to unreliable service. Moreover, the inherent inconvenience of transfers, primarily due to uncertain waiting time and failure probability, has always been a challenge in modeling transit networks, to the extent that determining an appropriate transfer penalty for heterogeneous user population is still a question when using planning models. This study aims to bridge the gap between frequency-based and schedule-based transit assignment models, and proposes a path algorithm in schedule-based transit networks with stochastic vehicle arrival times to model users’ adaptive behavior in response to unreliable service. Path reliability is modeled by link failure probability, and an online shortest path algorithm is developed to find a routing policy with minimum expected travel time given preferred arrival time to destination. Complexity analyses and computational tests indicate that the model has potential for application in large-scale transit networks. Numerical tests verify that the model assigns passengers to more reliable paths with lower transfer rate without a need for a large transfer penalty.",0191-2615,Not found
Simulation of rerouting phenomena in Dynamic Traffic Assignment with the Information Comply Model,10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.001,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"We present the Information Comply Model (ICM) which extends the framework for macroscopic within-day DTA proposed by Gentile (2016) to represent the rerouting of drivers wrt a single traffic event. Rerouting is reproduced as a two-stage process: first, drivers become aware about the event and its consequences on traffic; second, drivers may decide to change path. At each arc, unaware drivers have a probability of being informed by multiple ATIS sources (radio, VMS, mobile apps), which depends not only on devise penetration rates, but also on users space and time coordinates wrt the position and interval of the event. At each node, aware drivers, who are somehow reluctant to change, may finally modify their path based on a random rerouting utility, which is composed of expected gains and avoided losses. ICM is thus capable of representing the evolution of rerouting phenomena in time and space when the information about a traffic event and its consequences on congestion spread among drivers and onto the network. This way, ICM extends the concept of dynamic user equilibrium to a case of imperfect information related to availability and awareness rather than to individual perception, as well as to a case of bounded rationality with prudent drivers. Besides the model architecture and specification, this paper provides a workable methodology which can be applied both off-line for transport planning and in real-time for traffic management on large size networks.",0191-2615,Not found

In particular, we apply the theory of differential variational inequalities (DVIs) to the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) problem. We first show that there is a variational inequality whose necessary conditions describe a DUE. We restate the flow conservation constraint associated with each origin-destination pair as a first-order two-point boundary value problem, thereby leading to a DVI representation of DUE; then we employ Pontryagin-type necessary conditions to show that any DVI solution is a DUE.

While it has been known that an equilibrium solution of a static equilibrium assignment problem is stable in a various types of evolution dynamics with mild conditions, the stability of solutions in dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) assignments has rarely been investigated. This study proves that an equilibrium solution of the departure time choice problem is not Lyapunov stable when the replicator dynamics is employed. As the uniqueness of the equilibrium solution has been proven, it can be concluded that there is no stable equilibrium solution in the departure time choice problem when the replicator dynamics is assumed as an evolution dynamics.",0191-2615,Not found
Incorporating activity duration and scheduling utility into equilibrium-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment,10.1016/j.trb.2018.08.006,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper deals with the problem of jointly modelling activity scheduling and duration within a Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) problem framework. Although the last decades witnessed an intense effort in developing utility-based departure time choice models, relatively little has been done for understanding how the different assumptions on the utility model affect the model outputs. This problem is the main focus of this paper, which evaluates the effect of explicitly incorporating activity scheduling and duration within a generic user equilibrium DTA formulation. While using utility functions to model the positive component of the utility is a quite common procedure, the object of this paper is to show that a generic utility-based framework behaves as trip-based, activity-based, tour-based, or schedule-based if specific assumptions are specified. By establishing a set of properties, we quantify the amount of utility lost due to traffic congestion and how this affects activity (re-)scheduling and duration decisions. This allows predicting the effect of using a different assumption on the evolution of the transport system – and more specifically the departure time choice model. Conclusions support the idea that, under specific conditions, complex user behaviour can be approximated through a simplified model, and that the ratio between utility at origin and destination can be used to identify systematic biases within an existing DTA model – such as anticipating the rush hour. We also propose a novel utility function suited for modelling different activities, which can be used for modelling activities with a different duration. The mathematical model used to evaluate the effect of scheduling and duration into the equilibrium-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment is a simple bottleneck model. While this model has been recently re-formulated in order to capture the interaction between morning/evening commute, this paper further generalizes it in order to account for all type of activities.",0191-2615,Not found

A novel numerical method is developed based on the Godunov scheme to track the movement of vehicles in the network while maintaining the relevant priority rules. In comparison with previous approaches, the proposed numerical scheme is computationally efficient, considers the non-uniform cell sizes inherent in different internal paths within a reservoir, and conserves the flow through holding and balancing rules.

In such circumstances, it is commonly assumed that passengers may arrive randomly to a stop and may behave according to a “strategy”; such a strategy is associated with a so-called “attractive” set of routes: a passenger selects a set of routes departing from the stop, and will board the next vehicle to depart from among that set of routes. We extend the conventional notion of attractive sets by introducing a measure of “attractiveness” that allows for randomness in the choice of attractive routes. The proposed model uses a link-based (recursive, or sequential choice) formulation, rather than a path-based formulation, which has the advantage of including all path alternatives without the need for path set enumeration. The recursive formulation is also very suitable for smart card data because it allows model calibration with incomplete path choice observations. The link-based approach was originally advocated by Nguyen et al. (1988) in the strategy-based transit assignment context, but without investigating methods for model calibration or empirical analysis. Recently, Fosgerau et al. (2013) and Mai et al.

This important property enables us to develop an incremental loading method to obtain the UE solutions efficiently by solving a sequence of linear programs.

Regulating dynamic congestion externalities with tradable credit schemes: Does a unique equilibrium exist?,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.012,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Tradable credit schemes offer a potentially efficient, revenue-neutral policy alternative to classical dynamic pricing of congestion externalities. We show in this paper that the resulting equilibrium may not be unique for particular models of congestion, including the first-best solution for the conventional Vickrey's bottleneck model. This can have substantial detrimental impacts on social welfare and social acceptance of tradable credit schemes. The reason underlying this result is that the credit supply-demand condition can be satisfied for a continuum of credit prices. This is because any marginal change in the credit price will be matched by a compensating change in queuing times, keeping user price fixed but deviating from the first-best optimum in which no queueing should occur. We find that the problem of non-uniqueness does not occur for the dynamic flow congestion model proposed by Chu. A unique equilibrium can be obtained in the bottleneck model if the buying and selling of credits with a bank is allowed, against a pre-determined price. Credits are then still tradable so that the use can deviate from the initial distribution, but the credit price is determined by the perfectly elastic demand and supply from the bank.",0191-2615,Not found
A dynamic pricing scheme with negative prices in dockless bike sharing systems,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.007,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"To achieve bike relocation 1 1 The bike relocation mentioned in this paper is also referred as bike repositioning in the literature. through travellers’ spontaneous behaviour in dockless bike sharing systems, an innovative dynamic pricing scheme with negative prices is introduced. In normal situation, users pay a positive price to operators for using a bike. However, when imbalanced distribution of bikes occurs in the system, users who cycle from the oversupplied area to undersupplied area will receive monetary reward from the operator, i.e., negative pricing applies. A user equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment model is developed to capture travellers’ mode-path choice behaviour in response to the proposed dynamic pricing strategy. Travellers can either use a single transportation mode (e.g. walking, cycling and bus) or take multiple modes to complete their trips. The user equilibrium travel pattern is formulated as a variational inequality problem and then solved by a path-flow swapping algorithm. Two numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed dynamic pricing strategy with negative prices is effective in terms of attracting users as well as achieving a more balanced bike repositioning, especially when the number of bikes provided in the system is limited.",0191-2615,Not found
Carpooling with heterogeneous users in the bottleneck model,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.003,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"We investigate the effects of carpooling in a dynamic equilibrium model of congestion, which captures various dimensions of heterogeneity: heterogeneity in the preference for and cost of carpooling, heterogeneity in values of time and values of schedule delay. We investigate various policy scenarios: no-toll, first-best pricing, and subsidization of carpooling. The optimally differentiated subsidy equals each type of users’ marginal external benefit (MEB) of switching to m-person carpooling or carpooling, which turns out to be heterogeneous for “ratio heterogeneity”, where the ratios of the values of time and schedule delay vary, and homogeneous for “proportional heterogeneity”, where these values vary in fixed proportion over the population. If such differentiation over users is impossible, the subsidy is a weighted average of the MEB’s, with the weights reflecting the relative sensitivity of the group size of carpoolers to the subsidy. Using a numerical example, we investigate the welfare effects and distributional effects of different policies. The relative efficiency of the differentiated subsidization first increases and then falls with the degree of ratio heterogeneity, and decreases over the entire parameter range and more with the degree of proportional heterogeneity.",0191-2615,Not found
A theory of auto ownership rationing,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.008,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"This paper provides a theoretical analysis of three alternative auto ownership rationing schemes, including lottery, auction and the hybrid scheme. The city's residents are differentiated by their income level, which is assumed to follow a uniform distribution. Expected social cost minimization models are proposed for determining the optimal auto quota for these schemes and the optimal proportion allocated to the lottery and auction in the hybrid scheme. The solution properties of the proposed models are analytically explored, and a comparison of these schemes is made. The results show that the auction scheme is most efficient and the lottery scheme is most inefficient in terms of the expected social cost. The optimal auto quota increases with degraded transit services, but decreases with increased auto travel time/cost. Increasing the proportion of allocation to the lottery in the hybrid scheme may lead to an increased or a decreased optimal auto quota, depending on the road service level. Residents' income gap can significantly affect the optimal quota solution: widening the income gap via raising the income of the rich pushes the government to increase the quota to be provided. However, narrowing the income gap via raising the minimum salary standard may require an increased or a decreased quota provision. The efficiencies of the lottery and auction schemes are very close in terms of the expected social cost, which justifies the use of the lottery scheme in practice.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal sectional fare and frequency settings for transit networks with elastic demand,10.1016/j.trb.2019.06.011,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Sectional fares have been used in transit services in practice but are rarely examined analytically and compared with flat and distance-based fares, especially under the considerations of path choice, elastic demand, service frequency, and profitability. This paper proposes a bilevel programming model to jointly determine the fare and frequency setting to maximize transit operator's profit. The preceding three fare structures can be incorporated into the bilevel model. To consider the path choice and elastic demand in the bilevel model, the existing approach-based stochastic user equilibrium transit assignment model for the fixed demand was extended to the elastic demand case and the resultant model was used in the lower level model. To solve the bilevel model, the sensitivity-based descent search method that takes into account the approach-based formulation for the elastic demand transit assignment is proposed, in which the approach-based formulation was solved by the cost-averaging self-regulated averaging method. Numerical studies and mathematical analyses were performed to examine the model properties and compare the three fare structures. The result of the Tin Shui Wai network instance is also provided to illustrate the performance of the solution method. It is proven that when all passengers’ destinations are located at transit terminals, the sectional fare structure is always better than the other two fare structures in terms of profitability. For more general networks, the sectional fare structure is always better than the flat fare structure, but the choice between sectional and distance-based fare structures depends on the geometry of the network (e.g., the route structure and the distance between stops), the demand distribution, and the maximum allowable fares. It is also proven that the optimal profit (total vehicle mileage) is strictly monotonically decreasing (monotonically decreasing) with respect to the unit operating cost. Moreover, it is proven that the lower level approach-based assignment problem with elastic demand has exactly one solution. However, the bi-level problem can have multiple optimal solutions. Interestingly, it is found that from the operator's profitability point of view, providing better information to the passengers may not be good.",0191-2615,Not found
A matheuristic for integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.004,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Planning a public transportation system is a complex process, which is usually broken down in several phases, performed in sequence. Most often, the trips required to cover a service with the desired frequency (headway) are decided early on, while the vehicles needed to cover these trips are determined at a later stage. This potentially leads to requiring a larger number of vehicles (and, therefore, drivers) that would be possible if the two decisions were performed simultaneously. We propose a multicommodity-flow type model for integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling. Since the model is large-scale and cannot be solved by off-the-shelf tools with the efficiency required by planners, we propose a diving-type matheuristic approach for the problem.

Fast or forced to follow: A speed heterogeneous approach to congested multi-lane bicycle traffic simulation,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.002,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Copenhagen is world-known for its large proportion of cyclists, forming a diverse group with a large variation of equipment and physical abilities. This leads to a considerable speed heterogeneity which needs to be taken into account when modelling the traffic on dedicated bicycle paths. Nevertheless, existing studies on bicycle traffic simulation have either neglected such speed heterogeneity altogether or modelled it by dividing cyclists into a few discrete classes ignoring the entirety of the speed distribution. This paper proposes an efficient bicycle traffic simulation model with continuously speed heterogeneous cyclists and corresponding congestion effects. Based on individual-specific desired speeds and headway distance preferences, the model shows realistic speed-flow relationships validated with on-site observations while being capable of delaying rapid cyclists more often than slower ones in moderate traffic flows. The scalability of the model allows it to be large-scale applicable for network loading purposes, and thus suitable for evaluating impacts of cycling related infrastructure investments.",0191-2615,Not found

We propose a dynamic congestion approach that endogenously models queuing both on the road and at BRT stations, which are the center of our interest. We show analytically that, if capacity is perfectly divisible, implementing a BRT is always efficient (it decreases total social cost), while we show numerically that if capacity is not perfectly divisible, a BRT is in most cases efficient. Moreover, BRT can induce a Pareto Improvement where both time costs and public transport operating costs decrease. Compared to the optimum when buses run in mixed traffic, the optimal BRT system has: (i) Shorter period of bus operation and car-peak period, (ii) larger frequency and, very importantly, (iii) more boarding delays, i.e. longer queues at bus stops. Point (ii) implies that, while for some level of demands it may be optimal not to provide any public transport service under mixed traffic, with a BRT it may well be worthwhile.",0191-2615,Not found

Combined line planning and train timetabling for strongly heterogeneous railway lines with direct connections,10.1016/j.trb.2019.06.010,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Rail systems have been developing rapidly in recent years aiming at satisfying the growing passenger demand and shortening passenger travel time. The line planning problem (LPP) and train timetabling problem (TTP) are two key issues at the strategic level and tactical level, laying the foundation of a high-level service quality for railway operation. In this paper, a multi-frequency LPP (MF-LPP) model and a multi-period TTP (MP-TTP) model are introduced for direct connections, with consideration of both periodic and aperiodic nature to meet strongly heterogeneous train services and reduce the capacity loss of train operating companies. A combined LPP and TTP method is designed considering timetable robustness, timetable regularity, and passenger travel time. For a given line pool, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model for the MF-LPP is formulated to obtain a line plan with multiple line frequencies by minimizing travel time, empty-seat-hour and the number of lines. Using the acquired line plan from the previous step, a MP-TTP model is proposed to achieve the minimal travel time, the maximal timetable robustness and the minimal number of overtakings. The two models work iteratively with designed feedback constraints to find a better plan for the rail transport system.

Optimal port call adjustment for liner container shipping routes,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.015,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Container shipping companies usually alter their shipping networks in response to the seasonally changing shipping demand and freight rate. Rather than redesigning their shipping networks from scratch, they often choose to make small adjustments to the shipping routes by skipping some ports or adding additional calls to several ports. Inspired by above industrial practice in shipping network alteration, this study solves the port call adjustment problem (PCAP) to determine which port calls should be removed and which should be inserted for each route of a shipping network under the new shipping market patterns. A two-phase solution method is developed for the PCAP. In Phase 1, the candidate port calls for removal and insertion operations in each shipping route are determined. In Phase 2, the port call adjustment strategy is obtained by solving a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to select the port calls from these candidates identified in Phase 1 for actual removal and insertion operations. Considering the difficulties in solving the MILP model efficiently, two heuristic methods are also proposed to give near-optimal solutions in an acceptable computational time.

The l ∞-norm string stability is achieved by formulating constraints within the MPC based on the future states of the leading CAV, and the l 2-norm string stability is achieved by proper weight matrix tuning over a robust positive invariant set.

Constrained optimization for bottleneck coarse tolling,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.013,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"We study the optimal single-step coarse toll design problem for the bottleneck model where the toll level and tolling duration have maximum acceptable upper bounds and the unconstrained optimal solution exceeds the upper bounds. We consider proportional user heterogeneity where users’ values of time and schedule delay vary in fixed proportions. Three classic coarse tolling models are studied, the ADL, Laih and braking models. In the ADL model, untolled users form a mass arrival at the bottleneck following the last tolled user. In the Laih model, there is a separated waiting facility for untolled users to wait until the toll ends. In the braking model, untolled users can choose to defer their arrival at the bottleneck to avoid paying the toll. We find that, in the ADL and the Laih models, the optimal solution chooses the maximum acceptable toll level and tolling duration. The ADL model further requires the tolling period to be started as late as possible to eliminate the queue at the toll ending moment. In the braking model, if the upper bound of the tolling duration is too small, no toll should be charged. Otherwise the optimal solution chooses the maximum acceptable tolling duration and may choose a toll price less than the maximum acceptable level.",0191-2615,Not found
Position weighted backpressure intersection control for urban networks,10.1016/j.trb.2019.08.005,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Decentralized intersection control techniques have received recent attention in the literature as means to overcome scalability issues associated with network-wide intersection control. Chief among these techniques are backpressure (BP) control algorithms, which were originally developed of for large wireless networks. In addition to being light-weight computationally, they come with guarantees of performance at the network level, specifically in terms of network-wide stability. The dynamics in backpressure control are represented using networks of point queues and this also applies to all of the applications to traffic control. As such, BP in traffic fail to capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along the intersection links and, consequently, spill-back dynamics. This paper derives a position weighted backpressure (PWBP) control policy for network traffic applying continuum modeling principles of traffic dynamics and thus capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along network roads and spill-back dynamics. PWBP inherits the computational advantages of traditional BP. To prove stability of PWBP, (i) a Lyapunov functional that captures the spatial distribution of vehicles is developed; (ii) the capacity region of the network is formally defined in the context of macroscopic network traffic; and (iii) it is proved, when exogenous arrival rates are within the capacity region, that PWBP control is network stabilizing. We conduct comparisons against a real-world adaptive control implementation for an isolated intersection. Comparisons are also performed against other BP approaches in addition to optimized fixed timing control at the network level.

Flexible parking reservation system and pricing: A continuum approximation approach,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.006,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Reservation-based parking systems have the merit of eliminating vehicle cruising for parking.

To mitigate the service failure caused by random late departures of customers, we propose a new flexible reservation mechanism in which the reservation is no longer restricted to a specific location at a specific time, but tolerates predetermined spatiotemporal flexibility instead. With a pricing instrument designed for such parking flexibility, customers can coordinate to significantly reduce the reservation failure rate, resulting in an optimal system equilibrium benefiting the entire society. Due to the complex nature of this system, a continuum approximation framework is used to provide tractable analysis for a large-scale urban parking system.

We then study the integrated morning-evening commuting pattern at the system optimum and develop the road tolling scheme to achieve the system optimum. Furthermore, this study analyses the optimal AV parking supply strategy to minimise the total system cost, which is comprised of the total social parking cost and the total daily travel cost under either user equilibrium or system optimum traffic pattern.

This reformulation method also holds the promises to be applied in a broader set of routing and scheduling problems with periodic activity requirements. We also hope that this space-time network extension technique, as a special version of variable splitting methods in the dual decomposition literature, could potentially bridge the modeling gaps between cyclic and non-cyclic timetables. Specifically, the existing mathematical programming model for the periodic event scheduling problem (PESP) is transformed into a multi-commodity network flow model with two coupled schedule networks and side track capacity constraints. In addition, two dual decomposition methods including Lagrangian relaxation and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), are adopted to dualize the side track capacity constraints.

This is the first model to consider this full suite of decisions while also recognizing uncertainty in freight volumes. Given the computational difficulties associated with solving stochastic programs exactly, we propose a column-generation-based matheuristics scheme for addressing the model, which decomposes the optimization problem across multiple dimensions, and evaluates a neighboring solution across all scenarios. This is the first heuristic scheme for this class of problem and we assess its effectiveness on two sets of instances. The first is a set generated to mimic the operations of a Less-than-truckload freight transportation carrier and the second is based on the network of a European postal carrier.

A real-time deployable model predictive control-based cooperative platooning approach for connected and autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2019.08.002,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Recently, model predictive control (MPC)-based platooning strategies have been developed for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to enhance traffic performance by enabling cooperation among vehicles in the platoon. However, they are not deployable in practice as they require the embedded optimal control problem to be solved instantaneously, with platoon size and prediction horizon duration compounding the intractability. Ignoring the computational requirements leads to control delays that can deteriorate platoon performance and cause collisions between vehicles. To address this critical gap, this study first proposes an idealized MPC-based cooperative control strategy for CAV platooning based on the strong assumption that the problem can be solved instantaneously. It also proposes a solution algorithm for the embedded optimal control problem to maximize platoon performance. It then develops two approaches to deploy the idealized strategy, labeled the deployable MPC (DMPC) and the DMPC with first-order approximation (DMPC-FOA). The DMPC approach reserves certain amount of time before each sampling time instant to estimate the optimal control decisions. Thereby, the estimated optimal control decisions can be executed by all the following vehicles at each sampling time instant to control their behavior. However, under the DMPC approach, the estimated optimal control decisions may deviate significantly from those of the idealized MPC strategy due to prediction error of the leading vehicle's state at the sampling time instant. The DMPC-FOA approach can significantly improve the estimation performance of the DMPC approach by capturing the impacts of the prediction error of the leading vehicle's state on the optimal control decisions. An analytical method is derived for the sensitivity analysis of the optimal control decisions. Further, stability analysis is performed for the idealized MPC strategy, and a sufficient condition is derived to ensure its asymptotic stability under certain conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate that the control decisions estimated by the DMPC-FOA approach are very close to those of the idealized MPC strategy under different traffic flow scenarios. Hence, DMPC-FOA can address the issue of control delay of the idealized MPC strategy effectively and can efficiently coordinate car-following behaviors of all CAVs in the platoon to dampen traffic oscillations. Thereby, it can be applied for real-time cooperative control of a CAV platoon.",0191-2615,Not found

A formulation of unifiable multi-commodity kinematic wave model with relative speed ratios,10.1016/j.trb.2019.08.007,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Observations suggest that the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle is usually violated on multi-lane roads. Jin (2017) formulated and solved unifiable multi-commodity kinematic wave models, when different commodities have the same contributions to overall traffic congestion (unifiable) but may travel at different speeds (non-FIFO). However, the construction of unifiable multi-commodity fundamental diagrams and the assumption of concave or convex commodity flow proportion functions are purely mathematical and lack behavioral explanations. Thus the existing formulation is only of pure mathematical and theoretical interests and too complicated for real-world calibration, validation, or applications. In this study, we present a new formulation of unifiable multi-commodity kinematic wave models to address the aforementioned limitations. We first introduce a new variable for the relative speed ratios of different commodities and particularly discuss constant relative speed ratios. The relative speed ratios are physically, behaviorally, and economically meaningful since they characterize drivers’ relative aggressiveness, values of times, and other features. We then present unifiable multi-commodity fundamental diagrams based on the relative speed ratios, which can be used to derive the mathematical generating functions in Jin (2017). Then we show that non-FIFO multi-commodity kinematic wave model is a system of non-strictly hyperbolic conservation laws and solve the Riemann problem for a two-commodity system with constant relative speed ratios, in which the commodity flow proportion function is either concave or convex. We also present an empirical evidence for the existence of unifiable multi-commodity fundamental diagrams with constant relative speed ratios, which help to demonstrate the advantage of the new formulation. In summary, the new formulation is as general as the original formulation, but physically more meaningful, theoretically easier to solve, and empirically simpler to calibrate. Finally we conclude the study with discussions on potential future applications.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimization models for electric vehicle service operations: A literature review,10.1016/j.trb.2019.08.006,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are widely considered to be a solution to the problems of increasing carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. However, the adoption of EVs remains sluggish due to range anxiety, long charging times, and inconvenient and insufficient charging infrastructure. Various problems with EV service operations should be addressed to overcome these challenges. This study reviews the state-of-the-art mathematical modeling-based literature on EV operations management. The literature is classified according to recurring themes, such as EV charging infrastructure planning, EV charging operations, and public policy and business models. In each theme, typical optimization models and algorithms proposed in previous studies are surveyed.

An iterative re-optimization framework for the dynamic vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations,10.1016/j.trb.2019.08.004,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Branch-and-price has established itself as an effective solution methodology for a wide variety of planning problems. We investigate its potential as a solution methodology for solving operational problems. Specifically, we explore its potential in the context of a dynamic variant of the vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations, in which customer itineraries may change during the execution of a planned delivery schedule, which, in turn, may cause the planned delivery schedule to become suboptimal or even infeasible. We propose an iterative solution framework in which an active delivery schedule is re-optimized whenever a customer itinerary update is revealed. We use a branch-and-price algorithm for solving the planning problem (to obtain an initial delivery schedule) as well as the re-optimization problems (to obtain modified delivery schedules). As the re-optimization problems are solved during the execution of the (active) delivery schedule, it is critical to produce solutions quickly. This is accomplished by re-using, suitably modified, columns generated during preceding branch-and-price solves. The results of our computational experiments demonstrate the viability of using branch-and-price for solving operational problems and the benefit (necessity) of re-using information from previous solves.",0191-2615,Not found
Joint infrastructure planning and fleet management for one-way electric car sharing under time-varying uncertain demand,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.005,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"We propose an innovative framework to deploy a one-way Electric Vehicle (EV) sharing system that serves an urban area.

This substantially advances EV sharing system efficiency and yields a practical management strategy. We propose a multistage stochastic model to address the critical challenge of time-varying uncertain demand.

We reformulate the MILP into a more compact set-partitioning formulation, develop a column generation algorithm for solving the problem, and propose three performance enhancement strategies, namely, a row generation method, a pricing problem reduction method, and a heuristic pricing method, to accelerate the convergence of the column generation algorithm.

Fleet sizing for one-way electric carsharing services considering dynamic vehicle relocation and nonlinear charging profile,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.016,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This study aims to determine the electric vehicle fleet size for one-way carsharing services by maximizing the profit of carsharing operators while taking into account the vehicle relocation operations and nonlinear electric vehicle charging profile.

In particular, an effective multi-label correcting method is developed to solve the pricing problem (i.e., generate columns) within the B&P approach. A novel non-dominated charging strategy is put up to avoid the exponential growth of labels caused by the allowance of partial charging with a nonlinear charging profile. In addition to the B&P approach, two heuristic methods are put forward for solving the large-scale problems or reinforcing the B&P approach. Numerical experiments with randomly generated instances and a case study based on a one-way carsharing operator in Singapore are conducted to further assess the efficiency and applicability of the proposed solution methods.

This extended estimation takes into account multiple trips per individual, as well as mode availability. The model was estimated using the novel dataset gathered in Austria in 2015. It includes individual-specific information on time-use, expenditures and mode choice. As a result, we calculate the value of leisure (VoL), travel time savings (VTTS) and time assigned to travel (VTAT), that are relevant inputs to appraisals of transport policies. We also show that, at least for the Austrian working population, the omission of expenditures in the model might result in a significant overestimation of the value of leisure (16.83%); the VoL (9.29€/h) was estimated to be considerably lower than the wage rate (12.14€/h) and the VTTS varies strongly between the modes (9.98€/h for car, 3.91€/h for public transport, 9.25€/h for bike and 17.53€/h for walk).

Optimizing Omni-Channel Fulfillment with Store Transfers,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.002,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The presence of different distribution channels in omni-channel retail makes the fulfillment process challenging. When consumers can buy online and pick up their purchased goods at a store, the stores are often visited by a vehicle that supplies the pick-up points (PUPs) and by a vehicle that replenishes the store’s inventory. We study the benefit of exploiting any spare capacity in the vehicles replenishing store inventories to reduce online order fulfillment cost by transferring online orders to these vehicles at one or more of the stores visited. This involves choosing transfer locations and the set of stores whose online orders are transferred at these locations so as to minimize the online order fulfillment cost. We present a mixed integer linear programming model as well as an effective and efficient heuristic for solving this problem.

A cumulative service state representation for the pickup and delivery problem with transfers,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.015,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The pickup and delivery problem with transfers is a challenging version of the vehicle routing problem. In order to tackle this problem, we add a time dimension to physical transportation networks to not only track the location of vehicles at any time but also impose parcels’ pickup/delivery time windows, synchronization time points, and precedence constraints to the problem. We also add another dimension, described as the “cumulative service state” to the constructed space-time network to track the service status of parcels at any time. The constructed network not only handles real-life transportation networks but also is well-suited for connecting microscopic cumulative service states to macroscopic cumulative flow count diagrams. We develop a continuous time approximation approach using cumulative arrival, departure, and on-board count diagrams to effectively assess the performance of the system and dynamically constrict the search space. To handle a large-scale set of parcels, we develop the traditional cluster-first, route-second approach. We reach optimality for the clusters derived from the original set of parcels. We also propose an integer programming model to improve the vehicles’ efficiency. We perform extensive numerical experiments over the standard data set used by Ropke and Pisinger (2006) and real-world large-scale data set proposed by Cainiao Network (with about 10,000 delivery orders) to examine the computational efficiency of our developed algorithm.",0191-2615,Not found
On the role of speed adaptation and spacing indifference in traffic instability: Evidence from car-following experiments and its stochastic model,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.014,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the emergence and evolution of oscillations in traffic flow has been a subject of intensive research by numerous scholars. In our previous work, we proposed a new mechanism to explain the generation of traffic oscillations: traffic instability caused by the competition between speed adaptation and stochastic effects. By conducting a closer examination of car following data obtained in a 25-car platoon experiment, we discovered in this work that the speed difference plays a more important role on car-following dynamics than the spacing, and when its amplitude is small, the growth of oscillations is mainly determined by the stochastic factors that follow the mean reversion process; when its amplitude increases, the growth of the oscillations is determined by the competition between the stochastic factors and the speed difference. An explanation is then provided, based on the above findings, to why the speed variance in the oscillatory traffic grows in a concave way along the platoon. We also proposed a mode-switching stochastic car-following model that incorporates the speed adaptation and spacing indifference behavior of drivers, which captures the observed characteristics of oscillation and discharge rate. Finally, our sensitivity analysis shows that the influence on oscillation growth and discharge rate is small by the reaction delay but large by the indifference region boundary.",0191-2615,Not found
Congestion and environmental toll schemes for the morning commute with heterogeneous users and parallel routes,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.012,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"We design a congestion and environmental toll (CET) scheme for the morning commute with heterogeneous users in a single OD network with parallel routes. The designed toll scheme relies upon the concept of marginal-cost pricing and is anonymous. The Henderson approach is used to model road congestion and the tolling problem to examine commuter's arrival time and route choice at the CET equilibrium (CETE). Linear interpolation is applied to approximate the emission cost function and the resulting CETE problem is formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem, which is solved by the modified Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method. Unlike the existing approach, this novel approach does not require that the arrival of each group of commuters at the destination at the equilibrium follows a predetermined order, and can handle non-monotone (emission) cost function. As two special cases, no-toll equilibrium (NTE) and the congestion toll equilibrium (CTE) are also examined, and the two resultant equilibrium problems are formulated and solved by the same approach. This approach is shown to be more efficient than the existing approach. Bi-level programming models are proposed to formulate the optimal congestion toll and CET design problems, in which the CTE and CETE problems are the corresponding lower level problem. These models are solved by the double BFGS method, which uses a classical BFGS method to solve the upper level model and the proposed BFGS method to solve the lower level model.

A general equilibrium model for transportation systems with e-hailing services and flow congestion,10.1016/j.trb.2019.08.012,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Passengers are increasingly using e-hailing as a means to request transportation services. Adoption of these types of services has the potential to impact the travel behavior of individuals as well as increase congestion and vehicle miles driven since extra deadhead miles must be added to the trip (e.g., the extra miles from the driver location to the pick-up location of the customer). The objective of this paper is to develop a basic mathematical model to help transportation planners understand the relationship between the wide-scale use of e-hailing transportation services and deadhead miles and resulting impact on congestion. Specifically, this paper develops a general economic equilibrium model at the macroscopic level to describe the equilibrium state of a transportation system composed of solo drivers and the e-hailing service providers (e-HSPs). The equilibrium model consists of three interacting sub-models: e-HSP choice, customer choice, and network congestion; the model is completed with a “market clearance” condition describing the waiting costs in the customer’s optimization problem in terms of the e-HSPs’ decisions, thereby connecting the supply and demand sides of the equilibrium. We show the existence of an equilibrium of a certain kind under some mild assumptions. In numerical experiments, we illustrate the sensitivity on the usage of these modes to various parameters representing cost, value of time, safety, and comfort level, as well as the resulting relationship between usage of these services and vehicle miles.",0191-2615,Not found
Investigating the effect of temporal and spatial flexibility on the performance of one-way electric carsharing systems,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.003,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"One-way electric carsharing systems provide an environmentally friendly option for facilitating urban mobility needs. However, the management of one-way electric carsharing systems presents operational challenges stemming from the need to relocate cars in order to strike an optimum balance between demand and supply. As a result, the cost associated with vehicle relocation operations represents a significant proportion of the total operating cost. In the context of electric carsharing systems, the problem of vehicle relocation is further exacerbated by the car battery charging requirements. The introduction of temporal and spatial flexibility regarding the pick-up and drop-off of vehicles provides the means of improving the efficiency of one-way electric carsharing systems. However, the literature currently lacks models that can be used to investigate the effect of temporal and spatial flexibility on the performance of one-way electric carsharing systems. In this paper, we are introducing an integrated modeling and solution framework for investigating the effect of temporal and/or spatial flexibility, and different options for processing trip requests to the profitability and utilization of one-way electric carsharing systems. The application of the proposed framework to a realistic size system suggests that spatial flexibility has a stronger effect on the system performance than temporal flexibility. Furthermore, both spatial and temporal flexibility can increase the profitability of the system by serving more customers with fewer vehicle relocation needs.",0191-2615,Not found
Accelerating the adoption of automated vehicles by subsidies: A dynamic games approach,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.011,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Early deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) may likely cause a loss of efficiency in the transportation system. However, after there are a sufficient number of such vehicles in the traffic stream, many benefits can be realized. It thus appears sensible to provide subsidies to promote the early adoption of AVs and shorten the transition period. This paper investigates an optimal subsidy policy that accelerates the deployment of AVs from lower to higher market penetration rates. The policy can maximize the government agency’s expected total payoff associated with the AV deployment. The main contribution is a dynamic games approach that considers the uncertainty in the market forecast and the information asymmetry between the government agency and the subsidized entities.",0191-2615,Not found
ADMM-based problem decomposition scheme for vehicle routing problem with time windows,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.009,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Emerging urban logistics applications need to address various challenges, including complex traffic conditions and time-sensitive requirements. In this study, in the context of urban logistics, we consider a vehicle routing problem with time-dependent travel times and time windows (VRPTW), and the goal is to minimize the total generalized costs including the transportation, waiting time, and fixed costs associated with each vehicle. We adopt a high-dimensional space–time network flow model to formulate an underlying vehicle routing problem (VRP) with a rich set of criteria and constraints. A difficult issue, when solving VRPs, is how to iteratively improve both the primal and dual solution quality in general and how to break the symmetry generated by many identical solutions, particularly with homogeneous vehicles. Along this line, many coupling constraints, such as the consensus constraints across different agents or decision makers, need to be carefully addressed to find high-quality optimal or close-to-optimal solutions under medium- or large-scale instances. Currently, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used in the field of convex optimization, as an integration of the augmented Lagrangian relaxation and block coordinate descent methods, for machine learning and large-scale continuous systems optimization and control. In this work, we introduce the use of ADMM to solve the multi-VRP, which is a special case of integer linear programming, and demonstrate a manner to reduce the quadratic penalty terms used in ADMM into simple linear functions. In a broader context, a computationally reliable decomposition framework is developed to iteratively improve both the primal and dual solution quality. Essentially, the least-cost path subproblem or other similar subproblems involving binary decisions can be embedded into a sequential solution scheme with an output of both lower bound estimates and upper bound feasible solutions.

Impact of ride-pooling on the nature of transit network design,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.007,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"This paper examines the basic design trade-off in six distinctive transit systems, including two state-of-the-art fixed-route systems and four hybrid systems that use ride-pooling as an integrated feeder service. The systems are analyzed using a continuous approximation approach, and the resulting optimal design problem is formulated and solved as a mixed integer program. We find that ride-pooling changes little the fundamental laws inherent in transit design. Specifically, all six systems, despite their seemingly vastly different design features, display the following laws: (1) that the per capita agency cost correlates linearly with the per capita user cost, (2) that both costs are power functions of the demand density with an exponent close to − 1 3 and − 0.4 for agency and user costs, respectively, and (3) that the per capita agency cost is not significantly affected by city size but the user cost is. This finding suggests that ride-pooling may have a rather limited impact on the economy of scale in mass transit systems. However, mixing ride-pooling with fixed-route services does promise modest improvements to the overall system efficiency. It also tilts the balance of trade-off considerably in the user’s favor, at the operator’s expense.",0191-2615,Not found
Regulating TNCs: Should Uber and Lyft set their own rules?,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.008,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"We evaluate the impact of three proposed regulations of transportation network companies (TNCs) like Uber, Lyft and Didi: (1) A minimum wage for drivers, (2) a cap on the number of drivers or vehicles, and (3) a per-trip congestion tax. The impact is assessed using a queuing theoretic equilibrium model which incorporates the stochastic dynamics of the app-based ride-hailing matching platform, the ride prices and driver wages established by the platform, and the incentives of passengers and drivers. We show that a floor placed under driver earnings can push the ride-hailing platform to hire more drivers and offer more rides, at the same time that passengers enjoy faster rides and lower total cost, while platform rents are reduced. Contrary to standard competitive labor market theory, enforcing a minimum wage for drivers benefits both drivers and passengers, and promotes the efficiency of the entire system. This surprising outcome holds for almost all model parameters, and it occurs because the wage floor curbs TNC labor market power. In contrast to a wage floor, imposing a cap on the number of vehicles hurts drivers, because the platform reaps all the benefits of limiting supply. The congestion tax has the expected impact: fares increase, wages and platform revenue decrease. We also construct variants of the model to briefly discuss platform subsidy, platform competition, and autonomous vehicles.",0191-2615,Not found

These companies connect passengers and drivers in real time and are disruptively changing the transportation industry. As pioneers in a general sharing economy context, ridesourcing shared transportation platforms consist of a typical two-sided market. On the demand side, passengers are sensitive to the price and quality of the service. On the supply side, drivers, as freelancers, make working decisions flexibly based on their income from the platform and many other factors. Diverse variables and factors in the system are strongly endogenous and interactively dependent. How to design and operate ridesourcing systems is vital—and challenging—for all stakeholders: passengers/users, drivers/service providers, platforms, policy makers, and the general public.

In the proposed framework, we mainly focus on three modes: driving solo, ridesharing, and e-hailing service. The four types of traffic flows are: personal vehicle drivers, e-hailing drivers, ridesharing riders, and e-hailing passengers. The first two flows contribute to traffic congestion while the latter two do not. To capture their interactions, a super extended network is created with four copied networks each of whom represents one type of traffic flow. The equilibrium of new mobility systems can then be reformulated as a quasi-variational inequality and solution existence is discussed.

Spatio-temporal traffic queue detection for uninterrupted flows,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.001,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"When traffic flow exceeds capacity because of demand fluctuations, crashes, work zones, and special events, a traffic queue is formed on a highway.

This study presents a real-time spatio-temporal traffic queue detection algorithm that builds on traffic flow fundamentals combined with a statistical pattern recognition procedure. Using flow-density data, traffic flow phase is classified as either congested or uncongested flow in a probabilistic manner, based on Gaussian mixture models for each location in such a way that detects the traffic phase transitions. The proposed detection algorithm was applied to detect traffic queues using traffic detector data from Interstate 40 in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Paradox links can improve system efficiency: An illustration in traffic assignment problem,10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.018,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"This paper demonstrates a counter-intuitive phenomenon that “paradox links” (i.e. marginally improving or adding these links will increase a system's cost) can sometimes decrease a system's cost.

Here, we refer this phenomenon as the “non-monotonicity” of the paradox with regard to the degree of link improvement and the number of additional paradox links. Firstly, a formal definition of ""non-monotonicity"" property of paradox in a rigorous mathematical manner is proposed. Then this non-monotonicity property is demonstrated to widely exist in the user equilibrium (UE), the stochastic assignment, and the stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) models by two simple networks, where the underlying reasons for this phenomenon in different scenarios are analyzed and compared.

Capturing network properties with a functional form for the multi-modal macroscopic fundamental diagram,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.004,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"In urban road networks, the interactions between different modes can clearly impact the overall travel production. Although those interactions can be quantified with the multi-modal macroscopic fundamental diagram; so far, no functional form exists for this diagram to explicitly capture operational and network properties. In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate such functional form, and we show its applicability to the specific case of a bi-modal network with buses and cars. The proposed functional form has two components. First, a three dimensional lower envelope limits travel production to the theoretical best-case situation for any given number of vehicles for the different modes. The lower envelope’s parameters are derived from topology and operational features of the road network. Second, a smoothing parameter quantifies how interactions between all vehicle types reduce travel production from the theoretical best-case. The smoothing parameter is estimated with network topology and traffic data. In the case no traffic data is available, our functional form is still applicable. The lower envelope can be approximated assuming fundamental parameters of traffic operations. For the smoothing parameter, we show that it always hold similar values even for different networks, making its approximation also possible. This feature of the proposed functional form is an advantage compared to curve fitting, as it provides a reasonable shape for the multi-modal macroscopic fundamental diagram irrespective of traffic data availability.

Multiclass information flow propagation control under vehicle-to-vehicle communication environments,10.1016/j.trb.2019.09.005,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Most existing models for information flow propagation in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications environment are descriptive. They lack capabilities to control information flow, which may preclude their ability to meet application needs, including the need to propagate different information types simultaneously to different target locations within corresponding time delay bounds. This study proposes a queuing-based modeling approach to control the propagation of information flow of multiple classes. Two control parameters associated with a vehicle, the number of communication servers and the mean communication service rate, are leveraged to control the propagation performance of different information classes. A two-layer model is developed to characterize the information flow propagation wave (IFPW) under the designed queuing strategy. The upper layer is formulated as integro-differential equations to characterize the spatiotemporal information dissemination due to V2V communication. The lower layer characterizes the traffic flow dynamics using the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards model. The analytical solution of the asymptotic density of informed vehicles and the necessary condition for existence of the IFPW are derived for homogeneous traffic conditions. Numerical experiments provide insights on the impact of the mean communication service rate on information spread and its spatial coverage. Further, a numerical solution method is developed to solve the two-layer model, which aids in estimating the impacts of the control parameters in the queuing strategy on the IFPW speed under homogenous and heterogeneous conditions. The proposed modeling approach enables controlling the propagation of information of different information classes to meet application needs, which can assist traffic managers to design effective and efficient traffic management and control strategies under V2V communications.",0191-2615,Not found
Dynamic prediction-based relocation policies in one-way station-based carsharing systems with complete journey reservations,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.004,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"In this paper, we study the operations of a one-way station-based carsharing system implementing a complete journey reservation policy. We consider the percentage of served demand as a primary performance measure and analyze the effect of several dynamic staff-based relocation policies. Specifically, we introduce a new proactive relocation policy based on Markov chain dynamics that utilizes reservation information to better predict the future states of the stations. This policy is compared to a state-of-the art staff-based relocation policy and a centralistic relocation model assuming full knowledge of the demand. Numerical results from a real-world implementation and a simulation analysis demonstrate the positive impact of dynamic relocations and highlight the improvement in performance obtained with the proposed proactive relocation policy.",0191-2615,Not found
Measuring travel time reliability and risk: A nonparametric approach,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.009,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The reliability of travel time significantly affects individual travelers’ decision-making behaviour and hence in turn influences the overall travel demand at the macroscopic level. The travel time reliability ratio (TTRR), defined to be the ratio of the value of travel time variability to the value of travel time, is an important metric for measuring such reliability. In this paper, we first show that the TTRR is closely related to a widely used risk measure in financial economics, i.e. conditional value at risk (CVaR). Then based on the connection between the TTRR and CVaR, we develop a nonparametric approach to estimate the TTRR. In the literature, to compute the TTRR, it usually needs to assume a specific statistical distribution for the travel time. This can produce a misleading result when this assumption goes awry due to the potential complexity of travel time distributions. Based on the relationship between the TTRR and CVaR, this paper proposes a new nonparametric method, i.e. the kernel density estimation method, to overcome this problem. We show that this new nonparametric method is robust in terms that it does not depend on any assumptions about the shape of the travel time distribution. The simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and substantially improves the numerical accuracy. Finally, a practical example is used to illustrate the proposed method.",0191-2615,Not found
Blue phase: Optimal network traffic control for legacy and autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2019.11.001,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"With the forecasted emergence of autonomous vehicles in urban traffic networks, new control policies are needed to leverage their potential for reducing congestion. While several efforts have studied the fully autonomous traffic control problem, there is a lack of models addressing the more imminent transitional stage wherein legacy and autonomous vehicles share the urban infrastructure. We address this gap by introducing a new policy for stochastic network traffic control involving both classes of vehicles. We conjecture that network links will have dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles which provide access to traffic intersections and combine traditional green signal phases with autonomous vehicle-restricted signal phases named blue phases. We propose a new pressure-based, decentralized, hybrid network control policy that activates selected movements at intersections based on the solution of mixed-integer linear programs. We prove that the proposed policy is stable, i.e. maximizes network throughput, under conventional travel demand conditions. We conduct numerical experiments to test the proposed policy under varying proportions of autonomous vehicles. Our experiments reveal that considerable trade-offs exist in terms of vehicle-class travel time based on the level of market penetration of autonomous vehicles. Further, we find that the proposed hybrid network control policy improves on traditional green phase traffic signal control for high levels of congestion, thus helping in quantifying the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles in urban networks.",0191-2615,Not found
Grouped travel time estimation in signalized arterials using point-to-point detectors,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.007,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Travel time, an essential parameter in Advanced Traffic Management Systems and Advanced Traveller Information Systems, has been studied for decades of years, especially on freeways. However, the traffic flows in signalized arterials are more complex and stochastic, which enables arterial travel times to be multistate due to the interruptions from signal controls. Therefore, the signal effects need to be considered in the estimation of arterial travel times. In this paper, a grouped travel time estimation method is proposed to consider the signal interruptions and estimate the arterial travel times on a more micro level. With the data obtained from point-to-point detectors, the method analyzes vehicles’ traffic states before signals and recognizes those vehicles sharing the same states in both upstream and downstream signals as vehicle groups. Then the estimation problem is formulated as a clustering process to recognize the vehicle groups, and the grouped travel times are represented by the centers of vehicle groups. The field tests under ten different scenarios show that the grouped travel times can capture the multistate properties of the travel times in signalized arterials and represent the observed travel times of most vehicles within minor deviations.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal zone sizes and headways for flexible-route bus services,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.006,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Flexible-route bus systems serving passengers at their doorsteps may be preferable to fixed-route bus systems in areas with low demand densities or whose roads cannot accommodate relatively large fixed-route buses. Flexible-route systems may also be preferable for elderly or handicapped riders for whom accessing the pre-determined stops on fixed routes is difficult. Since bus systems with flexible demand-responsive routes retain the economic and environmental advantages of public transportation, it is important to analyze them and optimize their characteristics to match their operating environments. This study shows how the total cost can be minimized for a flexible-route bus system with a many-to-one demand pattern by jointly optimizing its headway and service zone size. Numerical results demonstrate the model's applicability and indicate how such flexible-route systems should be adapted to demand characteristics and planning constraints.",0191-2615,Not found
Design of build-operate-transfer contract for integrated rail and property development with uncertainty in future urban population,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.003,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper proposes a novel model of the design of a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract for integrated rail and property (R + P) development when the size of future urban population is uncertain. A real-option approach is adopted to accurately capture the potential economic value of a BOT investment project under uncertainty and its externality effects on urban spatial structure. The proposed model is formulated as a two-stage problem. The first stage of the model optimizes the concession period and rail line parameters (including rail line length, and number and locations of stations) through a Nash bargaining game between a private investor and the government. The second stage determines the headways and fares during the private operation and after transferring the BOT project to the government. The private investor's objective is to maximize its own net profit received during the concession period, whereas the government aims to maximize social welfare over the whole life-cycle of the project. The proposed model is extended to explore the effects of future population jumps due to non-recurrent random events and station deployments with even and uneven station spacings. The results show that compared with the rail-only scheme, the R + P scheme can lead to a win-win situation for the government and private investor. In the BOT contract design, ignoring the effects of population jumps and using an average (or even) station spacing as an estimate of actual station deployment can cause a large bias of the parameter values designed in the contract and an underestimate of project values in terms of expected net profit and expected social welfare.",0191-2615,Not found
Quantitative measurement of social repulsive force in pedestrian movements based on physiological responses,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.008,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The pedestrian movement in the crowds is a paradigmatic example of collective motion where social interactions play an important role. The psychological behaviors of pedestrians underlying crowd movements are usually based on intuitive assumptions, and so far a quantitative measurement of social repulsive force in pedestrian movements has been rarely reported. In this work, we perform different types of human experiments in face-to-face and face-to-back situations as well as walking, running and blind conditions to indirectly measure the social repulsive force based on the human physiological response to stress, i.e., the skin conductance response (SCR). It is demonstrated that the social repulsive force tends to increase with the moving speed of participants, and is much stronger in the face-to-face orientation compared to that in the face-to-back orientation. As interesting outcomes, a relationship between SCR amplitude and interpersonal distances is also observed, and statistical results show that the logistic functional form has a better fit to the measurement data of SCR amplitude than the classical exponential function due to the existence of a diminishing marginal utility in human psychology. Moreover, the observed repulsive force coefficients in running experiment slightly exceed those in walking experiment because faster running speed will cause more serious body conflict, thereby leading to a higher physiological arousal level. Especially, the social repulsive forces under the condition of zero visibility only occur where there is a body contact, which are significantly higher than those in walking and running experiments because of the panic psychology and unexpected danger in a blind environment. These experimental findings are further confirmed by numerical simulations performed by solving a modified social force model that incorporates logistic repulsive forces. The simulated velocity distributions in different types of psychological situations all demonstrate remarkable consistence with the experimental results. Therefore, this work establishes a direct link between behavioral responses and cognitive effort, and gives new insights into pedestrian dynamics from a social psychological perspective.",0191-2615,Not found
Efficiency and traffic safety with pay for performance in road transportation,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.005,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"We propose a theoretical model in order to study the behavior of a road transport company and a driver. The driver is supposed to face a pay for performance contract. The expected profit for the company and the expected utility for the driver depend on the input chosen by themselves and the other actor. By analyzing the possible interaction going on between the actors in a simultaneous game and the two possible leader-follower games, it is seen that the efforts could be strategic complements, independent or strategic substitutes. In cases where the efforts are strategic complements, and the expected profit for the company and the expected utility for the driver are increasing in the other actor's effort, leader-follower games trigger higher accident risks than the simultaneous game. If efforts are strategic complements, and the expected profit and utility are decreasing in the other actor's effort, leader-follower games produce lower accident risks than when the actors move simultaneously. Presuming that the transport company is the principal and the driver is the agent, we deduce an optimal pay contract. The optimal contract is characterized by a pay for performance contract where the driver's share of net revenue becomes higher the higher influence a marginal increase in her effort has on the net revenue, the lower influence a marginal increase in her effort has on the probability of accidents, and the lower the loss the company experiences if an accident occurs. When such a contract is used, the driver faces a situation where the transport company's interests are perfectly internalized, meaning that the company also maximizes the sum of the expected profit and utility. However, since accidents also mean costs for others apart from the driver and the company, public regulation is needed to ensure overall welfare.",0191-2615,Not found
An epidemiological diffusion framework for vehicular messaging in general transportation networks,10.1016/j.trb.2019.11.004,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Emerging Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) technologies are expected to significantly contribute to the safety and growth of shared transportation provided challenges towards their deployment can be overcome. This paper focuses on one such challenge: characterizing the fraction of vehicles which have received a message, as a function of space and time, and operating under different traffic and communication conditions. V2V technologies bridge two infrastructures: communication and transportation. These infrastructures are interconnected and interdependent. To capture this inter-dependence, which may vary in time and space, we propose a new methodology for modeling information propagation between V2V-enabled vehicles. The model is based on a continuous-time Markov chain which is shown to converge, under appropriate conditions, to a set of clustered epidemiological differential equations. The fraction of vehicles which have received a message, as a function of space and time may be obtained as a solution of these differential equations, which can be solved efficiently, independently of the number of vehicles. Such characterizations can form the basis of assessing several attributes of V2V systems, some of which we demonstrate. The characterizations lend themselves to a variety of generalizations and capture various interdependencies between communication and mobility. As tests of the model we provide applications both in real-world settings using microscopic traffic traces and in postulated scenarios of outages and system perturbations: we find good model agreement with microscopic trajectory from two actual trajectory datasets, as well as a synthetic trajectory dataset generated from the origin/destination matrix.",0191-2615,https://github.com/jungyeol-kim/V2X-simulations

We show that the problem is NP-hard, and investigate several special cases of the problem that are solvable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we show that the local search for the general problem is equivalent to the well-studied maximum directed cut problem. As such, we use an approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem to solve the timetable synchronization problem. We assess the quality of the algorithm on a real-world case study, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in the literature. Lastly, we relax the fixed headway assumption, and propose an efficient recursive quasi-linear time algorithm to minimize the total transfer waiting time in this general setting.",0191-2615,Not found
Bayesian estimation of mixed multinomial logit models: Advances and simulation-based evaluations,10.1016/j.trb.2019.12.001,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Variational Bayes (VB) methods have emerged as a fast and computationally-efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for scalable Bayesian estimation of mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) models. It has been established that VB is substantially faster than MCMC at practically no compromises in predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address two critical gaps concerning the usage and understanding of VB for MMNL. First, extant VB methods are limited to utility specifications involving only individual-specific taste parameters. Second, the finite-sample properties of VB estimators and the relative performance of VB, MCMC and maximum simulated likelihood estimation (MSLE) are not known. To address the former, this study extends several VB methods for MMNL to admit utility specifications including both fixed and random utility parameters. To address the latter, we conduct an extensive simulation-based evaluation to benchmark the extended VB methods against MCMC and MSLE in terms of estimation times, parameter recovery and predictive accuracy. The results suggest that all VB variants with the exception of the ones relying on an alternative variational lower bound constructed with the help of the modified Jensen’s inequality perform as well as MCMC and MSLE at prediction and parameter recovery. In particular, VB with nonconjugate variational message passing and the delta-method (VB-NCVMP-Δ) is up to 16 times faster than MCMC and MSLE. Thus, VB-NCVMP-Δ can be an attractive alternative to MCMC and MSLE for fast, scalable and accurate estimation of MMNL models.",0191-2615,https://github.com/RicoKrueger/bayes_mxl
Trial-and-error operation schemes for bimodal transport systems,10.1016/j.trb.2019.11.006,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"We concern the modal choice of commuters in a transport system comprising a highway, which is only used by autos, in parallel to a transit line, which is only used by buses. In the transport system, the in-vehicle congestion of passengers in bus carriages is treated as a negative externality cost of affecting the modal choice of commuters and commuters choose their travel modes according to the perceived travel costs of transport modes. We propose two trial-and-error operation schemes for the transport system without resorting to both the function of in-vehicle congestion costs and the distribution of perceived travel cost errors. In the first operation scheme, the manager (or the government) determines the transit fare charged from (or financial subsidy to) bus users from period to period so as to minimize the system time cost of the transport system. The second operation scheme is established from the viewpoint of a private firm that operates the public transit line. The operator determines the transit fare and bus run frequency from period to period in order to maximize its operating profit. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the two operation schemes for optimizing the system time cost and the operating profit by both theoretical analyses and numerical examples.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimizing matching time interval and matching radius in on-demand ride-sourcing markets,10.1016/j.trb.2019.11.005,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"With the availability of the location information of drivers and passengers, ride-sourcing platforms can now provide increasingly efficient online matching compared with physical searching and meeting performed in the traditional taxi market. The matching time interval (the time interval over which waiting passengers and idle drivers are accumulated and then subjected to peer-to-peer matching) and matching radius (or maximum allowable pick-up distance, within which waiting passengers and idle drivers can be matched or paired) are two key control variables that a platform can employ to optimize system performance in an online matching system. By appropriately extending the matching time interval, the platform can accumulate large numbers of waiting (or unserved) passengers and idle drivers and thus match the two pools with a reduced expected pick-up distance. However, if the matching time interval is excessively long, certain passengers may become impatient and even abandon their requests. Meanwhile, a short matching radius can reduce the expected pick-up distance but may decrease the matching rate as well. Therefore, the matching time interval and matching radius should be optimized to enhance system efficiency in terms of passenger waiting time, vehicle utilization, and matching rate. This study proposes a model that delineates the online matching process in ride-sourcing markets. The model is then used to examine the impact of the matching time interval and matching radius on system performance and to jointly optimize the two variables under different levels of supply and demand. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate how the proposed modeling and optimization approaches can improve the real-time matching of ride-sourcing platforms.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal design of transit networks fed by shared bikes,10.1016/j.trb.2019.11.003,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Transit systems are designed in which access and egress can occur via a shared-bike service. Patrons may walk to shared-bike docking stations nearest their origins, and then cycle to their nearest transit stations where they deposit the bikes. The travel pattern is reversed when patrons cycle from their final transit stations on to their destinations. Patrons choose between this option and that of solely walking to or from transit stations. Shared bikes are priced to achieve the system-optimal assignment of the two feeder options. Transit trunk-line networks are laid-out in hybrid fashion, as proposed in Daganzo (2010). Transit lines thus form square grids inside city centers, and radiate outward in the peripheries. As in Daganzo (2010) and other studies, a set of simplifying assumptions are adopted that pertain primarily to the nature of travel demand. These enable the formulation of a parsimonious, continuous model. The model produces designs that minimize total travel costs, and is ideally suited for high-level (i.e., strategic) planning. A similar model is developed for systems in which access or egress to or from transit can occur solely by walking, or by walking and riding fixed-route feeder buses in combination. The shared-bike and feeder-bus models both complement Daganzo's original model in which access and egress occur solely by walking. Comparisons of these feeder options are drawn through numerical analyses. These are performed in parametric fashion by varying city size, travel demand, and economic conditions; and for trunk services that are provided either by ordinary buses, Bus Rapid Transit, or metro rail. Designs are produced for cases in which shared-bike and feeder-bus services are made to fit pre-existing and unchangeable trunk-line networks; and for cases in which trunk and feeder services are optimized jointly. Outcomes reveal that shared-bike feeder systems can often reduce costs over walking alone, with cost savings as high as 7%, even when the shared bikes are made to fit a pre-existing transit network. Shared-biking often outperforms feeder-bus service as well. We further find that the joint optimization of trunk and shared-bike feeder services can reduce costs not only to users, but also to the transit agency that operates these services. Savings to the agency can be used to subsidize shared-bike services. We show that with or without this subsidy, shared-bike systems can always break even when they are suitably priced, and jointly optimized with trunk service.",0191-2615,Not found
A dynamic user equilibrium model for multi-region macroscopic fundamental diagram systems with time-varying delays,10.1016/j.trb.2019.11.002,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) has been widely used for aggregate modeling of urban traffic network dynamics to tackle the dimensionality problem of microscopic approaches. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by proposing a dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) model that enables simultaneous route choice and departure time choice under the MFD framework for various applications such as park-and-ride, vehicle dispatching and relocation. To better capture the traffic flow propagation and to adapt to the fast time-varying demand, the state-dependent travel time function is integrated into the MFD dynamics as an endogenous time-varying delay. The multi-region MFD dynamics with saturated state and inflow constraints is then used as the network loading model to formulate the DUE model through the lens of the differential variational inequality. Necessary conditions for the DUE are analytically derived using the Pontryagin minimum principle. Difficulties raised in handling the dynamic state-dependent nonlinear travel time functions, state and inflow constraints are addressed without model linearization nor enforcing constant delay assumption as conventionally done in the literature. The additional cost induced by inflow capacity and accumulation constraints can capture the hypercongestion represented by the downward sloping part of the MFD without actually activating traffic congestion. Numerical examples solved by using time-discretization solution algorithm illustrate the DUE characteristics and the corresponding dynamic external costs induced by constraints.",0191-2615,Not found

We build on the extant literature on continuum approximation of optimal route distances and propose adjustment factors that account for the effects of integrated pickup and delivery operations. By means of comprehensive numerical experiments and regression analysis, we further propose a set of closed-form adjustment factors that improve existing continuum approximation-based route length estimations. These adjustment factors incorporate some non-trivial route efficiency trade-offs emerging from first-mile and last-mile integration that cannot easily be captured through continuum approximation. The proposed extensions are particularly relevant for the optimal strategic design and operational planning of large-scale, high-density last-mile distribution systems that are gaining in importance in light of e-commerce and omni-channel retailing. Our analyses suggest that the efficiency gains emerging from integrating first-mile pickup and last-mile delivery operations can be as high as 30%. However, the effective efficiency gains are sensitive to vehicle capacity constraints and other factors complicating the optimal stop sequence in integrated routes. We apply our proposed method to a real-world case study informed by operational data from one of India’s largest e-commerce platforms for the city of Bengaluru.

Specifically, stochastic stability, which is the concept of stability in evolutionary dynamics subjected to stochastic effects, is herein considered. To achieve this, a new approach is developed by synthesizing the three concepts: the decomposition technique of DUE assignments, the weakly acyclic game, and the asymptotic analysis of the stationary distribution of perturbed dynamics. Specifically, we first formulate a DUE assignment as a strategic game (DUE game) that deals with atomic users. We then prove that there exists an appropriate order of assigning users for ensuring equilibrium in a unidirectional network. With this property, we establish the relationship between DUE games in unidirectional networks and weakly acyclic games. The convergence and stochastic stability of better response dynamics in the DUE games are then proved based on the theory of weakly acyclic games. Finally, we observe the properties of the convergence and stability from numerical experiments. The results show that the strict improvement of users’ travel times by the applied evolutionary dynamics is important for ensuring the existence of a stochastically stable equilibrium in DUE games.",0191-2615,Not found
Stabilizing mixed vehicular platoons with connected automated vehicles: An H-infinity approach,10.1016/j.trb.2019.06.005,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper presents a car-following control strategy of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to stabilize a mixed vehicular platoon consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles. This study first establishes a string stability criterion for a mixed vehicular platoon. Specifically, a mixed vehicular platoon is decomposed into “subsystems” that are all possible sequential subsets of the platoon. String stability is then defined as the “head-to-tail” string stability for all subsystems: the magnitude of a disturbance is not amplified from the first vehicle to the last vehicle of each subsystem. Based on this definition, distributed frequency-domain-based CAV control is proposed to increase the number of head-to-tail string stable subsystems and consequently dampen stop-and-go disturbances drastically. Specifically, an H-infinity control problem is formulated, where the maximum disturbance “damping ratios” in each subsystem is minimized within the predominant acceleration frequency boundaries of human-driven vehicles. Simulation experiments, embedded with real human-driven vehicle trajectories, were conducted, and results show that the proposed control can effectively dampen stop-and-go disturbances.",0191-2615,Not found
Ride-Sourcing modeling and pricing in non-equilibrium two-sided markets,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.019,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Ride-sourcing is a prominent transportation mode because of its cost-effectiveness and convenience. It provides an on-demand mobility platform that acts as a two-sided market by matching riders with drivers. The conventional models of ride-sourcing systems are equilibrium-based, discrete, and suitable for strategic decisions. This steady-state approach is not suitable for operational decision-making where there is noticeable variation in the state of the system, denying the market enough time to balance back into equilibrium. We introduce a dynamic non-equilibrium ride-sourcing model that tracks the time-varying number of riders, vacant ride-sourcing vehicles, and occupied ride-sourcing vehicles. The drivers are modeled as earning-sensitive, independent contractor, and self-scheduling and the riders are considered price- and quality of service-sensitive such that the supply and demand of the ride-sourcing market are endogenously dependent on (i) the fare requested from the riders and the wage paid to the drivers and (ii) the rider’s waiting time and driver’s cruising time. The model enables investigating how the dynamic wage and fare set by the ride-sourcing service provider affect supply, demand, and states of the market such as average waiting and search time especially when drivers can freely choose their work shifts. Furthermore, we propose a controller based on the model predictive control approach to maximize the service provider’s profit by controlling the fare requested from riders and the wage offered to drivers to satisfy a certain quality of market performance. We assess three pricing strategies where the fare and wage are (i) time-varying and unconstrained, (ii) time-varying and constrained so that the fare is higher than the wage such that the instantaneous profit is positive, and (iii) time-invariant and fixed. The proposed model and controller enable the ride-sourcing service provider to offer a wage to the drivers that is higher than the fare requested from the riders. The result demonstrates that this myopic loss can potentially lead to higher overall profit when customer demand (i.e., riders who may opt to use the ride-sourcing system) increases while the supply of ride-sourcing vehicles decreases simultaneously.",0191-2615,Not found
Stabilisation strategy for unstable transport systems under general evolutionary dynamics,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.021,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Stability of equilibria in transport systems has been discussed for decades. Even in deterministic cases, where stochasticity is ignored, stability is not a general property; a counterexample has been found in (within-day) dynamic traffic assignment problems. Instability can be a source of uncertainty of travel time and although pricing may stabilise an unstable transport system, pricing is not always acceptable to the public. This study aims to develop a pricing strategy that stabilises a transport system with minimum tolls. We show that with our stabilising pricing system tolls are bounded above and converge to zero when the error in estimation of a no-toll equilibrium converges to zero. We then show that the proposed toll scheme stabilises a wide range of evolutionary dynamics. We also propose a heuristic procedure to minimise the toll level. The procedure can also be viewed as a method of finding a possibly unstable equilibrium solution of a transport system. This suggests that, while we have not provided a rigorous proof, we may be able to find an equilibrium solution of any transport problem including problems which arise in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA); in these DTA cases, how to construct a solution algorithm that always converges to an equilibrium solution is still an open question.

Customer behavioural modelling of order cancellation in coupled ride-sourcing and taxi markets,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.016,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In today's world, massive on-demand mobility requests are dispatched every hour on ride-sourcing platforms, however, customers later cancel quite a number of these confirmed orders. This paper makes the first attempt to look into this customer confirmed-order cancellation behaviour based on a two-month, hourly average dataset of Didi Express in Shanghai provided by Didi Chuxing. The mean ride distance and pick-up distance of cancelled orders are observed to be obviously longer than those of completed orders of the same time period, reflecting an obvious impact of travel cost on customer decisions of order cancellation. However, the correlation between the mean customer confirmed-order cancellation rate (COCR) and the mean customer waiting time for pick-up of cancelled orders is significantly negative. Shanghai, like many other cities around the world, has coupled ride-sourcing and taxi markets, and as such, this counter-intuitive phenomenon can be explained as an outcome of the lower (higher) chance of meeting vacant taxis while waiting for pick-up during peak (non-peak) hours. We formulate COCR as a function of customer waiting time for ride-sourcing vehicles and cruising taxis, the penalty strategy by the platform for cancellation of confirmed orders, and customers’ own characteristics (i.e., ride distance, value of time, perceived psychological cost of order cancellation, additional safety concern over ride-sourcing), and propose a system of nonlinear equations to depict the complex interactions between the ride-sourcing and taxi markets considering the probability of ride-sourcing cancellation after order confirmation. With the proposed model, we replicate the observed lower COCR under a higher demand rate and longer waiting time for pick-up through numerical examples, and highlight the potential improvement of platform profit that can be achieved by appropriately designed penalty/compensation strategies.",0191-2615,Not found
Incorporating trip chaining within online demand estimation,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.010,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Time-dependent Origin–Destination (OD) demand flows are fundamental inputs for Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) systems and real-time traffic management. This work introduces a novel state-space framework to estimate these demand flows in an online context. Specifically, we propose to explicitly include trip-chaining behavior within the state-space formulation, which is solved using the well-established Kalman Filtering technique. While existing works already consider structural information and recursive behavior within the online demand estimation problem, this information has been always considered at the OD level. In this study, we introduce this structural information by explicitly representing trip-chaining within the estimation framework. The advantage is twofold. First, all trips belonging to the same tour can be jointly calibrated. Second, given the estimation during a certain time interval, a prediction of the structural deviation over the whole day can be obtained without the need to run additional simulations. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated first on a toy network and then on a large real-world network. Results show that the model improves the prediction performance with respect to a conventional Kalman Filtering approach. We also show that, on the basis of the estimation of the morning commute, the model can be used to predict the evening commute without need of running additional simulations.",0191-2615,Not found
Operational design for shuttle systems with modular vehicles under oversaturated traffic: Continuous modeling method,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.018,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Time-varying capacity design holds an opportunity to reduce the energy consumption of urban mass transit systems, e.g., urban rail transits, bus rapid transits, modular autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate the joint design of dispatch headway and vehicle capacity for one to one shuttle systems with oversaturated traffic to achieve the optimal tradeoff between general vehicle dispatching cost (mainly comprised of vehicle energy consumption) and customer waiting cost. We propose a continuum approximation model from a macroscopic point of view to reveal fundamental analytical insights into the optimal design. By introducing the concept of a preferred virtual arrival demand curve at the origin station, we prove that the investigated problem with possibly oversaturated traffic can be equivalently solved with a simpler revised problem where only unsaturated traffic is present. With this property, we decompose the original problem into a set of independent unit-time revised unsaturated problems that can be analytically solved in each neighborhood across the operational horizon. With two sets of numerical experiments, we show that the CA model offers near-optimum solutions with negligible errors very efficiently and we also verify the theoretical properties. Also, the effectiveness of time-varying vehicle capacity design is demonstrated in shuttle systems under both saturated and unsaturated traffic. Overall, the proposed CA model contributes to the CA methodology literature by extending the CA method for traditional transit dispatching problems with unsaturated traffic to the joint design of dispatch headway and vehicle capacity considering oversaturated traffic, adjustable vehicle capacities and other factors (e.g. minimum dispatch headway).",0191-2615,Not found
"Route choice, travel time variability, and rational inattention",10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.020,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper sets up a rational inattention model for the route choice problem in a stochastic network where travelers face random travel time. Previous research has assumed that travelers incorporate all provided information without effort. This study assumes that information is costly and that travelers rationally choose how much information to acquire prior to choosing route. We begin with a single traveler and then extend the model to heterogeneous travelers where rationally inattentive user equilibrium (RIUE) is achieved. From the perspective of a single traveler, more information always reduces the impact of travel time variability and increases the probability of choosing a less costly route. However, in RIUE, more information may reduce the social welfare in some scenarios.",0191-2615,Not found
Day-to-day needs-based activity-travel dynamics and equilibria in multi-state supernetworks,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.017,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This study proposes a new framework for studying activity-travel dynamics in multi-state supernetworks based on a needs-based theory. The framework postulates that temporal fluctuations in human needs are the source of dynamically generated activities, which in turn are manifested in the choice of day-to-day activity-travel patterns (ATPs) and dynamics in day-to-day traffic. Specifically, the net utility of a daily ATP is determined jointly by the degree of satisfying particular needs and the traffic conditions when conducting the ATP. Needs are updated after completing the activities and so is the net utility of the ATP, which means that the net utility that is derived from conducting a particular ATP varies across time. Thus, the choice of a daily ATP is determined not only by the needs reflected in past ATP choices but also on current traffic conditions and usage of facilities. We formulate these dynamics in terms of an activity-travel adjustment process, through which the proposed needs-based activity-travel dynamic system converges to a steady state, coinciding with the Wardropian user equilibrium and the equivalent mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. This formalism integrates activity generation, activity-travel scheduling, and traffic flow evolution, and offers appealing explanations for day-to-day traffic dynamics and equilibria.",0191-2615,Not found
Modeling double time-scale travel time processes with application to assessing the resilience of transportation systems,10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.005,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper proposes a double time-scale model to capture the day-to-day evolution along with the within-day variability of travel time. The proposed model can be used to evaluate short-term to long-term effects of new transport policies and construction of critical infrastructures, and to analyze the resilience of road networks under disruptions. The within-day travel time variability is modeled using the functional data analysis, in which the effects of road traffic congestion and noise of traffic data are considered explicitly. The within-day process is then regarded as the local volatility (or the noise process) to drive the day-to-day process while the latter is described by a modified geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Then, the day-to-day travel time process is obtained by the statistics of the modified GBM. The model probabilistically captures the evolution of day-to-day and within-day travel time processes analytically. Moreover, an efficient method based on the cross-entropy method is developed for calibrating the model parameters. A lasso-like regularization is employed to guarantee a small bias between the model estimations and the measurement counterparts. Finally, two empirical studies are carried out to validate the proposed model at different scales with different traffic scenarios, i.e., a case study on the Guangzhou Airport Expressway (link to path scale) under traffic accident conditions and a case study in New York City (city-scale) to analyze the network resilience under Hurricane Sandy. Both case studies adopted probe vehicle data but with different configurations (fine versus coarse, small versus big data). The empirical studies confirm that the proposed model can accommodate the inherent variability in traffic conditions and data meanwhile being computationally tractable. The numerical results illustrate the applicability of the proposed model as a powerful tool in practice for analyzing the short-term and long-term impacts of disruptions and systematic changes in the performance of road networks.",0191-2615,Not found
Modeling and managing congested transit service with heterogeneous users under monopoly,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.012,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"We develop and study a model of congested transit service under monopoly when potential users differ in their characteristics. Given travel time delays and crowding externalities, general user heterogeneity is characterized in a three-dimensional space of value of time, value of crowding, and willingness to pay. A unique user demand equilibrium is shown to exist. The operator chooses the fare and service frequency to maximize a weighted sum of profit and consumers’ surplus. The socially optimal fare consists of marginal operating cost, external user congestion cost, and a nonnegative shadow price on the vehicle capacity constraint which may or may not bind. A cost-recovery formula is also derived. Two methods for optimal design capacity are proposed that differ as to whether fare and frequency are exogenous or set conditional on capacity choice.

A continuum model for cities based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram: A semi-Lagrangian solution method,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.011,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper presents a formulation of the reactive dynamic user equilibrium problem in continuum form using a network-level Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). Compared to existing continuum models for cities – all based in Hughes’ pedestrian model in 2002 – the proposed formulation (i) is consistent with reservoir-type models of the MFD literature, shedding some light into the connection between these two modeling approaches, (ii) can have destinations continuously distributed on the region, and (iii) can incorporate multi-commodity flows without additional numerical error. The proposed multi-reservoir numerical solution method treats the multi-commodity component of the model in Lagrangian coordinates, which is the natural representation to propagate origin-destination information (and any vehicle-specific characteristic) through the traffic stream. Fluxes between reservoir boundaries are computed in the Eulerian representation, and are used to calculate the speed of vehicles crossing the boundary. Simple examples are included that show the convergence of the model and its agreements with the available analytical solutions. We find that (i) when origins and destinations are uniformly distributed in a region, the distribution of the travel times can be approximated analytically, (ii) the magnitude of the detours from the optimal free-flow route due to congestion increase linearly with the inflow and decreases with the square of the speed, and (iii) the total delay of vehicles in the network converges to the analytical approximation when the size of reservoirs tends to zero.",0191-2615,Not found
A hierarchical approach for splitting truck platoons near network discontinuities,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.006,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Truck platooning has attracted substantial attention due to its pronounced benefits in saving energy and promising business model in freight transportation. However, one prominent challenge for the successful implementation of truck platooning is the safe and efficient interaction with surrounding traffic, especially at network discontinuities where mandatory lane changes may lead to the decoupling of truck platoons. This contribution puts forward an efficient method for splitting a platoon of vehicles near network merges. A model-based bi-level control strategy is proposed. A supervisory tactical strategy based on a first-order car-following model with bounded acceleration is designed to maximize the flow at merge discontinuities. The decisions taken at this level include optimal vehicle order after the merge, new equilibrium gaps of automated trucks at the merging point, and anticipation horizon that the platoon members start to track the new equilibrium gaps. The lower-level operational layer uses a third-order longitudinal dynamics model to compute the optimal truck accelerations so that new equilibrium gaps are created when merging vehicles start to change lane and the transient maneuvers are efficient, safe and comfortable. The tactical decisions are derived from an analytic car-following model and the operational accelerations are controlled via model predictive control with guaranteed stability. Simulation experiments are provided in order to test the feasibility and demonstrate the performance and robustness of the proposed strategy.",0191-2615,https://github.com/licit-lab/hierarchical-split-platooning
Paired-line hybrid transit design considering spatial heterogeneity,10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.007,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This study attempts to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into the optimal design of paired-line hybrid transit systems, which aims to strike a better balance between accessibility and efficiency by leveraging the flexibility of a demand adaptive service. A simple trip production and distribution model is introduced to differentiate the central business district (CBD) of a city from its periphery. To cope with the heterogeneous demand pattern, the transit system is also configured differently inside and outside the CBD, for both its fixed route and demand adaptive services. Allowing the supply heterogeneity complicates transit users’ route choice modeling considerably. As a result, user costs must be estimated separately for six subregions that constitute the feasible set of the fixed route headway. Each subregion corresponds to a unique route choice behavior, hence leading to a distinctive design model that is formulated as a mixed integer program and solved by a commercial solver. Results of numerical experiments show that concentrating demand in the CBD significantly reduces the average system cost, and this benefit increases as the average demand density becomes larger. Also, recognizing demand heterogeneity and responding to it with a tailored design can be highly beneficial. However, this benefit diminishes as the average demand density increases.",0191-2615,Not found
Resilient perimeter control of macroscopic fundamental diagram networks under cyberattacks,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.020,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The perimeter control concept based on macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) modeling is now well-established in various literature. Recent research efforts are devoted to develop perimeter control schemes, which can be eventually applied to urban traffic control systems. Modern urban traffic control systems increasingly rely on information technology infrastructure, combining various network and physical facilities and use of communication technologies, which increases the vulnerability for cyberattacks. As witnessed in recent real-life events, modern urban traffic control systems are vulnerable and not protected from internal and external, malicious and accidental threats. Hence, applicable perimeter control algorithms should be robust not only against dynamic uncertainties, but in addition, it should be resilient against cyberattack issues for real future implementations. In this paper, a resilient perimeter control scheme is developed for a modified multi-region MFD system model. The developed perimeter control is a fully decentralized scheme, which operates based on online local regional information only. It achieves an a priori desired tracking performance with simultaneous compensation of (i) cyberattacks in the channels of control signals transmission, (ii) model parameter uncertainties, (iii) unknown but bounded disturbances, and (iv) control input constraints. A framework of adaptive control techniques is utilized to design the perimeter control. The proposed fault-tolerant perimeter control does not require on-line fault detection, as the fault effects caused by cyberattacks are continuously and adaptively compensated by the developed algorithm. Stability proof of the closed-loop system in terms of the tracking and parameter errors are introduced, and simulation results for three aggregate urban traffic regions are presented.",0191-2615,Not found
An entropy maximizing approach to the ferry network design problem,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.006,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper proposes a novel method to address the ferry network design problem (FNDP). Ferry transport is an increasingly important component of public transport, providing mobility for people in large cities with harbours or rivers. It is therefore important that ferry networks are well designed. The connections between ferry stations and the locations of hubs that are optimal for passengers are revealed by the maximum passenger utility spanning tree connecting all ferry stations. This paper harnesses the equivalence between entropy maximisation and utility maximisation to find the maximum passenger utility spanning tree which connects all ferry stations. A small example with five ferry stations illustrates how the spanning tree topology responds to the pattern of passenger demand. Two heuristics for solving the problem are compared for the Sydney Harbour ferry network with 36 ferry stations. One heuristic reveals the most important connections between ferry stations from a passenger perspective. The use of maximum passenger utility spanning trees for ferry network design is discussed.",0191-2615,Not found
On the supply curve of ride-hailing systems,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.011,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper studies the supply curve of ride-hailing systems under different market conditions. The curve defines a relationship between the throughput of trips of the system and the cost of riders it serves. We first focus on isotropic markets by revisiting a matching failure identified recently that matches a requesting rider with an idle driver very far away. The failure will cause the supply curve of an e-hailing market to be backward bending, but it is proved that the backward bend does not arise in the street-hailing market. By constructing a double-ended queuing model, we prove that the supply curve of an e-hailing system with finite matching radius is always backward bending, but a smaller matching radius leads to a weaker bend. We further reveal the possibility of completely avoiding the bend by adaptively adjusting the matching radius. We then turn to the anisotropic markets and identify another type of matching failure due to indiscriminate matching between drivers and riders, which again causes a backward bending supply. Given the prevalence of such a matching failure in real-world operations, we discuss how to avoid it using price or rationing discrimination. A conceptualized two-node network is constructed to facilitate the discussion.",0191-2615,Not found
Static traffic assignment with residual queues and spillback,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.010,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In this paper we propose a novel static traffic assignment model where the network loading component accounts for non-stationary residual queues as well as spillback effects by explicitly adding capacity and storage constraints. This is achieved by deriving a static version of the dynamic general link transmission model that describes average link inflow and outflow rates during a given time period under simplified temporal assumptions. The resulting model adopts the same concave fundamental diagram and first order node model used in state-of-the-art macroscopic dynamic network loading without the need to explicitly describe time. We show that our mathematical problem formulation is an extension of several other models described in the literature, including the traditional capacity restrained static modelling paradigm. The equilibrium problem is formulated as a variational inequality problem while the network loading problem can be formulated as a fixed point problem. We prove that a solution exists to each problem as long as all traffic is loaded onto the network (i.e., no queue spillback into an origin). The model is illustrated via numerical examples on several hypothetical transport networks.",0191-2615,Not found
Demand management with limited cooperation among travellers: A doubly dynamic approach,10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.012,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper proposes a demand management method that optimizes the network performance by manipulating departure times within limited cooperation settings. The framework builds on the restricted flexibility of travellers’ departure times and exposes the impact of minimal changes in travellers’ schedule on the overall network performance. The test-bed (the plant) is based on the trip-based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) that relates the network space-mean speed to the vehicle accumulation. Travellers in the trip-based MFD model are characterized by their specific desired arrival times, heterogeneous trip lengths, and earliness and lateness scheduling penalties. The optimization problem, on the other hand, is formulated based on the accumulation-based MFD model that relates the network production (i.e. length-weighted aggregated link flows) to the vehicle accumulation. The accumulation-based MFD is an aggregated parsimonious model and does not consider individual traveller attributes, which enables it to remain analytically tractable and makes it suitable for optimization purposes. The proposed demand management method is also incorporated into a day-to-day evolution model where travellers adapt based on their historical departure times, experienced travel costs, and individual characteristics. The results highlight that the accumulation-based MFD can be efficiently used to develop travel demand management methods with realistic representation of traffic congestion within and across days.",0191-2615,Not found
Effect of transit signal priority on bus service reliability,10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.016,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"As every user knows buses tend to bunch. To alleviate this problem, transit agencies introduce slack into their schedules and then hold buses back to schedule at pre-established control points along their routes. Unfortunately, this practice retards buses and only works with low frequency systems; i.e., when the headways are long. For higher frequency systems, which effectively operate without a schedule, headway-based control strategies show promise but unfortunately, they also retard buses. To alleviate bus retardation in all its forms, transit signal priority (TSP) is commonly used. Curiously however, the potential of TSP to enhance bus control practices has not been explored in detail. This paper evaluates a form of TSP designed for this purpose. In this version of TSP, which we call conditional signal priority (CSP), buses send priority requests only when the requests improve reliability. The evaluation includes both scheduled (low frequency) systems, and unscheduled (high frequency) systems operated by headways. A mathematical model based on Brownian motion is proposed for the former. This model allows us to optimize the CSP strategy and to develop formulas for the expectation and variance of the steady state deviations from the schedule–with CSP, with conventional TSP and with neither. Simulations confirm the accuracy of these findings. It is found that CSP improves reliability considerably and that it is better for traffic than TSP because it reduces the number of priority requests. For high frequency systems operated with a fixed number of buses CSP is shown to not just improve reliability and reduce the number of priority requests of TSP (by about 50%) but also to reduce the average headway by speeding up the buses.",0191-2615,Not found

An algorithm based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP), with customized subroutines for solving the MPEC, is developed to solve the overall problem.

The current work provides a detailed discussion of extended MFD-based models namely, accumulation-based and trip-based models that accounts for bi-modal flows through 3D-MFD. In addition, delay accumulation-based models, also known as exit-flow models in classical traffic flow theory, are revisited. Fundamental modeling differences between different MFD-based models are illustrated using a benchmark test case. A new FIFO-based entry flow function is also proposed in order to address the inconsistencies of the conventional entry flow function in the context of the 3D-MFD case. A novel weak internal FIFO discipline is proposed to circumnavigate the violation of internal FIFO order during network unloading in the delay accumulation-based model. MFD-based models are verified using the solutions of micro-simulations performed on an idealized grid network. The importance of separating the 3D-MFD into partial car and bus 3D-MFDs is highlighted.

Pricing with risk sensitive competing container shipping lines: Will risk seeking do more good than harm?,10.1016/j.trb.2020.01.003,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Container-shipping-lines (CSLs) operate in a highly competitive market with high demand volatility. Unlike many other industries in which risk-averse attitude is dominating, it is well known that many CSLs exhibit risk-seeking behaviors. In this paper, by using the mean-risk formulation, we analytically study the effects of risk attitude and demand volatility on the service pricing game between two CSLs. We find that the equilibrium prices increase when CSLs can accept more risk, and being slightly risk-seeking can help maximize the expected profits of both CSLs. We discover the risk-attitude convergence effect, which theoretically reveals that the “optimal risk attitudes” for the CSLs move in the same direction. Therefore, our research suggests that both CSLs should hire slightly risk-seeking managers in a competitive shipping market. In addition, we explore the impacts brought by demand volatility and find that the equilibrium prices increase (decrease) in the demand volatility when CSLs are risk-seeking (risk-averse). We uncover that when an individual CSL's risk sensitivity level is small and its rival is risk-seeking, its own expected profit under the decentralized case could be larger than that in centralized case. Finally, for robustness checking of our research findings, we investigate the scenarios with multiplicative randomness of demand, asymmetric information on risk attitude and multiple (more than two) competing CSLs, and find that our main findings still hold. Counterintuitively, in the case with multiplicatively random demand, we analytically find that CSLs may not prefer a large market potential when they are risk-averse.",0191-2615,Not found

Truck platooning is an emerging and promising container transportation mode in which a platoon is formed by a leading truck followed by a set of trucks using semi-automated technologies. This paper focuses on the truck platooning operation mode (TPOM) in which only the leading truck is human-driven. We also focus on attempts to exploit the advantages of the new operation mode, such as the ability to use multiple trucks simultaneously with only one driver. Moreover, one customer can be serviced by two different drivers through coordination, and one container can be shared among customers without returning to the depot. All of these advantages improve the LCDP operational performance. A mathematical model is proposed to capture these advantages and related features pertaining to this new operation mode. The model is compared, theoretically and numerically, with three well-studied LCDP models reported in the literature, and we prove that our model is a generalization of the previous three models. For even small-scale problems, CPLEX has difficulty achieving satisfactory solutions due to the NP-hardness and complicated structure of the problem. Therefore, a heuristic method that incorporates the learning mechanism based on the ant colony algorithm is proposed to overcome the problem.

We prove that both auction mechanisms ensure incentive compatibility, individual rationality, balanced budget, and asymptotical efficiency. Furthermore, compared with traditional truthful double-auctions, the TR-QD mechanism supports cooperative purchases—which allows more customers to enjoy discounts on large-scale logistics services—and bid time priority—which achieves the goal of meeting earlier requests earlier and improves auction efficiency.

An optimisation framework for airline fleet maintenance scheduling with tail assignment considerations,10.1016/j.trb.2019.12.008,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Fierce competition between airlines has led to the need of minimising the operating costs while also ensuring quality of service.

In this research, we propose a framework to develop commercially viable and maintenance feasible flight and maintenance schedules. Such framework involves two multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MMILP) formulations and an iterative algorithm. The first formulation, the airline fleet maintenance scheduling (AMS) with violations, minimises the number of maintenance regulation violations and the number of not airworthy aircraft; subject to limited workshop resources and current maintenance regulations on individual aircraft flying hours. The second formulation, the AMS with tail assignment (TA) allows aircraft to be assigned to different flights. In this case, subject to similar constraints as the first formulation, six lexicographically ordered objective functions are minimised. Namely, the number of violations, maximum resource level, number of tail reassignments, number of maintenance interventions, overall resource usage, and the amount of maintenance required by each aircraft at the end of the planning horizon. The iterative algorithm ensures fast computational times while providing good quality solutions. Additionally, by tracking aircraft and using precise flying hours between maintenance opportunities, we ensure that the aircraft are airworthy at all times. Computational tests on real flight schedules over a 30-day planning horizon show that even with multiple airlines and workshops (16000 flights, 529 aircraft, 8 maintenance workshops), our solution approach can construct near-optimal maintenance schedules within minutes.",0191-2615,Not found

This study makes a strong case to substitute these thin-tailed distributions with a t-distribution. First, we demonstrate that a model with a t-distributed error kernel better estimates and predicts preferences, especially in class-imbalanced datasets. Our proposed specification also implicitly accounts for decision-uncertainty behavior, i.e. the degree of certainty that decision-makers hold in their choices relative to the variation in the indirect utility of any alternative. Second – after applying a t-distributed error kernel in a multinomial response model for the first time – we extend this specification to a generalized continuous-multinomial (GCM) model and derive its full-information maximum likelihood estimation procedure. The likelihood involves an open-form expression of the cumulative density function of the multivariate t-distribution, which we propose to compute using a combination of the composite marginal likelihood method and the separation-of-variables approach.

Based on energy-regenerative technologies and smart-card data, this study formulates an optimization model incorporating energy allocation and passenger assignment to balance energy use and passenger travel time. The Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is applied and the core components are redesigned to obtain an efficient Pareto frontier of irregular timetables for maximizing the use of regenerative energy and minimizing total travel time. Particularly, a parallelogram-based method is developed to generate random feasible timetables; crossover and local-search-driven mutation operators are proposed relying on the graphic representations of the domain knowledge. The suggested approach is illustrated using real-world data of a bi-directional metro line in Beijing. The results show that the approach significantly improves regenerative energy use and reduces total travel time compared to the fixed regular timetable.",0191-2615,Not found
Benders decomposition for multiple-allocation hub-and-spoke network design with economies of scale and node congestion,10.1016/j.trb.2019.12.003,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"This paper is the first to consider a novel and more realistic variant of the uncapacitated hub location problem where both flow-dependent economies of scale and congestion considerations are incorporated into the multiple-allocation version of the problem. Given an undirected graph with edge per-unit costs and flow requirements for a given set of source-destination pairs of nodes, the goal is to decide where to locate hub nodes and then to route flow through these hubs in a way that minimizes total cost. Transportation costs are influenced by two conflicting effects: consolidation discounts on hub-to-hub flow due to economies of scale, and congestion penalties due to excessive demand through hubs. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program by piecewise-linearizing non-linear cost elements. Since the resulting model is found to be difficult to solve directly using commercial solvers, a specialized Benders decomposition approach is devised to solve the problem. The proposed method is tested on two standard testbeds (the Civil Aeronautics Board and Australian Post datasets). While the commercial solver is unable to obtain any feasible solution for networks larger than 25 nodes, the proposed algorithm is shown to be able to obtain optimal solutions for networks as large as 70 nodes, and is able to obtain small-gap feasible solutions for networks with up to 100 nodes. Whenever both algorithms are able to solve instances to optimality, the Benders algorithm is able to do so in a fraction of the time needed by the commercial solver. The incorporation of congestion costs into the multiple-allocation topology as opposed to the single-allocation one is also found to lead to significant cost savings.",0191-2615,Not found
Coupling time-indexed and big-M formulations for real-time train scheduling during metro service disruptions,10.1016/j.trb.2019.12.005,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Track disruptions in metro systems may lead to severe train delays with many passengers stranded at platforms, unable to board on overloaded trains. Dispatchers may put in place different recovery actions, such as alternating train directions and allowing short turns. The objective is to alleviate the inconvenience for passengers and to regain the nominal train regularity. To characterize this process, this paper develops nonlinear mixed integer programming (NMIP) models with two different recovery strategies to reschedule trains during the disruption. For solving models in real time, the hybrid formulation, which couples big-M and time-indexed formulations, is proposed to linearize the proposed model as the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Then, a two-stage approach is designed for handling the real-time detected information (like dynamic arriving passengers and end time of the disruption), including offline task (to select the best recovery strategy) and online task (to implement the best strategy and update timetable). Finally, the numerical experiments from Beijing metro Line 2 are implemented to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid formulation and two-stage approach.",0191-2615,Not found
Investigating high-speed rail construction's support to county level regional development in China: An eigenvector based spatial filtering panel data analysis,10.1016/j.trb.2019.12.006,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"The construction of high-speed rail in China was initially a direct response to the increasing demand of up-to-date infrastructure. It is commonly understood that the construction of HSR has significant wider economic impact on local development. The benefits of HSR are represented by the accessibility to the HSR stations. Our study defines accessibility to HSR with a simple distance measure and a transportation network measure that considers travel from the center of the county through different grades of roads to the nearest HSR stations. For better understanding, we estimate both global and local (i.e., location-specific) impacts from HSR, using per capital GDP as a representation of the wider economic impact. With access to a panel dataset from 2008 to 2015 of regional socioeconomic indicators at the county-level units in China, the current study employs an eigenvector based spatial filtering (ESF) approach with and without spatially varying coefficients in an attempt to establish potential global and local relationships between HSR accessibility and county-level regional development. The analysis result suggests that it is likely that HSR accessibility might significantly contribute to regional development. A 10% decrease of the travel time to the nearest HSR station could bring about 0.44% (locally ranging from 0.28% to 3.1%) increase in local GDP per capita at the county level, ceteris paribus. The panel analysis suggests that the continued development of HSR construction in China will have long-term and sustainable support to local economic development.

Variable neighborhood search and tabu search for auction-based waste collection synchronization,10.1016/j.trb.2019.12.004,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"We study a less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation service procurement (TSP) in the waste collection industry, where shippers make small-volume requests and a single carrier optimizes the collection routes to realize maximum profitability. In our proposed auction-based waste collection synchronization (A-WCS) mechanism, the carrier plays a role as the auctioneer to decide on who wins the bids and the corresponding payments while the shippers act as the bidders. This is attributed to the carrier-centric structure where a carrier has to consolidate multiple LTL shipping requests so as to provide cost-effective services. Furthermore, a single shipper (e.g., a construction site) may generate multiple types of waste and highly desires for a synchronous service, requiring multiple vehicles dedicated for different waste types to arrive almost simultaneously. The synchronization is beneficial to prevent repeated handling and reduce disruption caused to the minimum. The synchronization requirements are innovatively factored by incorporating time windows into each customer bid. The A-WCS mechanism can encourage truthful bidding from shippers and obtain fair payments for both sides, therefore can benefit the market in the long run. A-WCS problems are extremely difficult to solve due to the integration of two combinatorial problems. We address the A-WCS with a two-layered algorithm, where the variable neighborhood search (VNS) is purposed to search auction allocations in the upper layer and tabu search (TS) is conducted to generate efficient vehicle routes in the lower layer. The capability of our algorithm is demonstrated by an extensive computational study, comparing with a number of state-of-the-art exact and heuristic approaches. Finally, a number of managerial implications for the practitioners are obtained, with insights into the impacts caused by changes in market size, task complexity, customer distribution pattern, and auction frequency.",0191-2615,Not found
A mixed integer programming formulation and scalable solution algorithms for traffic control coordination across multiple intersections based on vehicle space-time trajectories,10.1016/j.trb.2020.01.006,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Thanks to the development of mobile computing, novel traffic data sources are emerging as the promising building blocks for more effective traffic control strategies. It is expected that the vehicle space-time trajectories will become ubiquitously available in foreseeable future. Real-time trajectory data will provide full-spectrum pattern of traffic dynamics among multiple intersections. In this paper, we present a new traffic control representation for multiple intersections. A new multi-intersection phase (MI-phase) is proposed to represent safe vehicle movements across a few tightly connected intersections. All the intersections are also viewed as one integral “super intersection” within which vehicles move according to their planned paths. Through scheduling the sequence and durations of MI-phases over time, the vehicles will be crossing intersections with minimal delays. This approach can provide more flexibilities for traffic control coordination than the traditional Cycle-Split-Offset approach. A linear integer programming formulation is presented for joint optimization of vehicle space-time trajectories and traffic control. We also design a scalable optimization frame for real-world traffic control optimization, referred to as “Lagrangian decomposition with subproblem approximation” approaches. In this new framework, we construct the dynamic network loading based lower bound estimator (DNL-LBE) in which the relaxed constraints and sensitivity to the Lagrangian multiplier prices are explicitly considered while vehicular flows are being loaded. By doing so, the complex controlled dynamic network loading process can be represented through Lagrangian multipliers interfacing with the MI-phase optimization module (then solved by Dynamic Programming). This approach can facilitate price-based search heuristics to find high quality solutions for both vehicular space-time trajectories and traffic control plans without increasing the overall computing complexity. The efficiency of the proposed optimization framework is further improved through multiple advanced computing techniques. In the end, one demonstrative and one real-world example are provided to show the performance of the new approach.",0191-2615,Not found
Scheduling preferences and the value of travel time information,10.1016/j.trb.2020.02.010,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"In this paper, we derive the value of a signal obtained by a traveller prior to the choice of departure time. The signal does not have to be a perfect prediction of the travel time. It is sufficient that it carries information about the travel time. The traveller may then consider the distribution of travel time conditional on the signal to increase her expected utility by making a better informed choice of departure time. We show that a signal always increases the expected utility compared to the situation without any signal. For a broad class of signals, the expected utility is monotone with respect to signal strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even perfect travel time information does not necessarily eliminate the cost of travel time variability and we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for when it does. We find that the predictable part of travel time variability may or may not be costly, depending on the shape of the traveller's scheduling utility at the origin of the trip. Using estimates of scheduling preferences from the literature, we show that the cost of predictable travel time variability may constitute a substantial part of the total cost of travel time variability. In a particular case of scheduling preferences, travel time distribution and noise distribution, we establish an analytic relationship between the strength of the signal and the expected utility of the trip and evaluate the marginal cost of signal weakness. This knowledge may facilitate design and cost-benefit analysis of traveller information systems and policies decreasing travel time variability.",0191-2615,Not found
A framework for collaborative air traffic flow management minimizing costs for airspace users: Enabling trajectory options and flexible pre-tactical delay management,10.1016/j.trb.2020.02.012,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper proposes a collaborative air traffic flow management (ATFM) framework, in the scope of trajectory based operations, aiming to improve the cost-efficiency for airspace users (AUs) when facing ATFM regulations. The framework consists of four modules. The first one involves the AUs initially scheduling their preferred trajectories for all their flights. Based on this initial demand, the second module (assumed to be on the Network Manager -NM- side) detects time-varying hotspots (i.e. overloaded sectors along the day). In the third module, hotspot information is shared back to the AUs who plan alternative trajectory options to avoid crossing these congested airspace volumes (in the lateral and vertical domain); as well as providing to the NM different pre-tactical delay management preferences (including ground holding, linear holding, air holding and pre-tactical delay recovery); based on their internal cost breakdown structures. Incorporating all these potential combined options, the last module computes the best trajectory selections and the optimal distribution of delay assignments, such that the cost deviation from the initial status (all the user-preferred trajectories) is minimized. This model is formulated as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and validated by a real-world case study focused on 24 h of traffic over the French airspace. Results using the proposed framework suggest a significant system delay reduction by nearly 97% over the existing method, whilst yielding an average of less than 100 kg extra fuel consumption and 50 Euro extra route charges for the 11% flights diverted to their alternative trajectories.",0191-2615,Not found
Managing bottleneck congestion with incentives,10.1016/j.trb.2020.01.010,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Incentive-Based Traffic Demand Management (IBTDM) is a strategy that adopts incentives to demotivate driving trips, or to redistribute demand across space and time. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of an IBTDM strategy that provides incentives to shift the commuting public's departure times so that the queueing delay is reduced. Based on Vickrey's bottleneck model, this paper considers the impact of incentive budget and market penetration rate on the optimal incentive profile for both homogeneous and heterogeneous commuters. The resulting departure pattern created by the optimal incentive profile achieves Pareto Optimality. The results indicate that an optimal incentive profile is “U-shape” during the morning peak with a limited budget. Additionally, we find that the marginal benefit of incentive is diminishing. Lastly, although Pareto improvement is achieved, commuters with higher values of time are found to benefit more under the optimal incentive design. It is also discovered that the incentive provider should promote IBTDM to the two ends of the income level of the commuters to achieve the lowest total system travel time under an insufficient marketing budget.",0191-2615,Not found
Statistical inference for two-regime stochastic car-following models,10.1016/j.trb.2020.02.003,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper presents the formulation of a family of two-regime car-following models where both free-flow and congestion regimes obey statistically independent random processes. This formulation generalizes previous efforts based on Brownian and geometric Brownian acceleration processes, each reproducing a different feature of traffic instabilities. The probability density of vehicle positions turns out to be analytical in our model, and therefore parameters can be estimated using maximum likelihood. This allows us to test a wide variety of hypotheses using statistical inference methods, such as the homogeneity of the driver/vehicle population and the statistical significance of the impacts of roadway geometry. Using data from two car-following experiments, we find that (i) model parameters are similar across repeated experiments within the same dataset but different across datasets, (ii) the acceleration error process is closer to a Brownian motion, and (iii) drivers press the gas pedal harder than usual when they come to an upgrade segment. Additionally, we explain the cause of traffic oscillations traveling downstream, which were observed both in the field data and in our simulations. The model is flexible so that newer vehicle technologies can be incorporated to test such hypotheses as differences in the car-following parameters of automated and regular vehicles, when data becomes available.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated reward scheme and surge pricing in a ridesourcing market,10.1016/j.trb.2020.01.008,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Surge pricing is commonly used in on-demand ridesourcing platforms to dynamically balance demand and supply, although it is controversial and has long stimulated debate regarding its pros and cons. In practice, there is usually a reasonable or legitimate range of prices. However, such a constrained surge-pricing strategy may fail to balance demand and supply in certain cases—e.g., even adopting the highest allowed price cannot reduce peak-period demand to a level at which the market clears without some form of non-price rationing. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reward scheme integrated with surge pricing: Passengers pay an additional amount to a reward account on top of the regular surge price during peak hours, then use the balance in their reward account to subsidize trips during off-peak hours. We propose models to describe the number of travel requests and the number of active drivers on the platform, and characterize the market equilibrium under several assumptions. We compare scenarios with and without the reward scheme from three perspectives: passenger utility, driver income, and platform revenue and profit. We find that in some situations, all three stakeholders—i.e., passengers, drivers, and the platform—will be better off under the reward scheme integrated with surge pricing.",0191-2615,Not found

Recent empirical work has shown that there is an important distinction between short-run departure time choice versus long-run routine formation of commuters, also characterized by differences in values of time and schedule delays for the short-run versus the long-run problem. This paper investigates whether this affects optimal pricing of congested roads. Using a dynamic model of congestion, and integrating it with a dynamic model of routine formation, it is found that contrary to expectation, short-run optimal congestion pricing alone cannot optimally decentralize the optimal formation of long-run routines. A separate instrument is therefore needed to optimize routine formation.",0191-2615,Not found

In practice, many parameters of this optimization problem are not known with certainty, in particular the fundamental diagram and predictions of future traffic demand. This uncertainty poses a challenge for control approaches that pursue a model- and optimization-based strategy. In this work, we propose a robust counterpart to the FNC problem, where we introduce uncertainty sets for both the fundamental diagram and future, external traffic demands and seek to optimize the system operation, minimizing the worst-case cost. For a network with controlled merging junctions, and assuming that certain technical conditions on the uncertainty sets are satisfied, we show that the robust counterpart of the FNC problem can be reduced to a convex, finite-dimensional and deterministic optimization problem, whose numerical solution is tractable.",0191-2615,Not found
A household optimum utility approach for modeling joint activity-travel choices in congested road networks,10.1016/j.trb.2020.02.007,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This study proposes a new household optimum (HO) utility approach to model the intra-household interactions between household members by heterogeneous household type with different size in deciding their daily joint/solo activities and travel in congested road networks.

Based on the HO utility approach, a new household activity-based network equilibrium model is proposed to simultaneously take into account the time-dependent household daily activity-travel scheduling and traffic assignment problems within a unified modeling framework. Two new household-oriented network equilibrium principles, namely, HO and household-based system optimum (HSO), are introduced together with the formulations of their equivalent mathematical programming problems. The analytical relationships between HO, HSO, conventional user equilibrium and individual-based system optimum, and their properties are then investigated.

Path-based system optimal dynamic traffic assignment: A subgradient approach,10.1016/j.trb.2020.02.004,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problem aims at solving for the time-dependent link and path flow of a network that yields the minimal total system cost, provided with the Origin-Destination (O-D) demand. The key to solving the path-based formulation of SO-DTA is to efficiently compute the path marginal cost (PMC). Existing studies implicitly assume that the total system cost (TC) is always differentiable with respect to the path flow when computing PMC. We show that the TC could be non-differentiable with respect to the link/path flow in some cases, especially when the flow is close or under the SO conditions. Overlooking this fact can lead to convergence failure or incorrect solutions while numerically solving the SO-DTA problem. In this paper we demonstrate when the TC would be indifferentiable and how to compute the subgradients, namely the lower and upper limit of path marginal costs. We examine the relations between the discontinuity of PMC and the SO conditions, develop PMC-based necessary conditions for SO solutions, and finally design heuristic solution algorithms for solving SO in general networks with multi-origin-multi-destination OD demands. Those algorithms are tested and compared to existing algorithms in four numerical experiments, two toy networks where we compare analytical solutions with numerical solutions, one small network and one sizable real-world network.

Besides, investigation is conducted into three types of driver behaviors, namely, gain/loss neutrality, loss aversion, and gain seeking, and the reference effects are examined. An effective multi-stage Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (MS-VCG) auction mechanism is raised. Expect for the disturbance makers, the MS-VCG auction is capable to achieve allocative efficiency, incentive compatibility, and individual rationality.

Dynamic carpool in morning commute: Role of high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) and high-occupancy-toll (HOT) lanes,10.1016/j.trb.2020.03.002,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"This study analyzes carpool in morning commute, using a bottleneck model that allocates a fraction of the bottleneck capacity to a high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) or a high-occupancy-toll (HOT) lane. Commuters are homogeneous cost minimizers who participate carpool through a platform, either as solo driver, carpool driver or carpool rider. At user equilibrium (UE), no commuter can unilaterally lower her cost by switching to a different departure time, carpool role or road facility. Because a rider can use the in-vehicle time more productively than her driver, she enjoys a cost benefit that grows with the journey time. Therefore, the driver must be compensated more when travel delay due to congestion is longer. This requirement is fulfilled through a time-dependent carpool ratio that determines how much a driver is paid. We characterize and numerically obtain the UE solutions for this dynamic carpool problem. Results of numerical experiments show that the HOV lane promotes carpool and boosts welfare. The larger capacity the HOV lane is allocated, the greater benefit it offers to the system.

This provides a convenient closed-form solution for implementation in traffic network models. The path size terms measure distinctiveness of routes; a route is penalised based on the number of other routes sharing its links, and the costs of those shared links. Typically, real road networks have many very long routes that should be considered unrealistic. Such unrealistic routes are problematic for the Path Size Logit (PSL) model because they negatively impact the choice probabilities of realistic routes when links are shared. The Generalised Path Size Logit (GPSL) model attempts to address this problem by weighting the contributions of routes to path size terms according to the ratio of route travel costs. However, the GPSL model is not internally consistent in how it defines routes as being unrealistic: the path size terms consider only travel cost, whereas the route choice probability relation considers disutility including the correction term. To solve these challenges, this paper formulates a new internally consistent Adaptive Path Size Logit (APSL) model wherein routes contribute to path size terms according to the ratio of route choice probabilities, ensuring that routes defined as unrealistic by the path size terms, are exactly those with very low choice probabilities. The APSL route choice probability relation is an implicit function, naturally expressed as a fixed-point problem. A proof is provided for the guaranteed existence of solutions, as well as conditions for the uniqueness of solutions. A Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure is given for estimating the APSL model with tracked route observation data, and this procedure is investigated in a simulation study where it is shown it is generally possible to reproduce assumed true parameters. APSL is then estimated using real tracked route GPS data on a large-scale network, and results are compared with other PSL models..",0191-2615,Not found
Generalized bathtub model of network trip flows,10.1016/j.trb.2020.04.002,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Vickrey (1991, 2020) proposed a bathtub model for the evolution of trip flows served by privately operated vehicles inside a road network based on three premises: (i) treatment of the road network as a single bathtub; (ii) the speed-density relation at the network level, also known as the network fundamental diagram of vehicular traffic, and (iii) the time-independent negative exponential distribution of trip distances. However, the distributions of trip distances are generally time-dependent in the real world, and Vickrey’s model leads to unreasonable results for other types of trip distance distributions. Thus there is a need to develop a bathtub model with more general trip distance distribution patterns. In this study, we present a unified framework for modeling network trip flows with general distributions of trip distances, including negative exponential, constant, and regularly sorting trip distances studied in the literature. In addition to tracking the number of active trips as in Vickrey’s model, this model also tracks the evolution of the distribution of active trips’ remaining distances. We derive four equivalent differential formulations from the network fundamental diagram and the conservation law of trips for the number of active trips with remaining distances not smaller than any value. Then we define and discuss the properties of stationary and gridlock states, derive the integral form of the bathtub model with the characteristic method, and present two numerical methods to solve the bathtub model based on the differential and integral forms respectively. We further study equivalent formulations and solutions for two special types of distributions of trip distances: time-independent negative exponential or deterministic. In particular, we present six equivalent conditions for Vickrey’s bathtub model to be applicable.",0191-2615,Not found
Macroscopic fundamental diagram based perimeter control considering dynamic user equilibrium,10.1016/j.trb.2020.03.004,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) has been receiving increasing attention recently due to its potential to describe traffic dynamics and guide the design of traffic control schemes at the network level. Perimeter control and route guidance are two main MFD-based traffic control approaches. However, current MFD-based perimeter control seldom considers travelers’ route choice behavior, while MFD-based route guidance studies usually assume directly that travelers would follow the guidance and neglect the effects of traffic control. This paper aims to integrate the MFD-based perimeter control (i.e., the behavior of a system manager) and the dynamic user equilibrium based route choice behavior (i.e., the behavior of travelers) into one rigorous mathematical framework. Given a traffic network that has been divided into multiple homogeneous regions, we use MFD to describe the dynamics of each region, and use point queue model to capture the dynamics of queues formed at the boundaries. Besides, we model travelers' route choice behavior by the instantaneous dynamic user equilibrium (IDUE) principle, and design an efficient range perimeter control method from the system perspective. We model the interactions between the system manager and the travelers as a non-zero sum, non-cooperative differential game, where the system manager aims to improve the system performance while travelers try to minimize their own travel times. Meanwhile, they share the common constraints (i.e., MFD dynamics and point queue dynamics at boundaries). Mathematically, this leads to a differential complementarity system (DCS). We propose a time-stepping approach to discretize and solve the DCS model, based on which the solution existence and convergence are also established. Numerical results show that the proposed method can limit the vehicle accumulations within the efficient range of each region, which helps improve the network performance. Compared with the condition without perimeter control, the proposed control method can improve network-wide traffic performance up to 14.18%.",0191-2615,Not found

The aggregate benefit of pricing LA County road congestion increases 2.7 fold when the toll revenue is recycled to cut the income tax of the poorer LA County workers while maintaining region-wide tax revenue neutrality. Consumers get 66% of the aggregate benefit and landlords 41%, while importers suffer losses equal to 7% of the aggregate benefit. Gross regional product increases by 1.34%. The aggregate benefit changes negligibly when the toll revenue is recycled to cut sales taxes instead of the income tax, but gross product still rises by 0.6%. Under the sales tax cut, consumers, importers and landlords benefit more evenly than under the income tax cut, but with the property tax cut nearly all of the cut is capitalized into property values.",0191-2615,Not found
Passenger-centered vulnerability assessment of railway networks,10.1016/j.trb.2020.03.008,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"The performance and behaviour of critical infrastructure in case of disruptions is an important topic and we are still lacking of insights. Due to disruptions, infrastructure becomes unavailable and may force the trains and passengers to adapt. In this paper, we introduce a problem of railway network vulnerability from the perspective of passenger flows and train operations. We propose a new Railway Network Vulnerability Model (RNVM) to assess the vulnerability of the system by finding the critical combination of links, which cause the most adverse consequences to passengers and trains. To solve this challenging problem, we present a RNVM framework, which combines two heuristics based on column and row generation with mixed integer linear programming, to efficiently model alternative passenger flows and infrastructure constraints. The developed framework provides the critical combination of links, the corresponding passenger flows, train routes and timetables. We demonstrate the performance of the RNVM framework on the real-world instance of a part of the Dutch railway network. The results show that the RNVM framework can efficiently reassign passenger flows and reroute trains during disruptions. The results also reveal that the critical links are highly demand dependent rather than a static feature of the networks topology. Finally, the computation times remain small when increasing the number of disrupted links as well as the size of the passenger demand, which allows fast and efficient network vulnerability assessment.",0191-2615,Not found
Calibration and validation of multi-reservoir MFD models: A case study in Lyon,10.1016/j.trb.2020.03.006,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Aggregated traffic flow models based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), also known as multi-reservoir or multi-region MFD models, have been developed for more than a decade for various applications. While being very appealing for simulating traffic dynamics at a city level, the outputs of these models were rarely confronted with real data measurements. Thus, this paper focuses on calibration and validation of an MFD simulation for a city partitioned into multiple reservoirs. The traffic predictions from the MFD simulation (total accumulation and mean speed) are compared with real data from loop and probe sensors. The questions addressed in this study include the influence of the city partitioning, the MFD and average trip length estimation, and the path flow distribution among reservoirs. This study is carried on the network of Lyon, France, composed by around 27,000 links that extend over an urban area of 80 km2. Two different partitioning cases are defined and compared, with respectively 5 and 10 reservoirs. Our results notably show that the proper estimation of three elements is critical for accurate traffic state prediction: (i) the total “active” network length of each reservoir, (ii) the regional trip lengths in the reservoirs, and (iii) the path flow distribution at the regional network level. While the network equilibrium found in the 5-reservoir partitioning can be roughly approximated with Wardrop’s principle, the 10-reservoir case is more complex and requires to design ad-hoc optimization process to derive regional path flow distributions that fit the data. The global equilibrium found in this latter case turns out to be hardly predictable with any traffic equilibrium principle.",0191-2615,Not found
Robust optimization models for integrated train stop planning and timetabling with passenger demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2020.03.009,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"In this work, we consider the problem of scheduling a set of trains (i.e., determining their departure and arrival times at the visited stations) and simultaneously deciding their stopping patterns (i.e., determining at which stations the trains should stop) with constraints on passenger demand, given as the number of passengers that travel between an origin station and a destination station. In particular, we face the setting in which demand can be uncertain, and propose Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models to derive robust solutions in planning, i.e., several months before operations. These models are based on the technique of Light Robustness, in which uncertainty is handled by inserting a desired protection level, and solution efficiency is guaranteed by limiting the worsening of the nominal objective value (i.e., the objective value of the problem in which uncertainty is neglected). In our case, the protection is against a potential increased passenger demand, and the solution efficiency is obtained by limiting the train travel time and the number of train stops. The goal is to determine robust solutions in planning so as to reduce the passenger inconvenience that may occur in real-time due to additional passenger demand. The proposed models differ in the way of inserting the protection, and show different levels of detail on the required information about passenger demand. They are tested on real-life data of the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway line under different demand scenarios, and the obtained results are compared with those found by solving the nominal problem. The comparison shows that robust solutions can handle uncertain passenger demand in a considerably more effective way.",0191-2615,Not found

Optimal traffic control at smart intersections: Automated network fundamental diagram,10.1016/j.trb.2019.10.001,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence and wireless communication technologies have created great potential to reduce congestion in urban networks. In this research, we develop a stochastic analytical model for optimal control of communicant autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at smart intersections. We present the automated network fundamental diagram (ANFD) as a macro-level modeling tool for urban networks with smart intersections. In the proposed cooperative control strategy, we make use of the headway between the CAV platoons in each direction for consecutive passage of the platoons in the crossing direction through non-signalized intersections with no delay. For this to happen, the arrival and departure of platoons in crossing directions need to be synchronized. To improve system robustness (synchronization success probability), we allow a marginal gap between arrival and departure of the consecutive platoons in crossing directions to make up for operational error in the synchronization process. We then develop a stochastic traffic model for the smart intersections. Our results show that the effects of increasing the platoon size and the marginal gap length on the network capacity are not always positive. In fact, the capacity can be maximized by optimizing these cooperative control variables. We analytically solve the traffic optimization problem for the platoon size and marginal gap length and derive a closed-form solution for a normal distribution of the operational error. The performance of the network with smart intersections is presented by a stochastic ANFD, derived analytically and verified numerically using the results of a simulation model. The simulation results show that optimizing the control variables increases the capacity by 138% when the error standard deviation is 0.1 s.",0191-2615,Not found
Learning and managing stochastic network traffic dynamics with an aggregate traffic representation,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.021,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"This study estimates and manages the stochastic traffic dynamics in a bi-modal transportation system, and gives hints on how increasing data availability in transport and cities can be utilized to estimate transport supply functions and manage transport demand simultaneously. In the bi-modal system, travelers’ mode choices are based on their perceptions of the two travel modes: driving or public transit. Some travelers who have access to real-time road (car) traffic information may shift their mode based on the information received (note that real-time information about public transit departures/arrivals is not considered here). For the roadway network, the within-day traffic evolution is modeled through a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), where the flow dynamics exhibits a certain level of uncertainty. A non-parametric approach is proposed to estimate the MFD. To improve traffic efficiency, we develop an adaptive pricing mechanism coupled with the learned MFD. The adaptive pricing extends the study of Liu and Geroliminis (2017) to the time-dependent case, which can better accommodate temporal demand variations and achieve higher efficiency. Numerical studies are conducted on a one-region theoretical city network to illustrate the dynamic evolution of traffic, the MFD learning framework, and the efficiency of the adaptive pricing mechanism.",0191-2615,Not found
H<inf>∞</inf> robust perimeter flow control in urban networks with partial information feedback,10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.010,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Perimeter control is an effective city-scale solution to tackle congestion problems in urban networks. To accommodate the unpredictable dynamics of congestion propagation, it is essential to incorporate real-time robustness against travel demand fluctuations into a pragmatic perimeter control strategy. This paper proposes robust perimeter control algorithms based on partial information feedback from the network. The network dynamics are modeled using the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), where a heterogeneously congested network is assumed to be partitioned into two homogeneously congested regions, and an outer region that acts as demand origin and destination. The desired operating condition of the network is obtained by solving an optimization program. Observer-based H ∞ proportional (P) and proportional-integral (PI) controllers are designed based on Lyapunov theory, to robustly regulate the accumulation of each region and consequently to maximize the network outflow. The controller design algorithms further accommodate operational constraints by guarantying: (i) the boundedness of the perimeter control signals and (ii) a bounded offset between the perimeter control signals. Control parameters are designed off-line by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI), which can be solved efficiently. Comprehensive numerical studies conducted on the nonlinear model of the network highlight the effectiveness of the proposed robust control algorithms in improving the congestion in the presence of time-varying disturbance in travel demand.",0191-2615,Not found

For reservable parking facility, a MP-DGS (modified proxy Demange-Gale-Sotomayor) mechanism and combinatorial system (integration of direct and evolutionary methods) are adopted to maximize the social surplus through optimizing the allocation-pricing of parking permits. As a result, it is found that: (i) the proposed approaches not only simplify the users’ bidding procedures but also ensure the users express their preference truthfully even under the situation of non-optimal parking permits allocation; (ii) in homogeneous case (parking periods for all users are the same), it is theoretically demonstrated that the MP-DGS mechanism is more efficient than the traditional mechanisms in the worst-case scenario; (iii) in heterogeneous case (users are heterogeneous in desired parking timing and duration), time-dependent parking permits are taken into account. The ranking of the algorithm time complexity in the worst-case scenario is that direct method = evolutionary method  <  Leonard mechanism = VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism, and the combinatorial system not only solves out the optimal allocation-pricing results effectively but also ensures the optimal results can be obtained in a shorter time.

Through theoretical analysis, it is revealed that depending on the realization of the queue length due to the cruising-for-parking, the region-based optimal dynamic parking pricing can be divided into two patterns, furthermore, each pattern results in a “bang-bang” control.",0191-2615,Not found
Dynamic traffic assignment using the macroscopic fundamental diagram: A Review of vehicular and pedestrian flow models,10.1016/j.trb.2018.10.017,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Link-level Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) models of large cities may suffer from prohibitive computation times, and calibration/validation can become the major challenge faced in their real-time implementation. The empirical evidence in 2008 in support of the existence of a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) on urban networks led to the formulation of discrete-space DTA models, where the link-level representation of networks replaced by a zone-based representation. In parallel, a large body of DTA models based on Hughes’ pedestrian model have been formulated in continuum space as 2-dimensional conservation laws, where the speed-density relationship has been recently interpreted as a MFD. Unfortunately, today it is not clear whether the continuum-space and discrete-space approaches are consistent with each other, in the sense that a well-defined discrete-space model should correspond to the numerical solution of a continuum model. This paper aims to shed light on this matter by performing a review of the literature in both modeling approaches. We found that (i) the discrete-space DTA models are prone to stalling problem leading to unrealistic gridlocks, (ii) with the exception of Hänseler’s pedestrian models, existing discrete-space models are not guaranteed to be consistent with a continuum formulation, which presents the potential for significant biases between the two approaches although they are trying to answer the same question, (iii) the speed-density relationships used in the continuum-space literature are very simplistic and do not incorporate the effects of network, particularly the effects of intersections, which is the strong suit of the MFD, (iv) the models mostly have been applied to the cases with only one or a few destinations and do not seem to be capable of modeling large-scale networks. We also found that further research is needed to (i) incorporate departure time choice, (ii) improve existing numerical methods, possibly extending recent advances on the one-dimensional kinematic wave (LWR) model, (iii) study the properties of system optimum solutions, (iv) examine the real-time applicability of current continuum-space models compared to traditional DTA methods, and (v) formulate anisotropic models for the interaction of intersecting flows.",0191-2615,Not found
A functional form with a physical meaning for the macroscopic fundamental diagram,10.1016/j.trb.2018.10.013,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) relates vehicle accumulation and production of travel in an urban network with a well-defined and reproducible curve.

So far, however, no generally accepted functional form has been identified. This paper proposes a functional form for the MFD that is based on the smooth approximation of an upper bound of technologically feasible traffic states (uMFD). In this functional form, the uMFD can be either estimated from MFD measurements or defined a-priori, either analytically or with additional measurements in the network, while the smoothing to the uMFD is quantified with a single parameter λ. The uMFD can in principle be any multi-regime function, but we find that a trapezoidal shape with only four parameters, all physically meaningful, models the familiar shape of the MFD very well as shown with empirical data from Marseille, London, Lucerne, Yokohama, and Zurich.

Over the last decade, different accumulation-based dynamic models, describing the traffic flow dynamics of one or multi-region systems, have been developed in different forms relying on vehicle conservation equations. In this research, two enhanced accumulation-based models are developed by incorporating into model structure the time-delay (time-lag) effects as an important factor. The first model incorporates state delay in the MFD output to improve the dynamics, to better represent wave propagation and travel time evolution within the region, especially when the change in demand is fast. While in the second model delayed interconnections are introduced in the dynamic equations to model data processing and communication delays between interconnected regions. The two linearized models are formulated in interconnected forms. Then, the reference model adaptive control approach has been implemented to allow us designing distributed adaptive perimeter control laws.

Towards real-time density estimation using vehicle-to-vehicle communications,10.1016/j.trb.2020.06.001,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Traffic state estimation is a fundamental task of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Recent advances in sensor technology and emerging computer and vehicular communications paradigms have brought the task of estimating traffic state parameters in real time within reach. Recognizing this, the US-DOT started promoting the Connected Vehicles (CV) initiative. By using wireless connectivity between the vehicles participating in the traffic, the CV initiative aims to promote an increased awareness of real-time traffic conditions and, as a result, to reduce the number and severity of crashes. A number of recent papers have proposed CV-based approaches to estimating traffic state parameters including density and flow. However, virtually all the CV-based approaches for density estimation also rely on communication with stationary detectors and other pre-deployed roadside infrastructure. This assumption is problematic since such infrastructure is often not available. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a simple and easy to implement real-time traffic density estimation method that uses only vehicle-to-vehicle communications and the on-board sensing capabilities of present-day vehicles. In our method, using their on-board devices, vehicles maintain a tally that keeps track of the difference between the number of times other vehicles pass them and the number of times they pass other vehicles. Notice that since vehicles may vary their speed as they please, they may pass and be passed by the same vehicle multiple times and, consequently, maintaining a correct tally is a non-trivial task. We show that the tallies computed by vehicles relate, in an interesting way, to traffic density. We provide a detailed proof of our method using techniques that avoid the use of common simplifications inherent to visual time-space traffic diagrams. Furthermore, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method through extensive simulations using real NGSIM traffic traces along with SUMO-generated synthetic traffic traces.",0191-2615,Not found
Why are highway speed limits really justified? An equilibrium speed choice analysis,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.009,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Speed externalities – the impacts that a driver’s speed choice imposes on others – are usually quoted to justify highway speed regulation in the form of maximum speed limits. However, speed externalities could already be internalized if a pre-existing policy were in place that is related to speed, questioning the traditional rationale supporting speed limits. Given the relationship between speed and fuel consumption and the omnipresence of fuel taxes around the world, it comes as a surprise that pre-existing taxes on motor fuel are completely missing in the debate on the general appropriateness of speed regulation. In this paper we develop an economic equilibrium model of highway speed choice accounting for (i) a market failure – speeding externalities capturing the fact that drivers do not internalize the adverse consequences of speeding on other highway users and the society as a whole; (ii) a famous speed related behavioral anomaly – causing adverse effects drivers impose on themselves by falsely predicting the time saving potential of speed; (iii) a pre-existing fuel tax – closing the wedge between the privately and socially optimal speed. The latter creates a ‘government feedback effect’ reflecting the positive feedback effect of speed on fuel tax revenue and so the broader beneficial fiscal impacts of speed choice ignored by drivers. Numerical computations for Germany indicate a dominant ‘government feedback effect’ ((iii) outweighs (i)) for mean speeds up to around 120 km/h presuming fully variable travel time budgets and beyond that speed level when drivers put (some of the) travel time savings from speeding into more highway traveling. This implies that speed externalities are largely internalized and that the externality rationale in favor of speed regulation does not apply to the majority of drivers. Nevertheless, a moderate speed limit on German highways of 130 km/h would probably not compromise economic efficiency, at least as long as the share of diesel cars is significant. Generally, when drivers are subject to lack of rationality leading to excess speeding, (iii) is not able to outweigh (i). Then, speed limits remain highly warranted provided that appropriate “nudging” is not available. The numerical finding is likely to hold for a large number of European countries too but probably not for North American countries where fuel taxes are considerably lower.",0191-2615,Not found

To find a reliable operational solution for shipment assignment, realizing the trade-off between the operations cost and reliability is highly essential.

We incorporate risk aversion into the stochastic optimization model where the objective is to minimize the total deterministic operations cost and the weighted value-at-risk. The closed-form expressions of value-at-risk are derived and some structural properties of the optimization problem are revealed. Linearization techniques are utilized to make the proposed model tractable and solvable by an exact algorithm. Our computational studies further demonstrate the cost efficiency on systems reliability improvement through the risk hedging approach with job combination. It is interesting to uncover that being moderately risk-averse is wise, but possessing a very high risk-averse attitude is doing more harm than good as the increase of deterministic operations cost is much more significant than the decrease of value-at-risk. Being risk neutral may also be unwise as the chance of achieving the optimal expected total cost may be very low.

During post-disaster operations, response teams must make road network connections between supplier nodes and demand (population) nodes in order to protect human health and safety. The effectiveness of response operations depends on positioning of relief supplies in anticipation of new clearance equipment requests at new locations, as well as with relocation of clearance equipment items to rebalance the use of items post disaster. To solve this problem, a novel dynamic post-disaster debris clearance problem is introduced—one that features non-myopic positioning of clearance equipment items based on a queuing formulation that is compatible with the maximum-weighted flow problem under incomplete information proposed by Çelik et al., (2015). By including a clearance equipment positioning strategy, we improve the strategy of the stochastic debris clearance problem, with a new framework on dynamically optimizing the post-disaster debris clearance strategy with limited observable information about the disaster-relief resources located on the road network.

A path-based equilibrium model for ridesharing matching,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.007,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This paper examines how the ridesharing program will reshape the spatial distribution of traffic congestion. With ridesharing services, travelers make multi-dimensional decisions concerning mode choices, route choices, and matching decisions. We build a path-based equilibrium model to describe the decision-making of travelers in the presence of the ridesharing program and thereby to forecast the stable congestion distribution in the long run. Specifically, our model can explicitly track the path information of the matched drivers and riders by solving the proposed equilibrium model. The model is formulated as variational inequalities due to the non-separable cost functions and asymmetric link interactions. We first demonstrate the non-uniqueness of mode-specific link flows and derive the condition for the uniqueness of link flows. We then derive sufficient conditions for a matching failure. A matching failure occurs if the lowest total inconvenience cost of a pair of rider and driver exceeds a threshold. In this situation, matching between the ridesharing supply (drivers) and demand (riders) cannot be established by adjusting the compensation scheme. Moreover, we derive the sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of equilibrium with a positive ridesharing ridership. These conditions help operators gain insights into how to appropriately design compensation schemes. We reformulate the variational inequalities as the equivalent mixed complementarity problem, and propose a heuristic routing algorithm to identify the feasible routing paths for shared rides that interest both ridesharing drivers and riders. Finally, Our numerical experiments show that ridesharing is effective in relieving the overall congestion but leads to high congestion on some links. In the scenarios where the demand into the central business district (CBD) is high, the commuters entering CBD are all better off with ridesharing service. In contrast, the commuters traveling to certain non-CBD areas are worse off. Our experiments also reveal various path choice behaviors of ridesharing participants. The solo drivers always use the paths with short travel times, while the ridesharing drivers tend to use paths with short travel distances. By considering a commission to the platform, we demonstrate the regime in which increasing the commission rate improves the platform’s revenue without harming the social welfare.",0191-2615,Not found
A bibliometric overview of Transportation Research Part B: Methodological in the past forty years (1979–2019),10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.016,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"In 1979, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological (TR-Part B) split from its mother journal Transportation Research, which was founded by Dr. Frank A. Haight in 1967, to set off on a journey as an independent journal with a theme on methodological development of transportation science. Since then, TR-Part B has been a leading international journal in the field of transportation research. Motivated by the 40th anniversary of TR-Part B (1979–2019), this paper utilized a bibliometric analysis technique to present a lifetime overview of the development characteristics and contribution details of TR-Part B in the past 40 years. The data used in this analysis were derived from the Core Collection Database of Web of Science, producing a total of 2,697 papers that were regular articles and reviews published in TR-Part B during the study period from 1979 to 2019. A systematic bibliometric analysis was conducted using VOSviewer software around two main aspects. First, analysis was conducted on publication and citation structures, the leading authors, organizations, and regions/countries with the most number of academic publications in TR-Part B, as well as those individuals and sources citing TR-Part B the most. Second, a visualization of the bibliometric characteristics of TR-Part B was presented in a knowledge mapping network analysis of co-authorship and bibliographic coupling.

Optimal location problem for variable speed limit application areas,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.003,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Some studies consider variable speed limit (VSL) control as a viable option to prevent traffic breakdown at bottlenecks by limiting the mainline flow with reduced speed limits. However, few studies consider the location of the application area as a design variable of the problem. This paper explains why the location of a VSL control area is crucial to prevent the capacity drop phenomenon at lane drop bottlenecks. We first define two types of stationary states, congested and uncongested, inside a lane drop bottleneck assuming the Lighthill-Whitham Richards model with bounded acceleration. In particular, the characteristics of these stationary states and their admissible conditions are discussed thoroughly. If the speed limit imposed is low enough, the location of the VSL application area is irrelevant to ensure an uncongested stationary state inside the bottleneck. However, for a given range of speed limits, the location of the VSL application area should be designed carefully to allow for uncongested stationary states and prevent the occurrence of the capacity drop. We formulate an optimization problem and show that, contrary to the general belief, the larger the speed limit, the farther the VSL application area should be from the bottleneck. Finally, the results are extended to other types of bottlenecks, such as sag or tunnel bottlenecks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analytically identify, formulate, and solve the optimal location problem for variable speed limit application areas. It makes fundamental contributions to both traffic flow theory (by analyzing the stationary states for VSL-controlled bottlenecks) and traffic control (by determining the optimal location of a VSL application area). Moreover, the results presented are of practical relevance because they can help to establish some guidelines for practitioners to implement VSL control strategies.",0191-2615,Not found
Modeling and optimizing a fare incentive strategy to manage queuing and crowding in mass transit systems: Modeling and optimizing a fare incentive strategy to manage queuing and crowding in mass transit systems,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.006,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This paper solves the problem of optimizing a surcharge-reward scheme and analyzes equilibrium properties incorporating commuters’ departure time choice to relieve crowding and queuing congestion in mass transit systems. The surcharge-reward scheme incentivizes commuters to switch departure times from a pre-specified central period to shoulder periods. We formulate a bilevel model to design and optimize the surcharge-reward scheme. The upper-level problem minimizes the total equilibrium costs by determining the refundable surcharges, the rewards, and the corresponding central charging period. The lower-level problem determines the equilibrium of commuters’ departure times with respect to generalized travel costs. Equilibrium properties are analyzed and a sequential iterative solution algorithm is developed. We found that the existence of an optimal solution depends on the scheme design and there exists a lower bound on the surcharge to achieve the system optimum. Numerical studies are conducted on a commuting rail line in Copenhagen. The proposed algorithm converges efficiently, and the fare incentive scheme can simultaneously reduce the individual trip costs, total crowding costs, and total queuing time costs. The performance of the scheme increases with the rewards and surcharges up to a point and beyond which it stays unchanged.",0191-2615,Not found
Understanding the costs of urban rail transport operations,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.019,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"There is considerable variation in the average cost of operations across urban rail transport (or metro) systems. Since metros are typically owned and operated by public authorities, there is a public interest case in understanding the key drivers of their operational costs. This paper estimates short-run cost functions for metro operations using a unique panel dataset from twenty-four metro systems around the world. We use a flexible translog specification and apply dynamic panel generalised method of moments (DPGMM) estimation to control for confounding from observed and unobserved characteristics of metro operations. Our empirical results show that metro systems with a high density of usage are the most cost-efficient. We also find that operational costs fall as metro size increases. These results have important implications for the economic appraisal of metro systems.",0191-2615,Not found
A distributionally robust stochastic optimization-based model predictive control with distributionally robust chance constraints for cooperative adaptive cruise control under uncertain traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.001,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Motivated by connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, this paper proposes a data-driven optimization-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) modeling framework for the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) of a string of CAVs under uncertain traffic conditions. The proposed data-driven optimization-based MPC modeling framework aims to improve the stability, robustness, and safety of longitudinal cooperative automated driving involving a string of CAVs under uncertain traffic conditions using Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) data. Based on an online learning-based driving dynamics prediction model, we predict the uncertain driving states of the vehicles preceding the controlled CAVs. With the predicted driving states of the preceding vehicles, we solve a constrained Finite-Horizon Optimal Control problem to predict the uncertain driving states of the controlled CAVs. To obtain the optimal acceleration or deceleration commands for the CAVs under uncertainties, we formulate a Distributionally Robust Stochastic Optimization (DRSO) model (i.e. a special case of data-driven optimization models under moment bounds) with a Distributionally Robust Chance Constraint (DRCC). The predicted uncertain driving states of the immediately preceding vehicles and the controlled CAVs will be utilized in the safety constraint and the reference driving states of the DRSO-DRCC model. To solve the minimax program of the DRSO-DRCC model, we reformulate the relaxed dual problem as a Semidefinite Program (SDP) of the original DRSO-DRCC model based on the strong duality theory and the Semidefinite Relaxation technique. In addition, we propose two methods for solving the relaxed SDP problem. We use Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data to demonstrate the proposed model in numerical experiments. The experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed model can obtain string-stable, robust, and safe longitudinal cooperative automated driving control of CAVs by proper settings, including the driving-dynamics prediction model, prediction horizon lengths, and time headways. Computational analyses are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed methods for solving the DRSO-DRCC model for real-time automated driving applications within proper settings.",0191-2615,Not found
Demand information sharing in port concession arrangements,10.1016/j.trb.2020.03.010,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This paper investigates the effects of demand information sharing on concession arrangements and market equilibria, when two ports, each managed by a welfare-maximizing port authority and a profit-maximizing port operator, compete for demands. The problem is formulated as a multi-stage game, in which the authority and the operator at each port first decide whether to share demand information and make concession arrangements; then, the port operators compete à la Cournot. Alternative scenarios are compared to identify the effects of information sharing and market structure. Our analytical results identify the conditions under which demand information sharing is beneficial in port concession arrangements and highlight the importance of the underlying market structure and congestion levels in achieving these benefits. Specifically, we show that information sharing is a source of welfare improvement, and the effects are more significant when the positive externality of information sharing on welfare is large, inter-port competition is strong, and port congestion is costly. However, with no compensation, the port operators have no incentive to share their private information because otherwise, this is likely to increase concession unit-fees, limit their ability to compete effectively with each other, and ultimately reduce their expected profits. Therefore, transfer payments are necessary to encourage information sharing. With this arrangement and the assumed symmetric cost and service structure, we show that a port operator prefers sharing information if the externality of information sharing on welfare exceeds a threshold. Furthermore, when this externality is sufficiently large, the operators at both ports benefit from sharing information. Finally, when the two ports compete in price, we show that a port operator's single-side information sharing may not always benefit its port authority.",0191-2615,Not found
Two-echelon vehicle routing problem with time windows and mobile satellites,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.010,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"To tackle the logistics challenges faced by enterprises using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with human-driven vans for parcel deliveries, we introduce the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with time windows and mobile satellites (2E-VRP-TM), which, when solved, optimizes delivery routes for a fleet of van-UAV combinations. Typically, one van carries several UAVs. The first echelon involves time-window-driven parcel deliveries using vans from a distribution center (DC) to customers. The second echelon involves UAVs being dispatched from mobile-satellite vans to serve customers with time windows and directly delivering parcels from the DC. When the first-echelon vehicles park at customer locations and wait for second-echelon vehicle departures and returns, the first-echelon vehicles are used as mobile satellites. We develop a vehicle-flow formulation, in which the mobile-satellite synchronization constraints are included to ensure the echelon interaction. We provide an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. Computational experiments evaluate the validity of the 2E-VRP-TM formulation and the effectiveness of the heuristic.",0191-2615,Not found
Mechanism design for on-demand first-mile ridesharing,10.1016/j.trb.2020.03.011,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Ridesharing emerges as a viable way to bridge the first-mile accessibility gap to public transit. There is particularly a high demand for the first-mile ridesharing service in transit-intensive metropolitan areas. This paper studies the mechanism design problem in order to promote passengers’ participation in the on-demand first-mile ridesharing accounting for passengers’ mobility preferences, including passengers’ requirements on arrival deadlines, maximum willing-to-pay prices, and detour tolerances. A rolling horizon planning approach is used to process spontaneous on-demand passenger requests. We propose a novel mechanism, namely “Mobility-Preference-Based Mechanism with Baseline Price Control” (MPMBPC), which adapts the traditional Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism and incorporates a baseline price control component. MPMBPC is proved to satisfy several important mechanism design properties, including “individual rationality”, “incentive compatibility”, “price controllability”, and “detour discounting reasonability”. In comparison with the traditional general-purpose VCG mechanism, MPMBPC can avoid unreasonably low prices and prevent carriers’ deficits. A computationally efficient heuristic algorithm called Solution Pooling Approach (SPA) is developed to solve large-scale ridesharing mechanism design problems. Numerical examples are developed to demonstrate that SPA can solve large-scale ridesharing mechanism design problems in a computationally efficient way, with satisfactory solution qualities.",0191-2615,Not found
The two-mode problem with bottleneck queuing and transit crowding: How should congestion be priced using tolls and fares?,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.008,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This paper proposes a bi-modal bottleneck model with time-varying scheduling preferences for investigating the two-mode problem with bottleneck queuing and transit crowding. In the proposed model, the activity scheduling utilities of commuters at home and at work vary by the time of day, and two kinds of congestion externalities (i.e., traffic congestion among vehicles at the bottleneck and in-bus passenger crowding discomfort) are considered. Commuters choose their travel modes and departure times from home to work during the morning commute to minimize their own generalized travel cost. The properties of the proposed bi-modal bottleneck model are analytically explored. Particularly, the relationship between the departure intervals of auto and bus commuters is revealed. The time-varying charging schemes and step charging schemes for reducing the congestion externalities are also investigated. A critical condition for passenger shift from one mode to the other mode with congestion charging schemes is identified, and the effects of congestion charging schemes with and without internalizing the bus-related congestion externalities (including the bottleneck congestion externality induced by auto and bus interaction and the in-bus passenger crowding externality) on the bottleneck system are compared.",0191-2615,Not found
"Dynamic optimization strategies for on-demand ride services platform: Surge pricing, commission rate, and incentives",10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.005,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"On-demand ride services reshape urban transportation systems, human mobility, and travelers' mode choice behavior. Compared to the traditional street-hailing taxi, an on-demand ride services platform analyzes ride requests of passengers and coordinates real-time supply and demand with dynamic operational strategies in the ride-sourcing market. To test the impact of dynamic optimization strategies on the ride-sourcing market, this paper proposes a dynamic vacant car-passenger meeting model. In this model, the accumulative arrival rate and departure rate of passengers and vacant cars determine the waiting number of passengers and vacant cars, while the waiting number of passengers and vacant cars in turn influence the meeting rate (which equals to the departure rate of both passengers and vacant cars). The departure rate means the rate at which passengers and vacant cars match up and start a paid trip. Compared with classic equilibrium models, this model can be utilized to characterize the influence of short-term variances and disturbances of current demand and supply (i.e., arrival rates of passengers and vacant cars) on the waiting numbers of passengers and vacant cars. Using the proposed meeting model, we optimize dynamic strategies under two objective functions, i.e., platform revenue maximization, and social welfare maximization, while the driver's profit is guaranteed above a certain level. We also propose an algorithm based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to solve the sequential dynamic optimization problem. The results show that our algorithm can effectively improve the objective function of the multi-period problem, compared with the myopic algorithm. A broader range of surge pricing and commission rate and the introduction of incentives are helpful to achieve better optimization results. The dynamic optimization strategies help the on-demand ride services platform efficiently adjust supply and demand resources and achieve specific optimization goals.",0191-2615,Not found
Two-dimensional vehicular movement modelling at intersections based on optimal control,10.1016/j.trb.2020.04.001,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Modeling traffic flow at intersections is essential for the design, control, and management of intersections. A challenging feature of microscopic modeling vehicular movement at intersections is that drivers can choose among an infinite number of alternative traveling paths and speeds. This makes it fundamentally different from structured straight road sections with lanes. This study proposes a novel method to model the trajectories of vehicles in two-dimensional space and speed. Based on optimal control theory, it assumes drivers schedule their driving behavior, including the steering and acceleration, to minimize the predicted costs. The costs contain the running costs, which consist of the travel time and driving smoothness (longitudinally and laterally), and the terminal cost, which penalizes the deviations from the desired final state. Different than conventional methods, the vehicle motion dynamics are formulated in distance rather than in time. The model is solved by an iterative numerical solution algorithm based on the Minimum Principle of Pontryagin. The descriptive power, plausibility, and accuracy of the proposed model are investigated by comparing the calculated results under several cases, which can be solved from symmetry or analytically. The proposed model is further calibrated and validated using empirical trajectory data, and the quality of the predicted trajectory is confirmed. Qualitatively, the optimal trajectory changes in the range of the shortest path and smoothest path under different weights of the running cost. The proposed model can be used as a starting point and extended with more considerations of intersection operation in the real world for future applications.",0191-2615,Not found
Security analysis for fixed-time traffic control systems,10.1016/j.trb.2020.07.002,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Wireless communication is being used as an enabling technology with traditional fixed traffic control systems in this transitional era toward Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Unfortunately, major security concerns have arisen with respect to ever-increasing complexity and interconnectivity, and a noticeable lack of attention for security in these systems. Addressing concerns is a colossal challenge as it requires thorough development and formal analysis of a system model with respect to security. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel formal attack modeling and impact analysis methodology based on the Link Queue Model (LQM) of traffic flow inside a double ring road network, which is equivalent to a grid network with homogeneous links. We develop attack models as functions of tampered traffic control settings (e.g., green time ratios, cycle length, retaining ratios) with outputs equivalent to mobility impacts on the traffic network (e.g., time until system reaches state convergence, asymptotic average network flow). Further, for a given attack model, we define and identify vulnerable states: states that are critical to protect because they lead to negative impacts under the given attack model. Using our methodology we found that for certain vulnerable states, after only a few cycles of tampered control settings an attacker could cause a real impact of 1.5x speed-up in gridlock state convergence or 37%-99% drop in the asymptotic average flow rate. These results imply potentially drastic financial costs for cities and all involved drivers if similar attacks were performed on a real traffic control system.",0191-2615,Not found
Modeling and managing heterogeneous ride-sourcing platforms with government subsidies on electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2020.07.006,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This paper formulates duopoly competition between two non-cooperative heterogeneous ride-sourcing platforms considering the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) and government subsidies on EVs. One ride-sourcing platform adopts an EV asset-heavy strategy by undertaking EV depreciation costs, while the other ride-sourcing platform adopts an asset-light strategy by hiring drivers who own vehicles. The first-order conditions of each platform's pricingunder competitive equilibrium are derived based on a game-theoretical model that involves the stakeholders (i.e., riders, drivers, and ride-sourcing platforms). Based on the modeling framework ofduopoly competition between two heterogeneous ride-sourcing platforms, this paper proposes an optimization model with social welfare maximization for the determination of governmentsubsidy strategies. We conduct numerical illustrations to demonstrate how governmental subsidies on EV purchase and charging stations impact the endogenous variables in equilibrium (e.g., price for riders, wage for drivers, and market share for each platform) under different formulations of riders' waiting time cost function, which are increasing returns to scale. Also, a specialmodel with a fixed commission ratio is discussed. The results provide suggestions for decision-makers on how to allocate subsidy within the budget constraint.",0191-2615,Not found
Regulating a public transit monopoly under asymmetric cost information,10.1016/j.trb.2020.07.009,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The regulation of a monopolistic public transit operator whose marginal cost is unknown to the regulator is studied in this paper. We contribute to the transit regulation literature by presenting an incentive-compatible (IC) regulatory policy with consideration of the decision interactions between the regulator and transit operator under asymmetric information. The regulator only has some subjective prior probability distribution for the unknown marginal cost before designing regulatory policies (i.e., probability of permitting operations, maximum fare, maximum headway, and subsidy amount) to maximize the expected social welfare over the unknown cost. The operator with privately held cost information optimizes its fare and headway decisions subject to regulatory policies. The proposed IC policy is derived analytically, which gives the operator no incentive to misrepresent its cost. We compare regulations under symmetric information versusasymmetric information, and measure the deadweight loss due to the information asymmetry. The proposed IC policy is also compared with a benchmark policy, which is based on the cost expected by the regulator, to demonstrate its superiority. We find: (1) solutions under asymmetric information can be reproduced by solving the regulation problem under symmetric information with an enlarged marginal cost; (2) a regulator adopting the benchmark policy may set fare and headway limits above the levels selected by a profit-maximizing monopolistic operator. This study improves the state of the artin public transit regulation by presenting an effective tool for designing IC regulatory policies.",0191-2615,Not found
Winners and losers from road pricing with heterogeneous travelers and a mixed-traffic bus alternative,10.1016/j.trb.2020.07.003,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Studies of road pricing in which the Value of Time (VOT) varies among travelers suggest that road pricing benefits travelers with high VOT and hurts travelers with low VOT. This happens because, when a toll reduces congestion, only high-VOT travelers value the time saved more than the money cost. This paper uses a static traffic model with elastic demands to examine how the presence of a mixed-traffic (one affected by congestion) bus alternative, which is cheaper but slower than driving, alters that logic. When “agents” (potential travelers) care only about the time and money costs of each alternative, it turns out that Pareto-improving toll increases are possible; and, absent a Pareto improvement, the “Full Cost of Travel” (inclusive of time and money costs) rises only inside an intermediate interval of VOT while falling for sufficiently high and low VOT. But when agents have heterogeneous “tastes” for each mode, the Full Cost of Travel falls for all agents with VOT higher than a certain level, and below that level the direction of change depends on an agent’s taste.",0191-2615,Not found
Pricing and equilibrium in on-demand ride-pooling markets,10.1016/j.trb.2020.07.001,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"With the recent rapid growth of technology-enabled mobility services, ride-sourcing platforms, such as Uber and DiDi, have launched commercial on-demand ride-pooling programs that allow drivers to serve more than one passenger request in each ride. Without requiring the prearrangement of trip schedules, these programs match on-demand passenger requests with vehicles that have vacant seats. Ride-pooling programs are expected to offer benefits for both individual passengers in the form of cost savings and for society in the form of traffic alleviation and emission reduction. In addition to some exogenous variables and environments for ride-sourcing market, such as city size and population density, three key decisions govern a platform's efficiency for ride-pooling services: trip fare, vehicle fleet size, and allowable detour time. An appropriate discounted fare attracts an adequate number of passengers for ride-pooling, and thus increases the successful pairing rate, while an appropriate allowable detour time prevents passengers from giving up ride-pooling service. This paper develops a mathematical model to elucidate the complex relationships between the variables and decisions involved in a ride-pooling market. We find that the monopoly optimum, social optimum and second-best solutions in both ride-pooling and non-pooling markets are always in a normal regime rather than the wild goose chase (WGC) regime—an inefficient equilibrium in which drivers spend substantial time on picking up passengers. Besides, in general, a unit decrease in trip fare in a ride-pooling market attracts more passengers than would a non-pooling market, because it not only directly increases passenger demand due to the negative price elasticity, but also reduces actual detour time, which in turn indirectly increases ride-pooling passenger demand. As a result, we prove that monopoly optimum, social optimum and second-best solution trip fares in a ride-pooling market are lower than that in a non-pooling market under certain conditions. These theoretical findings are further verified by a set of numerical studies.",0191-2615,Not found

Drone routing with energy function: Formulation and exact algorithm,10.1016/j.trb.2020.06.011,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Drone delivery is known as a potential contributor in improving efficiency and alleviating last-mile delivery problems. For this reason, drone routing and scheduling has become a highly active area of research in recent years. Unlike the vehicle routing problem, however, designing drones’ routes is challenging due to multiple operational characteristics including multi-trip operations, recharge planning, and energy consumption calculation. To fill some important gaps in the literature, this paper solves a multi-trip drone routing problem, where drones’ energy consumption is modeled as a nonlinear function of payload and travel distance. We propose adding logical cuts and subgradient cuts in the solution process to tackle the more complex nonlinear (convex) energy function, instead of using the linear approximation method as in the literature, which can fail to detect infeasible routes due to excess energy consumption. We use a 2-index formulation to model the problem and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm for the formulation. Benchmark instances are first generated for this problem. Numerical tests indicate that even though the original model is nonlinear, the proposed approach can solve large problems to optimality. In addition, in multiple instances, the linear approximation model yields routes that under the nonlinear energy model would be energy infeasible. Use of a linear approximation for drone energy leads to differences in energy consumption of about 9% on average compared to the nonlinear energy model.",0191-2615,Not found

The study takes on two different perspectives. First, we explore existing methods and relate them to one or more traffic assignment components. It is found that there exists a clear separation between a demand modelling point of view, i.e., travel demand and (geographical) zoning on the one hand, and supply modelling-oriented methods, i.e. network topology and network loading, on the other. Further, we explore the existing literature on the interface between demand and supply, i.e., connector and centroid placement which is to be considered a special type of aggregation. It is found this aspect of traffic assignment has received relatively little attention in this context, even though it is shown to be of significant impact on modelling results. The second perspective in this study places the discussed aggregation methodologies in the broader perspective of clustering procedures. We do not necessarily explore clustering methods as such but mainly look at the classification of different types of clustering methods which can be projected onto the traffic assignment domain and aggregation procedures in particular. It is shown that most existing methods can be classified as supervised – or classification based – clustering procedures while relatively few studies explore other known approaches such as semi-supervised or unsupervised clustering techniques. Lastly, we discuss how aggregation techniques could be deployed to construct multi-scale modelling environments. There is however a lack of methodology to construct such models consistently.

We model the investment decision as a real options problem under ambiguity. An airline's ambiguity-averse preferences are modeled using the multiple prior expected utility form. We obtain the optimal investment timing rule for the airline and find that it requires the airline's expected present value of its future incremental profit from investing to exceed the investment cost by the option value multiplier. We then compare the airline's optimal investment timing rule to the social optimum and discuss two possible subsidy policies, a lump-sum subsidy and a per-unit subsidy, with which the government can align the airline's investment timing rule with the social optimum. We characterize the stepwise structure of both subsidy policies, in which the optimal time to invest in an exclusive terminal depends on three thresholds: the social optimum, the airline's break-even point, and a combination of the social optimum and the airline optimum. We conclude that the two subsidy policies have equivalent effects when the government and the airline have the same ambiguity levels, as they lead to the same investment timing and require the same amount of government funds.",0191-2615,Not found

This study proposes a heuristic-based model to reproduce the mixed-flow dynamics of pedestrians and cyclists, and the model is calibrated with an experiment on the mixed traffic flow of pedestrians and cyclists. Pedestrians/cyclists were asked to walk/ride on a ring-shaped track. In the uni/bidirectional flow scenario, pedestrians and cyclists moved in the same/opposite direction. A genetic algorithm was used for parameter calibration. The model could reproduce the experimental results well. Under both scenarios, pedestrians and cyclists formed their own lanes. The pedestrians walked in the inner lane, and cyclists rode in the outer lane in a self-organized process. The widths of the pedestrian lane and the cyclist lane were found to be more uniform during bidirectional flow. The pedestrian flow rate was higher in the unidirectional flow scenario than in the bidirectional flow scenario. In contrast, at low cyclist densities, the cyclist flow rate was essentially the same in both scenarios. When the density was high, the cyclist flow rate is higher in the unidirectional flow scenario. Sensitivity analyses showed that cyclist speed had little effect on the pedestrian flow rate. A higher cyclist speed led to a higher cyclist flow rate at low densities, but the cyclist flow rates approached the same value at high cyclist densities. As the proportion of pedestrians/cyclists increased, the flow rate of cyclists/pedestrians decreased. The simulation results on a straight track were largely consistent with those on a ring-shaped track.",0191-2615,Not found
Exact matching of attractive shared rides (ExMAS) for system-wide strategic evaluations,10.1016/j.trb.2020.06.006,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The premise of ride-sharing is that service providers can offer a discount, so that travellers are compensated for prolonged travel times and induced discomfort, while still increasing their revenues. While recently proposed real-time solutions support online operations, algorithms to perform strategic system-wide evaluations are crucially needed. We propose an exact, replicable and demand-, rather than supply-driven algorithm for matching trips into shared rides. We leverage on delimiting our search for attractive shared rides only, which, coupled with a directed shareability multi-graph representation and efficient graph searches with predetermined node sequence, narrows the (otherwise exploding) search-space effectively enough to derive an exact solution. The proposed utility-based formulation paves the way for model integration in travel demand models, allowing for a cross-scenario sensitivity analysis, including pricing strategies and regulation policies. We apply the proposed algorithm in a series of experiments for the case of Amsterdam, where we perform a system-wide analysis of the ride-sharing performance in terms of both algorithm computations of shareability under alternative demand, network and service settings as well as behavioural parameters. In the case of Amsterdam, 3000 travellers offered a 30% discount form 1900 rides achieving an average occupancy of 1.67 and yielding a 30% vehicle-hours reduction at the cost of halving service provider revenues and a 17% increase in passenger-hours. Benchmarking against time-window constrained approaches reveals that our algorithm reduces the search-space more effectively, while yielding solutions that are substantially more attractive for travellers.",0191-2615,Not found
Revealing personal activities schedules from synthesizing multi-period origin-destination matrices,10.1016/j.trb.2020.06.007,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Over the last decades, technological advances have allowed the capturing of travel behaviour at large-scale. Despite the unprecedented volume and the variety of personal mobility data, aggregate Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are still the most widespread means to organise and represent travel demand. Nonetheless, standard ODs cannot adequately capture significant elements affecting travel behaviour such as trip-interdependency and trip-chaining, therefore they are not particularly suitable for travel behaviour analysis at person-level. The currently presented modelling framework enables the in-depth study of personal mobility by firstly combining the trips present in OD matrices into home-based trip-chains (i.e. tours) and subsequently into sequences of activities (activity schedules). The above-mentioned process is completed based on advanced graph-theoretical and combinatorial optimisation concepts. The applicability of the methodology is meticulously verified through a large-scale test case where a set of multi-period, purpose dependant ODs is converted into realistic activity schedules able to incorporate more than 99% of the inputted travel demand. The accurate and highly detailed results showcase the significant potential of the proposed methodology to support the comprehensive analysis of travel behaviour at person level.",0191-2615,Not found
Quantum probability: A new method for modelling travel behaviour,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.014,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"There has been an increasing effort to improve the behavioural realism of mathematical models of choice, resulting in efforts to move away from random utility maximisation (RUM) models. Some new insights have been generated with, for example, models based on random regret minimisation (RRM, μ-RRM). Notwithstanding work using for example Decision Field Theory (DFT), many of the alternatives to RUM tested on real-world data have however only looked at only modest departures from RUM, and differences in results have consequently been small. In the present study, we address this research gap again by investigating the applicability of models based on quantum theory. These models, which are substantially different from the state-of-the-art choice modelling techniques, emphasise the importance of contextual effects, state dependence, interferences and the impact of choice or question order. As a result, quantum probability models have had some success in better explaining several phenomena in cognitive psychology. In this paper, we consider how best to operationalise quantum probability into a choice model. Additionally, we test the quantum model frameworks on a best/worst route choice dataset and demonstrate that they find useful transformations to capture differences between the attributes important in a most favoured alternative compared to that of the least favoured alternative. Similar transformations can also be used to efficiently capture contextual effects in a dataset where the order of the attributes and alternatives are manipulated. Overall, it appears that models incorporating quantum concepts hold significant promise in improving the state-of-the-art travel choice modelling paradigm through their adaptability and efficient modelling of contextual changes.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated strategic and operational planning of dry port container networks in a stochastic environment,10.1016/j.trb.2020.06.002,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This paper proposes a dry port network design model that integrates strategic and operational decision taking into account the stochastic nature of demand.

This problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model where the dynamic decisions relating to containers’ transportation and inventory are integrated with decisions that determine the number and location-allocation of dry ports in an uncertain environment. For solving this problem, a robust sample average approximation method enhanced with Benders decomposition algorithm which is accelerated by multi-cut framework, knapsack inequalities, and Pareto-optimal cut scheme is proposed. The model was tested using a hypothetical case relating to the design of a hinterland container shipping network in North Carolina, USA, that comprises a seaport and fifty manufacturing companies. The quality of solutions obtained was evaluated through extensive numerical experiments.

Machine learning-driven algorithms for the container relocation problem,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.017,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The container relocation problem is one of important issues in seaport terminals which could bring a significant saving on the operating cost even with a slight improvement due to the huge number of containers processed across the world each year. Given a specific layout and container retrieval priorities, the container relocation problem aims to find the optimal movement sequence to minimize the total number of container relocation operations. In this paper, we propose novel machine learning-driven algorithms, which integrate optimization methods and machine learning techniques, to solve the problem. More specifically, we propose a new upper bound method called MLUB that incorporates branch pruners. These pruners are derived from some machine learning techniques through using the optimal solution values of many small-scale instances. The tightened upper bounds generated by MLUB are used subsequently both in the exact branch-and-bound algorithm called IB&B and the hybrid beam search heuristic called MLBS. Moreover, we also provide a tighter lower bound for the problem by additionally considering the interaction between consecutive target containers. Based on the benchmark data published recently in the literature, extensive experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Public transport trajectory planning with probabilistic guarantees,10.1016/j.trb.2020.06.005,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The paper proposes an eco-cruise control strategy for urban public transport buses. The aim of the velocity control is ensuring timetable adherence, while considering upstream queue lengths at traffic lights in a probabilistic way. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, the shockwave profile model (SPM) is extended to capture the stochastic nature of traffic queue lengths. The model is adequate to describe frequent traffic state interruptions at signalized intersections. Based on the distribution function of stochastic traffic volume demand, the randomness in queue length, wave fronts, and vehicle numbers are derived. Then, an outlook is provided on its applicability as a full-scale urban traffic network model. Second, a shrinking horizon model predictive controller (MPC) is proposed for ensuring timetable reliability. The intention is to calculate optimal velocity commands based on the current position and desired arrival time of the bus while considering upcoming delays due to red signals and eventual queues. The above proposed stochastic traffic model is incorporated in a rolling horizon optimization via chance-constraining. In the optimization, probabilistic guarantees are formulated to minimize delay due to standstill in queues at signalized intersections. Optimization results are analyzed from two particular aspects, (i) feasibility and (ii) closed-loop performance point of views. The novel stochastic profile model is tested in a high fidelity traffic simulator context. Comparative simulation results show the viability and importance of stochastic bounds in urban trajectory design. The proposed algorithm yields smoother bus trajectories at an urban corridor, suggesting energy savings compared to benchmark control strategies.",0191-2615,Not found

A main focus is on the one hand on the (dis-)connecting processes between cars and locomotives and on the other hand on combining two or more locomotives, i.e., the process of building and busting consists (combination of locomotives). Furthermore, regional limitations for running certain types of locomotives and technical conditions for combining locomotives are taken into account. A generalized solution framework is developed that allows a gradual restricting of the solution space and enables an analysis and comparison of different solution procedures. Testing these for a real-world network as well as several newly generated instances shows that the framework outperforms previous approaches in the literature.

We formulate it as an integration of Multi-Depot Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problem (MDMTVRP) and Paired Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window (PPDPTW). To solve the mixed problem of MDMTVRP and PPDPTW, we present its Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model to obtain the optimal solution for small-scale instances.

Travel cost budget based user equilibrium in a bottleneck model with stochastic capacity,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.002,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This paper studies a bottleneck model in which the capacity of the bottleneck is constant within a day but changes stochastically from day-to-day between a designed value (good condition) and a degraded one (bad condition). The study relates the travel cost variability due to stochastic capacity with commuters' departure time choice behaviors. We postulate that commuters acquire the variability of travel cost based on past experiences and factor such variability into their departure time choice consideration by minimizing their travel cost budget (TCB), defined as a weighted average of mean travel cost and standard deviation of travel cost. We show that the consideration of TCB yields seven possible equilibrium patterns. Closed form solutions to all possible equilibrium patterns and their corresponding parameter ranges are derived. The rationality of the patterns has been investigated. Dependence of travel cost and the duration of peak hours on the commuters' risk attitude has also been derived in each equilibrium pattern.

An actor-critic deep reinforcement learning approach for metro train scheduling with rolling stock circulation under stochastic demand,10.1016/j.trb.2020.08.005,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This paper presents a novel actor-critic deep reinforcement learning approach for metro train scheduling with circulation of limited rolling stock. The scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov decision process driven by stochastic passenger demand. As in most dynamic optimization problems, the complexity of the scheduling process grows exponentially with the amount of states, decisions, and uncertainties involved. This study aims to address this ‘curses of dimensionality’ issue by adopting an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning solution framework. The framework simplifies the evaluation and searching process for potential optimal solutions by parameterizing the original state and decision spaces with the use of artificial neural networks. A deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is developed for training the artificial neural networks via simulated system transitions before the actor-critic agent can be applied for online schedule control. The proposed approach is tested with a real-world scenario configured with data collected from the Victoria Line of London Underground, UK.

Estimation of a recursive link-based logit model and link flows in a sensor equipped network,10.1016/j.trb.2020.08.003,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This paper describes a method to estimate the parameters of a Recursive link-based Logit model (RL) using measurements of a set of spatially fixed proximity sensors, with limited hit rates, which can uniquely identify people, such as Wi-Fi-, RFID- or Bluetooth-sensors. The observed ‘route’ of an individual, where we focus on pedestrians in an urban or event context, is modelled as the sequence of sensors that have identified the individual during his or her trip. Obviously, these ‘routes’ contain large gaps, which makes traditional estimation techniques not applicable. Although we do not exactly know what happens within these gaps, we do have some specific insight about the individuals behavior between two identifications; we know with a certain probability which is related to the hit rate of the sensors, that the individual did not cross another sensor location between the two identifications. This paper therefore describes a method to estimate the parameters of an RL model that specifically exploits this knowledge. The framework also allows us to formulate a probabilistic link utilization estimation method, which can be used to estimate link flows in a network based on the sensor observations. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated in simulation using an artificial network, after which the methodology is tested on a real data set, collected at a Dutch music event.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated timetable rescheduling and passenger reassignment during railway disruptions,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.001,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"During railway disruptions, most passengers may not be able to find preferred alternative train services due to the current way of handling disruptions that does not take passenger responses into account. To offer better alternatives to passengers, this paper proposes a novel passenger-oriented timetable rescheduling model, which integrates timetable rescheduling and passenger reassignment into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model with the objective of minimizing generalized travel times: in-vehicle times, waiting times at origin/transfer stations and the number of transfers. The model applies the dispatching measures of re-timing, re-ordering, cancelling, flexible stopping and flexible short-turning trains, handles rolling stock circulations at both short-turning and terminal stations of trains, and takes station capacity into account. To solve the model efficiently, an Adapted Fix-and-Optimize (AFaO) algorithm is developed. Numerical experiments were carried out to a part of the Dutch railways. The results show that the proposed passenger-oriented timetable rescheduling model is able to shorten generalized travel times significantly compared to an operator-oriented timetable rescheduling model that does not consider passenger responses. By allowing only 10 min more train delay than an optimal operator-oriented rescheduling solution, the passenger-oriented model is able to shorten the generalized travel times over all passengers by thousands of minutes in all considered disruption scenarios. With a passenger-oriented rescheduled timetable, more passengers continue their train travels after a disruption started, compared to a rescheduled timetable from the operator-oriented model. The AFaO algorithm obtains high-quality solutions to the passenger-oriented model in up to 300 s.",0191-2615,Not found

A time-slot based signal scheme model for fixed-time control at isolated intersections,10.1016/j.trb.2020.08.004,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Fixed-time signal control is widely used in the real world due to its low cost of implementation. Repeated signal cycles with the same phase structure are applied in the existing fixed-time signal control schemes. However, such signal schemes do not always achieve the best performance, especially when traffic demand is unbalanced. The inclusion of sub-cycles in one cycle provides a potential solution in this situation. This study proposes a time-slot based signal scheme model with a generalized cycle structure for fixed-time signal control at isolated intersections. The proposed signal scheme can generate sub-cycles with different phase structures. It optimizes the number of sub-cycles in one cycle as well as the phase sequence, cycle length, and green splits in each sub-cycle. Certain phases may be skipped in partial sub-cycles. Nonlinear programming models are formulated to minimize average vehicle delay and maximize intersection capacity for under- and over-saturated demand. Solution algorithms for the two nonlinear models are developed by solving a series of mixed-integer-quadratic-programming (MIQP) models and mixed-integer-linear-programming (MILP) models, respectively. The numerical studies validate the advantages of proposed signal scheme in terms of intersection capacity and average vehicle delay. The sensitivity analyses show that: 1) a long maximum green time can enable the conventional dual-ring, eight-phase structure to handle unbalanced demand from the perspective of intersection capacity; 2) the time-slot number of 6 or 7 is suggested considering both the solution optimality and the model complexity.",0191-2615,Not found

The lower-level captures travelers’ activity-travel scheduling behavior by an extended dynamic user equilibrium model and the upper-level determines the hub locations, fleet size, and initial distribution of SAVs.

The electric vehicle routing problem with time windows and synchronised mobile battery swapping,10.1016/j.trb.2020.06.012,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This paper introduces an alternative to intra-route recharging of Electric Commercial Vehicles (ECVs) used for freight distribution by exploiting new pertinent technological developments that make mobile battery swapping possible. The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Synchronised Mobile Battery Swapping (EVRPTW-SMBS) is introduced in which route planning is carried out in two interdependent levels: (i) for the ECVs to deliver customers’ demands, and (ii) for the Battery Swapping Vans (BSVs) to swap the depleted battery on an ECV with a fully charged one at a designated time and space. Each BSV route can provide the battery swapping service to multiple ECVs, and each ECV can extend its autonomy by requesting the battery swapping service for as many times as required with no need to divert from its original delivery route. The EVRPTW-SMBS opens up multiple opportunities to facilitate eco-friendly goods distribution using ECVs and brings in extra flexibility and cost savings. At the same time, it is a challenging problem to tackle mainly due to the interdependence problem that stems from the spatio-temporal synchronisation requirement between the vehicles in the two levels (i.e. ECVs and BSVs). To tackle these complications, the paper proposes a methodology for exact evaluation of an EVRPTW-SMBS solution based on a two-stage hybridisation of a dynamic programming and an integer programming algorithm, and places the resulting procedure at the heart of an intensified large neighbourhood search algorithm to solve instances of the EVRPTW-SMBS efficiently. A library of EVRPTW-SMBS test instances is developed and used to demonstrate the added value of the proposed problem variant and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

Stable dynamic pricing scheme independent of lane-choice models for high-occupancy-toll lanes,10.1016/j.trb.2020.07.008,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"A stable dynamic pricing scheme is essential to guarantee the desired performance of high-occupancy-toll (HOT) lanes, where single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs) can pay a price to use the HOT lanes. But existing methods apply to either only one type of lane-choice models with unknown parameters or different types of lane-choice models but with known parameters. In this study we present a new dynamic pricing scheme that is stable and applies to different types of lane-choice models with unknown parameters. There are two operational objectives for operating HOT lanes: (i) to maintain the free-flow condition to guarantee the travel time reliability; and (ii) to maximize the HOT lanes’ throughput to minimize the system’s total delay. The traffic dynamics on both HOT and general purpose (GP) lanes are described by point queue models, where the queueing times are determined by the demands and capacities. We consider three types of lane-choice models: the multinomial logit model when SOVs share the same value of time, the vehicle-based user equilibrium model when SOVs’ values of time are heterogeneous and follow a distribution, and a general lane-choice model. We demonstrate that the second objective is approximately equivalent to the social welfare optimization principle for the logit model. Observing that the dynamic price and the excess queueing time on the GP lanes are linearly correlated in all the lane-choice models, we propose a feedback control method to determine the dynamic prices based on two integral controllers. We further present a method to estimate the parameters of a lane-choice model once its type is known. Analytically we prove that the equilibrium state of the closed-loop system with constant demand patterns is ideal, since the two objectives are achieved in it, and that it is asymptotically stable. With numerical examples we verify the effectiveness of the solution method.",0191-2615,Not found
A generic multi-scale framework for microscopic traffic simulation part II – Anticipation Reliance as compensation mechanism for potential task overload,10.1016/j.trb.2020.07.011,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The inclusion of human factors (HF) in mathematical models is proving crucial to allow complex driving behaviour and interactions to be explicitly considered to capture driving phenomena. An important area where such integration is required is for the role of anticipation by drivers to compensate for critical traffic situations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Anticipation Reliance (AR), which acts as a demand lowering compensative effect for the driving task by relying more on anticipation. We implement AR in a generic multi-scale microscopic traffic modelling and simulation framework to explore and explain the effects of HF on traffic operations and safety in critical traffic situations. This concept addresses a disparity in the description of driver workload in relation to the execution of driving tasks in regard to the confidence that drivers place on tasks that are sub-consciously catered for. The crossover from HF to a mathematical description of this role of AR introduces a ground-breaking concept that explains and models the mechanisms that allow drivers to compensate and avoid accidents in many circumstances, even when driving errors or sub-optimal driving performance occurs. By and large, the HF effects can be subdivided in effects on perception and anticipation; effects on sensitivity and response to stimuli; and effects on personal attributes and characteristics. A key aspect of the framework are two intertwined driver-specific mental state variables—total workload and awareness—that bridge between classic collision-free idealized models for lane changing and car following, and HF models that explain under which conditions the performance of drivers deteriorates in terms of reaction time, sensitivity to stimuli or other parameters. In this paper, we focus on the awareness construct, as described by AR, and explore the effects. We prove the effectiveness of the approach with a case example that demonstrates the ability of the model to dissect a complex traffic situation with both longitudinal and lateral driving tasks, while endogenously considering human factors and that produces accident avoidance and occurrence within the same order of magnitude compared to real traffic accident statistics.",0191-2615,Not found

To cope with customer demand fluctuations and improve service level, BSRP aims to identify the optimal vehicle routes to visit bike-sharing stations in order to balance their inventories, picking up excess bikes from surplus stations and adding needed bikes to insufficient stations, with the objective of minimizing total traveling cost and inventory cost. The mathematical model of the studied problem is first given, detailing the considerations of multiple depots available for re-positioning vehicles and the extra objective of inventory cost minimization. An effective clustering strategy is then proposed to put bike-sharing stations into self-sufficient groups, which is shown to be able to greatly decompose the problem complexity for large-scale instances. A destroy-and-repair algorithm is developed to improve the clusters, and an adaptive variable neighborhood search algorithm is designed to conduct intra-cluster and inter-cluster vehicle routing optimization. Performance of the hybrid algorithm is validated on three sets of benchmark instances, and compared with CPLEX as well as state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature, which demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive in solving BSRPs.",0191-2615,Not found
Locally optimal routes for route choice sets,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.007,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Route choice is often modelled as a two-step procedure in which travellers choose their routes from small sets of promising candidates. Many methods developed to identify such choice sets rely on assumptions about the mechanisms behind the route choice and require corresponding data sets. Furthermore, existing approaches often involve considerable complexity or perform many repeated shortest path queries. This makes it difficult to apply these methods in comprehensive models with numerous origin-destination pairs. In this paper, we address these issues by developing an algorithm that efficiently identifies locally optimal routes. Such paths arise from travellers acting rationally on local scales, whereas unknown factors may affect the routes on larger scales. Though methods identifying locally optimal routes are available already, these algorithms rely on approximations and return only few, heuristically chosen paths for specific origin-destination pairs. This conflicts with the demands of route choice models, where an exhaustive search for many origins and destinations would be necessary. We therefore extend existing algorithms to return (almost) all admissible paths between a large number of origin-destination pairs. We test our algorithm and its applicability in route choice models on the road network of the Canadian province British Columbia and empirical data collected in this province.",0191-2615,Not found
Emergency vehicle lane pre-clearing: From microscopic cooperation to routing decision making,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.011,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Emergency vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in providing timely help for the general public in saving lives and avoiding property loss. However, very few efforts have been made for EV prioritization on normal road segments, such as the road section between intersections or highways between ramps. In this paper, we propose an EV lane pre-clearing strategy to prioritize EVs on such roads through cooperative driving with surrounding connected vehicles (CVs). The cooperative driving problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem aiming at (i) guaranteeing the desired speed of EVs, and (ii) minimizing the disturbances on CVs. To tackle this NP-hard MINP problem, we formulate the model in a bi-level optimization manner to address these two objectives, respectively. In the lower-level problem, CVs in front of the emergency vehicle will be divided into several blocks. For each block, we developed an EV sorting algorithm to design optimal merging trajectories for CVs. With resultant sorting trajectories, a constrained optimization problem is solved in the upper-level to determine the initiation time/distance to conduct the sorting trajectories. Case studies show that with the proposed algorithm, emergency vehicles are able to drive at a desired speed while minimizing disturbances on normal traffic flows. We further reveal a linear relationship between the optimal solution and road density, which could help to improve EV routing decision makings when high-resolution data is not available.",0191-2615,Not found
A multiple discrete extreme value choice model with grouped consumption data and unobserved budgets,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.008,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a closed-form multiple discrete-grouped extreme value model that accommodates grouped observations on consumptions rather than continuous consumptions. For example, in a time-use context, respondents tend to report their activity durations in bins of time (for example, 15-minute intervals or 30-minute intervals, depending on the duration of an activity). Or when reporting annual mileages driven for each vehicle owned by a household, it is unlikely that households will be able to provide an accurate continuous mileage value, and so it is not uncommon to solicit mileages in grouped categories such as 0–4,999 miles, 5000–9,999 miles, 10,000–14,999 miles, and so on. Similarly, when reporting expenditures on different types of commodities/services, individuals may round up or down to a convenient dollar value of multiples of 10 or 100 (depending on the length of time in which expenditures are sought). In some other cases, a product itself may be available only in specific package sizes (such as say, instant coffee, which is typically packaged in fixed sizes). In this paper, we use the so-called linear outside good utility MDCEV structure of Bhat (2018) to show how the model can be used for grouped consumption observations. Of course, this is also possible because the linear outside good utility does not need a continuous budget value, and allows for unobserved budgets. We discuss an important identification issue associated with this linear outside good utility model, and proceed to demonstrate applications of the proposed model to the case of weekend time-use choices of individuals and vehicle type/use choices of households.",0191-2615,Not found

The flexible policy allows the terminal operators to determine the container retrieval sequence to some extent, which provides more opportunity for reducing the number of relocations and the truck waiting times. A more general probabilistic model that captures customers’ arrival preference is presented to describe the randomness for external truck arrivals within their appointed time windows. Being a multi-stage stochastic sequential decision-making problem, it is first formulated into a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model to minimize the expected number of relocations. Then, the SDP model is extended considering a secondary objective representing the truck waiting times. Tree search-based algorithms are adapted to solve the two models to their optimality. Heuristic algorithms are designed to seek high-quality solutions efficiently for larger problems. A discrete-event simulation model is developed to evaluate the optimal solutions and the heuristic solutions respectively on two performance metrics.

Dynamic discretization discovery for the service network design problem with mixed autonomous fleets,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.009,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"We consider a service network design problem for the tactical planning of parcel delivery in a city logistics setting. A logistics service provider seeks a repeatable plan to transport commodities from distribution centers on the periphery to inner-city satellites. In a heterogeneous infrastructure, autonomous vehicles in level 4 may only drive in feasible streets but need to be pulled elsewhere by manually operated vehicles in platoons. We formulate an integer program to determine the fleet mix, schedule transportation services, and decide on the routing or outsourcing of commodities. Platooning requires a high level of synchronization between vehicles which demands the time-expanded networks to contain narrow time intervals. Thus, we develop an algorithm based on the dynamic discretization discovery scheme which refines partially time-expanded networks iteratively without having to enumerate the fully time-expanded network a priori. We introduce valid inequalities and provide two enhanced versions of the algorithm that exploit linear relaxations of the problem. Further, we propose heuristic ideas to speed up the search for high-quality solutions. In a computational study, we analyze the efficacy of the algorithm in different versions and observe improvements of computational performance in comparison to a commercial solver. Finally, we solve a case study on a real-world based network to obtain insights into the deployment of a mixed autonomous fleet in an existing heterogeneous infrastructure.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal assignment for the single-household shared autonomous vehicle problem,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.003,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform the way people are transported. While driverless technology may mean fewer vehicles are required to transport people to and from their daily activities, such changes may result in increased congestion or total miles traveled. In this study, we solve the single-household shared autonomous vehicle problem to identify cost-optimal routings of vehicles throughout the day. Such a tool will be useful for consumers seeking to minimize cost and for regulators seeking to understand and predict how people may behave in different scenarios. We provide a thorough literature review and construct a mixed-integer linear program to minimize the daily travel cost of a household attending a given set of activities. Since solution time is a determinant for applicability of such a model, we present the model in a component-wise fashion. This approach allows us to understand which features most affect the problem complexity and solution time. We note that modeling carpooling is the feature that most increases time to find an optimal solution, and we therefore propose a novel modeling technique for carpooling two people. We illustrate the performance of our model by comparing it with other models from the literature and note that our model can solve significantly larger problem instances and in a time that is short enough to facilitate real-time scheduling. We also highlight the utility of our model for regulators, who can use it to analyze quickly produced optimal routes under different cost/tax scenarios.",0191-2615,Not found
Decomposition and distributed optimization of real-time traffic management for large-scale railway networks,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.004,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper introduces decomposition and distributed optimization approaches for the real-time railway traffic management problem considering microscopic infrastructure characteristics, aiming at an improved computational efficiency when tackling large-scale railway networks. Based on the nature of the railway traffic management problem, we consider three decomposition methods, namely a geography-based (GEO) decomposition, a train-based (TRA) decomposition, and a time-interval-based (TIN) decomposition, in order to partition the large railway traffic management optimization problem into several subproblems. In particular, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is developed to generate the optimal GEO solution, with the objectives of minimizing the number of interconnections among regions and of balancing the size of regions. The decomposition creates couplings among the subproblems, in terms of either capacity usage or transit time consistency; therefore the whole problem gets a non-separable structure. To handle the couplings, we introduce three distributed optimization approaches, namely an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, a priority-rule-based (PR) algorithm, and a Cooperative Distributed Robust Safe But Knowledgeable (CDRSBK) algorithm, which operate iteratively. We test all combinations of the three decomposition methods and the three distributed optimization algorithms on a large-scale railway network in the South-East of the Netherlands, in terms of feasibility, computational efficiency, and optimality. Overall the CDRSBK algorithm with the TRA decomposition performs best, where high-quality (optimal or near-optimal) solutions can be found within 10 s of computation time.",0191-2615,Not found
Queue profile estimation at a signalized intersection by exploiting the spatiotemporal propagation of shockwaves,10.1016/j.trb.2020.08.009,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Queues at signalized intersections bring interruptions to the smooth movement of vehicles and slow down the traffic in urban road networks. Although queue length estimation has attracted much attention in the literature, recent studies indicate increasing interest in queue profile estimation, which is crucial to many extensive analysis. In this research, we propose an innovative approach to estimating the queue profile at a signalized intersection by exploiting the spatiotemporal propagation of shockwaves. The input to our model includes locations and speeds of probe vehicles on a signalized link and the starting time of red in signal cycles. The model then outputs the corresponding queue profile. We first classify data points of probe vehicles into moving and stopped states. We then develop an integer programming model with a set of novel constraints to estimate the queue profile, which conforms to the spatiotemporal propagation of shockwaves. Unlike existing studies that use triangles or polygons to approximate queue profiles, our model allows us to detect queue profiles of any shape. Our model can also categorize cycles into different types and utilize data in cycles of the same type, which helps to construct the queue profile. We validate our model using both simulated and real data. Results show that our model is capable of producing satisfactory results even when the penetration rate is as low as 10–20% and the sampling interval is as high as 20–30 seconds.",0191-2615,Not found
The heterogeneous multicrew scheduling and routing problem in road restoration,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.002,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper introduces the heterogeneous multicrew scheduling and routing problem (MCSRP) in road restoration. The MCSRP consists of identifying the schedule and route of heterogeneous crews that must perform the restoration of damaged nodes used in the paths to connect a source node to demand nodes in a network affected by extreme events. The objective is to minimize the accessibility time defined as the time that the demand nodes remain unconnected from the source node. The main contributions of the paper include three novel mathematical formulations that differ in the way of modeling the scheduling decisions and the synchronization of the crews, and the development of valid inequalities based on some particular properties of the problem. Additionally, we prove that the MCSRP is NP-hard. Extensive numerical experiments with randomly generated instances and a case study based on floods and landslides disasters in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are performed to assess the efficiency and applicability of our approach. In particular, we show that the valid inequalities significantly improve the solvability of the mathematical models.

Taxi-hailing platforms: Inform or Assign drivers?,10.1016/j.trb.2020.10.001,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Online platforms for matching supply and demand, as part of the sharing economy, are becoming increasingly important in practice and have seen a steep increase in academic interest. Especially in the taxi/travel industry, platforms such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing have become major players. Some of these platforms, including Didi Chuxing, operate two matching systems: Inform, where multiple drivers receive ride details and the first to respond is selected; and Assign, where the platform assigns the driver nearest to the customer. The Inform system allows drivers to select their destinations, but the Assign system minimizes driver-customer distances. This research is the first to explore: (i) how a platform should allocate customer requests to the two systems and set the maximum matching radius (i.e., customer-driver distance), with the objective to minimize the overall average waiting times for customers; and (ii) how taxi drivers select a system, depending on their varying degrees of preference for certain destinations. Using approximate queuing analysis, we derive the optimal decisions for the platform and drivers. These are applied to real-world data from Didi Chuxing, revealing the following managerial insights. The optimal radius is 1-3 kilometers, and is lower during rush hour. For most considered settings, it is optimal to allocate relatively few rides to the Inform system. Most interestingly, if destination selection becomes more important to the average driver, then the platform should not always allocate more requests to the Inform system. Although this may seem counter-intuitive, allocating too many orders to that system would result in many drivers opting for it, leading to very high waiting times in the Assign system.",0191-2615,Not found
On ride-pooling and traffic congestion,10.1016/j.trb.2020.10.003,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Ridesourcing platforms, such as Uber, Lyft and Didi, are now launching commercial on-demand ride-pooling programs that enable their affiliated drivers to serve two or more passengers in one ride. It is generally expected that successful designs of ride-pooling programs can reduce the required vehicle fleet size, and achieve various societally beneficial objectives, such as alleviating traffic congestion. The reduction in traffic congestion can in turn save travel time for both ridesourcing passengers and normal private car users. However, it is still unclear to what extent the implementation of ride-pooling affects traffic congestion and riders’ travel time. To this end, this paper establishes a model to describe the ridesourcing markets with congestion effects, which are explicitly characterized by a macroscopic fundamental diagram. We compare the time cost (sum of travel time and waiting time) of ridesourcing passengers and normal private car users (background traffic) in the ridesourcing markets without ride-pooling (each vehicle serves one passenger) and with ride-pooling (each vehicle serves one or more passengers). It is found that, a win-win situation can be achieved under some scenarios such that the implementation of on-demand ride-pooling reduces the time cost for both ridesourcing passengers and private car users. Furthermore, we find that the matching window is a key decision variable the platform leverages to affect the stationary equilibrium state. As the matching window increases, passengers are expected to wait for longer time, but the pool-matching probability (the proportion of passengers who are pool-matched) increases, which further alleviates traffic congestion and in turn reduces passengers’ travel time. It is interesting to find that, there is a globally optimal matching window for achieving the minimum time cost for ridesourcing passengers in the normal flow regime.",0191-2615,Not found
A simulation optimization method for deep-sea vessel berth planning and feeder arrival scheduling at a container port,10.1016/j.trb.2020.10.007,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Vessels served by a container port can usually be classified into two types: deep-sea vessels and feeders. While the arrival times and service times of deep-sea vessels are known to the port operator when berth plans are being devised, the service times of feeders are usually uncertain due to lack of data interchange between the port operator and the feeder operators. The uncertainty of feeder service times can incur long waiting lines and severe port congestion if the service plans for deep-sea vessels and feeders are poorly devised. This paper studies the problem of how to allocate berths to deep-sea vessels and schedule arrivals of feeders for congestion mitigation at a container port where the number of feeders to be served is significantly larger than the number of deep-sea vessels, and where the service times of feeders are uncertain. We develop a stochastic optimization model that determines the berth plans of deep-sea vessels and arrival schedules of feeders, so as to minimize the departure delays of deep-sea vessels and schedule displacements of feeders. The model controls port congestion through restricting the expected queue length of feeders. We develop a three-phase simulation optimization method to solve this problem. Our method comprises a global phase, a local phase, and a clean-up phase, where the simulation budget is wisely allocated to the solutions explored in different phases so that a locally optimal solution can be identified with a reasonable amount of computation effort.

We clarify that the locally optimal pricing rules include a significant component resulting from the incentive to exploit the foreign airline, which is not included in the optimal pricing rules set by a social/global welfare-maximizing authority. We evaluate the pricing rules of the two airport charges for a round trip (i.e., the sum of each airport's per-departing-passenger charge). We clarify that the incentive to exploit the foreign airline is, theoretically, the only source of deviation from global welfare maximization (which may reach the first-best outcome) regardless of the uniform or discriminatory charges’ pricing regimes. Furthermore, we show that each airport's runway capacity investment could be globally efficient under globally optimal pricing rules, whereas each airport tends to overinvest under locally optimal pricing rules.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimization of demand-oriented train timetables under overtaking operations: A surrogate-dual-variable column generation for eliminating indivisibility,10.1016/j.trb.2020.09.010,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"This paper aims to optimize demand-oriented train timetables under overtaking operations for a high-speed rail corridor. With the application of the constructed space-time network representation, the timetabling and skip-stopping decisions in response to passenger demand for heterogeneous train traffic are formulated into an integer linear programming model. Specifically, we carefully assign the hour-dependent origin-to-destination demand to the skip-stop-flexible timetable by using a group of tailored constraints that bind the origin station and destination station together. While solving the proposed model under the column-generation-based framework, the biggest barrier is that the pricing subproblem cannot be successfully solved through the standard dynamic programming algorithm, because the dual price from the demand constraint is dependent upon two coupled stations. To dynamically eliminate the indivisibility attached to the demand-oriented timetabling problem, we propose a novel approach to replace the two-station-dependent dual variable with its single-station-dependent surrogate counterpart.

Adjacent lane dependencies modulating wave velocity on congested freeways-An empirical study,10.1016/j.trb.2020.10.005,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Much of traffic flow theory and highway design is based upon the fundamental relationship, FR, between speed, flow, and density. Traditionally, the FR is assumed to be a static curve over time and space. This paper presents new empirical findings that show the FR in one lane of a freeway can actually change shape in a rapid and systematic response to conditions in the adjacent lanes. This paper demonstrates the dependencies for a general purpose freeway lane that is operating in the congested regime. The drivers become more conservative in response to slower speeds in either adjacent lane, conversely, they become less conservative in response to higher speeds in either adjacent lane. It is also shown that as drivers become more conservative the signals and waves move upstream slower. So this inter-lane dependency has a direct impact on how fast signals propagate through the traffic stream. For the study site the empirical relationship between the wave speed and relative speed is close to linear. This interdependence between lanes is an important factor that it is absent from most traffic flow and car following models. Given these findings the discussion explores hypothetical examples showing how the inter-lane dependencies can give rise to mechanisms for waves in adjacent lanes to synchronize, as well as a mechanism for a queue spreading from one lane to another without any lane change maneuvers.

The first approach predicts the number of deficiencies in each deficiency category for each ship and then develops an integer optimization model that assigns the inspectors to the ships to be inspected. The second approach predicts the number of deficiencies each inspector can identify for each ship and then applies an integer optimization model to assign the inspectors to the ships to be inspected. The third approach is a semi-“smart predict then optimize” (semi-SPO) method. It also predicts the number of deficiencies each inspector can identify for each ship and uses the same integer optimization model as the second approach, however, instead of minimizing the mean squared error as in the second approach, it adopts a loss function motivated by the structure of the optimization problem in the second approach.

Combining multiple imputation and control function methods to deal with missing data and endogeneity in discrete-choice models,10.1016/j.trb.2020.10.002,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"While collecting data for estimating discrete-choice models, researchers often encounter missing information in observations.

The problems of missing information and endogeneity may occur in the same variable in the data, if, e.g., partially missing price information is correlated with another omitted variable. Extant approaches to correct for endogeneity in discrete choice models, such as the control function method, do not address the problem when the error term is correlated with a variable having missing information. Likewise, approaches to address missing information, such as the multiple imputation method, cannot handle endogeneity problems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm by combining the methods of multiple imputation and the control function.

The relationship between car following string instability and traffic oscillations in finite-sized platoons and its use in easing congestion via connected and automated vehicles with IDM based controller,10.1016/j.trb.2020.10.004,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"This paper focuses on two fundamental issues in traffic flow modelling: string stability of car following (CF), and oscillation of traffic flow. Its aim is to explore the complementary use of CF instability analysis and oscillation analysis to compress and ease traffic congestion in a connected environment. Each of these topics has been extensively investigated in the literature. However, each topic has been investigated separately and, despite the inherent conceptual and empirical closeness of the two concepts, little effort has been devoted to untangling their relationship. To address this failing, we first define four types of oscillation – amplitude-decay oscillation, amplitude-ceiling oscillation, speed-deviation ceiling oscillation, and speed-deviation growth oscillation – and reveal their similarities and dissimilarities to CF instability. Based on the stability criterion, we then develop oscillation criteria to identify different types of oscillation by relaxing two unrealistic assumptions used in CF stability analysis (i.e., infinitely-long platoon and long-wavelength perturbation). Finally, to demonstrate how CF instability analysis and oscillation analysis can be combined to influence individual vehicle stability and improve traffic oscillations in a connected environment, a platoon of vehicles that experience an oscillation in the NGSIM data is used in a case study. In this case study, different control factors are used for different vehicle types: connected (but human-driven) vehicles, and automated vehicles. Our analysis shows that a higher stability of some individual vehicles can alleviate the oscillation severity for the platoon. It also shows that desired time gap and maximum acceleration are two promising parameters that can be used to both improve individual vehicle stability and significantly smooth the oscillation of the platoon in a connected and/or automated environment. Of particular note, when considering all of the factors explored in our analysis, adjustment of the desired time gap is the most effective factor in smoothing traffic oscillations.",0191-2615,Not found

Then we develop a two-fleet strategy (with different vehicle sizes) where one fleet operates the whole day and the other during the peak period only. This strategy includes holding during the peak (in order to avoid bunching) by imposing equal cycle times for both fleets. The two-fleet operation has slightly lower total costs than one-fleet, but exhibits very different effects on users’ and on operators’ costs across periods. A sensitivity analysis reveals the role played by various elements and shows that results are robust.

Two deadlock situations resulting from blocked routes are analyzed in detail.

Furthermore, an indicator called the attraction degree is presented to quantify the preferred degree of each location for storing different groups of cars. A hierarchical two-stage exchange strategy (HTSES) is designed to obtain the car layout with the minimum total dispersion degree. To reduce the scale of the solved problem, a rolling-horizon heuristic approach based on closed-loop (positive and negative) feedback is proposed. Positive feedback based on the guidance mechanism describes the guidance provided by the existing car layout to arriving cars, while negative feedback based on the reformulation mechanism represents the influence of arriving cars on the car layout. A series of numerical experiments show that the proposed method can effectively produce a satisfactory car assignment plan for the management of automotive Ro-Ro terminals.",0191-2615,Not found
The impact of autonomous vehicles on commute ridesharing with uncertain work end time,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.002,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The uncertainty in work end time can prevent ridesharing between two commuters with identical home and work locations. This effect can be alleviated by autonomous vehicles (AV): when two commuters share a ride from home to work, if the realized work end times result in a long wait between the two, an additional AV can be easily repositioned from home to work, whereas with regular human-driven vehicles one has to either bear the long wait or request expensive taxi service. This observation implies that AVs have great potential for increasing commute ridesharing. To study this effect, we develop evening commute bottleneck models with uncertain work end time and establish mode choice equilibrium for the round-trip commute. We find that, with regular vehicles, because of the expected waiting cost caused by work end time uncertainty, commuters typically do not share rides even though they have the same home and work locations. With AVs, commuters always share rides for the morning commute, and they also share rides for the evening commute if their work end times turn out to be close; otherwise, they reposition an additional AV to pick one of them up. Our numerical examples show that AVs can encourage commute ridesharing and significantly reduce the expected round-trip travel costs for commuters.",0191-2615,Not found
The Robust Bulk Ship Routing Problem with Batched Cargo Selection,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.003,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Maritime transportation forms the backbone of the world merchandise trade. In this paper, we consider a problem that combines three interconnected subproblems in tramp shipping: the fleet adjustment problem, the cargo selection problem, and the ship routing problem. For cargo selection, we consider the decision behaviors under the setting of Contract of Affreightment (COA), in which cargoes should be rejected or accepted as a batch. In view of the uncertainties observed in maritime transportation, we formulate the problem in a robust way so that the solutions can protect the profitability of shipping companies against variations in voyage costs. We first provide compact mixed integer linear programming formulations for the problem and then convert them into a strengthened set covering model. A tailored branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm is developed to solve the set covering model. The algorithm is enhanced by a multi-cut generation technique aimed at tightening the lower bounds and a primal heuristic aimed at finding high-quality upper bounds.

Car following behavioral stochasticity analysis and modeling: Perspective from wave travel time,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.008,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"This paper analyzes the car following behavioral stochasticity based on two sets of field experimental trajectory data by measuring the wave travel time series τ ˜ n ( t ) of vehicle n. The analysis shows that (i) No matter the speed of leading vehicle oscillates significantly or slightly, τ ˜ n ( t ) might change significantly; (ii) A follower's τ ˜ n ( t ) can vary from run to run even if the leader travels at the same stable speed; (iii) Sometimes, even if the leader's speed fluctuates significantly, the follower can keep a nearly constant value of τ ˜ n ( t ) . The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test indicates that the time series ξ n ( t ) = d τ ˜ n ( t ) / d t follows a mean reversion process, no matter the oscillations fully developed or not. Based on the finding, a simple stochastic Newell model is proposed. The concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations has been derived analytically.

Integrated railway timetable rescheduling and dynamic passenger routing during a complete blockage,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.006,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Trains normally run as scheduled in a non-disrupted situation. However, due to external and/or internal factors, trains may deviate from their original timetable during daily operations. To this end, the involved dispatchers are required to reschedule disrupted trains to efficiently transport delayed passengers to their destinations as soon as possible. In this study, we focus on train rescheduling in a seriously disrupted situation where a track segment is completely blocked for a relatively long period of time, e.g., two hours. In this situation, trains cannot pass the disrupted segment, meaning that passengers will be unable to travel as scheduled. We simultaneously rescheduled trains and passenger routes from both the operator’s and passengers’ perspectives. This integrated train rescheduling and passenger rerouting problem was formulated with an Integer Linear Programming model based on a space-time network. We decomposed the integrated model into two subproblems, a train rescheduling problem and a passenger routing problem, using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Both subproblems could be further decomposed into a series of shortest path problems for trains or passengers, and solved by a dynamic programming algorithm. Finally, we tested our models and algorithms on both a small hypothetical railway network and a part of the Chinese high-speed railway network.",0191-2615,Not found

Temporal-spatial allocation of bottleneck capacity for managing morning commute with carpool,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.007,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Carpooling as one of demand management measures is effective in reducing highway congestion. Recent studies have shown that an appropriate spatial allocation of bottleneck capacity between carpool lane and general-purpose lane can lead to peak-spread of the morning commuters' departure time and reduce the system's total trip cost. What is not clear however is whether temporal allocation of bottleneck capacity can also be effective and if so, what the impact would be, and furthermore what the combined effects of temporal-spatial allocation of bottleneck capacity would be. This paper investigates the impacts of a temporal allocation of bottleneck capacity, when carpool lane is available only within a reserved time window, and a joint temporal-spatial capacity allocation, on morning commute patterns. User equilibrium commute patterns are derived for both the temporal-only and the joint temporal-spatial capacity allocation schemes, along a highway corridor with two driving modes: solo driving and carpooling. The extra costs associated with carpooling are considered alongside of travel time and schedule delay costs. We identify three different cases representing the relative barriers and attractions of carpooling to commuters, and we show that the optimal capacity allocations are sensitive to the accurate estimation of the commuters' extra carpool cost. To assist in evaluating the difference between a non-optimal and the optimal temporal-spatial allocation schemes, we derive analytically the upper bounds on the efficiency loss and present numerical illustrations on how the upper bounds vary with the different operational and behavioral variables.",0191-2615,Not found

However, spatial and temporal mismatches of supply and demand require a relocation of rental cars in order to avoid low degrees of utilization. Here, especially user-based relocation strategies seem to be promising to increase utilization in a cost-efficient manner. However, a thorough optimization-based assessment of user-based relocation strategies for FFCS systems is still missing. In this paper, we introduce an integer program that optimizes the assignment of user-based relocation strategies in FFCS fleets. We develop a graph representation that allows to reformulate the problem as a k-disjoint shortest paths problem and propose an exact algorithm to solve large-size instances. We show that this algorithm can solve real-world instances within a few milliseconds as well as instances with up to 100,000 customers and 10,000 vehicles in a few minutes. Furthermore, we present a case study based on real-world data and derive managerial insights on user-based relocation strategies.

Capturing the interaction between travel time reliability and route choice behavior based on the generalized Bayesian traffic model,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.005,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Travel time reliability plays an important role in travelers’ route choice behaviors. Based on a previously developed generalized Bayesian traffic model, we propose different types of perceived knowledge (i.e., mean-variance-based type, relative gap-based type, and penalty-based type) to model travelers’ daily route choice behavior concerning travel time reliability. We theoretically demonstrate the flexibility of the generalized Bayesian model in capturing various existing UE-based travel behaviors and other non-UE-based travel behaviors (e.g., penalty-based) in stochastic transportation systems. Three major conclusions are obtained. First, the route choice dynamics induced by the Bayesian model with an infinitely long memory and mean-variance-based perceived knowledge will converge to the mean-variance UE condition. Second, the convergence of route choice dynamics to a UE condition is not affected by adding a bounded weight on the daily perceived knowledge. Thirdly, non-UE-based formulations of perceived knowledge also lead to fixed points for the mean route choice proportion. The convergences of the models with different types of perceived knowledge are verified based on numerical studies and the underlying day-to-day route choice dynamics with both recurrent and non-recurrent unreliability are examined.",0191-2615,Not found

A tailored adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is developed for solving the model within a reasonable time. To evaluate the solution quality, a lower bound of the solution of the problem is given by a column generation algorithm that solves a set-partitioning model adapted from the MILP model.

To regulate taxi markets effectively, it is necessary to model such interaction and investigate how different regulatory regimes affect stakeholders in taxi markets (e.g., taxi owners, rentee-drivers, and customers) and system performance (social welfare) in the presence of such an interaction. This study extends the classical aggregate taxi model to describe the supply of rentee-drivers and their interaction with a monopsony taxi owner. A general supply function is proposed to describe the supply of rentee-drivers in the market.

Decomposition methods for large-scale network expansion problems,10.1016/j.trb.2020.12.002,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Network expansion problems are a special class of multi-period network design problems in which arcs can be opened gradually in different time periods but can never be closed. Motivated by practical applications, we focus on cases where demand between origin-destination pairs expands over a discrete time horizon. Arc opening decisions are taken in every period, and once an arc is opened it can be used throughout the remaining horizon to route several commodities. Our model captures a key timing trade-off: the earlier an arc is opened, the more periods it can be used for, but its fixed cost is higher, since it accounts not only for construction but also for maintenance over the remaining horizon. An overview of practical applications indicates that this trade-off is relevant in various settings. For the capacitated variant, we develop an arc-based Lagrange relaxation, combined with local improvement heuristics. For uncapacitated problems, we develop four Benders decomposition formulations and show how taking advantage of the problem structure leads to enhanced algorithmic performance. We then utilize real-world and artificial networks to generate 1080 instances, with which we conduct a computational study. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms. Notably, for uncapacitated problems we are able to solve instances with 2.5 million variables to optimality in less than two hours of computing time.

A branch-and-cut algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with drones,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.011,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Increasing online purchases and higher customer requirements in terms of speed, flexibility, and costs of home deliveries are challenges to every company involved in last mile delivery. Technological advances have paved the way for last mile deliveries by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Yet, the limited range and capacity of UAVs remain a challenge. This makes the possibility of pairing drones with well-established means of transportation highly attractive. However, the optimization problem arising in joint delivery by truck and drone has only recently been considered in the literature. We develop a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) with two different time-oriented objective functions. Additionally, we introduce new valid inequalities based on problem properties to strengthen the linear relaxation. One type of valid inequalities is an extension of the well known subtour elimination constraints. As the number of these constraints grows exponentially with instance size, we provide a separation routine that identifies violated cuts in relaxed solutions to add them efficiently. We therefore derive the first branch-and-cut algorithm for the VRPD. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the competitiveness of our MILP formulation and to show the impact of different combinations of valid inequalities. We optimally solve instances with unrestricted drone ranges with up to 20 nodes and instances with range-limited drones with up to 30 nodes. These are significantly larger instance sizes than the previously known exact approaches are able to handle. In addition, we introduce a relaxation of the VRPD that provides good lower bounds in notable reduced run times. To provide managerial insights, we show that integrating truck-drone tandems into transportation systems can not only lead to improvements regarding the speed of deliveries, but can also be used to reduce the fleet size without slowing down the delivery process and increasing the workload of truck drivers.",0191-2615,Not found
A large neighborhood search approach to the vehicle routing problem with delivery options,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.012,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"To reduce delivery failures in last mile delivery, several types of delivery options have been proposed in the past twenty years. Still, customer satisfaction is a challenge because a single location is chosen independently of the time at which the customer’s order will be delivered. In addition, delivery at shared locations such as lockers and shops also experience failure due to capacity or opening-time issues at the moment of delivery. To address this issue and foster consolidation at shared delivery locations, we investigate the case where a customer can specify several delivery options together with preference levels and time windows. We define, in this article, the Vehicle Routing Problem with Delivery Options, which integrates several types of delivery locations. It consists of designing a set of routes for a fleet of vehicles that deliver to each customer at one of his/her options during the corresponding time window. These routes should respect capacities at shared locations such as lockers and minimum service level requirements, while minimizing the total routing costs. This problem is solved with a large neighborhood search in which a set partitioning problem is periodically used to reassemble routes. Specific ruin and recreate operators are proposed and combined with numerous operators from the literature. A thorough experimental study was carried out to determine a subset of efficient and complementary operators. The proposed method outperforms existing algorithms from the literature on particular cases of the problem under consideration, such as the vehicle routing problem with roaming delivery locations and the vehicle routing problem with home and roaming delivery locations. New instances are generated and used both to serve as a benchmark and to propose some managerial insight into the vehicle routing problem with alternative delivery options.",0191-2615,Not found
On string stability of a mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow: A unifying modelling framework,10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.009,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Urged by a close future perspective of a traffic flow made of a mix of human-driven vehicles and connected, automated vehicles (CAVs), research has recently focused at making the most of CAVs capabilities to mitigate the instability of the whole, i.e. mixed, traffic flow. In all works, however, either the two sub-flows are studied under a simplifying but unrealistic assumption of flow homogeneity, or drivers’ and vehicles heterogeneity is not correctly taken into account within each sub-flow. We show here that the only condition developed so far to study a car-following model string stability for a heterogeneous flow, is inaccurate. Therefore, we propose a methodology to model string stability that considers drivers’ and vehicles heterogeneity, which is the essence of a real traffic. Uncertain transfer functions are introduced to map the probability distributions of car-following model parameters into a L 2 stability measure of a mixed and heterogeneous traffic. Specifically, they allow us to move from the stability analysis of a car-following model, or of a controller, to the stability analysis of a traffic flow, as interpreted by that model, or controller. Eventually, several other theoretical contributions on stability analysis are given in the paper, aiming at reconciling approaches from different fields. Among these, a mathematical justification of the equivalence between the asymptotic stability of a closed-loop platoon system – which has been studied through the famous “traffic wave ansatz” on a ring-road – and the L 2 stability of an open-loop platoon system.",0191-2615,Not found

Other than passengers’ transit route choices, the transit service line choices among congested common lines are also specified in the model formulation. A tri-level programming approach is applied to formulate this problem, wherein the upper-level program optimizes the transit frequency to minimize the total operating costs and passengers’ transit costs; the middle-level program describes passengers’ transit routing choices, in which passengers will select a sequence of transfer nodes to minimize their transit costs; and the lower-level program formulates the equilibrium strategy in the common line problem on the route sections (i.e., between two successive transfer nodes), whose equilibrium solution may have multiple strategies depending on the congestion level of the common lines. The tri-level model is then reformulated into a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. Two solution methods are proposed to solve the problem. One is to transform the model into a mixed-integer linear program so that the global optimal solution of the linearized problem can be guaranteed, and the other employs a surrogate optimization approach to ensure high solution efficiency for large size problems without compromising solution quality.

Full cover charging station location problem with routing,10.1016/j.trb.2020.12.001,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"In this paper, a new full cover modeling framework is developed to design refueling station infrastructure, where the focus is on locating fast-charging stations for battery electric vehicles to enable long-distance transportation. A mathematical model is introduced to determine the optimal locations of these charging stations so that every origin-destination trip on a given transportation network is covered with respect to vehicle range. This full cover model allows deviations from the shortest paths and also determines an optimal route for each trip that requires the minimum total en route recharging. Two variants of this model are proposed: one that minimizes the total cost of locating charging stations and total en route recharging, and another that determines the locations of a predetermined number of stations to minimize the total en route recharging. Computational experiments performed on benchmark data sets validate that the proposed full cover models perform better than the maximum or set cover problem settings in the literature in terms of routing-related measures, such as total trip distance and maximum deviation from the shortest paths.

However, due to the complexities of this phenomenon, accurate and yet simple models of such lane change maneuvers are hard to develop. In this work, we present a macroscopic model for predicting the number of vehicles that perform a bypass at a traffic diverge when taking an exit link. We interpret the bypassing maneuver of vehicles at a traffic diverge as drivers acting selfishly; every vehicle selects lanes such that its own cost of travel is minimized. We discuss how we model the costs that are incurred by the vehicles. Then, taking into account the selfish behavior of vehicles, we model the lane choice of vehicles at a traffic diverge as a Wardrop equilibrium. We state and prove the properties of the equilibrium in our model. We show that there always exists an equilibrium for our model. Moreover, although our model is an instance of nonlinear asymmetrical routing games which in general have multiple equilibria, we prove that the equilibrium of our model is unique under certain assumptions that we observed to hold in all our case studies. We discuss how our model can be calibrated by running a simple optimization problem. Then, using our calibrated model, we validate it through simulation studies and demonstrate that our model successfully predicts the aggregate lane change maneuvers that are performed by vehicles at a traffic diverge. Having shown the predictive power of our model, we discuss how our model can be employed to obtain the optimal lane choice behavior of vehicles, where the social or the overall cost of all vehicles is minimized. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be utilized in scenarios where a central authority can dictate the lane choice and trajectory of certain vehicles, for example autonomous vehicles directed by a central authority, so as to increase the overall vehicle mobility at a traffic diverge. Examples of such scenarios include the case when both human driven and autonomous vehicles coexist in the network.",0191-2615,Not found

Intermodal railway terminals are special components of these systems that allow container traffic to be consolidated from different sources and to be transported by train over long distances. This paper addresses a practical problem faced by a major North American railway. On a daily basis, terminal operators must make several decisions such as how inbound trains are split into sequences of railcars, on which tracks these railcars are parked for loading and off-loading operations, and how the railcars are assigned to outbound blocks so as to fulfill the demand of each block. We introduce an approach that incorporates all these decisions to obtain improved solutions. In a first step, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is used to create a set of patterns that specify how each inbound train is split and how the railcars are assigned to the blocks. Then, in a second step, another MILP formulation decides which patterns to use and where to park the railcars.

An exact constraint programming model is proposed and compared with a variable neighborhood search that incorporates the driver’s reliability and the trip’s importance. The obtained trip-vehicle-driver assignments are evaluated on many scenarios with a Monte Carlo method to simulate the driver’s absenteeism. Experimental results on randomly generated instances based on a real case study show our methodologies’ efficiency and the enormous gains in covered trips when the drivers’ reliability is considered.,0191-2615,Not found
Connecting urban transportation systems with the spread of infectious diseases: A Trans-SEIR modeling approach,10.1016/j.trb.2021.01.008,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Urban transportation systems satisfy the essential mobility needs of the large-scale urban population, but it also creates an ideal environment that favors the spread of infectious diseases, leading to significant risk exposure to the massive urban population. In this study, we develop the mathematical model to understand the coupling between the spreading dynamics of infectious diseases and the mobility dynamics through urban transportation systems. We first describe the mobility dynamics of the urban population as the process of leaving from home, traveling to and from the activity locations, and engaging in activities. We then embed the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) process over the mobility dynamics and develops the spatial SEIR model with travel contagion (Trans-SEIR), which explicitly accounts for contagions both during travel and during daily activities. We investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed model and show how activity contagion and travel contagion contribute to the average number of secondary infections. We further develop an optimal control strategy for the effective entrance control of public transportation systems with optimal allocation of limited resources. In the numerical experiments, we explore how the urban transportation system may alter the fundamental dynamics of the infectious disease, change the number of secondary infections, promote the synchronization of the disease across the city, and affect the peak of the disease outbreaks. The Trans-SEIR model is further applied to understand the disease dynamics during early COVID-19 outbreak in New York City, where we show how the activity and travel contagion may be distributed and how effective entrance control can be implemented in urban transportation systems. The Trans-SEIR model, along with the findings in our study, may significantly improve our understanding of the coupling between urban transportation systems and disease dynamics, the development of quarantine and control measures for mitigating the disease risks and promoting the idea of disease-resilient urban transportation networks.",0191-2615,Not found
Can dynamic ride-sharing reduce traffic congestion?,10.1016/j.trb.2021.01.004,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Can dynamic ride-sharing reduce traffic congestion? In this paper we show that the answer is yes if the trip density is high, which is usually the case in large-scale networks but not in medium-scale networks where opportunities for sharing in time and space become rather limited. When the demand density is high, the dynamic ride-sharing system can significantly improve traffic conditions, especially during peak hours. Sharing can compensate extra travel distances related to operating a mobility service. The situation is entirely different in small and medium-scale cities when trip shareability is small, even if the ride-sharing system is fully optimized based on the perfect demand prediction in the near future. The reason is simple, mobility services significantly increase the total travel distance, and sharing is simply a means of combating this trend without eliminating it when the trip density is not high enough. This paper proposes a complete framework to represent the functioning of the ride-sharing system and multiple steps to tackle the curse of dimensionality when solving the problem. We address the problem for two city scales in order to compare different trip densities. A city scale of 25 k m 2 with a total market of 11,235 shareable trips for the medium-scale network and a city scale of 80 k m 2 with 205,308 demand for service vehicles for the large-scale network over a 4-hour period with a rolling horizon of 20 minutes. The solutions are assessed using a dynamic trip-based macroscopic simulation to account for the congestion effect and dynamic travel times that may influence the optimal solution obtained with predicted travel times. This outperforms most previous studies on optimal fleet management that usually consider constant and fully deterministic travel time functions.",0191-2615,Not found
An integer L-shaped algorithm for the integrated location and network restoration problem in disaster relief,10.1016/j.trb.2021.01.005,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Being prepared for potential disaster scenarios enables government agencies and humanitarian organizations to respond effectively once the disaster hits.

In this study, we propose an integer L-shaped algorithm to solve the integrated location and network restoration model, which is a two-stage stochastic programming model determining the number and locations of the emergency response facilities and restoration resources under uncertainty. Our algorithm accommodates the second-stage binary decision variables which are required to indicate undamaged and restored roads of the network that can be used for relief distribution. Our computational results show that our algorithm outperforms CPLEX for the larger number of disaster scenarios as the solution time of our algorithm increases only linearly as the number of scenarios increases.",0191-2615,Not found
Trading airport time slots: Market design with complex constraints,10.1016/j.trb.2021.01.003,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Due to the lasting growth in air traffic, many international airports have reached their capacity limits. Access to major airports is granted through the assignment of airport time slots. Current practices of allocating these time slots via grandfathering are widely regarded as inefficient by experts. New market mechanisms need to take into account synergistic valuations of airlines for departure and arrival time slots, as well as financial constraints of the participating airlines for the many time slots available. Unfortunately, computing core-stable outcomes in such environments is Σ 2 p -hard. Such problems are typically considered intractable. We introduce bilevel integer optimization models for airport time slot trading and compute core-stable outcomes, i.e. allocations and prices such that no coalition can beneficially deviate. Interestingly, despite the computational hardness of the underlying problem numerical experiments show that instances of practically relevant size can be solved in due time.

The interplay between the line planning and the passenger assignment is explicitly taken into account and the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model with linear constraints.

Online predictive connected and automated eco-driving on signalized arterials considering traffic control devices and road geometry constraints under uncertain traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trb.2020.12.009,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"For energy-efficient Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) Eco-driving control on signalized arterials under uncertain traffic conditions, this paper explicitly considers traffic control devices (e.g., road markings, traffic signs, and traffic signals) and road geometry (e.g., road shapes, road boundaries, and road grades) constraints in a data-driven optimization-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) modeling framework. This modeling framework uses real-time vehicle driving and traffic signal data via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. In the MPC-based control model, this paper mathematically formulates location-based traffic control devices and road geometry constraints using the geographic information from High-Definition (HD) maps. The location-based traffic control devices and road geometry constraints have the potential to improve the safety, energy, efficiency, driving comfort, and robustness of connected and automated driving on real roads by considering interrupted flow facility locations and road geometry in the formulation. We predict a set of uncertain driving states for the preceding vehicles through an online learning-based driving dynamics prediction model. We then solve a constrained finite-horizon optimal control problem with the predicted driving states to obtain a set of Eco-driving references for the controlled vehicle. To obtain the optimal acceleration or deceleration commands for the controlled vehicle with the set of Eco-driving references, we formulate a Distributionally Robust Stochastic Optimization (DRSO) model (i.e., a special case of data-driven optimization models under moment bounds) with Distributionally Robust Chance Constraints (DRCC) with location-based traffic control devices and road geometry constraints.

Multiclass dynamic system optimum solution for mixed traffic of human-driven and automated vehicles considering physical queues,10.1016/j.trb.2020.12.008,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) is an important method in the long term transportation planning and management processes. However, in most existing system optimum dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA), no side constraints are used to describe the dynamic link capacities in a network which is shared by multiple vehicle types. Our motivation is based on the possibility for dynamic system optimum (DSO) to have multiple solutions, which differ in where queues are formed and dissipated in the network. To this end, this paper proposes a novel DSO formulation for the multi-class DTA problem containing both human driven and automated vehicles in single origin-destination networks. The proposed method uses the concept of link based approach to develop a multi-class DTA model that equally distributes the total physical queues over the links while considering explicitly the variations in capacity and backward wave speeds due to class proportions. In the model, the DSO is formulated as an optimization problem considering linear vehicle composition constraints representing the dynamics of the link capacities.

Electric vehicle routing problem with machine learning for energy prediction,10.1016/j.trb.2020.12.007,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Routing electric commercial vehicles requires taking into account their limited driving range, which is affected by several uncertain factors such as traffic conditions. This paper presents the time-dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Chance-Constraints (EVRP-CC) and partial recharging. The routing method is divided into two stages, where the first finds the best paths and the second optimizes the routes. A probabilistic Bayesian machine learning approach is proposed for predicting the expected energy consumption and variance for the road links, paths and routes. Hence it is possible to consider the uncertainty in energy demand by planning charging within a confidence interval. The energy estimation is validated with data from electric buses driving a public transport route in Gothenburg-Sweden as well as with realistic simulations for 24 hours traffic in the city of Luxembourg connected to a high fidelity vehicle model. Routing solutions are compared with a deterministic formulation of the problem similar to the ones found in the literature.

Theory-based residual neural networks: A synergy of discrete choice models and deep neural networks,10.1016/j.trb.2021.03.002,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Researchers often treat data-driven and theory-driven models as two disparate or even conflicting methods in travel behavior analysis. However, the two methods are highly complementary because data-driven methods are more predictive but less interpretable and robust, while theory-driven methods are more interpretable and robust but less predictive. Using their complementary nature, this study designs a theory-based residual neural network (TB-ResNet) framework, which synergizes discrete choice models (DCMs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) based on their shared utility interpretation. The TB-ResNet framework is simple, as it uses a ( δ , 1- δ ) weighting to take advantage of DCMs’ simplicity and DNNs’ richness, and to prevent underfitting from the DCMs and overfitting from the DNNs. This framework is also flexible: three instances of TB-ResNets are designed based on multinomial logit model (MNL-ResNets), prospect theory (PT-ResNets), and hyperbolic discounting (HD-ResNets), which are tested on three data sets. Compared to pure DCMs, the TB-ResNets provide greater prediction accuracy and reveal a richer set of behavioral mechanisms owing to the utility function augmented by the DNN component in the TB-ResNets. Compared to pure DNNs, the TB-ResNets can modestly improve prediction and significantly improve interpretation and robustness, because the DCM component in the TB-ResNets stabilizes the utility functions and input gradients. Overall, this study demonstrates that it is both feasible and desirable to synergize DCMs and DNNs by combining their utility specifications under a TB-ResNet framework. Although some limitations remain, this TB-ResNet framework is an important first step to create mutual benefits between DCMs and DNNs for travel behavior modeling, with joint improvement in prediction, interpretation, and robustness.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimizing freight rate of spot market containers with uncertainties in shipping demand and available ship capacity,10.1016/j.trb.2021.02.008,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Liner container shipping company satisfies container shipping demand from both long-term contracts and spot market. Different from the shipping demand from long-term contracts whose freight rate is usually negotiated between the shipping company and the customer, the freight rate of the spot demand is usually determined by the shipping company itself. This paper thus focuses on how to determine the optimal freight rate of spot containers for each origin and destination (OD) pairs of a shipping network to maximize the total profit. To further reflect industry practice, two types of uncertainties are considered, i.e., the uncertain spot demand volume due to stochastic slot booking arrivals and cancelations, and the uncertain remaining ship capacity for the spot demand after satisfying other demand types with higher priority (e.g. delayed containers). This problem is first formulated as a two-stage stochastic nonlinear and nonconvex programming model. A tailored spatial branch-and-bound-and-Benders algorithm is then developed to obtain the global optimal solution of the model. Numerical experiments also demonstrate the efficiency of the solution algorithm and the applicability of the proposed model in improving the profit from the spot shipping demand.",0191-2615,Not found

This paper develops an aggregate modeling framework to examine the practicability of such a dual-sourcing strategy. We investigate the optimal contract design of dual sourcing under demand uncertainty, varying price sensitivity of freelancers, and heterogeneity in drivers’ risk attitude. Our results uncover the conditions under which dual sourcing benefits both the platform and drivers. We show that the platform’s staffing and pricing decisions are most responsive to freelancers’ price sensitivity. When the price sensitivity stays adequately low, both the platform and drivers can be better off under dual sourcing compared to the self-scheduling counterpart. On the contrary, with moderate price sensitivity, freelancers will be made worse off by dual sourcing.

The setting is motivated by the increasing trend in road privatization around the world, and the need to design auctions leading to efficient outcomes: firm selection, government payments, toll and capacity schedules, which determine public welfare and firm profits. In this paper, we characterize optimal direct revelation mechanisms for cases with and without restrictions on government payments. Because, in practice, it may be difficult or unappealing for firms to reveal their cost structure, we derive a scoring function that allows for the implementation of the optimal mechanism as a first-score auction where bids consist of toll, capacity, and government payment levels. The function accounts for distortions stemming from firms’ incentives to exploit their private information. We use the results to benchmark the performance of simple, but sub-optimal mechanisms: (i) predetermined toll and capacity bidding, (ii) auctions where the public welfare function is used to score bids, and (iii) a demand pricing mechanism aimed at maximizing patronage.",0191-2615,Not found
Reliable closed-loop supply chain design problem under facility-type-dependent probabilistic disruptions,10.1016/j.trb.2021.02.009,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) have received considerable attention because of various economic and regulatory factors. A CLSC is characterized by more complicated network structures and higher uncertainties compared to traditional supply chain networks. Therefore, reliable CLSCs are being increasingly emphasized in academic circles due to the vast impacts of disruptions such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks. This paper studies a reliable location-inventory problem in a CLSC considering the mutual effects between failures of forward and reverse distribution centers (DCs) when they are co-located. The disruption probability of a co-located forward DC is different from that of a standalone forward DC, i.e., probabilistic disruptions are dependent on facility type. The problem is formulated as a nonconvex mixed-integer programming problem. A decomposition approach based on the outer approximation (DOA) algorithm is proposed to address the resulting model.

The market share is maximized under the assumption that customers choose amongst competing airlines on the basis of utility provided by the respective airlines. We provide model formulations for the airline’s problem for two alternate network settings: one in the multiple allocation setting and another in the single allocation setting. Both these formulations are non-linear integer programs, which are intractable for most of the off-the-shelf commercial solvers. We propose two alternate approaches for each of the formulations to solve them optimally. The first among them is based on a mixed integer second order conic program reformulation, and the second uses Kelley’s cutting plane method within Lagrangian relaxation. On the basis of extensive numerical tests on well-known data-sets (CAB and AP), we conclude that the Kelley’s cutting plane within Lagrangian relaxation is computationally the best for both the single and multiple allocation settings, especially for large instances. We are able to solve instances upto 50 nodes from AP data-set within 120 and 10 minutes of CPU time for single and multiple allocation settings, respectively, which were unsolved by mixed integer second order cone based reformulation or Kelley’s cutting plane algorithm in the maximum allowed CPU time (3 hours for single allocation and 1 hour for multiple allocation).",0191-2615,Not found
From homogeneous to heterogeneous traffic flows: L<inf>p</inf> String stability under uncertain model parameters,10.1016/j.trb.2021.01.009,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"This paper shows that the heterogeneity of drivers’ and vehicles characteristics makes platoons, on average, more string-unstable. However, the string instability degree of unstable platoons is much higher in a homogeneous flow than in a heterogeneous one. These results are based on an L ∞ characterization of string stability, which is shown to be the most appropriate one from a traffic safety viewpoint. Mechanisms and conditions are discussed in which an L 2 characterization is not able to capture the amplification of a speed drop through a string of vehicles. An analytical sufficient condition for the L ∞ string stability of heterogeneous vehicles, which move according to a general class of car-following models, is derived. Above all, a thorough comparison of L ∞ and L 2 string stability characterizations between a homogeneous and a heterogenous flow, is performed. To this aim, the L p norms of heterogeneous platoons are calculated within a quasi-Monte Carlo framework. The variability of the L p norm values due to the platoon length, the equilibrium speed, and the probability distribution model of the uncertain vehicle parameters, is analysed. Overall, it is shown that the platoon stability behaviour sensibly changes with the shape and the correlation structure of vehicle model parameter distributions.

Three major issues in bus routing and scheduling are addressed in this framework, i.e., uncertain driving range, refueling or charging need, and locating refueling or charging facilities. Mathematically, the problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. Two types of services, regular services running on fixed schedules and ad hoc services to cover incomplete scheduled trips arising from energy shortage of certain buses, are considered in this paper. An adaptive time-space-energy network is developed to model the refueling issues and location problem. We introduce the notion of range reliability to decompose and solve the two-stage stochastic formulation under range uncertainty. The regular services schedule is determined in stage-one to cover the demand under a certain range reliability level. Upon realization of the random driving range, the deployment of ad hoc services is made in stage-two to address the occurrence of energy shortage of certain buses.

Timetabling for strategic passenger railway planning,10.1016/j.trb.2021.02.006,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"In research and practice, public transportation planning is executed in a series of steps, which are often divided into the strategic, the tactical, and the operational planning phase.

In this paper, however, we propose a timetabling approach that is aimed at decision making in the strategic phase of public transportation planning and to determine an outline of a timetable that is good from the passengers’ perspective. Instead of including explicit synchronization constraints between train runs (as most timetabling models do), we include the adaption time (waiting time at the origin station) in the objective function to ensure regular connections between passengers’ origins and destinations.

To address this issue, this study presents a new modeling framework, named physics regularized machine learning (PRML), to encode classical traffic flow models (referred as physics models) into the ML architecture and to regularize the ML training process. More specifically, leveraging the Gaussian process (GP) as the base model, a stochastic physics regularized Gaussian process (PRGP) model is developed and a Bayesian inference algorithm is used to estimate the mean and kernel of the PRGP. A physics regularizer, based on macroscopic traffic flow models, is also developed to augment the estimation via a shadow GP and an enhanced latent force model is used to encode physical knowledge into the stochastic process. Based on the posterior regularization inference framework, an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm is then developed to maximize the evidence lowerbound of the system likelihood. For model evaluations, this paper conducts empirical studies on a real-world dataset which is collected from a stretch of I-15 freeway, Utah.

Optimising airport slot allocation considering flight-scheduling flexibility and total airport capacity constraints,10.1016/j.trb.2021.02.002,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The lack of airport capacity hinders the growth potential of global air travel, inflicting delays and economic losses to passengers, airlines, and airports. Airport Slot Allocation (ASA) is used in congested airports as a short-term measure for providing access to air-carriers to scarce airport resources. A rich literature has been developed during the last decade around the formulation and optimisation of the ASA problem using the IATA World Scheduling Guidelines (IATA WSG). However, existing models do not address airlines’ flight scheduling flexibility preferences which are expressed through the Timing Flexibility Indicator (TFI). Additionally, in considering the airport's capacity, existing ASA literature does not treat endogenously the allocation of the available airport capacity to match the demand's characteristics. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel modelling and solution framework that considers airlines’ flexibility preferences and its seamless integration with constraints that enable the dynamic allocation of the airport's resources. Our approach takes into account the number of rejected requests, the total, and maximum displacement objectives and addresses several primary and additional policy criteria of IATA WSG. The preferences of the airlines are introduced through the Timing Flexibility Indicator (TFI) which is incorporated in a weighted objective function considering the number of slot requests which fall within their specified TFI. The proposed framework benefits from valid tightening inequalities which reduce the required computational times. Our computational study using data from a coordinated airport suggests that the joint consideration of the TFI and the endogenous and dynamic capacity constraints, improves airport capacity utilisation, thus leading to improved airport slot schedules with reduced total and maximum displacement and significant improvements in terms of displaced slot requests and passengers.",0191-2615,Not found

It is not clear however whether this result is general, or whether other variations of the trip scheduling problem may be stable. This paper focuses on the cost function and shows that it is monotone if and only if the marginal utility rate at destination is non-increasing with time. This implies that unlike the morning commute, the evening commute is stable in continuous time with various adjustment mechanisms. It also suggests (but does not prove) that the morning commute equilibrium is likely to be unstable also with many other schedule preferences and economically rational adjustment mechanisms.

Integrating advanced discrete choice models in mixed integer linear optimization,10.1016/j.trb.2021.02.003,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"In many transportation systems, a mismatch between the associated design and planning decisions and the demand is typically encountered. A tailored system is not only appealing to operators, which could have a better knowledge of their operational costs, but also to users, since they would benefit from an increase in the level of service and satisfaction. Hence, it is important to explicitly allow for the interactions between the two in the model governing the decisions of the system. Discrete choice models (DCM) provide a disaggregate demand representation that is able to capture the impact on the behavior of these decisions by taking into account the heterogeneity of tastes and preferences of the users, as well as subjective aspects related to attitudes or perceptions. Despite their advantages, the demand expressions derived from DCM are non-linear and non-convex in the explanatory variables, which restricts their integration in optimization problems. In this paper, we overcome the probabilistic nature of DCM by relying on simulation in order to specify the demand directly in terms of the utility functions (instead of the choice probabilities). This allows us to define a mixed-integer linear formulation that characterizes the preference structure and the behavioral assumption of DCM, which can then be embedded in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. We provide an overview of the extent of the framework with an illustrative MILP model that is designed to solve a profit maximization problem of a parking services operator.

We find that when the HSR subsidy is not directly linked to the aviation tax, introducing this subsidy will decrease the air traffic and increase the rail traffic on the route where air transport and HSR compete. However, if part of the aviation tax revenue is earmarked for the HSR subsidy (i.e., the integrated tax-subsidy policy), the traffic implications of the HSR subsidy will be the opposite. To extend the analysis to a transportation network, when the integrated tax-subsidy policy only involves aviation tax revenue from routes with HSR presence, it will decrease air traffic on routes without HSR. When the integrated tax-subsidy scheme involves tax revenue from the whole network, the traffic implications depend on the comparison between aviation tax rate on routes with and without HSR.",0191-2615,Not found
Car-following behavior characteristics of adaptive cruise control vehicles based on empirical experiments,10.1016/j.trb.2021.03.003,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Emerging automated vehicle (AV) technologies are increasingly being deployed around the world and it is only a matter of time before the transportation landscape changes dramatically. Unfortunately, those changes cannot be well predicted due to the lack of empirical data. But adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are common in the market and can be used to fill this gap. In this paper, we aim to characterize the empirical car-following behaviors of a commercial ACC system and understand how ACC behaves in different conditions and the underlying impact mechanism. It is found that for a single ACC: (i) the ACC response time is comparable to human drivers but much larger than the ACC controller time gap and it exhibits small variance, (ii) the ACC response can amplify or dampen an oscillation, (iii) after the oscillation, the stabilization process can exhibit overshooting or undershooting, and (iv) these CF behaviors depend largely on the ACC headway setting, speed level, and leader stimulus, which produce the impacts directly and/or indirectly through the mediation of earlier ACC behaviors. For a three-vehicle platoon, our main finding is that the change from one ACC vehicle to the next is progressive for oscillation growth, and regressive for deceleration, acceleration, and overshooting. This implies that in long platoons, oscillation amplitude tends to exacerbate very quickly, which forces ACC vehicles further upstream to apply very strong braking followed by a strong acceleration. This can cause significant overshooting and safety hazards.",0191-2615,Not found
A macro-micro approach to modeling parking,10.1016/j.trb.2021.03.012,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"In this paper, we propose a new macro-micro approach to modeling parking. We first develop a microscopic parking simulation model considering both on- and off-street parking with limited capacity. In the microscopic model, a parking search algorithm is proposed to mimic cruising-for-parking based on the principle of proximity, and a parking-related state tracking algorithm is proposed to acquire an event-based simulated data set. Some key aspects of parking modeling are discussed based on the simulated evidence and theoretical analysis. Results suggest (i) although the low cruising speed reduces the network performance, it does not significantly alter the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD) unless the cruising vehicles dominate the traffic stream; (ii) distance to park is not uniquely determined by parking occupancy because factors such as cruising speed and parking duration also contribute; and (iii) multiscale parking occupancy-driven intelligent parking guidance can reduce distance to park yielding considerable network efficiency gains. Using the microscopic model, we then extend, calibrate, and validate a macroscopic parking dynamics model with an NFD representation. The demonstrated consistency between the macro- and micro-models permits integration of the two for online parking pricing optimization via model predictive control. Numerical experiments highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as one caveat. That is, when pricing on-street parking, the road network connected to the alternate off-street parking lots must have sufficient capacity to accommodate the increased parking demand; otherwise, local congestion may arise that violates the homogeneity assumption underlying the macroscopic model.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal rebalancing and on-board charging of shared electric scooters,10.1016/j.trb.2021.03.009,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"This paper presents a sequence of models for optimal overnight charging and rebalancing of shared electric scooters (e-scooters) by allowing e-scooters to be charged while being transported on rebalancing vehicles. This problem is first modeled as a mixed-integer program for the multi-commodity inventory routing problem, where commodities represent e-scooters with different states of charge. To avoid prohibitive computation burden, continuous approximation techniques are proposed to estimate costs associated with the pickup and drop-off operations in small local neighborhoods, and the formulation turns into a discrete-continuous hybrid model for the integrated operations at both local and line-haul levels. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that, as compared to direct application of the discrete formulation, the proposed hybrid approach can produce good quality solutions for large-scale instances in a much shorter computation time.",0191-2615,Not found

A novel class of models for the ship speed optimisation problem, which we refer to as P ( n , m , G o ) , is presented. It is based on incorporating cash-flow functions and is flexible in modelling journey structures of variable composition. By studying properties of optimal leg speeds within this NPV framework, we demonstrate two novel elements of ship speed optimisation: (a) When executing a series of identical journeys, optimal ship speeds from one execution of the journey to the next are shown to change. We refer to this as the chain effect. (b) The ship’s optimal speed is in general highly dependent on the decision maker’s views on the ship’s future profit potential(FPP). We present two efficient algorithms to solve the models. The methodology is applied to case studies based on the literature and the results are compared with classic model formulations. Net Present Value Equivalence Analysis (NPVEA) shows how the proposed framework increases understanding of the applicability and limitations of these classic model formulations.

A set of benchmarking criteria is designed, ranging from the operational measures (e.g., delay and travel time) as well as the complex traffic phenomena (i.e., oscillations, capacity drop, and hysteresis phenomena).

In this paper we study the traffic problems of a small town that is located parallel to a congested motorway and suffers from such diverted traffic (high local accident risks, local congestion and other nuisances). We assume that the motorway and the secondary road through the local town are under the jurisdiction of a different authority. A local government controls local accident risks and congestion using non-price measures such as speed bumps, traffic lights and explicit access restrictions for through traffic. A ‘federal’ government can control traffic levels on the motorway using tolls. We show the following results. First, competition between the federal and local authority leads to a Nash equilibrium where the toll is too high and there is too much traffic calming compared to the second-best social optimum. Second, if the local government uses traffic calming measures, imposing a federal toll on the main road is welfare-reducing, unless congestion on the main road is severe and accident risks and other traffic nuisances in the small town are unimportant. Third, traffic diverted from the main road to the local community gives the latter strong incentives to close the local road for through traffic, even when it is socially undesirable to do so. Fourth, if the access restriction only applies to through traffic by trucks, the conflict between federal and local authorities disappears: both will agree on restricting truck access. A numerical application using a two-link network between Leuven and Brussels (the highway and an alternative road passing through local communities) illustrates the theoretical results.",0191-2615,Not found
Capacity of a freeway lane with platoons of autonomous vehicles mixed with regular traffic,10.1016/j.trb.2021.03.010,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"In the near future, autonomous vehicles (AVs) will travel sharing the current freeways with human driven vehicles. The efficiency of this mixed traffic scenario will depend on the ability of AVs to behave cooperatively. Otherwise, the introduction of uncoordinated AVs might lead to capacity reductions. Connected AVs (CAVs) traveling in platoons represents a promising management strategy to get the most from the AVs’ technological revolution. Most of previous research has used traffic microsimulation tools to assess platooning and other CAVs’ cooperative driving strategies, achieving good results. However, the robust macroscopic modeling alternative, which typically yields the necessary insights and fundamental knowledge to set the foundations for the development of management and control strategies, remains almost unexplored. This paper contributes to fill this research gap by providing a generalized macroscopic model to estimate the average CAVs platoon length for a given traffic demand and penetration rate of CAVs. Two different platooning schemes are compared (i.e. cooperative and opportunistic) representing the best and worst case scenarios. The estimation of CAVs platoon length is of much importance as it is the main factor driving capacity improvements on freeways, which under the appropriate conditions could exceed 10.000 vehicles per hour and lane.",0191-2615,Not found
A new closed form multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) choice model with multiple linear constraints,10.1016/j.trb.2021.03.005,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Traditional multiple-discrete continuous choice models that have been formulated and applied in recent years consider a single linear resource constraint, which, when combined with consumer preferences, determines the optimal consumption point. However, in reality, consumers may face multiple resource constraints, such as those associated with time, money, and storage capacity. Ignoring such multiple constraints and instead using a single constraint can, and in general will, lead to poor data fit and inconsistent preference estimation, which can then have a serious negative downstream effect on forecasting and welfare/policy analysis. Unlike earlier attempts to address this multiple constraint situation, we formulate a new multiple-constraint (MC) multiple discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model (or the MC-MDCEV model) that retains a closed-form probability structure and is as simple to estimate as the MDCEV model with one constraint. We achieve this by assuming a type-I extreme value distribution for the error term in its minimization form in the baseline utility preference of each good rather than a maximization form as in Bhat's (2005; 2008) original MDCEV formulation. The statistical foundation of the proposed model is based on the fact that the difference between a minimal type-I extreme value random variable with scale σ and the weighted sum of the exponential of standardized minimal type-I extreme value random variables (scaled up by σ) leads to an apparently new multivariate distribution that has an elegant and closed-form survival distribution function. Results from a simulation experiment show that our proposed model substantially outperforms single-constraint models; the results also highlight the serious mis-estimation that is likely to occur if only a subset of active constraints is used. The proposed model is applied to a case of week-long activity participation where individuals are assumed to maximize their utility from time-use subject to time and money budgets.It is hoped that our proposed simple closed-form multi-constraint MDCEV model will contribute to a new direction of application possibilities and to new research into situations where consumers face multiple constraints within a multiple discrete-continuous choice context.",0191-2615,Not found
Analysis of first-come-first-served mechanisms in one-way car-sharing services,10.1016/j.trb.2021.03.006,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The principle of “first-come-first-served” (FCFS) has been widely adopted in the deployment of car-sharing services (CSS) to manage service requests for the sake of equity. Most studies of CSS do not explicitly model the supply-demand interactions of shared cars, especially when supply insufficiency arises. This study formulates the supply-demand dynamics of one-way CSS under different FCFS mechanisms and embeds them in a boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium (BR-DUE) problem. Two disaggregate FCFS mechanisms are suggested to improve the utilization of shared cars given the same CSS supplies in the discrete-time domain. To accurately capture the choice of CSS in space and time, a path expansion strategy is proposed to cope with different waiting times under the disaggregate FCFS mechanisms. The path expansion strategy congruently bridges the aggregate-disaggregate analyses and is incorporated in an adaptive column generation algorithm to solve the BR-DUE problem in a bi-modal supernetwork. Numerical examples demonstrate that the FCFS mechanisms have a significant influence on the supply-demand dynamics and choice of CSS.",0191-2615,Not found
The location-or-routing problem,10.1016/j.trb.2021.02.010,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"We introduce the location-or-routing problem (LoRP), which integrates the facility location and the vehicle routing problems by uncovering a new connection from the customer coverage perspective. In the LoRP, open facilities cover the customers in their neighborhood and the uncovered customers are transported to open facilities by capacitated vehicles. Each facility has a maximum coverage range and each vehicle route is constrained by a maximum length. In this setting, a customer can be covered either by ‘location’ or by ‘routing’, hence the problem name. We discuss several application areas of LoRP and present its relation to the location and routing problems. We develop a set covering model and a branch-and-price algorithm as an exact solution methodology. The results show that the facility coverage range is an important determinant of the number and location of open facilities. We find that the vehicle routes play a decreasing role on the total cost as facility range increases. Furthermore, trade-off analyses on random graphs show that the total cost decreases almost linearly by increasing facility coverage range. We investigate the reasons behind this observation using arguments from asymptotic analysis and find that it is a common property when the customers are uniformly distributed.",0191-2615,Not found
The cell transmission model with free-flow speeds varying over time or space,10.1016/j.trb.2020.05.012,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"In the cell transmission model (CTM), time is discretised into time-steps and links discretised into cells. In the original CTM, and usually thereafter, the cell lengths are chosen so that, at free-flow speeds (ffs), traffic travels exactly one cell per time-step (1 cpts), so that the ffs, denoted α, is exactly α = 1 cpts and, to avoid computational complications, the length of each cell is normally held constant over time. But the actual observed ffs's in a cell will often differ by time of day or traffic type or traffic lane, or due to speed limits that vary over time or space, or due to stochastic effects. By construction, the maximum ffs in each cell is 1 cpts (α = 1), hence when the ffs is varying within a cell, it will often be less than 1 (α < 1). We show that when traffic in a cell has a ffs α < 1 cpts then the flows and occupancies obtained from the standard CTM can be very inaccurate. For example, consider a cell of length 1 that is in a free flow state with free-flow speed α < 1 and no further flow into the cell. Then all traffic in the cell will have exited by time 1/α and the cell will then be empty. In contrast, for the same scenario, the CTM lets a fraction α < 1 of the remaining traffic in the cell exit in each time step, so that the cell outflow and occupancy decline geometrically toward zero, so that the cell never fully empties. The problem is serious since in traffic networks there may be large numbers, or a large proportion, or a majority, of cells and links that are in a free-flow state for all or part of the time span being modelled. To overcome the above problem, we propose that the CTM not be applied to cells that are in a free-flow state with ffs α < 1 cpts. Instead, for those cells and links, we let traffic move forward at its ffs rather than as computed from the CTM. This is easily accomplished since, in the CTM the computations roll forward one time step at a time and, in each time step, the cell occupancy is updated from the previous time step, hence is known and the known occupancy immediately indicates whether the cell will be in a free-flow state.",0191-2615,Not found

Integrated train dwell time regulation and train speed profile generation for automatic train operations on high-density metro lines: A distributed optimal control method,10.1016/j.trb.2021.04.009,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The wide-spread application of automatic train operation (ATO) system on metro lines allows short service headways, high-density operations and high operation efficiency. This paper addresses real-time train control for ATO when faced with disturbances or disruptions in its operations. More specifically, the paper focuses on the design of integrated train dwell time regulation and speed profile generation in real-time and in response to dynamic changes in the operation environment. A nonlinear optimal control model is formulated in a rolling horizon scheme that incorporates three key operating elements: train timetable, passenger load and train speed profile. The objective is to simultaneously improve headway regularity and reduce the total energy consumptions. To satisfy the real-time control requirement for ATO system, a decomposition method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is designed to divide the original optimization problem into many sub-problems, one for each train, which can then be computed in a distributed manner. Moreover, to address the non-convexity issue, a relax-round-polish process is developed to deal with the formulated nonlinear optimal control problem with convex objective over non-convex constraints in order to find the approximate solutions quickly for the embedded applications. The combined result is an ADMM-based heuristic algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm is demonstrated using real-world data from the Changping Line of Beijing Metro.

Analytical characterization of multi-state effective discharge rates for bus-only lane conversion scheduling problem,10.1016/j.trb.2021.04.008,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"An accurate quantification of traffic flow characteristics with and without bus-only lane is important for determining transit priority strategies. Examinations of real-world vehicle trajectory data, like those from the NGSIM dataset, found that an effective discharge rate may be discounted when merging or lane-changing behaviors are observed. To deal with this, this manuscript analytically derives the effective discharge rate of a roadway segment by considering multi-stage merging behavior and vehicular traffic kinematics near a side entrance, for optimal bus-only lane conversion. The classic fluid-based approximation model by Newell that characterizes the queuing and dissipation process is extended to a multi-state queuing analysis framework. Three effective discharge rate discount factors are explicitly derived, for bus-only lane, general-purpose lane, and mixed-traffic lane, respectively. The derived effective discharge rates are represented by mathematically-simple expressions in a closed-form, and correctly account for the effects of demand inputs, such as arrival rate and the ratio of vehicles of different types, vehicular performance (such as acceleration rate), and traffic flow characteristics (such as backward wave speed and jam density). The bus-only lane conversion scheduling problem is then formulated as an optimization model to minimize total traffic delay. Validation, using NGSIM data, showed that our model reduced the effective discharge rate estimation error significantly on both arterials and freeways. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the optimal bus-only lane scheduling time varied in response to traffic demand and vehicle ratios, and the developed optimization model was always beneficial when compared with the demand-oriented strategy.",0191-2615,Not found
Maximum-stability dispatch policy for shared autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2021.04.011,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have been widely studied in the recent literature. Agent-based simulations and theoretical models have extensively explored the effects on travel service, fleet size, and congestion using heuristic dispatching strategies to match SAVs with on-demand passengers. A major question that simulations have sought to address is the service rate or replacement rate: the number of passengers each SAV can serve. Thus far, the service rate has mostly been estimated through simulation. This paper investigates an analytical max-pressure dispatch policy, which aims to maximize passenger throughput under any stochastic demand pattern, which takes the form of a model predictive control algorithm. An analytical proof using Lyapunov drift techniques is presented to show that the dispatch policy achieves maximum stability. The service rate and minimum fleet sizes are derived analytically in this paper and can be achieved with the proposed dispatch policy. Simulation results show that the maximum stable demand is linearly related to the fleet size given. Also, it demonstrates how asymmetric demand necessitates rebalancing trips that affect service rates.

Deep neural networks for choice analysis: A statistical learning theory perspective,10.1016/j.trb.2021.03.011,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Although researchers increasingly use deep neural networks (DNN) to analyze individual choices, overfitting and interpretability issues remain obstacles in theory and practice. This study presents a statistical learning theoretical framework to examine the tradeoff between estimation and approximation errors, and between the quality of prediction and of interpretation. It provides an upper bound on the estimation error of the prediction quality in DNN, measured by zero-one and log losses, shedding light on why DNN models do not overfit. It proposes a metric for interpretation quality by formulating a function approximation loss that measures the difference between true and estimated choice probability functions. It argues that the binary logit (BNL) and multinomial logit (MNL) models are the specific cases of DNNs, since the latter always has smaller approximation errors. We explore the relative performance of DNN and classical choice models through three simulation scenarios comparing DNN, BNL, and binary mixed logit models (BXL), as well as one experiment comparing DNN to BNL, BXL, MNL, and mixed logit (MXL) in analyzing the choice of trip purposes based on the National Household Travel Survey 2017. The results indicate that DNN can be used for choice analysis beyond the current practice of demand forecasting because it has the inherent utility interpretation and the power of automatically learning utility specification. Our results suggest DNN outperforms BNL, BXL, MNL, and MXL models in both prediction and interpretation when the sample size is large ( ≥ O ( 10 4 ) ), the input dimension is high, or the true data generating process is complex, while performing worse when the opposite is true. DNN outperforms BNL and BXL in zero-one, log, and approximation losses for most of the experiments, and the larger sample size leads to greater incremental value of using DNN over classical discrete choice models. Overall, this study introduces the statistical learning theory as a new foundation for high-dimensional data, complex statistical models, and non-asymptotic data regimes in choice analysis, and the experiments show the effective prediction and interpretation of DNN for its applications to policy and behavioral analysis.",0191-2615,Not found

These modular bus units can either operate individually or combined (forming larger modular buses with a higher passenger capacity). This provides enormous flexibility to manage the service frequencies and vehicle allocation, reducing thereby the operating cost and improving passenger mobility. We develop an optimization model used to determine the optimal composition of modular bus units and the optimal service frequency at which the buses (both conventional and modular) should be dispatched across each bus line. We explicitly account for the dynamics of traffic congestion and complex interactions between the modes at the network level based on the recently proposed three-dimensional macroscopic fundamental diagram (3D-MFD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the 3D-MFD and modular bus units for the frequency setting problem in the domain of bus operations. Numerical results show the improvements in the total system cost made by adjusting the number of combined modular bus units and their dispatching frequencies to the evolution of both, the car and the bus passenger demand. A comparison with the commonly used approach that considers only the bus system (neglecting the complex multimodal interactions and congestion propagation) reveals the value of the proposed modeling framework. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the effect of the operating unit cost of modular bus units, the size of the bus network, and the size of the bus fleet sheds light on the robustness of the proposed optimization framework.",0191-2615,Not found

Given an ordered set of clients, the proposed method plans a minimum cost route and schedule such that the itinerary is regulation-compliant, and the driver is guaranteed to find parking at all scheduled stops. The problem is modeled as a shortest path problem with resource constraints, and a label correcting algorithm is used to generate optimal solutions. Computational experiments are used to compare the cost of solutions that use parking availability information with ones that do not. The cost of disregarding parking information was estimated by simulating drivers’ behavior when parking is unavailable and applying time and cost penalties. The effect of parking availability and alternative routes on trip costs is also studied, aiming to illustrate that disregarding these factors can lead to significant errors in cost estimates.

We demonstrate that the stationary state of the dynamical system is the same as the user equilibrium, and the user equilibrium is proved with Lyapunov's second method to be stable for the symmetrical deferral and advance coefficients. With numerical examples, we verify the analytical results and examine the model's sensitivity to different factors with different combinations of heuristic asymmetrical coefficients and theoretically stable symmetrical coefficients. Both analytical and numerical results confirm that the new dynamical system is asymptotically stable in a stability region.

In this study, by redefining the set of feasible driver trajectories and the market equilibrium conditions for ridesharing, we propose an alternative approach to modeling the RUE when the driver- and rider-demand for each OD pair are fixed and given. We show that the resulting RUE conditions can be equivalently transformed into a convex programming problem, and the existence and uniqueness of RUE link flows are guaranteed under mild conditions. The structure of the model is similar to the classic Beckmann’s formulation, except for the additional ridesharing demand-supply constraints. So a dual subgradient algorithm with averaging is proposed to solve the problem, and the dual sub-problem can be solved by the Frank-Wolfe method.

Moreover, none of the existing studies have considered the effects of bus network structure on private car users, the level of interactions between the modes, and the passenger mode choice that depends on traffic conditions. This paper aims to close this gap and provide a general framework considering multiple trip length patterns, two types of user behavior, and the effects that the bus network structure might have on the traffic performance and passenger mode choice. For modeling different trip length patterns, we use the trip length distribution as an intermediate level of abstraction. To capture complex modal interactions and quantify the operating speeds, we apply the recently proposed three-dimensional macroscopic fundamental diagram. We use the operating speed for each mode to determine the mode choice at the trip length level. This way, we are able to solve the optimal bus network design problem under the free-flow/saturated traffic conditions in an analytical way, while considering more realistic settings including a dynamic description of the peak hour demand, mixed traffic, and different mode choice decisions depending on trip lengths and walking preferences. Numerical analysis reveals that all the tested factors, including demand intensity, user behavior, and trip length patterns, have significant effects on the operator and user cost function. Results show that the probability of choosing any given mode follows certain distribution that varies across the trip length patterns, indicating the importance of modeling the mode choice at the trip length level. Furthermore, the results indicate that users can benefit if they are willing to adjust the number of transfers to minimize the walking distance at the origin and the destination. Moreover, we show that the optimal bus network design determined for the uniform trip pattern underestimates the number of required buses, which leads to passenger congestion at stops during the peak period. This, however, does not happen when we take into account the actual trip length distribution for the bus network design. A comparison with a simplified approach that considers the bus system only, reveals the value of accounting for the complex bi-modal interactions, especially for higher demand levels. Finally, we show that by allowing the design parameters to vary across cardinal directions we provide more flexibility for the bus system to serve the passenger demand while reducing the operator cost compared to the existing approaches.",0191-2615,Not found
Competitive and cooperative behaviour analysis of connected and autonomous vehicles across unsignalised intersections: A game-theoretic approach,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.007,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"We in this paper investigate navigation strategies of two cross-moving connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at an unsignalised intersection. As highly intelligent and automated entities, CAVs could make decisions independently or behave in a cooperative manner. A Nash game with discrete decision strategy is formulated to characterize the non-cooperative behaviour and a cooperative game is formulated to model the cooperative control mechanism. Results show that (i) pure-strategy Nash equilibria (NEs) for the non-cooperative game always exist and NEs hold if and only if at least one CAV takes its dominant strategy; (ii) more than two pure-strategy NE solutions may exist, but at most two different payoffs could arrive for each player at pure-strategy NEs; (iii) the optimal solution to the cooperative game must be in the NE solution set. These interesting findings provide useful managerial insights to CAV operators and transport authorities, and also enable us to tailor a branch & bound (B&B) algorithm to efficiently solve the models. We also extend the proposed methodology to the n-player case ( n ≥ 3 ) and give some more generalized insights. Numerical experiments are demonstrated in the end to test the computational accuracy and efficiency of the B&B method and show that our models and algorithm can be readily incorporated into future real-time CAV decision system to help navigate through unsignalised intersections.",0191-2615,Not found
An exact method for the integrated optimization of subway lines operation strategies with asymmetric passenger demand and operating costs,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.009,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Subway lines connecting different urban functional zones in large cities have direction-dependent and time-variant passenger demand, namely, asymmetry in passenger demand. Most existing studies adopt a symmetric strategy to design operations in both directions and sequentially optimize the different problems associated with operations, thereby failing to meet the asymmetry in passenger demand. This study formulates an asymmetric operation strategy as an integrated mixed-integer non-linear model to optimize the entire operational process of rolling stock from the perspective of service quality and operating costs. Based on the proposed model, an exact algorithm is proposed with speed-up techniques to quickly generate an optimal solution. To this end, the original model is decomposed into several sub-problems that can be exactly solved by using a forward dynamic programming algorithm.

Incentive-based decentralized routing for connected and autonomous vehicles using information propagation,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.004,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Routing strategies under the aegis of dynamic traffic assignment have been proposed in the literature to optimize system performance. However, challenges have persisted in their deployment ability and effectiveness due to inherent strong assumptions on traveler behavior and availability of network-level real-time traffic information, and the high computational burden associated with computing network-wide flows in real-time. To address these gaps, this study proposes an incentive-based decentralized routing strategy to nudge the network performance closer to the system optimum for the context where all vehicles are connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The strategy consists of three stages. The first stage incorporates a local route switching dynamical system to approximate the system optimal route flow in a local area based on vehicles’ knowledge of local traffic information. This system is decentralized in the sense that it only updates the local route choices of vehicles in this area rather than route choices of all vehicles in the network, which circumvents the high computational burden associated with computing the flows on the entire network. The second stage optimizes the route for each CAV by considering individual heterogeneity in traveler preferences (e.g., the value of time) to maximize the utilities of all travelers in the local area. Constraints are also incorporated to ensure that these routes can achieve the approximated local system optimal flow of the first stage. The third stage leverages an expected envy-free incentive mechanism to ensure that travelers in the local area can accept the optimal routes determined in the second stage. The study analytically discusses the convergence of the local route switching dynamical system. We also show that the proposed incentive mechanism is expected individual rational and budget-balanced, which ensure that travelers are willing to participate and guarantee the balance between payments and compensations, respectively. Further, the conditions for the expected incentive compatibility of the incentive mechanism are analyzed and proved, ensuring behavioral honesty in disclosing information. Thereby, the proposed incentive-based decentralized routing strategy can enhance network performance and user satisfaction under fully connected and autonomous environments.",0191-2615,Not found
Airline integrated robust scheduling with a variable neighborhood search based heuristic,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.005,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This study investigates an airline integrated robust scheduling problem, subsuming three steps: schedule design, fleet assignment, and aircraft routing, while considering the effects of propagated delays. We propose a mixed integer programming model incorporating propagated delays and flight re-timing decisions; the model is extended towards a second one in terms of passenger spill/recapture effects, optional flights, and passenger miss-connections. In order to solve our models for large-scale airline instances, we propose a column generation procedure as well as a sequential variable neighborhood search (VNS) heuristic; the integration of which leads to significantly improved convergence. Based on a real airline instance, from a Chinese legacy airline, we report an extensive set of numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and solution techniques.

Blockchain technology for port logistics capability: Exclusive or sharing,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.010,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Although the application of blockchain technology in maritime industry can improve the customs clearance efficiency and logistics transparency in the container cargo supply chains, it generates the unit operations cost and setup cost. In this study, a spatial model is proposed to conduct an investigation into the two heterogeneous ports when blockchain technology is applied under inter-port competition. Different utility-driven operations models are built to highlight the values of blockchain technology for port logistics capability, and to reveal the equilibria under the optimal strategies and equilibrium strategies. It is noticed that the relationship between the unit net benefit and unit operations cost brought out by blockchain technology is a key factor determining whether the blockchain technology is applicable. When the unit operations cost is lower than unit net benefit, and the setup cost is high, there is a win-win situation for two ports to apply traditional technology. It is further verified to be Pareto-optimal. In addition, three lose-lose situations are also identified, which are classic Prisoner's Dilemmas. Consequently, a horizontal collaboration mechanism “blockchain technology sharing + compensation” (BTSC) is designed to not only break these three Prisoner's Dilemmas, but also achieve the Pareto-optimum. Furthermore, we discuss some extensions to prove the robustness of our main qualitative insights.",0191-2615,Not found
Mitigating unfairness in urban rail transit operation: A mixed-integer linear programming approach,10.1016/j.trb.2021.04.014,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"In oversaturated urban rail transit systems, passengers departing from downstream stations often experience long waiting times due to unbalanced space-time demand and limited transit capacity. This is often prevalent during morning and evening peak periods in transit systems. This paper aims to mitigate the unfairness of waiting time among a time-varying number of passengers through train timetable's adjustment by optimizing the train skip-stopping pattern. We develop an approximate general model by clustering passengers into groups and introducing an aggregation granularity parameter. To characterize feasible passenger travel patterns, both rigid first-in-first-out rule and capacity constraints are incorporated in the proposed model. Preprocessing is proposed to reduce the space of solutions. Some small-scale case studies show that the proposed method outperforms the original timetable and the preprocessing is effective to reduce computation time. Case studies based on the Batong line of Beijing rail transit network are conducted, in which a variable neighborhood search algorithm is applied to obtain high-quality solutions in short computing times. The results show that the proposed approach not only mitigates the unfairness of waiting time among passengers but also improves other efficiency evaluation indexes, including the average waiting time and the maximum number of missed trains.

Shipping Domain Knowledge Informed Prediction and Optimization in Port State Control,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.003,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Maritime transportation is the backbone of global supply chain. To improve maritime safety, protect the marine environment, and set out seafarers’ rights, port state control (PSC) empowers ports to inspect foreign visiting ships to verify them comply with various international conventions. One critical issue faced by the port states is how to optimally allocate the limited inspection resources for inspecting the visiting ships. To address this issue, this study first develops a state-of-the-art XGBoost model to accurately predict ship deficiency number considering ship generic factors, dynamic factors, and inspection historical factors. Particularly, the XGBoost model takes shipping domain knowledge regarding ship flag, recognized organization, and company performance into account to improve model performance and prediction fairness (e.g., for two ships that are different only in their flag performances, the one with a better flag performance should be predicted to have a better condition than the other). Based on the predictions, a PSC officer (PSCO) scheduling model is proposed to help the maritime authorities optimally allocate inspection resources. Considering that a PSCO can inspect at most four ships in a day, we further propose and incorporate the concepts of inspection template and un-dominated inspection template in the optimization models to reduce problem size as well as improve computation efficiency and model flexibility. Numerical experiments show that the proposed PSCO scheduling model with the predictions of XGBoost as the input is more than 20% better than the current inspection scheme at ports regarding the number of deficiencies detected. In addition, the gap between the proposed model and the model under perfect-forecast policy is only about 8% regarding the number of deficiencies detected. Extensive sensitivity experiments show that the proposed PSCO scheduling model has stable performance and is always better than the current model adopted at ports.",0191-2615,Not found
A Continuum model for pedestrian flow with explicit consideration of crowd force and panic effects,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.006,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper proposes a second-order pedestrian model that comprises two types of equations: continuity equation and a set of transport equations. To complete the model, we develop Eikonal equations to explicitly consider the effects of the collective decisions of individuals and crowd pressure on pedestrian dynamics. Then, the crowd movement is simulated using a set of partial differential equations under appropriate initial and boundary conditions. Based on the stability requirements derived by performing a standard linear stability analysis, suitable parameters are selected to test the model in a numerical example. The proposed second-order system is then solved using the characteristic-wise third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO3) scheme, and the Eikonal equations are solved using the fast sweeping method. The numerical results indicate the effectiveness of the model because the derived local flow-density relationship produces a second peak in the high-density region, which is consistent with previous empirical studies. Besides, the applicability of the model to an unstable condition is verified through the simulation of complex phenomena such as stop-and-go waves. Furthermore, the estimate of crowd pressure in the simulation results can be used as a risk-level indicator for crowd management and control.",0191-2615,Not found

Predictive user-based relocation through incentives in one-way car-sharing systems,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.008,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Car-sharing systems are an attractive alternative to private vehicles due to their benefits in terms of mobility and sustainability. However, the distribution of vehicles throughout the network in one-way systems is disturbed due to asymmetry and stochasticity in demand. As a consequence, vehicles need to be relocated to maintain an adequate service level. In this paper, we develop a user-based vehicle relocation approach through the incentivization of customers and a predictive model for the state of the system based on Markov chains. Our methods determine the optimal incentive as a trade-off between the cost of an incentive and the expected omitted demand loss while taking into account the value of time of customers. We introduce a learning algorithm that allows the operator to estimate unknown customer preferences to find the optimal incentive. Experimental results in an event-based simulation of a real system show that the use of incentives can significantly increase the service level and profitability of a car-sharing system and decrease the number of staff members needed to balance the vehicles in the system. Thereby, incentives are a more sustainable alternative to staff-based relocations. Extensive sensitivity analyses show the prospective benefits in terms of customer flexibility and the robustness of our results to varying customer preferences.",0191-2615,Not found

We first propose a user equilibrium model for the commuting problem in the EV corridor, by taking into account both departure time and travel path choices. Departure time equilibriums for bottleneck-constrained road paths with and without en-route charging are respectively derived. We also give a condition that ensures all EV users arrive early at the destination for the path with road and charging bottlenecks (serial bottlenecks), and discuss the existence and uniqueness of the user equilibrium solution. Based on the proposed EV corridor model, we further develop a joint optimization model of charging location and road capacity allocation, for two bottleneck-constrained road paths, to manage traffic flows.

Integrated flight scheduling and fleet assignment with improved supply-demand interactions,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.001,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Flight scheduling and fleet assignment are important steps of an airline planning process. In light of the reciprocal relationship between air transport supply and demand, a key element of these models is to devise effective methods to both incorporating estimation of total market demand and allocating passengers over the available itineraries in a specific market.

Using a nested logit formulation, we jointly model competition among air travel itineraries and appraise the contribution of specific itinerary attributes to demand generation, therefore yielding a more comprehensive and explicit representation of supply-demand interactions. Computational testing based on realistic problem instances reveals that the model can optimize mid-size hub-and-spoke networks within reasonable time. Further analyses illustrate the benefits that can be derived from the application of the proposed approach using real-world data for a major European airline.

An accumulation of preference: Two alternative dynamic models for understanding transport choices,10.1016/j.trb.2021.04.001,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Interest in behavioural realism has gradually led to the introduction of alternatives to random utility models (RUMs) as a paradigm for representing choice behaviour, with notable interest, for example, in random regret minimisation (RRM). These more general models continue to rely on a framework where a single value function is calculated for each alternative in each choice setting, and the choice probabilities are calculated by comparing these value functions across alternatives. By contrast, research in mathematical psychology has used a more dynamic approach, where the preference value of each alternative updates over time in a given situation while the decision maker is deliberating about the choice to make. These accumulator models are well suited to accommodating a variety of context effects, and have been shown to give good performance for data collected in laboratory-based settings. The present paper considers two such accumulator models, namely decision field theory (DFT) and the multi-attribute linear ballistic accumulator (MLBA), and addresses limitations that have prevented their use in travel behaviour research. The methodological additions include the ability to capture the influence of socio-demographics, the presence of underlying preferences for specific alternatives, and/or the representation of attributes that have opposite effects on choice probabilities. We develop what we believe to be the first in-depth simultaneous comparison of DFT and MLBA with typical discrete choice models, and test both DFT and MLBA on a revealed preference dataset. We find that each model outperforms typical RUM and RRM implementations for both in-sample estimation and out-of-sample prediction, including in a large scale simulation experiment.",0191-2615,Not found

Contracts’ selection and pricing decisions are integrated to generate multiple combinatorial bids. Our paper is the first to propose an exact non-enumerative method to solve this NP-Hard problem. Our computational results demonstrate that optimal solutions can be obtained on instances with up to 50 contracts.

Enforcing optimal routing through dynamic avoidance maps,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.002,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper presents a new concept for operating traffic management at a sizeable urban scale. The overall principle is to partition the network into multiple regions, where traffic conditions should remain optimal. Instead of monitoring the inflow, like for perimeter control, deviations in regional mean speed compared to a reference value are transformed into avoidance levels by a centralized controller. That information is broadcasted to vehicles through a public avoidance map. The onboard navigation systems then interpret this map to deliver individual route guidance according to the avoidance levels. In that way, the concept tends to distribute vehicles in the network optimally while preserving privacy. In addition to the controller parameters itself, three other critical parameters define the system: the safety distance, the controller time horizon, and the region sizes. Thorough sensitivity analysis leads to the optimal setting. The concept is proven effective using microsimulation for both a Manhattan and a realistic network. The total travel time is improved by about 15% when traffic is severely congested compared to the uncontrolled case. In the meantime, the mean individual travel distance increase for rerouted vehicles is kept below 10%. Those results have been obtained with a simple decentralized reactive control framework, i.e., an individual proportional feedback system independently governs each region. More advanced formulations introducing cooperation between the regions are also tested. In a nutshell, this paper is a proof of concept for a new control system that appears both practical and valuable to alleviate congestion in urban areas. © 2021 The Authors.

Experimental study on properties of lightly congested flow,10.1016/j.trb.2021.04.013,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Congested traffic flow exhibits rather complex properties of spatiotemporal evolution, e.g. stop-and-go waves, phantom jams, wide scattering of flow-density data, etc. To the best of our knowledge, previous car-following experiments on circular tracks only studied heavily congested flow. The experimental study concerning lightly congested flow, which exhibits different stability characteristic from heavily congested flow, is still lacking. To fill this gap, very recently we conducted a large-scale car-following experiment on an 812-meter circumference circuit with densities of 0.049, 0.043 and 0.037 m−1. The flow-density relation of the experiment is highly consistent with the empirical one, which indicates that the driving behavior in the experiment is similar to that in real traffic. By comparing the macroscopic spatiotemporal evolution diagrams in different runs under the same global density, we found that the traffic flow exhibits stochastic features with even the same initial conditions. We analyzed the car-following behavior and its relation to the macroscopic traffic flow evolution. It was found that the indifference region, the sensitivity of drivers, and the strength of stochasticity all contribute to the macroscopic traffic flow evolution pattern. Specifically, the traffic flow becomes more homogeneous in time-space with the expansion of indifference region, the overall decrease of sensitivity and the decrease of stochasticity strength. The roles of stochasticity and speed adaptation were further investigated. It was found that stronger traffic oscillations correspond to stronger stochasticity and speed adaptation. The analysis for competition between the two effects indicated that the ratio between speed adaptation effect and stochastic effect grows with the increase of the oscillation amplitude. The stochastic effect plays a dominant role in car following when the oscillation amplitude is small; its influence wanes and the speed adaptation effect grows to outweigh the influence of the stochastic effect as oscillation amplitude grows. These findings are expected to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism that produces the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of lightly congested flow and the data collected in this study can be used to test traffic models and theories.",0191-2615,Not found
Noise-induced instability of a class of stochastic higher order continuum traffic models,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.013,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Traffic flow dynamics are complex and nonlinear, and depend on the interactions of many vehicles moving together. Especially, the stochastic driving behavior is a significant reason for many complex traffic phenomena such as the capacity drop or traffic instabilities without lane changing. To date, there has not been a satisfactory general theory that can be consistently applied to represent such traffic flow conditions. While there have been efforts to introduce stochastic behavior in deterministic traffic flow models, these attempts have mainly focused on the small stochastic fluctuations around the theoretical equilibrium fundamental diagram or model parameters. Little attention has been given to the physical relevance of the stochastic component, and the existing models do not consider large deviations from the equilibrium fundamental diagram that occur in the transient phases of traffic flow (i.e acceleration and/or deceleration). The goal of this paper is thus to improve current continuum traffic models, with the primary focus on the stochastic behavior arising in the acceleration and/or deceleration process. Our analytical results show noise-induced (long-wave length) stop-and-go waves in the low speed regime, which conform to the recent empirical findings. In addition, it is found that the stochasticity can lead to situations in which a bottleneck sometimes is activated and at other times is not activated under identical traffic demand.",0191-2615,Not found
Constructing a fundamental diagram for traffic flow with automated vehicles: Methodology and demonstration,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.011,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Increasingly, commercial vehicles are equipped with automated vehicle (AV) features such as adaptive cruise control systems. The AV feature can automatically control the headway between the current vehicle and the preceding vehicle in an adaptive manner. The automatic control may lead to significantly different car- following motions compared with those of human-driven vehicles, which challenges the applicability of classic traffic flow theory to emerging road traffic with AVs. To investigate the impacts of commercial AVs on traffic flow, this paper proposes a general methodology that combines both empirical experiments and theoretical models to construct a fundamental diagram (FD), i.e., the foundation for traffic flow theory for AV traffic. To demonstrate the empirical experiment settings, we collected high-resolution trajectory data with multiple commercial AVs following one another in a platoon with different headway settings. The field experiment results revealed that the traditional triangular FD structure remains applicable to describe the traffic flow characteristics of AV traffic. Further, by comparing the FDs between AVs and human-driven vehicles, it was found that although the shortest AV headway setting can significantly improve road capacity, other headway settings may decrease road capacity compared with existing human-driven-vehicle traffic. It was also found that headway settings may affect the stability of traffic flow, which has been revealed by theoretical studies but was first verified by empirical AV data. With these findings, mixed traffic flow FDs were derived by incorporating different headway settings and AV penetration rates. The method proposed in this paper, including experiment designs, data collection approaches, traffic flow characteristics analyses, and mixed traffic flow FD construction approaches, can serve as a methodological foundation for studying future mixed traffic flow features with uncertain and evolving AV technologies.",0191-2615,Not found

The basic Locomotive Scheduling Problem (LSP), which depicts one of the most crucial optimization problems occurring in the railway industry, aims at assigning a fleet of locomotives to a set of scheduled trains such that the overall costs are minimized.

This requires the incorporation of special maintenance constraints that increase the computational difficulty of the problem significantly. In our previous work, we proposed a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation for solving the LSPM and continue in this paper by investigating different heuristic solution approaches, i.e., an Overlapping Rolling Horizon Approach and a Two-Stage Matheuristic (2SMH).

A new spatial count data model with time-varying parameters,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.015,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Recent crash frequency studies incorporate spatiotemporal correlations, but these studies have two key limitations – i) none of these studies accounts for temporal variation in model parameters; and ii) Gibbs sampler suffers from convergence issues due to non-conjugacy. To address the first limitation, we propose a new count data model that identifies the underlying temporal patterns of the regression parameters while simultaneously allowing for time-varying spatial correlation. The model is also extended to incorporate heterogeneity in non-temporal parameters across spatial units. We tackle the second shortcoming by deriving a Gibbs sampler that ensures conditionally conjugate posterior updates for all model parameters. To this end, we take the advantages of Pólya-Gamma data augmentation and forward filtering backward sampling algorithm. After validating the properties of the Gibbs sampler in a Monte Carlo study, the advantages of the proposed specification are demonstrated in an empirical application to uncover relationships between crash frequency spanning across nine years and pavement characteristics. Model parameters exhibit practically significant temporal patterns (i.e., temporal instability). For example, the safety benefits of better pavement ride quality are estimated to increase over time.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimizing coordinated vehicle platooning: An analytical approach based on stochastic dynamic programming,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.009,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Platooning connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can improve traffic and fuel efficiency. However, scalable platooning operations require junction-level coordination, which has not been well studied. In this paper, we study the coordination of vehicle platooning at highway junctions. We consider a setting where CAVs randomly arrive at a highway junction according to a general renewal process. When a CAV approaches the junction, a system operator determines whether the CAV will merge into the platoon ahead according to the positions and speeds of the CAV and the platoon. We formulate a Markov decision process to minimize the discounted cumulative travel cost, i.e., fuel consumption plus travel delay, over an infinite time horizon. We show that the optimal policy is threshold-based: the CAV will merge with the platoon if and only if the difference between the CAV’s and the platoon’s predicted times of arrival at the junction is less than a constant threshold. We also propose two ready-to-implement algorithms to derive the optimal policy. Comparison with the classical value iteration algorithm implies that our approach explicitly incorporating the characteristics of the optimal policy is significantly more efficient in terms of computation. Importantly, we show that the optimal policy under Poisson arrivals can be obtained by solving a system of integral equations. We also validate our results in simulation with a Real-time Strategy (RTS) using real traffic data. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method yields better performance compared with the conventional method.",0191-2615,Not found
A mean-field Markov decision process model for spatial-temporal subsidies in ride-sourcing markets,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.014,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Ride-sourcing services are increasingly popular because of their ability to accommodate on-demand travel needs. A critical issue faced by ride-sourcing platforms is the supply-demand imbalance, as a result of which drivers may spend substantial time on idle cruising and picking up remote passengers. Some platforms attempt to mitigate the imbalance by providing relocation guidance for idle drivers who may have their own self-relocation strategies and decline to follow the suggestions. Platforms then seek to induce drivers to system-desirable locations by offering them subsidies. This paper proposes a mean-field Markov decision process (MF-MDP) model to depict the dynamics in ride-sourcing markets with mixed agents, whereby the platform aims to optimize some objectives from a system perspective using spatial-temporal subsidies with predefined subsidy rates, and a number of drivers aim to maximize their individual income by following certain self-relocation strategies. To solve the model more efficiently, we further develop a representative-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a representative driver to model the decision-making process of multiple drivers. This approach is shown to achieve significant computational advantages, faster convergence, and better performance. Using case studies, we demonstrate that by providing some spatial-temporal subsidies, the platform is able to well balance a short-term objective of maximizing immediate revenue and a long-term objective of maximizing service rate, while drivers can earn higher income.",0191-2615,Not found
Subsidy or minimum requirement? Regulation of port adaptation investment under disaster ambiguity,10.1016/j.trb.2021.04.006,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This paper models two commonly adopted regulatory polices (the minimum requirement regulation vs. subsidy) on port adaptation investment to mitigate the damage caused by climate change-related disasters. The ambiguity of the disaster occurrence probability and the decision makers’ attitudes towards risk are explicitly modelled. It is found, under the minimum requirement regulation, ports balance the option of increasing their adaptation vs. reducing their economic activities. In comparison, subsidies promote adaptation without introducing any incentive for ports to reduce outputs, but they can be less efficient than minimum requirement regulations in addressing market failures, such as that caused by a spill-over externality. The ambiguity of disasters changes the optimal designs of minimum requirement regulation and subsidy policy but does not change their relative ranking qualitatively. Decision makers’ risk attitudes also play important roles. Higher degrees of pessimism (more risk aversion) lead to lower port outputs but can also increase the level of port adaptation to achieve full insurance against disaster loss. Higher degrees of pessimism also make the government more conservative to intervene in the ports’ adaptation and thus less likely to impose the two regulatory policies. Our analysis also explains why it is justified for the government to withhold intervention under ambiguity, and also shows that the ambiguity does not necessarily bring worse expected social welfare.",0191-2615,Not found

The assumption of strongly monotone increasing path delay operators is not needed. In its place, we assume path delay operators are merely weakly monotone increasing, a property assured by Lipschitz continuity, while inverse demand functions are strongly monotone decreasing. Lipschitz continuity of path delay is a very mild regularity condition. As such, nonmonotone delay operators may be weakly monotone increasing and satisfy our convergence criteria, provided inverse demand functions are strongly monotone decreasing. We illustrate convergence for nonmonotone path delays via a numerical example.",0191-2615,Not found

It is a strategy commonly used to increase vehicle speeds and reduce patron travel times. The present paper develops a continuous approximation model to optimally design a select form of skip-stop service, termed AB-type service. The model accounts for demand patterns that slowly vary over space. An efficient heuristic is developed to obtain solutions. These are shown to be near-optimal for a variety of numerical examples. Results also indicate that optimal AB-type designs outperform optimized all-stop service in a variety of cases. The AB-type service is found to be especially competitive when travel demands are high, trip origins are unevenly distributed along a corridor, and patrons have relatively high values of time. In these cases, AB-type service is found to reduce system costs by as much as 8%.",0191-2615,Not found
Calibration of stochastic link-based fundamental diagram with explicit consideration of speed heterogeneity,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.021,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This study aims to establish a stochastic link-based fundamental diagram (FD) with explicit consideration of two available sources of uncertainty: speed heterogeneity, indicated by the speed variance within an interval, and rainfall intensity. A stochastic structure was proposed to incorporate the speed heterogeneity into the traffic stream model, and the random-parameter structures were applied to reveal the unobserved heterogeneity in the mean speeds at an identical density. The proposed stochastic link-based FD was calibrated and validated using real-world traffic data obtained from two selected road segments in Hong Kong. Traffic data were obtained from the Hong Kong Journey Time Indication System operated by the Hong Kong Transport Department during January 1 to December 31, 2017. The data related to rainfall intensity were obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory. A two-stage calibration based on Bayesian inference was proposed for estimating the stochastic link-based FD parameters. The predictive performances of the proposed model and three other models were compared using K-fold cross-validation. The results suggest that the random-parameter model considering the speed heterogeneity effect performs better in terms of both goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy. The effect of speed heterogeneity accounts for 18%–24% of the total heterogeneity effects on the variance of FD. In addition, there exists unobserved heterogeneity across the mean speeds at an identical density, and the rainfall intensity negatively affects the mean speed and its effect on the variance of FD differs at different densities.",0191-2615,Not found
On the application of variational theory to urban networks,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.019,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The well-known Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) theory is the fundamental pillar for most macroscopic traffic models. In the past, many methods were developed to numerically derive solutions for LWR problems. Examples for such numerical solution schemes are the cell transmission model, the link transmission model, and the variational theory (VT) of traffic flow. So far, the eulerian formulation of VT found applications in the fields of traffic modelling, macroscopic fundamental diagram estimation, multi-modal traffic analyses, and data fusion. However, these studies apply VT only at the link or corridor level. To the best of our knowledge, there is no methodology yet to apply VT at the network level. We address this gap by developing a VT-based framework applicable to networks. Our model allows us to account for source terms (e.g. inflows and outflows at intersections) and the propagation of spillbacks between adjacent corridors consistent with kinematic wave theory (KWT). We show that the trajectories extracted from a microscopic simulation fit the predicted traffic states from our model for a simple intersection with both source terms and spillbacks. We also use this simple example to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed model, and the ability to model complex bottlenecks. Additionally, we apply our model to the Sioux Falls network and again compare the results to those from a microscopic KWT simulation. Our results indicate a close fit of traffic states, but with substantially lower computational cost. The developed methodology is useful for extending existing VT applications to the network level, for network-wide traffic state estimations in real-time, or other applications within a model-based optimization framework.",0191-2615,Not found

Simulations of these scenarios validate the formulas. In the most favorable cases carpooling reduces the vehicle-kilometers driven by all users by a few percent.

Directional assessment of traffic flow extremes,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.006,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"We analyze extremes of traffic flow profiles composed of traffic counts over a day. The data is essentially curves and determining which trajectory should be classified as extreme is not straight forward. To assess the extremes of the traffic flow curves in a coherent way, we use a directional definition of extremeness and apply the dimension reduction technique called principal component analysis (PCA) in an asymmetric norm. In the classical PCA one reduces the dimensions of the data by projecting it in the direction of the largest variation of the projection around its mean. In the PCA in an asymmetric norm one chooses the projection directions, such that the asymmetrically weighted variation around a tail index – an expectile – of the data is the largest possible. Expectiles are tail measures that generalize the mean in a similar manner as quantiles generalize the median. Focusing on the asymmetrically weighted variation around an expectile of the data, we find the appropriate projection directions and the low dimensional representation of the traffic flow profiles that uncover different patterns in their extremes. Using the traffic flow data from the roundabout on Ernst-Reuter-Platz in the city center of Berlin, Germany, we estimate, visualize and interpret the resulting principal expectile components. The corresponding directional extremes of the traffic flow profiles are simple to identify and to connect to their location- and time-related specifics. Their shapes are driven by their scores on each principal expectile component which is useful for extracting and analyzing traffic patterns. We utilize the double cross-validation for determining the optimal component number and forecast traffic flow profiles based on the estimated model. Our approach to dimensionality reduction towards the directional extremes of traffic flow extends the related methodological basis and gives promising results for subsequent analysis, prediction and control of the reflected patterns.",0191-2615,Not found
A new transit assignment model based on line and node strategies,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.018,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Passengers traveling on transit networks involve two kinds of decision-making strategies: deciding which lines are attractive at an origin or transfer node (denoted line strategy, LS), or deciding which node to transfer at when riding a line (denoted node strategy, NS). Combining these two strategies, this paper proposes a novel variational inequality formulation for the user equilibrium passenger assignment problem. The inclusion of the NS eliminates the need for passenger assignment on a large augmented graph, reducing the modeling complexity and making it easier to track all passengers’ travel routes. Moreover, constraints on the maximal number of transfers—which are crucial in practical decision-making on transit networks—are explicitly included, further drastically reducing the set of passengers’ feasible strategies. Furthermore, some extant strategy-based transit assignment models are shown to be a special case of the proposed model when the transfer constraint is removed. Finally, the properties of the proposed model are illustrated on a small network, and the model and algorithm exhibit huge advantages on the chosen transit subnetwork of Beijing.",0191-2615,Not found
Linear location-dependent parking fees and integrated daily commuting patterns with late arrival and early departure in a linear city,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.012,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This paper extends the work of Zhang et al. (2008) to investigate the daily commuting patterns allowing both late arrival in the morning and early departure in the evening in a linear city. Given the fixed parking locations of morning commuters, the Nash equilibrium principle is employed to formulate commuters’ departure time choice in the evening and the user equilibrium principle in terms of daily travel cost is adopted to formulate the departure time choice of morning commuters. A combined regime of linear location-dependent parking fee and time-varying road toll is then proposed to reduce the total social cost (TSC) for the linear city. All the possible equilibrium traffic flows are analytically derived. The analytical results show that (1) commuters, who arrive at work early in the morning, may not depart early in the evening, but their evening trip costs must be lower; (2) when the parking spaces become denser, the evening commute starts earlier and the morning commute starts later; (3) a linear location-dependent parking fee could either advance or postpone the earliest departure time in the morning; (4) three parking modes, distinguished by the order in which commuters park, occur successively as the parking fee rate increases; and (5) an appropriate parking fee can always improve the system efficiency, but no matter how the parking fee is changed, it is impossible to completely eliminate the efficiency loss in the morning. Furthermore, a parking reservation regime joint with time-varying road toll is designed to minimize the TSC for the linear city.

Dynamical systems in the considered class are described as differential inclusions whereby the routing matrix is constant and the outflow from each cell in the network is limited by a control that is a Lipschitz continuous function of the state of the network. This framework finds application in particular within traffic signal control, whereby it is common that an empty queue can be allowed to have more outflow than vehicles in the queue. While models for this scenario have previously been presented for open-loop outflow controls, our result ensures the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the network flow dynamics in the case Lipschitz continuous feedback controllers.",0191-2615,Not found

The linearization of the derived switching nonlinear dynamics is conducted considering the accumulation heterogeneity. A Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is employed for gating the flow exchange between regions to minimize network congestion.

Modeling hurricane evacuation behavior using a dynamic discrete choice framework,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.003,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Predicting evacuation-related choices of households during a hurricane is of paramount importance to any emergency management system. Central to this problem is the identification of socio-demographic factors and hurricane characteristics that influence an individual’s decision to stay or evacuate. However, decision makers in such conditions do not make a single choice but constantly evaluate current and anticipated conditions before opting to stay or evacuate. We model this behavior using a finite-horizon dynamic discrete choice framework in which households may choose to evacuate or wait in time periods prior to a hurricane’s landfall. In each period, an individual’s utility depends not only on his/her current choices and the present values of the influential variables, but also involves discounted expected utilities from future choices should one decide to postpone their decision to evacuate. Assuming generalized extreme value (GEV) errors, a nested algorithm involving a dynamic program and a maximum likelihood method is used to estimate model parameters.

However, the fact that the size of DARP grows exponentially with number of requests and number of available seats renders the current solution methodologies inadequate for online applications. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a general framework that shifts much of the computational burden of the optimization problems that need to be solved into an offline phase, thereby addressing on-demand requests with fast and high-quality solutions in real time.

Modeling and managing the morning commute problem with park-and-ride-sharing,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.004,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In this paper, park-and-ride-sharing (P&RS) is proposed to manage morning peak hour congestion in a monocentric linear city, where there is a multilane highway with a single bottleneck connecting the residential area and the central business district (CBD). To realize ride-sharing matching, a ride-sharing parking lot (RSPL) and a ride-sharing meeting point (RSMP) are set up somewhere between the origin and the bottleneck. To encourage ride-sharing participation, the lanes of the highway are physically divided into high occupancy vehicle (HOV) and general purpose (GP) lanes for only ride-sharing vehicles and non-ride-sharing vehicles, respectively. The user equilibrium principle in terms of generalized travel cost is adopted to formulate commuters’ mode choice and arrival time choice at the RSMP. It is demonstrated that there exist three possible equilibrium ride-sharing matching patterns and three possible equilibrium traffic flow patterns. All possible equilibrium ride-sharing matching and traffic flow patterns are analytically derived. In addition, to minimize total system cost (TSC), three break-even parking charge schemes are designed under the case that all parking lots are managed by the government.

Robust matching-integrated vehicle rebalancing in ride-hailing system with uncertain demand,10.1016/j.trb.2021.05.015,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"With the rapid growth of the mobility-on-demand (MoD) market in recent years, ride-hailing companies have become an important element of the urban mobility system. There are two critical components in the operations of ride-hailing companies: driver–customer matching and vehicle rebalancing. In most previous literature, each component is considered separately, and performances of vehicle rebalancing models rely on the accuracy of future demand predictions. To better immunize rebalancing decisions against demand uncertainty, a novel approach, the matching-integrated vehicle rebalancing (MIVR) model, is proposed in this paper to incorporate driver–customer matching into vehicle rebalancing problems to produce better rebalancing strategies. The MIVR model treats the driver–customer matching component at an aggregate level and minimizes a generalized cost including the total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and the number of unsatisfied requests. For further protection against uncertainty, robust optimization (RO) techniques are introduced to construct a robust version of the MIVR model. Problem-specific uncertainty sets are designed for the robust MIVR model. The proposed MIVR model is tested against two benchmark vehicle rebalancing models using real ride-hailing demand and travel time data from New York City (NYC). The MIVR model is shown to have better performances by reducing customer wait times compared to benchmark models under most scenarios.

A contract shipper has a contract with the shipping company and negotiates a fixed minimum quantity, so that the shipping company can secure a steady revenue. The remaining containership slots are open to spot shippers, allowing the shipping company to obtain ad hoc revenue. The container slot allocation problem is investigated in this study using a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming model.

However, stop-skipping can shorten passenger journey time and also save on train operating costs.

Integrating these decisions is a challenging task, as these decisions affect passenger train transfer behavior, which in turn affects the entire passenger flow. This study is a first attempt at integrating these decisions while simultaneously taking into account the passenger flow.

The road network may even become disconnected, impeding accessibility between disaster-stricken areas and critical locations such as hospitals, relief aid depots and transportation hubs. In the immediate response phase, a set of blocked edges should be selected and restored to reconnect the transportation network. While locations of the disrupted roads can be identified using drone or satellite images, an accurate estimation of time to restore a road segment can be carried out only after expert observations on the field. In this article, we study a post-disaster road restoration problem modeled on an undirected edge-weighted graph with k blocked edges, where the unblocking time of a blocked edge is revealed online once the road restoration team visits an end-node of that blocked edge. The objective is to minimize the time at which the road network is reconnected. We first investigate the worst-case performance of online algorithms against offline optimal solutions by means of the competitive ratio. We prove that any online deterministic algorithm cannot achieve a competitive ratio better than 2 k − 1 . We also provide an optimal online algorithm that is proven to achieve this lower bound. In addition, to achieve good performance on realistic instances, we implement an algorithm that solves a mixed integer programming model each time new information is revealed. Since model solution is prohibitively time-consuming, we also propose a novel polynomial time online algorithm.

We propose two mechanisms – strategic route choice and tactical reroute – to ascribe flight en route inefficiency to these factors. In our framework, we first propose an efficient trajectory clustering algorithm to identify nominal routes that reveal both air traffic flow patterns and air route structures in the national airspace system. Second, we develop a tree-based searching algorithm that matches different causal factors to the identified nominal routes in a 4-dimensional manner. Third, we employ a discrete choice modeling framework to quantitatively understand the flight route choice process, and establish a linear model to understand the tactical reroute process. Finally, we estimate the contributions of the identified causal factors to flight inefficiency through counterfactual analysis. Numerical experiments based on 8 representative airport pairs suggest strong negative impact of convection and headwind on route choice process, while MIT, AFP and SAA only demonstrate negative effects on some pairs.

The market equilibrium is established based on a spatial driver–passenger matching model that determines the passenger wait time for both solo and pooling rides. We prove, under mild conditions, this system always has an equilibrium solution. Built on the market equilibrium, three variants of pricing problems are analyzed and compared, namely, (i) profit maximization, (ii) profit maximization subject to regulatory constraints, and (iii) social welfare maximization subject to a revenue-neutral constraint. A comprehensive case study is constructed using TNC data collected in the city of Chicago. We found pooling is desirable when demand is high but supply is scarce. However, its benefit diminishes quickly as the average en-route detour time (i.e., the difference between the average duration of solo and pooling trips) increases. Without regulations, a mixed strategy—providing both solo and pooling rides—not only achieves the highest profit and trip production in most scenarios, but also gains higher social welfare. The minimum wage policy can improve social welfare in the short term. However, in the long run, the TNC could react by limiting the size of the driver pool, and consequently, render the policy counterproductive, even pushing social welfare below the unregulated level. Moreover, by maintaining the supply and demand of ride-hail at an artificially high level, the minimum wage policy tends to exacerbate traffic congestion by depressing the use of collective modes (transit and pooling). A congestion tax policy that penalizes solo rides promotes pooling, but may harm social welfare. However, it promises to increase both social welfare and pooling ratio when jointly implemented with the minimum wage policy.",0191-2615,Not found
Mobility service design via joint optimization of transit networks and demand-responsive services,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.005,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This paper proposes a modeling framework to design an integrated mobility service system that is composed of a local demand-responsive transportation (DRT) component and a fixed-route transit network component.

The transit network provides backbone line-haul service to inter-zonal trips, while the DRT system targets intra-zonal trips as well as the first-mile and last-mile legs of inter-zonal trips. The system components can be broadly defined, and this paper considers, as examples, conventional non-shared taxi or ride-sharing for the DRT service, and regular bus, bus rapid transit (BRT), or metro for the backbone network. For quantitative analysis of the DRT services, new aspatial queuing network models are developed to capture various DRT operations for serving trips with randomly distributed origins and destinations (i.e., intra-zonal trips) and those with origins or destinations concentrated at a set of fixed transit stations (i.e., first- or last-mile trip legs) at the same time. Each queuing model is integrated with the transit network design model, through proper service region partition, to derive closed-form formulas for the agency and passenger costs. Then, we formulate constrained non-linear programs that simultaneously optimize the zone partition, the fleet size and repositioning operation for the local DRT service, as well as the spacing and headway of a grid transit network. We apply the proposed models to a variety of transit technologies and application scenarios, so as to demonstrate applicability of the models, and to show promising performance of the proposed systems.",0191-2615,Not found
Routing policy choice prediction in a stochastic network: Recursive model and solution algorithm,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.016,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"We propose a Recursive Logit (STD-RL) model for routing policy choice in a stochastic time-dependent (STD) network, where a routing policy is a mapping from states to actions on which link to take next, and a state is defined by node, time and information. A routing policy encapsulates travelers’ adaptation to revealed traffic conditions when making route choices. The STD-RL model circumvents choice set generation, a procedure with known issues related to estimation and prediction. In a given state, travelers make their link choice maximizing the sum of the utility of the outgoing link and the expected maximum utility until the destination (a.k.a. value function that is a solution to a dynamic programming problem). Existing recursive route choice models and the corresponding solution approaches are based on the assumption that network attributes are deterministic. Hence, they cannot be applied to stochastic networks which are the focus of this paper. We propose an efficient algorithm for solving the value function and its gradient, critical for parameter estimation. It is based on partitioning the state space and decomposing costly matrix operations into a series of simpler ones. We present numerical results using a synthetic network and a network in Stockholm, Sweden. The estimation running time has a 20-30 times speed-up due to matrix decomposition. The estimated model parameters have realistic interpretations. Specifically, travelers are more likely to be adaptive to realized travel times during a longer trip, and more sensitive to travel time when travel time variability is higher. The STD-RL model performs better in predicting route choices than the RL model in a corresponding static and deterministic network.",0191-2615,Not found
Feeder vessel routing and transshipment coordination at a congested hub port,10.1016/j.trb.2021.07.002,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"With increasing container-shipping traffic, congestion at transshipment hub ports happens from time to time incurring longer-than-expected waiting time for vessels and loss of transshipment connections. This situation is even worse for feeder companies, due to their relatively lower berthing priority. It is essential to design the feeder vessel routes and schedules in response to hub port congestion while ensuring efficient transshipment connection with their connecting long-haul services. In this paper, we study the vessel routing and transshipment coordination problem for a feeder liner company where only limited choices of berthing time slots are available at the hub port. We proposed an arc-based mixed integer linear programming model and a set partitioning model with the objective of minimizing the total operating and transshipment connection cost. Two solution approaches are developed (1) a branch-&-price exact algorithm that can solve instances with up to 30 ports to optimality within reasonable computational time; and (2) a column generation heuristic method that yields high-quality near-optimal solutions very efficiently without having to implement a full-scale branch-&-bound search. Computational experiments based on a real-world shipping network and randomly generated test instances confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the solution approaches. It is also demonstrated that, by integrating the hub port calling time decision with feeder vessel routing, transshipment coordination can be significantly enhanced even under hub port congestion situations.",0191-2615,Not found
Estimation of urban network capacity with second-best constraints for multimodal transport systems,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.011,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Transport network capacity enhancement is a significant aspect of urban transport planning and demand management, and a suitable measurement of the network capacity is of considerable importance. In this paper, the network capacity with second-best constraints (NCSC) is investigated to meet some specific development requirements of urban transport networks. Herein, the network capacity is restricted to an inferior “second-best solution”, due to various concerns/constraints regarding the public transport mode share, serviceability, and emissions, etc. For the sake of presentation, these constraints are termed as second-best constraints, and the NCSC problem can also be referred as second-best network capacity (SBNC) problem. A bi-level model is formulated to analyse the NCSC problem. The upper-level model maximizes the total origin-destination (OD) demand, which incorporates the second-best constraints into consideration. The lower-level model is a transport network equilibrium model, which measures the network performance under a given OD demand pattern. To better investigate some important second-best constraints (e.g., public transport mode share) and also the demand elasticity, the modelling framework is extended to a multimodal transport network. An exact solution method is developed for the NCSC problem; wherein, a modified improved gradient projection (MIGP) algorithm is designed for the lower-level multimodal flow equilibrium problem, and a tailored sensitivity analysis-based (SAB) method is employed for solving the NCSC problem. The proposed models and solution methods are verified by numerical examples, demonstrating that NCSC can be an efficient tool for transport planning and management.",0191-2615,Not found
Sharing economy of electric vehicle private charge posts,10.1016/j.trb.2021.09.001,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) leads to heightened demand for the charging infrastructure. More and more EV drivers install private charge posts, which can now be shared with others through certain mobile apps. This emerging phenomenon is becoming a prominent part of the sharing economy. To examine the impacts of post sharing on EV charging market, this study establishes game theory models on consumer choices among private, public, and shared options. Such peer-to-peer sharing and collaborative consumption redistribute the installation and operation costs of private charge posts in proportion to their increased utilization. Numerical analyses suggest that the sharing mode provides a win-win solution for charge post owners and non-owner consumers, as well as electricity distributors and public charging infrastructure operators. In the case of China, the estimated saving for charge post owners is between 20% and 50%, which can be translated into more non-government investment in the EV industry chain. The findings provide supporting evidence for policy-makers to promote private charge post sharing, especially with certain consumer subsidization at a reasonable level.",0191-2615,Not found
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Crowdsourced Urban Delivery,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.015,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper investigates the problem of assigning shipping requests to ad hoc couriers in the context of crowdsourced urban delivery. The shipping requests are spatially distributed each with a limited time window between the earliest time for pickup and latest time for delivery. The ad hoc couriers, termed crowdsourcees, also have limited time availability and carrying capacity. We propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to tackling this assignment problem. A deep Q network (DQN) algorithm is trained which entails two salient features of experience replay and target network that enhance the efficiency, convergence, and stability of DRL training. More importantly, this paper makes three methodological contributions: 1) presenting a comprehensive and novel characterization of crowdshipping system states that encompasses spatial-temporal and capacity information of crowdsourcees and requests; 2) embedding heuristics that leverage information offered by the state representation and are based on intuitive reasonings to guide specific actions to take, to preserve tractability and enhance efficiency of training; and 3) integrating rule-interposing to prevent repeated visiting of the same routes and node sequences during routing improvement, thereby further enhancing the training efficiency by accelerating learning. The computational complexities of the heuristics and the overall DQN training are investigated. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive numerical analysis. The results show the benefits brought by the heuristics-guided action choice, rule-interposing, and having time-related information in the state space in DRL training, the near-optimality of the solutions obtained, and the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods in terms of solution quality, computation time, and scalability.",0191-2615,Not found
The value of pre-trip information on departure time and route choice in the morning commute under stochastic traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.006,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Uncertainty in transportation systems can incur additional travel costs, but this adverse effect can be mitigated by providing travel information (Lindsey et al., 2014). It is not clear, however, if providing information always reduces system travel costs, particularly when the information provided is not one hundred percent accurate. This paper studies the welfare effects resulting from providing pre-trip information to morning commuters in a two-route network with bottlenecks, where the bottleneck capacity and free-flow travel time on each route are stochastic. We derive the expected travel costs at user equilibrium (UE) under stochastic conditions without and with pre-trip information first on one route, and later on two routes. Under this model, we examine how accurate and inaccurate information affect commuting costs. We find that full and accurate information is welfare-improving under stochastic bottleneck capacity and deterministic free-flow travel time. However, when bottleneck capacity and free-flow travel time are both stochastic, full and accurate information can be welfare-reducing for the two-route scenario. We show that the degree of correlation between routes in traffic conditions, the frequency and severity of bottleneck capacity drops, and the relationship between free-flow travel time and bottleneck capacity significantly affect the welfare effects of pre-trip information. Furthermore, when bottleneck capacity experiences severe drops, full information is more likely to be welfare-improving, even if the provided information is not completely accurate. These theoretical results are supplemented by numerical examples that show the welfare effects of providing pre-trip information to morning commuters.",0191-2615,Not found
Port adaptation to climate change and capacity investments under uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.009,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Seaports are crucial linkages in supply chains and account for over 80% of global trade by volume and 70% by value. They are also vulnerable to extreme weather events and sea level rise driven by climate change. Choosing the timing and scale of adaptation measures is challenging due to uncertainty about the rate of climate change, the frequency of disasters, and the irreversibility of investment in physical infrastructure. In addition to adaptation to climate change, ports must invest in throughput capacity to accommodate rising traffic volumes, reduce congestion, and maintain their long-term competitiveness. Ports also face uncertainty about shipping demand, which fluctuates with the business cycle, trade relations between countries, and other events. With this as background, we investigate the optimal timing and amount of port protection and capacity investments, as well as port charges, given uncertainty about climate-change-related threats and demand. The port gains better information over time, and thus has an option value to waiting. We show that the port charge is a decreasing function of capacity and an increasing function of protection. Capacity and protection are supermodular: a higher capacity warrants more protection, and better protection justifies higher capacity. If the disaster frequency rises, the port reduces its capacity and traffic volume but may increase or decrease protection investment. It prefers to postpone capacity investment if the disaster frequency can fall, but prefers to invest in advance if the climate is likely to get worse. It prefers to postpone protection investment if the disaster frequency changes a lot, or if the disaster frequency is currently low. The port also holds back on capacity and protection if future demand is highly uncertain. The results are largely the same for a landlord port, a service port, and a fully privatized port.",0191-2615,Not found
Synchronizing time-dependent transportation services: Reformulation and solution algorithm using quadratic assignment problem,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.008,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"A new modeling framework is developed in this paper to design a class of synchronized transportation services that can be formulated as a time-dependent synchronized service network design problem. The framework is established using a generic network representation for the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). As one of the fundamental combinatorial optimization problems, the QAP was introduced by Koopmans and Beckman (KB-QAP), in 1957, in the context of locating economic activities. Our proposed network-based QAP (NET-QAP) model not only linearizes the KB-QAP model but also generalizes the traditional QAP model as a special case with a symmetric network structure. The NET-QAP is utilized to formulate a time-dependent synchronized service network design problem to obtain an optimal schedule for both inbound and outbound services in a transshipment area, where commodities are collected from origins using the inbound services and distributed to their final destinations using the outbound services (after sorting and storage). From the view of the Gilmore-Lawler Bound (GLB), this paper explores a new branch and bound framework to solve the synchronizing NET-QAP problem. An extended GLB (E-QAP) is adopted in this research as a lower bound estimator for the first-stage assignment costs, based on several relaxed subproblems in the second-stage assignment. Then, the framework can also be applied to estimate the cost of sub-decisions that are involved in making a broader decision-making problem.

Enhancing the performance of one-way electric carsharing systems through the optimum deployment of fast chargers,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.001,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"One-way electric carsharing systems (OWECS) provide environmentally friendly mobility that enables users to commence and terminate their trips at a preselected station within a region. However, the operations of OWECS are complicated mainly due to: (i) unbalanced spatial and temporal distribution of demand which causes shortage or surplus of vehicles at stations, and (ii) excessive battery charging requirements that can reach up to 8 h. To ensure vehicle availability to their customers, carsharing companies hire personnel to relocate vehicles to restore the demand–supply balance, and increase the number of trips served. On the other hand, fast charging technologies can reduce the charging time drastically and can help carsharing companies to cope with the inefficiencies arising from excessive battery charging times. Therefore, fast charging technologies have the potential to enhance the operational performance of OWECS. In this study, we propose an integer programming model to determine the number and location of fast chargers to be implemented in OWECS while considering vehicle relocation and battery availability. We propose a time–space–battery level network model which allows to track battery levels of each vehicle. As the number of stations increases, the number of relocation variables created increases polynomially which makes the model intractable for problem instances found in real world OWECS. Therefore, we are introducing three heuristics, two of which are based on the concept of reduction of vehicle relocation variables, while the third heuristic is based on station grouping. The heuristics that are categorized as relocation reduction type heuristics generate only a fraction of all possible relocation arcs significantly reducing the number of relocation variables. The third heuristic reduces the number of variables by grouping the stations and solves the problem initially at an aggregate level using groups of stations instead of individual stations, while subsequently optimizes the location of chargers within each group of stations. We tested different approaches combining heuristics and tested them on smaller instances with exact solutions to identify the approach that is both accurate and efficient. We applied the selected heuristic approach on real-life instances taken from an OWECS based in Nice, France. The results suggest that the use of the proposed modeling and solution framework leads to a configuration of the network of fast and conventional chargers that improves the profitability and the number of trips served by the OWECS system.",0191-2615,Not found
Real-time integrated train rescheduling and rolling stock circulation planning for a metro line under disruptions,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.003,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"More and more unexpected events occur in metro systems, which may cause serious disturbances and even disruptions for the operation of trains. This paper studies an integrated train rescheduling and rolling stock circulation planning problem for the complete blockage situations in a metro line. We consider several key practical train operation constraints, including the maximum number of available rolling stocks, the turnaround constraints, the service connection constraints. This problem is viewed as a complex multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, where the objectives involve the deviations with respect to the timetable, the (partial) cancellations, and the headway deviations of train services. A two-stage approach is also developed to enhance the computational efficiency, where a smaller-size optimization problem is solved in the first stage, by considering a set of key turnaround stations only, while the original MILP problem is solved in the second stage by fixing some binary variables according to the first stage solution. In addition, we propose a heuristic technique that is based on introducing a new set of constraints to reduce the search space without eliminating potentially good solutions. Comprehensive experiments are investigated based on the practical data of Beijing Subway Lines, where the proposed integrated models and approaches yield much better solutions when compared with a widely used strategy, i.e., holding (waiting at station) strategy and the sequential approach. Moreover, the impacts of the complete blockage locations/durations and the effects of different weight settings in the multi-objective optimization are deeply analyzed.",0191-2615,Not found
A self-organizing policy for vehicle dispatching in public transit systems with multiple lines,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.004,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"In this paper, we propose and analyze an online, decentralized policy for dispatching vehicles in a multi-line public transit system. In the policy, vehicles arriving at a terminal station are assigned to the lines starting at the station in a round-robin fashion. Departure times are selected to minimize deviations from a certain target headway. We prove that this policy is self-organizing: given that there is a sufficient number of available vehicles, a timetable spontaneously emerges that meets the target headway of every line. Moreover, in case one of the vehicles breaks down, the remaining vehicles automatically redistribute over the network to re-establish such a timetable. We present both theoretical and numerical results on the time until a stable state is reached and on how quickly the system recovers after the breakdown of a vehicle. Experiments on three real-world transit systems show that our policy performs well, even if not all assumptions required for the theoretical analysis are met: if there are enough vehicles, the realized headways are typically close to the target headways. These promising results suggest that our self-organizing policy could be useful in situations where centralized dispatching is impractical or simply impossible due to an abundance of disruptions or the absence of information systems.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal build-operate-transfer road contracts under information asymmetry and uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.005,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This study investigates optimal build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts for toll roads under asymmetric and uncertain information concerning the construction cost of a private firm. In such a contract, the choice of toll, capacity and subsidy is made as a function of the marginal construction cost, reported by the firm, to maximize the expected social welfare, while ensuring that the firm has incentive to participate and no incentive to misreport the cost. By investigating the properties of the optimal contract, we find that enticing the firm to report its information truthfully will increase the optimal volume/capacity ratio of the BOT road. It also causes a loss in social welfare. However, a higher extent of information asymmetry will not necessarily yield greater loss in social welfare, and the effect of the extent of information asymmetry on welfare loss differs when it follows different probability distributions. We also show that the effects of information asymmetry and uncertainty on the BOT contract are amplified by each other. Nevertheless, the welfare loss is not necessarily amplified.",0191-2615,Not found
Spatial pricing in ride-sourcing markets under a congestion charge,10.1016/j.trb.2021.07.004,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper studies the optimal spatial pricing for a ride-sourcing platform subject to a congestion charge. The platform determines the ride prices over the transportation network to maximize its profit, while the regulatory agency imposes the congestion charge to reduce traffic congestion in the urban core. A network economic equilibrium model is proposed to capture the intimate interactions among passenger demand, driver supply, passenger and driver waiting times, platform pricing, vehicle repositioning and flow balance over the transportation network. The overall optimal pricing problem is cast as a non-convex program. An algorithm is proposed to approximately compute its optimal solution, and a tight upper bound is established to evaluate its performance loss with respect to the globally optimal solution. Using the proposed model, we compare the impacts of three forms of congestion charge: (a) a one-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles that enter the congestion area; (b) a bi-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles that enter or exit the congestion area; (c) a trip-based congestion charge on all ride-sourcing trips. We show that the one-directional congestion charge not only reduces the ride-sourcing traffic in the congestion area, but also reduces the travel cost outside the congestion zone and benefits passengers in these underserved areas. We establish that in all congestion charge schemes the largest share of the tax burden is carried by the platforms, as opposed to passengers and drivers. We further show that compared to other congestion charges, the one-directional cordon charge is more effective in congestion mitigation: to achieve the same congestion-mitigation target, it imposes a smaller cost on passengers, drivers, and the platform. On the other hand, compared with the other charges, the trip-based congestion charge is more effective in revenue-raising: to raise the same tax revenue, it leads to a smaller loss to passengers, drivers, and the platform. We validate these results through realistic numerical studies for San Francisco.",0191-2615,Not found
Calculating conditional passenger travel time distributions in mixed schedule- and frequency-based public transport networks using Markov chains,10.1016/j.trb.2021.06.020,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Calculation of passenger travel time distributions in public transport networks is important for the evaluation of the level of service provided to passengers. Passenger travel times are deterministic for punctual and uncongested networks, but in reality usually have random fluctuations caused by vehicle delays and other incidents. Advanced methods are therefore needed to calculate the passenger travel time distribution between a given origin and destination. This paper presents a novel approach for calculating the travel time distribution from origin to destination based on vehicle delays and possible missed connections in a mixed schedule- and frequency-based public transport network. Markov chains are used to model the network, making the travel time from the origin to the destination phase-type distributed. The approach is flexible with regard to the specification of vehicle travel times and provides the distribution of passenger travel times without any need for simulation. Additionally, it facilitates detailed analyses of passenger travel times conditional on the usage of specific line segments or stops.

Governments usually improve sustainability dimensions in freight transportation by imposing taxes on transportation systems. Therefore, they should extend their knowledge on interactions between sustainability dimensions and how their interventions affect each dimension. In this regard, we analyze competition between two freight transportation systems in the context of government intervention. These systems include road and intermodal road–rail transportation modes, where the latter is regarded as an environmentally sustainable mode. A sequential game is addressed to analyze the duopoly competition. In the upper level, a government, as a Stackelberg leader, imposes taxes on fuel usage based on environmental, economic, and social concerns. In the lower level, a Nash game is developed to analyze price competition in the transportation market. Our analyses reveal that: (a) Given a fixed level of the consumers' loyalty to their specific transportation systems, economic and social sustainability are consistent with each other, while they conflict with environmental sustainability. (b) Economic risks increase economic sustainability requested by the transportation systems. Such a relationship and the mentioned conflict between environmental and economic sustainability imply that a reduction of economic risks by the government indirectly contributes to environmental sustainability. (c) An increase in the consumers' loyalty simultaneously improves the three sustainability dimensions. (d) The energy efficiency improvements of the transportation systems may pose adverse environmental and social effects, called the rebound effects. Moreover, government intervention effectively eliminates such rebound effects.

A New Econometric Approach for Modeling Several Count Variables: A Case Study of Crash Frequency Analysis by Crash Type and Severity,10.1016/j.trb.2021.09.008,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"There is limited adoption of research modeling crash severity frequency considering different crash types due to the challenge associated with analyzing large number of dependent variables. The proposed research contributes to burgeoning econometric and safety literature by developing a joint modeling approach that can accommodate for several dependent variables within a parsimonious structure. By recasting the analysis levels for dependent variables, the proposed approach allows for flexible consideration of crashes by type and severity within a single framework. Specifically, we employ a Panel Mixed Negative Binomial- Generalized Ordered Probit Fractional Spilt (PMNB-GOPFS) model where the first component (NB) accommodates for crash frequency by crash type and the later component (GOPFS) studies the fraction of severity outcome for different crash types. The proposed model system increases interaction between dependent variables through observed variables thus reducing the dependency on unobserved interactions across dependent variables. Thus, the proposed approach allows for the estimation of parsimonious specifications reducing the need for computationally intensive simulation based estimation. The proposed system is also flexible to accommodate for common unobserved effects including: 1) common unobserved factors simultaneously affecting crash counts of different crash types; 2) common unobserved factors simultaneously affecting crash severity proportions of different crash types; and 3) common unobserved factors that simultaneously impact crash counts and severity proportions by different crash types. The model system performance is illustrated using a simulation study. The empirical analysis was conducted using zonal level crash count data for the year 2016 from Central Florida while considering a comprehensive set of exogenous variables including roadway, built environment, land-use, traffic and sociodemographic characteristics. To illustrate the applicability of our proposed system, we carried out a comparison exercise between our proposed joint PMNB-GOPFS and the traditional multivariate system for predicting crash counts across different crash severities. The resulting goodness of fit measures clearly highlight the superior/equivalent performance of the proposed PMNB-GOPFS model over the traditional RPMNB model with less than half the number of parameters. The proposed framework can predict several dimensions including total crash counts, total crash counts by crash types, crash counts for each severity level and finally, proportions and counts of crashes for each crash type by severity.",0191-2615,Not found

Through this service mode, a company provides free valet charging services to users that are far away from charging stations, and users can request the fee-based service when they are unwilling to charge electric vehicles themselves. The valet charging service is a new service mode that promises to alleviate users’ worries regarding the lack of nearby charging stations. However, whether such a mode truly benefits a specified system remains open to careful study. We build the charging station locating and sizing model with the valet charging service under demand uncertainty.

Two travel modes, namely on-demand and frequency-based autonomous vehicles (AVs), are used for commuting between the suburb and urban core. Each resident attempts to maximize his/her individual utility with consideration to environment quality by choosing a residential location, travel mode, departure time, and non-housing composite consumption good within an expenditure budget. The traffic equilibria are analytically derived for two right-of-way policies, namely (i) the two travel modes sharing the right-of-way and (ii) frequency-based AVs-priority, with consideration of the effect of AVs on travel and urban characteristics. It was found from the analytical results that at any level of AV automation, adopting the frequency-based AVs-priority policy can reduce travel cost for suburban residents while alleviating traffic congestion. Furthermore, an increase in AV automation level results in an increase in expected trip time if the highway capacity is less elastic than the value of travel time for on-demand AVs with respect to the automation level. In addition, if the environment quality depends solely on the residential density, with an increasing level of AV automation, the suburban population and the number of residents using on-demand AVs increase, the land rent in the urban core reduces, the suburb expands, and the utility for all residents increases. These findings help to provide a better understanding of the interactions between AVs, travel and urban characteristics, and serve as a valuable reference to transportation-urban planning in the era of driving automation.",0191-2615,Not found
The consistent vehicle routing problem considering path consistency in a road network,10.1016/j.trb.2021.09.005,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This paper investigates a new variant of the consistent vehicle routing problem considering path consistency based on the underlying road network (ConVRP R N ). It is the problem of determining a set of consistent paths for vehicles within a certain period (e.g. a week). We propose a flexible strategy to achieve path consistency, providing a discount for the cost of roads that are traversed every day. The objective is to minimize the total travel costs considering the discount for the paths’ consistent parts. We formulate the problem as a set partitioning model and a general arc-flow model, and then solve the problem by a branch-price-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm is based on a two-layer network, including an underlying road-network graph (lower layer) and a serial of customer-based graphs (upper layer). Furthermore, an innovative aggregation technique is proposed to accelerate the algorithm, which is specifically designed for ConVRP R N . Finally, we construct a road network based on the real road-network structure of West Jordan and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a set of numerical experiments. The impact of consistency discount is also analyzed to provide information and inspiration for tactical decision making.",0191-2615,Not found
Minimising emissions in traffic assignment with non-monotonic arc costs,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.007,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The modelling of vehicle emissions within Traffic Assignment (TA) has been studied in the literature as emissions such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are detrimental to the populace’s health as well as to the environment. TA is employed as a means to identify the potential to reduce vehicle emissions by obtaining emissions-minimising traffic patterns. TA captures the flow-dependent cost to traverse an arc in a so-called arc cost function, which often captures travel time, travel cost, or emissions. Arc cost functions that model emissions are naturally non-monotonic (partly increasing and partly decreasing) with respect to arc flow. Studies that make use of emission-based arc cost functions in TA generally assume a positive, increasing function, or do not discuss the computational complexities that arise when the arc cost functions are non-monotonic. In this paper, we investigate the implications of non-monotonic arc costs within the TA methodology and address the complexity of the resulting problem. We suggest adjustments to solution algorithms to heuristically allow the computation of TA solutions with non-monotonic arc costs. We present several methods to find good solutions to the TA problem with non-monotonic arc costs in the absence of a unique emissions-minimising solution. We compare these methods by applying them to several test networks for non-monotonic arc cost functions that model different emission types.",0191-2615,Not found
Itinerary planning for cooperative truck platooning,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.016,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"A cooperative truck platoon is a set of virtually linked trucks driving with a small intra-vehicle headway enabled by connected and automated vehicle technologies. One of the primary benefits of truck platooning is energy savings due to the reduction of aerodynamic drag on the platooned vehicles. The focus of this paper is on scheduling travel itineraries of a given set of trucks to facilitate the formation of platoons to maximize energy savings. By constructing a time-expanded network, we formulate the problem as a minimum concave-cost network flow problem, and devise a few solution methods to find the optimal or high-quality solutions. The solution methods include an outer approximation algorithm for solving a mixed-integer convex minimization reformulation of the problem, a dynamic-programming-based heuristic scalable to large-scale instances, and a fast approximation algorithm with guaranteed performance for a restrictive version of the problem.

In this paper, we describe a method for calculating the minimum cuts between all pairs of nodes in a transportation network and develop two indices for analyzing vulnerability; these are derived from topology-based vulnerability/demand-accountable analyses and enable evaluation of cuts without assuming route-choice behaviors. We show that such analyses can be performed using a Gomory–Hu tree to reduce the computational load. This method is efficient, requiring only N − 1 calculations of the maximum flow problem even though the number of node pairs is N 2, where N is the number of nodes. In addition, we show that the total demand passing each minimum cut, which is necessary for demand-accountable analysis, can be obtained by network loading onto the tree using the Gomory–Hu tree features. We apply the proposed method to the central region of Japan to illustrate the applicability of the two indices for identifying vulnerable links in the road network.",0191-2615,Not found
Decentralized game-theoretical approaches for behaviorally-stable and efficient vehicle platooning,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.012,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Cooperative vehicle platooning enabled by connected automated vehicle (CAV) technology has shown to bring various benefits including energy savings and a reduction in driving effort. Nevertheless, because these benefits vary over different platoon positions, vehicles from different owners may not be willing to platoon together; even if they form a platoon, they may attempt to change positions. To address such a behavioral-instability issue, it is necessary to redistribute the benefits among platoon members. To this end, this study investigates a decentralized multi-agent system where individually rational agents form platoons through peer-to-peer coordination under designated mechanisms that simultaneously determine the benefit reallocation. Depending on whether the scope of coordination is one-to-one or many-to-many, we introduce two types of mechanisms based on the bilateral trade model and one-sided matching. As the privacy of information sharing in the decentralized system is a common concern in practice, we further discuss two settings under each mechanism, differing by whether complete information is or is not known by the other agents. We indicate both theoretically and numerically that the decentralized platooning system is flexible and scalable, and can be implemented in real-time by leveraging the CAV technology.",0191-2615,Not found
Target-oriented robust location–transportation problem with service-level measure,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.010,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"We study a target-oriented, multi-period location–transportation problem where customer demands are uncertain. This problem is to determine the facility locations, production quantities, capacities, and shipment quantities, where the objective is to achieve the desired profit and fill rate to the full extent when it is impossible to reach both. To achieve the goal, we propose a target-oriented framework for the location–transportation problem, where a service-level measure is constructed to guarantee the desired fill rate and a hard constraint on profit is imposed to ensure a decent profit. This framework gets rid of the issues arising from estimating the weights of different objectives in a multi-objective optimization approach. To capture the characteristics of a multi-period decision-making process, an affine decision rule is introduced. Our method not only ensures that the transportation decisions of each period can adapt to realized demands wisely, but also prevents the high complexity of the model resulting from uncertainty and adaptation. Specifically, to tackle challenges of problem intractability, we reformulate the robust counterpart of the problem into a conservative approximation in the form of a mixed-integer quadratic program and propose a Benders decomposition approach to produce effective solutions. Finally, the performance of the target-oriented framework is assessed through computational experiments based on realistic instances.",0191-2615,Not found

The following vehicles in a platoon can save fuel consumption because of the reduced air resistance. Based on a fuel consumption function with respect to travel speed and platoon formation, we formulate a mixed-integer second-order-cone programming (MISOCP) model to minimize the total operation cost. To address the extra computational challenges caused by the requirements of platoon coordination, we develop a column-generation-based heuristic method in which two types of columns representing AT schedules and platoon schemes are generated and added into the master problem. According to the practice of container transshipment between two port terminals in Singapore, we conduct extensive numerical experiments and evaluate the performance of the proposed method up to the instance of 50 requests in a two-hour time limit.

The steady-state mobile personnel booking problem,10.1016/j.trb.2021.10.008,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"We present a model for policy optimization of the online booking of mobile personnel over a multiday horizon with a different cutoff for each day, where the goal is to maximize the expected ratio of accepted requests at steady-state. This model fits the practice of many service providers who allow booking of time slots over a horizon of multiple days and use availability control of the demand. Since the planning horizon is indefinite and the service horizon of each day overlaps the horizon of subsequent days, the objective is defined in terms of the steady-state performance. The interactions with the customers are performed in a single step: The system offers an assortment of time slots covering the next few days, and the user either chooses one of them or abandons the system. Upon the arrival of a service request, the provider estimates the opportunity cost of serving the request at each of the available time slots. We model this cost as a linear function and a Cobb–Douglas function of features that concisely represent the current system state. The assortment of time slots following each service request is constructed by maximizing the expected net gain from the assortment. The parameters of the opportunity cost functions are fitted using a simulation framework. The proposed method is benchmarked based on randomly generated datasets in various demand scenarios and geographies. The method is shown to outperform more straightforward baseline policies significantly.",0191-2615,Not found
Network user equilibrium problems with infrastructure-enabled autonomy,10.1016/j.trb.2021.07.005,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Although autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is expected to bring dramatic societal, environmental, and economic benefits, the high vehicle cost might slow the adoption of AVs. This paper explores an infrastructure-enabled autonomous driving system, which is a promising remedy to the high cost of AVs. Specifically, the system combines vehicles and infrastructure in the realization of autonomous driving. Equipped with roadside sensing, computing, and communicating devices, an ordinary road can be upgraded into an “automated road” enabling autonomous driving service for vehicles with the minimum required on-board devices. The vehicle costs can thus be significantly reduced. We envision that automated roads will be deployed in transportation networks to serve a new type of vehicle called infrastructure-enabled autonomous vehicles (IEAVs), which can be driven autonomously only on automated roads but manually on ordinary roads. Therefore, IEAV users may experience inconvenience costs due to transitions between autonomous driving and manual driving, and the frequent switch will inevitably yield high inconvenience costs. Therefore, to minimize their individual travel cost, they have to decide whether to switch to the autonomous driving mode when heading to an automated road. Considering such a unique feature of IEAVs, we proposed a group of driving-mode-choice equilibrium conditions to describe IEAV drivers’ driving mode choice behaviors, in which we considered drivers’ travel time costs, service charges of autonomous driving, and inconvenience costs due to driving mode change. Combining traditional route-choice equilibrium conditions with the proposed driving-mode-choice equilibrium conditions, we developed a new user equilibrium (UE) model to describe the equilibrium flow distributions in a road network with automated roads and mixed-autonomy traffic. The UE model is formulated as a novel non-linear complementarity problem, and its solution existence is discussed. To solve the UE model, a network expansion method is proposed to reformulate the UE model as a standard path-based UE model. A route-swapping-based solution algorithm is then used to solve the reformulated UE model. Numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the proposed models and algorithms.",0191-2615,Not found
Scheduling multimodal alternative services for managing infrastructure maintenance possessions in railway networks,10.1016/j.trb.2021.10.009,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Highly utilized railway networks require regular infrastructure maintenance. Different track sections often need to be closed for entire days to carry out engineering works, which makes the regular timetables no longer feasible and thus adjusted railway services and temporary alternative services need to be planned. We introduce the Multimodal Alternative Services for Possessions (MASP) problem to support the planning of alternative services, from the passenger and transport operator points of view, including an adjusted train timetable, bus-bridging services and extra train services. The MASP problem is formulated based on the Service Network Design Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. To solve it efficiently, we develop a solution framework that incorporates heuristics based on the column and row generation with mixed-integer linear programming. The developed framework provides the optimized alternative service routes, schedules and passenger flows routing. We demonstrated the performance of the MASP solution framework on the real-life Dutch railway network. The results show that the MASP framework is capable of efficiently generating alternative services to route passenger flows affected by possessions with a very limited increase in the total passenger costs compared to a scenario with no link closures.

Optimal driving for vehicle fuel economy under traffic speed uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2021.10.010,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Minimizing the amount of fuel consumed by a moving vehicle can be formulated as an optimal control problem that determines the speed profile that the vehicle should follow. The fuel consumption is generally a function of speed and acceleration, and is optimized under external parameters (e.g., road grade or surrounding traffic conditions) known to affect fuel economy. Uncertainty in the traffic conditions, and in particular traffic speed, has seldom been investigated in this context, which may prevent the vehicle from following the optimal speed profile and consequently affect the fuel economy and the journey time. This paper describes two stochastic optimal speed control models for minimizing the fuel consumption of a vehicle traveling over a given stretch of road under a given time limit, where the maximum speed that can be achieved by the vehicle over the journey is assumed to be random and follow a certain probability distribution. The models include chance constraints that either (i) limit the probability that the desired vehicle speed exceeds the traffic speed, or (ii) bound the probability that the journey time limit is violated. The models are then extended into distributionally robust formulations to capture any uncertainties in the probability distribution of the traffic speed. Computational results are presented on the performance of the proposed models and to numerically assess the impact of traffic speed variability and journey duration on the desired speed trajectories: The results affirm that uncertainty in traffic speeds can significantly increase the amount of fuel consumption and the journey time of the speed profiles created by deterministic model. Such increase in journey duration can be mitigated by incorporating the stochasticity at the planning stage using the models described in this paper, and more so with the distributionally robust formulations particularly with higher levels of uncertainty. The solutions themselves generally exhibit low levels of speeds, which ensure the feasibility of the speed profile against any variabilities in the traffic speed.",0191-2615,Not found
Predicting the matching probability and the expected ride/shared distance for each dynamic ridepooling order: A mathematical modeling approach,10.1016/j.trb.2021.10.005,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The popularity of smartphones and the advent of GPS positioning and wireless communication technologies in the recent decade have facilitated large-scale implementations of dynamic ridepooling services, such as Uber Pool, Lyft Line, and Didi Pinche. As in such services trips usually start before the appearance of pooling partners, knowing the probability of getting matching with another order (i.e., matching probability), the expected detour distance, and the expected shared distance before the start of each trip is essential for passengers to evaluate their willingness to pool and for ridepooling platforms to offer attractive discounts. In this paper, assuming that every ridepooling passenger shares vehicle space with at most one another during the entire trip, and ridepooling orders in each (origin-destination) OD pair appear following a Poisson process with a given rate, we propose a mathematical modeling approach to predict the matching probability, the expected ride distance, and the expected shared distance of each order under a first-come-first-serve strategy in dynamic ridepooling service. The method defines unmatched passengers at different locations along the exclusive-riding path of each OD pair into different seeker- and taker-states, formulates the complex interdependency of the matching probabilities, matching rates and arrival rates of (unmatched) passengers in different states into a system of nonlinear equations, and generates the matching probabilities and expected ride/shared distances of all OD pairs simultaneously. Under the same first-come-first-serve strategy, we simulated the occurrence, movements and state transitions of ridepooling orders based on a 30*30 grid network and the real network of Haikou City in China. In comparison with simulation results, we show that the method proposed in this paper can generate fairly satisfactory predictions under diverse matching conditions and demand intensities.",0191-2615,Not found
Airline Network Planning: Mixed-integer non-convex optimization with demand–supply interactions,10.1016/j.trb.2021.09.003,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Airlines routinely use analytics tools to support flight scheduling, fleet assignment, revenue management, crew scheduling, and many other operational decisions. However, decision support systems are less prevalent to support strategic planning. This paper fills that gap with an original mixed-integer non-convex optimization model, named Airline Network Planning with Supply and Demand interactions (ANPSD). The ANPSD optimizes network planning (including route selection, flight frequencies and fleet composition), while capturing interdependencies between airline supply and passenger demand. We first estimate a demand model as a function of flight frequencies and network configuration, using a two-stage least-squares procedure fitted to historical data, and then formalize the ANPSD by integrating the empirical demand function into an optimization model. The model is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer program. To solve it, we develop an exact cutting plane algorithm, named 2 α ECP, which iteratively generates hyperplanes to develop an outer approximation of the non-linear demand functions. Computational results show that the 2 α ECP algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks and generates tight solution quality guarantees. A case study based on the network of a major European carrier shows that the ANPSD provides much stronger solutions than baselines that ignore – fully or partially – demand–supply interactions.",0191-2615,Not found

In this study, a scenario-based train timetabling framework is constructed to classify the possibilities of passenger demand in multiple days into a set of scenarios based on profile and volume of passenger demand. On this basis, multi-scenario demand input method (MM) is introduced to deal with the uncertainty of passenger demand, which is different from one-scenario method (OM) and average-scenario method (AM). A MM-based mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated for the bi-objective train timetabling problem under uncertain and dynamic demand at acyclic network level, in which multi-scenario small-granularity passenger demand follows actual distribution processed from historical data. The two objectives are to minimize train service cost and penalized passenger waiting time from perspectives of enterprises and passengers. Advanced and Adaptive NSGA II (AANSGA-II) is proposed to cope with the high-complexity bi-objective problem, which applies advanced population sorting based on neighborhood distance, adaptive genetic operation based on scoring mechanism and improved population initialization based on boundary individuals. The model and algorithm are testified by a small-scale numerical experiment on a virtual line and a large-scale real-world instance in Shenyang Metro network. As a result, MM-based train timetables are generally better than AM-based and OM-based train timetables in reducing generalized cost and raising robustness. Besides, AANSGA-II is more applicable than NSGA-II and CPLEX in shortening computation time at the same time of improving computation result.",0191-2615,Not found

To do so the application area of level of service at toll plazas is chosen. Principles arising out of past work on the psychophysics of time perception are seamlessly incorporated into a novel unified model that accounts for both bias and random errors in perception. Multiplicative error terms arise naturally in this model. Results indicate that it is important to include both bias and random errors while modelling perception as ignoring the bias leads to high variance in the error term. Interestingly the pattern of bias in perception of time seems to remain steady across various waiting line situations from disparate contexts. Finally, the proposed model creates a framework that can be used to determine how time durations are perceived by humans when responses about perceptions are provided through categories like very small, small, etc. whose definitions are also concurrently identified. Such a framework can be used to study a wide range of situations both in transportation (such as route choice, mode choice, gap acceptance, and overtaking) and elsewhere. From a narrower perspective, this methodology can be used, as has been done here, to (i) determine level of service category definitions in terms of observable and “engineerable” variables (actual or measured delay faced by vehicles) even though it is the perceived value (a latent variable) that determines travelers’ responses on the quality of service, and (ii) identify parameters that define the systematic bias and randomness in perceptions.",0191-2615,Not found

The virtual network is shown to provide close approximations to the average density of the real system for large enough networks. Algorithms to efficiently calculate the observer parameters are proposed. This approach is based on the assumption that traffic dynamics are linear, and is applied at first in free-flow regime.

First, we highlight that the prior implementations of this model in the literature ignore primal feasibility conditions related to the budget constraint and the essential nature of outside good in formulating the model likelihood function. Second, we evaluate the suitability and performance of the model for alternative consumption patterns relative to the budget. In addition, we provide a systematic comparison of the performance of MDC choice models with the linear outside good utility form (i.e., the Lγ-profile model) and those with the non-linear outside good utility form (i.e., the NLγ-profile model). Third, for the Lγ-profile model with infinite budgets (i.e., when a very small proportion of the budget is allocated to inside goods), we derive the distributions of the resulting optimal demand functions and analytic expressions for the corresponding first and second moments, and identify a property that makes it easy to estimate the utility function parameters of an inside alternative even when consumption data is not available for other alternatives.

Schedule reliability in liner shipping timetable design: A convex programming approach,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.010,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Container liner shipping is the primary mode of moving manufactured products across continents. Partly due to inherent uncertainties at sea and ports, the liner shipping industry has long had a notorious reputation of schedule delays and unreliable on-time performance. This paper formulates a new approach to incorporate schedule reliability targets in liner shipping timetable design, to balance bunker consumption, time taken for the voyage, and schedule delays. We first model a surrogate problem using a copositive program through a moment decomposition approach and solve it as a convex semidefinite programming relaxation. We next incorporate schedule reliability targets implicitly by exploiting the optimality condition of this surrogate model. We use this approach to analyze the trade-offs between the bunker consumption and the schedule reliability targets for each port call. Furthermore, we derive the optimal speed of the vessel in each leg of the schedule to control for total bunker consumption. Surprisingly, the analytical analysis shows that, if a shipping line has the freedom to choose its preferred berthing times at all ports, it is optimal to set design sailing speeds equal at all legs to maximize schedule reliability. We validate our model using data from a Daily Maersk service, and demonstrate that our schedule can achieve an even higher schedule reliability than the innovative Daily Maersk service schedule, which attained more than 98% reliability in practice, with 11.4% lower bunker consumption. In comparison with a common schedule design heuristic, our model can design service schedules that improve the reliability performance by at least five percentage points, consuming the same amount of bunker. For the same reliability target (of 80%) in schedule design, our model can help reduce bunker consumption by about 11.6% for an 11-week schedule. The savings in bunker consumption can be much more substantial when an ocean carrier aims for higher schedule reliability.",0191-2615,Not found

Extensions to incorporating airline heterogeneity and air-HSR revenue sharing are also explored. The results suggest that in the case of profit-maximizing airports, (i) the effect of airport collaboration on the profit of transfer airport is ambiguous, regardless of air-HSR cooperation or not; (ii) although the air-HSR cooperation can enhance total profit of the airport system with airport collaboration, its effect is undetermined under airport non-collaboration; (iii) although the full cooperation can lead to the highest total profit of the airport system, it may not be the best scheme in terms of social welfare; (iv) In general, an airline is more likely to provide air-HSR inter-modal service in the presence of costly hub airport congestion, low degree of substitution between direct air service and air-HSR inter-modal service, or when the competition on the direct air route is not very significant. Air-HSR cooperation offers promising improvements to the MAS, and the associated welfare benefits would be more significant with inter-airport competition, especially in the case of profit-maximizing airports.

First, we formulate the matching problem of heterogeneous users in carpooling as an MILP problem and we discuss its analytical properties when there is no congestion. Next, we construct a bi-level optimization problem involving matching (first stage) and dynamic traffic congestion with scheduling preferences (second stage) when congestion is endogenous. We provide a heuristic to attain an optimal matching for a dynamic traffic equilibrium with congestion. Such a template allows studying the two-way causality between dynamic congestion and carpooling matching.",0191-2615,Not found
Air Traffic Flow Management Integrating Separation Management and Ground Holding: An Efficiency-Equity Bi-objective Perspective,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.004,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Motivated by a recent air traffic flow management (ATFM) initiative in the Southeast Asia region, this paper considers a new ATFM model that integrates Minutes-In-Trail (MINIT) with ground holding and jointly considers system efficiency and inter-airline equity. Three equity metrics are investigated including two Gini coefficient-based metrics previously not considered for inter-airline equity. We formulate both deterministic and robust bi-objective optimization models, with the notion of robustness introduced to equity as well as to efficiency. Several solution approaches are proposed, including an exact approach based on the ε-constraint method and linearization techniques, and heuristics approaches which adapt nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a learning-augmented nondominated sorting move (L-NSM) algorithm. For solving the robust bi-objective models, Monte Carlo sampling is further integrated with L-NSM. As inter-airline equity is of primary concern in the models, we also propose three methods for solution selection from a Pareto frontier for potential ATFM use that take into account flight-level equity from different perspectives. Extensive numerical analysis is conducted showing superior performance of L-NSM in both computation time and solution quality for small, medium, and large cases, benefits of the proposed ATFM initiative over a case with only MINIT but no ground holding, differences and similarities of the three equity metrics used, characteristics of the selected solutions from Pareto frontiers using the three proposed methods, benefits of considering robustness, and results sensitivity to key parameters. Findings of this research shed lights on further development of integrated ATFM modeling of separation management with ground holding with bi-objective consideration and relevant practices.",0191-2615,Not found
The multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem with power grid characteristics,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.007,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Electric buses can bring significant environmental and social benefits in the future public transportation systems. However, the large-scale adoption of electric buses faces major technical challenges caused by not only the limited running range and long charging time, but also the complex power grid characteristics, such as time-of-use (TOU) electricity tariffs and peak load risk. On one hand, the operation cost is determined by the TOU pricing and vehicle schedule. On the other hand, the unbalanced charging demand resulting from the vehicle schedule will cause peak load risk and pose a potential threat to the power grid safety. With the increasing penetration of electric buses, there is a real need to carefully design and manage electric bus scheduling to not only reduce the system costs but also ensure power grid safety. In this paper, we introduce a bi-objective multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem, a new generalization to the vehicle scheduling problem where the effects of TOU pricing and peak load risk are explicitly considered. The dual objectives are to minimize the total operation cost and to minimize the peak load resulting from concurrent recharging activities, as constrained by the running range of the electric buses and the capacity of charging depots/stations. A time-expanded network model is devised to represent this problem, while the bi-objective optimization model is reformulated by the lexicographic method. We propose a tailored branch-and-price method to solve the problem. Heuristics and a trip chain pool strategy are embedded into the branch-and-price method to expedite the computation time. Our method is validated through a benchmark network and a real-world bus network in Guangzhou, China. The results demonstrate that our method is effective in cost savings and peak load leveling, and far outperforms the off-the-shelf solver with respect to solution quality and computation efficiency. The real-world application results show that compared to state-of-the-practice, the peak load can be significantly reduced, on top of cost and fleet size savings.",0191-2615,Not found
A spatial rank-ordered probit model with an application to travel mode choice,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.008,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Ranking data provide important additional information related to valuation because of the implied preference sequence among all alternatives, rather than just the top choice preference. This additional information from a preference ranking can be exploited to achieve a certain desired precision in choice model estimation with a much smaller sample size, making ranked data surveys much more cost-effective than first-choice surveys. In this paper, we propose a spatial rank-ordered probit (SROP) model that accommodates both spatial lag effects as well as spatial drift effects. To our knowledge, this is the first such formulation and application of an SROP model in the econometric and transportation literature. An application of the proposed model is demonstrated in a travel mode choice ranking experiment among seven alternatives, including autonomous vehicle (AV) private ride-hailing and AV pooled ride-hailing.",0191-2615,Not found
Operations on an on-demand ride service system with express and limousine,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.009,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Motivated by Uber's and DiDi's differentiated services providing, in this paper we propose an analytical model to investigate the operating strategies of an on-demand ride service system for coordinating express and limousine services. It is found that the customer preference for express over limousine plays an important role in the model solutions. When the degree of the preference is lower than a certain criterion, the express service should be terminated; otherwise, both express and limousine services should coexist, with more (fewer) vehicles classified as express when customer demand (driver supply) increases. Under certain conditions, improving the quality of express service benefits both customers and drivers, while leads to an increase in demand for express but a decrease in demand for limousine. These insights would help in a better operation of ride service systems, and provide valuable references for other peer-to-peer markets such as Turo, eBay, Uber, and Airbnb.",0191-2615,Not found

In no-toll equilibrium if existing, when there exists no congestion delay in the downtown area, the departures for each corridor are regulated only by its bottleneck's capacity on the periphery of the downtown area, as occurred in Vickrey's bottleneck model, whereas when the downtown accumulation goes beyond the critical value, the departures for each corridor are constrained not only by its bottleneck's capacity but also by the downtown congestion level, regulated by all corridors’ departures in turn. We show that under specific assumptions, at the system optimum, the entrances at the boundary of the downtown area should be running at their full capacities before the onset of the downtown congestion, and the downtown network should be operating upon the onset of the downtown congestion at the critical accumulation with maximum production and highest traveling speed. Two optimal time-varying cordon pricing schemes (entrance-independent and entrance-dependent respectively) are developed to minimize the total social cost, which includes the queuing time costs concerning all corridors, the moving time cost in the interior of the downtown area, and schedule delay cost. What's more, the two time-varying cordon tolls to support the system optimum are analyzed from practical views.

Governmental subsidy plan modeling and optimization for liquefied natural gas as fuel for maritime transportation,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.003,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Environmental concerns are currently a major issue in the maritime transportation industry. A practical approach to implementing green maritime transportation is to adopt liquefied natural gas (LNG) as marine fuel. Government subsidies would efficiently stimulate the adoption of LNG in maritime transportation as marine fuel. However, the question of how to determine the appropriate amount of subsidies has not yet been investigated in depth. In this paper, a trilevel programming model is proposed to address the subsidy optimization problem. Decisions at the government, port, and ship levels are integrated into the model, which aims to maximize the social benefit government’s net profit. Based on the behavior rules of ship operators, a tailored method is proposed to convert the bilevel (port level and ship level) problem into an equivalent single-level problem. Embedded in an enumeration algorithm, the method significantly reduces the difficulty of solving the problem.

Dynamic system optimal traffic assignment with atomic users: Convergence and stability,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.001,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"In this study, we analyse the convergence and stability of dynamic system optimal (DSO) traffic assignment with fixed departure times. We first formulate the DSO traffic assignment problem as a strategic game wherein atomic users select routes that minimise their marginal social costs, called a ‘DSO game’. By utilising the fact that the DSO game is a potential game, we prove that a globally optimal state is a stochastically stable state under the logit response dynamics, and the better/best response dynamics converges to a locally optimal state. Furthermore, as an application of DSO assignment, we examine characteristics of the evolutionary implementation scheme of marginal cost pricing. Through theoretical comparison with a fixed pricing scheme, we found the following properties of the evolutionary implementation scheme: (i) the total travel time decreases smoother to an efficient traffic state as congestion externalities are perfectly internalised; (ii) a traffic state would reach a more efficient state as the globally optimal state is stabilised. Numerical experiments also suggest that these properties make the evolutionary scheme robust in the sense that they prevent a traffic state from going to worse traffic states with high total travel times.",0191-2615,Not found
Parameter and density estimation from real-world traffic data: A kinetic compartmental approach,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.006,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The main motivation of this work is to assess the validity of a LWR traffic flow model to model measurements obtained from trajectory data, and propose extensions of this model to improve it. A formulation for a discrete dynamical system is proposed aiming at reproducing the evolution in time of the density of vehicles along a road, as observed in the measurements. This system is formulated as a chemical reaction network where road cells are interpreted as compartments, the transfer of vehicles from one cell to the other is seen as a chemical reaction between adjacent compartment and the density of vehicles is seen as a concentration of reactant. Several degrees of flexibility on the parameters of this system, which basically consist of the reaction rates between the compartments, can be considered: a constant value or a function depending on time and/or space. Density measurements coming from trajectory data are then interpreted as observations of the states of this system at consecutive times. Optimal reaction rates for the system are then obtained by minimizing the discrepancy between the output of the system and the state measurements. This approach was tested both on simulated and real data, proved successful in recreating the complexity of traffic flows despite the assumptions on the flux–density relation.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated line planning and train timetabling through price-based cross-resolution feedback mechanism,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.009,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Railway line planning and train timetabling are two key planning steps that determine the operating cost and passenger service quality of a railway operator under the infrastructure capacity limitations. Traditionally, the line planning and train timetabling problems are solved sequentially at the strategic and tactical level, respectively. In this study, by introducing two types of binary decision variables, we first propose a unified integer linear programming (ILP) model for the integrated optimization of line planning and train timetabling. The line planning problem is modeled using ILP to satisfy passenger demand, whereas the cyclic train timetabling problem is formulated as a multi-commodity network flow model with a side track capacity constraint. The two types of binary decision variables are coupled by a cross-resolution consistency constraint, which ensures the conformity of the line planning and train timetabling decisions. Furthermore, a dual decomposition mechanism based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is developed to dualize the cross-resolution consistency and track capacity constraints, such that the original ILP model is decomposed into a line planning sub-problem and a set of train-specific sub-problems. After the linearization of the quadratic penalty terms in the ADMM, each sub-problem contains the Lagrangian relaxation price information based on the cross-resolution consistency constraint. Moreover, the primal and dual solutions are obtained by iteratively and efficiently solving the line planning sub-problem using a commercial solver, and each train-specific sub-problem through a tailored forward dynamic programming algorithm. Furthermore, a real-life case study is conducted based on the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway corridor to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The results of the numerical experiments demonstrate that the ADMM can achieve significantly smaller optimality gaps than Lagrangian relaxation, and the integrated optimization approach can improve the objective value by 5.78% on average compared with the sequential optimization approach.",0191-2615,Not found
A perimeter control method for a congested urban road network with dynamic and variable ranges,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.008,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The urban traffic system is a complex dynamic system, and its state changes with the real-time traffic demand; correspondingly, the range of congested areas also continuously transforms spatiotemporally. Affected by the traffic congestion range, the dynamics of a road network and the macroscopic control model that describes the road network also change. The existing sub-region division methods divide sub-regions based on cluster algorithms, and their results cannot be directly used to establish a dynamic congested area model with varying ranges or to implement perimeter control because they fail to consider the continuity of congested area transfer. To achieve control of the dynamic entrance boundary of a continuously changing congested range, this paper carries out three related analyses. First, depending on the section data of the kernel congested area, a continuous division method for generating sub-regions is proposed on the basis of similarity theory to determine the dynamic boundary of the congested area. Then, after the boundary intersections of bottlenecks are categorized as output, input, or passing types, a congested area range estimation model is established using the density wave transfer speed to estimate the boundary range change trend caused by the influence of traffic congestion diffusion or dissipation. A three-dimensional macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) surface model with an independent section length, traffic flow density, and road network trip completion rate of the congested area is then established according to the changes in the congested area. On the basis of the three-dimensional MFD surface model, a sliding mode control with dynamic boundary (SMCDB) method is proposed to determine the entrance of the congested area. With a regional road network in Hefei taken as an example, numerical experiments are carried out, and the simulation results are compared with those of PI control with and without boundary changes, showing that the SMCDB method can track congested boundaries and adjust boundary flows according to the traffic state, protect the centre network from over-saturation, effectively improve the trip completion flow, and decrease the network travel delay.",0191-2615,Not found
Markovian traffic equilibrium assignment based on network generalized extreme value model,10.1016/j.trb.2021.10.013,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This study establishes Markovian traffic equilibrium assignment based on the network generalized extreme value (NGEV) model, which we call NGEV equilibrium assignment. The use of the NGEV model for route choice modeling has recently been proposed, and it enables capturing the path correlation without explicit path enumeration. However, the theoretical properties of the model in traffic assignment have yet to be investigated in the literature, which has limited the practical applicability of the NGEV model in the traffic assignment field. This study addresses the research gap by providing the theoretical developments necessary for the NGEV equilibrium assignment. We first show that the NGEV assignment can be formulated and solved under the same path algebra as the traditional Markovian traffic assignment models. Moreover, we present the equivalent optimization formulations to the NGEV equilibrium assignment. The formulations allow us to derive both primal and dual types of efficient solution algorithms. In particular, the dual algorithm is based on the accelerated gradient method that is for the first time applied in the traffic assignment. The numerical experiments showed the excellent convergence and complementary relationship of the proposed primal and dual algorithms.",0191-2615,Not found
One-to-many matching and section-based formulation of autonomous ridesharing equilibrium,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.002,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This paper models autonomous ridesharing — multiple travelers simultaneously riding one shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) — in a network equilibrium setting with mixed SAV and human-driven vehicle (HV) traffic. We make two major methodological contributions. First, a novel one (SAV)-to-many (riders) matching is proposed to characterize the waiting times of an SAV and multiple travelers who share rides in the SAV during online matching, which is a nontrivial generalization of the one-to-one matching without ridesharing. Our matching characterization considers the possibilities of a traveler matched with an SAV starting from the same origin, whereto the SAV moved unoccupied as a result of either pickup or relocation, or with an in-service SAV that goes through the traveler's origin. Second, a section-based formulation for SAV ridesharing user equilibrium is introduced to characterize the SAV traveler flow, which accommodates the possibility that an SAV traveler's itinerary (OD pair) is different from that of the serving SAV and other travelers in the SAV. Unlike the existing link and route based ridesharing formulations, the notion of section both prevents undesired traveler en-route transfer(s) and allows travelers of multiple ODs to share rides, meanwhile respecting the SAV seat capacity constraint. In addition to the above two methodological contributions, the optimal SAV fleet size, fare, routing, and allocation (to in-service, pickup, and relocation states) decisions of a transportation network company (TNC) are formulated. The TNC decisions anticipate traveler reactions as characterized by a new multimodal autonomous ridesharing user equilibrium (MARUE), which is put forward with a proof of its existence and finds the endogenous market shares and road congestion effects of SAV/HV. Original insights are obtained from model implementation, including substantial systemwide benefit of ridesharing, marginal benefit of relocation in the presence of ridesharing, and diminishing economies of SAV size.",0191-2615,Not found
Theory for socio-demographic enrichment performance using the inverse discrete choice modelling approach,10.1016/j.trb.2021.11.004,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"In light of the growing availability of big data sources and the essential role of socio-demographic information in travel behaviour and transport demand modelling more broadly, the enrichment of socio-demographic attributes for anonymous big datasets is a key issue that continues to be explored. The common shortcoming of existing socio-demographic enrichment approaches concerns their lack of consistent theory that can link their enrichment performance (i.e. the ability to correctly enrich the required attribute) to the underlying covariance structure in the anonymous big datasets. In other words, existing approaches are unable to indicate, prior to the enrichment, to what extent it will be successful. Instead, they require undertaking the enrichment itself to assess and validate it post factum, incurring the effort and cost of the activity. An alternative and arguably preferable way would be to have a prior indicator as to whether an enrichment is likely to be sufficiently effective for the desired application. Towards this end, this paper draws upon the Inverse Discrete Choice Modelling (IDCM) approach to demonstrate what is termed as the IDCM performance theory, which systematically and in a tractable manner links the socio-demographic enrichment performance of the IDCM approach to the structure of the underlying datasets. This is achieved by recalibration of the constant, a technique adopted from conventional discrete choice modelling practice, while also drawing upon information theory employed in the context of communication systems. The established IDCM performance theory is validated in two empirical applications where performance of the IDCM approach in enriching several socio-demographic attributes, given travel behaviour patterns, is successfully estimated. Additionally, the IDCM approach is found to perform comparably to commonly used methods in previous socio-demographic enrichment efforts. It is thus argued that the capability of the IDCM performance theory to predict and explain its enrichment performance under different data conditions can facilitate informed and transparent transferability of the IDCM framework in the socio-demographic enrichment for anonymous big datasets.",0191-2615,Not found
Are autonomous vehicles better off without signals at intersections? A comparative computational study,10.1016/j.trb.2021.10.012,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"We model and analyze a futuristic intersection that serves only connected, autonomous and centrally managed vehicles. Under consideration are three control strategies that aim to minimize the total system delay by choosing an optimal trajectory for each vehicle. The first two abandon the concept of signal timing all together whereas the third strategy keeps it. The difference between the two signal-free strategies has to do with a fail-safe buffer requirement introduced to provide redundancy. Each control strategy leads to a unique version of a trajectory-based autonomous intersection management (T-AIM) problem, which is formulated as a mixed integer linear program and solved using both a commercial solver and a specialized heuristic algorithm. We find the signal-free strategy holds an overwhelming advantage over the signal-based strategy in terms of efficiency. However, its success is fragile and dependent on the faith in the safety and reliability of the system. When the fail-safe buffer is introduced, the efficiency of the signal-free strategy degrades to a level comparable to that of a properly optimized signal-based strategy. Surprisingly, the signal-free strategy with redundancy tends to arrange vehicles in groups that take turns to cross the intersection together. This “signal-like behavior” manifests itself whenever congestion rises to a certain threshold. In addition, solving the T-AIM problem based on signal timing enjoys significant computational benefits, because it eliminates many conflicts. Thus, the basic logic of signal timing – if not the physical equipment – may survive even after humans are no longer allowed to drive.",0191-2615,Not found

First, we show that our model overcomes the correlation problem between routes, a common pitfall of traditional logit models, and that the choice aversion model can be seen as an alternative to these models. Second, we show how our model can generate violations of regularity in the path choice probabilities. In particular, we show that removing edges in the network may decrease the probability for existing paths. Finally, we show that under the presence of choice aversion, adding edges to the network can make users worse off. In other words, a type of Braess’s paradox can emerge outside of congestion and can be characterized in terms of a parameter that measures users’ degree of choice aversion. We validate these contributions by estimating this parameter over GPS traffic data captured on a real-world transportation network.",0191-2615,Not found
Approximate multi-objective optimization for integrated bus route design and service frequency setting,10.1016/j.trb.2021.10.007,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This paper focuses on the transit network design and frequency setting problem for bus transit systems, where solutions are simultaneously generated in favor of the passengers and operator. While multi-objective solutions exist in the literature, simplifications and inconsistent assumptions make them hard to compare. For example; researchers have proposed solutions that report on a minimal fleet size without considering the service frequencies that guide the passenger’s travel options, as a result, logical choices made by all passengers would cause the buses in the transit system to be overcrowded. To address this issue, we have developed a mathematical model which couples service frequencies and passenger assignment reflective of available choice options a passenger can take in the network. This approach can achieve lower operating costs while still ensuring that passengers can reach their destination at no detriment to journey times. We have constructed a complete set of multi-objective solutions, and compared them with those in the literature.

Hidden city travel and its impact on airfare: The case with competing airlines,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.006,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Hidden city pricing is an anomaly in airline pricing where a direct flight from A to B is more expensive than a multi-leg flight from A to B and B to C. In this case, customers wanting to travel from A to B may consider purchasing the connecting flight from A to C, deplane in B, and throw away the second leg of the itinerary. This practice is called hidden city ticketing. We study the cause and the impact of hidden city ticketing. The airline industry has perceived this practice harmful to profitability and has taken measures to discourage such practice. We build a stylized model where two airlines compete on a hub-and-spoke airline network and use a game theoretic approach to study airline and consumer decisions. We find that hidden city pricing can arise when an airline lowers the price of its indirect flight to compete with the competitor’s direct flight on the same route. We also find that strategic customers who seek hidden city traveling opportunity can attenuate competition by limiting the airlines’ ability to lower their price for connecting flights. Thus, when customers in the market start practicing hidden city ticketing, airlines face less competition and may be able to charge higher prices. Our results provide future-looking perspective on what may happen to the equilibrium airfare if customers start practicing hidden city ticketing.",0191-2615,Not found
Joint apron-runway assignment for airport surface operations,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.011,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Airport surface operations, such as off-block control, taxi routing, and runway sequencing, are typically confined to a fixed network topology with given origin–destination (O-D) pairs for departures and arrivals. Reconfiguring the O-D distribution of flights by actively assigning their aprons and runways is a potentially effective measure to maximize the utilization of network capacity. To date this has not been investigated in the literature due to its complexity involving operational constraints, assignment rules, and different stakeholders. This paper demonstrates the significant potential of O-D reconfiguration in improving surface network efficiency by proposing a joint apron-runway assignment framework for pre-tactical operations. This is underpinned by a comprehensive review of apron and runway assignment rules, including constraints and preferences, and an elaborated optimization scheme that encompasses lexicographic and iterative approaches along with temporal buffers to absorb uncertainties in pre-tactical operations. The proposed apron-runway assignment is implemented and assessed in a case study at Beijing Capital International Airport. An airport cellular automata simulator is employed for quantitative evaluation, and qualitative assessment is based on interviews with subject matter experts. Compared to the current operations, the proposed apron-runway assignment is very promising, with reductions in total taxiing distance, average taxiing time, taxiing conflicts, runway queuing time, and fuel consumption by 15.5% (Table 3), 6.2%, 19.8%, 17.6% (Table 4) and 6.6% (Table 5) respectively; gated assignment is increased by 11.8% (Table 4).

Resilient perimeter control for hyper-congested two-region networks with MFD dynamics,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.003,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Understanding the resilience of transportation networks has received considerable research attention. Nevertheless in the field of network traffic flow control, few control approaches target the mitigation from hyper-congestion, and the control objective has rarely touched the system resilience requirement which focuses on system recovering from hyper-congested state. This paper sheds light on a resilience-oriented network control. We firstly define the traffic resilience as the integral of deviation against optimal state from disturbance generation moment t 0 to recovery moment t f . Then, we propose a control method under hyper-congested situations by formulating the analytical problem using a two-reservoir transportation system with parabola-shaped Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs), using phase diagram analysis, attraction region derivation and switched controller design. Afterwards, we evaluate the system resilience performances between two classic perimeter control schemes (constant perimeter control (CPC) and state-feedback control (SFC)) and the proposed resilient control scheme. Results show that proposed controller can ensure the system to recover from hyper-congestion to the optimal state while existing studies failed to recover. This resilience is confirmed in various case study scenarios, e.g., when the level of hyper-congestion is different. More promisingly, the proposed control shows high compatibility with the form of the MFDs, e.g., the recover can be achieved under hysteresis conditions which are common for network-level traffic dynamics. These findings will help to design an intelligent transportation system with enhanced resilience.",0191-2615,Not found

A multiple discrete continuous extreme value choice (MDCEV) model with a linear utility profile for the outside good recognizing positive consumption constraints,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.013,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"A variant of the traditional multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model that obviates the need to have budget information, labeled as the Lγ-profile MDCEV model, has been proposed recently. This new model structure breaks the strong linkage between the discrete and continuous choice dimensions of decision-making. But recent studies show that this Lγ-profile model may not work well in situations when, even if the budget is unobserved, the budget is known to be finite and small in magnitude. The reason is that the formulation, while ensuring the positivity of consumptions of the inside goods (that may or may not be consumed), does not guarantee, within the model formulation and estimation itself, the positivity of the consumption of the essential outside good. In this paper, we develop a formulation based on a reverse Gumbel structure for the stochastic terms in the utility functions of alternatives that develops a closed-form probability expression, while also accommodating the positivity requirement for the outside good. The ability of our proposed Budget-based Reverse Generalized Lγ-profile model (labeled the BR-GLγ-profile model) to recover true underlying model parameters is assessed. Our results clearly point to the benefit of employing the proposed model (relative to extant linear outside utility profile models in the literature) in empirical contexts when there is reason to believe that a finite ceiling applies to the budget (even if the budget is unobserved) or if the budget is actually available. In the latter case when the budget is available, our proposed model is a serious contender to the traditional γ-profile-MDCEV model and will generally outperform the traditional γ-profile-MDCEV when the consumption share of the outside good is high.",0191-2615,Not found

On the return trip to the station, the vehicle boards new patrons in the manner of traditional, fixed-route, fixed-stop feeder-bus service. Continuum approximation models are formulated, both for Jitney-lite and traditional services. The models are used to determine the conditions for which one service form imparts lower generalized costs than the other. A case study of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region reveals that Jitney-lite tends to generate lower costs in the city's periphery, where travel demands are relatively low. The service can be especially cost-effective where sidewalks and other pedestrian infrastructure are underdeveloped, and where residents earn middle-to-high incomes.",0191-2615,Not found
Train timetabling with the general learning environment and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trb.2022.02.006,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach for the train timetabling problem of different railway systems. A general train timetabling learning environment is constructed to model the problem as a Markov decision process, in which the objectives and complex constraints of the problem can be distributed naturally and elegantly. Through subtle changes, the environment can be flexibly switched between the widely used double-track railway system and the more complex single-track railway system. To address the curse of dimensionality, a multi-agent actor–critic algorithm framework is proposed to decompose the large-size combinatorial decision space into multiple independent ones, which are parameterized by deep neural networks. The proposed approach was tested using a real-world instance and several test instances. Experimental results show that cooperative policies of the single-track train timetabling problem can be obtained by the proposed method within a reasonable computing time that outperforms several prevailing methods in terms of the optimality of solutions, and the proposed method can be easily generalized to the double-track train timetabling problem by changing the environment slightly.",0191-2615,Not found
Business models for Mobility as an Service (MaaS),10.1016/j.trb.2022.02.004,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Travellers often combine transport services from different firms to form trip chains: e.g. first taking a train and then a bus. Integration of different forms of public and private transport into a single service is gaining attention with the concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). Usually the attention focuses on such things as ease of use for travellers and shifting demand away from the car. We focus on the effects of MaaS on behaviour and welfare via the market structure of transportation. In particular, we analyse three archetypical ways in which MaaS could be operationalised: Integrator, Platform, and Intermediary. We find that these models differ strongly in how consumers and firms are affected by the availability of MaaS technologies. The Integrator model seems best for consumers and social welfare. It always leads to lower prices than free competition without MaaS and therefore benefits consumers; transport firm profits can be lower or higher. The Platform model tends to lead to an outcome that is relatively close to free competition without MaaS: prices can be higher or lower, while transport firm profits are lower. Finally, the Intermediary model tends to lead to much higher prices. Regulation of the price that the MaaS firm has to pay may lower prices, but, compared to the Integrator model, the change is often small. So, even without price regulation, MaaS supply can benefit consumers by increasing competition and removing serial marginalisation, even before we consider other benefits of MaaS.",0191-2615,Not found
Sensitivity analysis for transit equilibrium assignment and applications to uncertainty analysis,10.1016/j.trb.2022.02.001,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Systematic uncertainty analysis can be used to quantitatively evaluate variation in model outputs and identify the critical sources of uncertainty to improve the reliability and stability of a system. To analyze the effects of uncertainties in transit networks that may be caused by probabilistic travel demand, congestion, or vehicle frequencies, this study develops a sensitivity-based uncertainty analysis approach as a post-analysis tool for equilibrium transit systems. The congestion effect is considered in the waiting time and in-vehicle travel time of a passengers’ route-choice model. The hyperpath concept is used to manage passengers’ riding strategies due to the common-line problem at transit stops. A hyperpath-based gradient projection (GP) solution algorithm is developed for the solution of the variational inequality formulation of the transit equilibrium assignment problem (TEAP). A restricted sensitivity analysis approach originally developed for road networks is re-developed for the TEAP in transit networks. An analytical sensitivity-based approach is derived to conduct uncertainty analysis for the TEAP, which enables the simultaneous propagation of uncertainties from different input sources to the model outputs. Numerical examples are provided for the following purposes. (1) To demonstrate three applications of the sensitivity analysis of the TEAP, namely the perturbed solution estimation problem, the critical parameter identification problem, and the paradox analysis problem. (2) To illustrate the use of uncertainty analysis of the TEAP, such as estimating the variance and confidence level of model outputs with respect to various model inputs/parameters as random variables, and ranking the importance of arcs using sensitivity-based uncertainty analysis.

Conformable fractional derivative and the fractional grey model are then introduced to establish a fractional grey viscoelastic traffic flow model that can reflect time-varying characteristics.

Modeling and Managing Mixed On-Demand Ride Services of Human-Driven Vehicles and Autonomous Vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2022.01.003,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"We model a monopoly ride-sourcing market where the platform adopts the service types of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Both congestion externality under mixed traffic flow and heterogeneity on riders' perceived utility of the ride-sourcing service are considered when formulating the mode choice behavior of riders. We analyze the impact of the platform's fleet size and its price for riders on demand rates and riders' waiting time in the market equilibrium state. The analytical results show that the demand rates of mixed on-demand ride service types are not necessarily monotonous to the price for riders or the fleet size, due to the congestion externality and existence of a wild goose chase regime. Under either profit maximization or welfare maximization strategies, numerical results demonstrate that a higher pure AV traffic flow capacity benefits human ride-sourcing drivers and both types of riders. The platform should arrange more AVs than HVs even under the high AV depreciation cost. In a surging demand scenario, the platform should encourage riders to switch from the HV service to the AV service through price regulation. Moreover, an extended scenario considering the integrated service is discussed. The economic analysis and gained managerial insights benefit the on-demand ride services platform's decision making on operational strategies of HVs and investment in AVs with mixed traffic congestion effects.",0191-2615,Not found
The stratified p-hub center and p-hub maximal covering problems,10.1016/j.trb.2022.01.002,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Hub networks are the foundation of many transportation and distribution systems, and real-world hub networks often transport freight or passengers of different service classes. This paper introduces the stratified multiple allocation p -hub center and p -hub maximal covering problems where the traffic corresponding to each origin–destination (O/D) pair is divided into different strata each having a specific service level requirement. The problems are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models and efficient Benders decomposition algorithms are developed for solving large instances. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mathematical models and the solution algorithms. MILP formulations are also proposed for the generalized versions of the problems that include fixed set-up costs for hubs and hub arcs. Results indicate that the optimal sets of hub locations and hub arcs when considering different strata can be quite dissimilar to those of the traditional p -hub center or p -hub maximal covering problem, but are similar to those of hierarchical hub location problems. Furthermore, models are provided and solved for multi-modal stratified hub location problems with fixed setup costs for hubs and hub arcs.

The value of stochastic crowd resources and strategic location of mini-depots for last-mile delivery: A Benders decomposition approach,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.014,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Crowd-shipping is an emergent solution to avoid the negative effects caused by the growing demand for last-mile delivery services. Previous research has studied crowd-shipping typically at an operational planning level. However, the study of support infrastructure within a city logistics framework has been neglected, especially from a strategic perspective. We investigate a crowd-sourced last-mile parcel delivery system supported by a network of strategically located mini-depots and present a two-stage stochastic network design problem with stochastic time-dependent arc capacity to fulfill stochastic express deliveries. The first-stage decision is the location of mini-depots used for decoupling flows allowing more flexibility for crowd–demand matching. The second stage of the problem is the demand allocation of crowd carriers or professional couriers for a finite set of scenarios. We propose an exact Benders decomposition algorithm embedded in a branch-and-cut framework. To enhance the algorithm, we use partial Benders decomposition, warm-start, and non-dominated cuts. We perform computational experiments on networks inspired by the public transportation network of Munich. The proposed solution method outperforms an off-the-shelf solver by solving instances 3.6 to 19 times faster. The results show the potential to exploit the stochastic crowd flows to deliver packages with deadlines of 3 or 8 h. The crowd can transport 8.3% to 32.5% of the total demand by using between 4% to 24% of the crowd capacity, and we observe average daily savings of 2.1% to 7.6% of the total expected operational cost.

Lagrangian dual decomposition for the ambulance relocation and routing considering stochastic demand with the truncated Poisson,10.1016/j.trb.2021.12.016,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The pre-hospital Emergency Medical Service (EMS) provides the critical care to the ill or injured patients, and evaluates and manages those patients at scene before their transport to an emergency medical facility.

By taking into consideration of the short-term demand estimation, there is chance to improve the management of ambulances and reduce the TAH. This study proposes a new stochastic programming model to minimize the TAH within a complete dynamic relocation system. In this system, a truncated Poisson distribution is utilized for forecasting near future EMS requests, and a Lagrangian dual decomposition with branch-and-bound is adapted as the solution methodology.

Hidden prices arise because each unit, even if not immediately up for sale, is assigned a price. Airline fares collected for the analysis empirically show the existence of each force.

The NEWS model can be applied to predict traffic evolution on a general urban network of arbitrary size by knowing only its boundary flows, as well as its topology and infrastructure parameters such as roads speed limits, number of lanes and capacities. The flux direction is retrieved from turning ratios at intersections, which is then aggregated in four direction layers using geometrical projection matrices. We show its formal derivation step-by-step from the classical Cell Transmission Model at one intersection. We then show that the NEWS model is a hyperbolic PDE system that corresponds to a conservation law with bounded densities. The model prediction performance is validated using synthetic data from the microsimulator Aimsun.

The only requirement of the rolling stock is that the doors in different parts of each train (e.g., its cars) can be operated independently. The extra-long trains (XLTs) can protrude beyond both ends of the station platforms—in different ways at different stations. The proposed OS has a train-side and a passenger-side. On the train side, it includes train organization and station-stopping protocols and on the passenger side a new information system that organizes passengers at the platforms as required by the train-side protocols. These protocols specify the composition of each train and what it does at each station; i.e., whether it stops or not; how it aligns its doors along the platform; whether each door opens or not; and the set of destinations advertised by each open door. A general menu of train-side protocols is presented, as well as a crude mathematical framework for their optimization and analysis.

Since delivery quantities of candidate orders may be beyond capacity resources, this paper investigates a new combined order selection and periodic vehicle routing problem with time windows for perishable products. An online community group-buying operator can design daily online community group-buying delivery plan by deciding to serve which customers, to deliver which products and delivery quantities to be transported. To solve this problem, we propose a branch-and-price algorithm that strongly relies on a new label setting algorithm with partial label dominance and a strong bounding strategy based on the definition of Pareto-optimal delivery patterns. Since en-route delivery quantities depend on the interval between two consecutive services, our label setting algorithm is also applicable to the pricing subproblem for the discrete split delivery vehicle routing problem. We conduct a case study on a real-world instance and propose management insights into the structure of delivery plan facing inadequate capacity resources.

A variational autoencoder approach for choice set generation and implicit perception of alternatives in choice modeling,10.1016/j.trb.2022.02.015,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Choice set generation is a challenging task, since the consideration set is generally unknown to the modelers, and the full choice set could be too large to be enumerated. The proposed variational autoencoder approach (VAE) is motivated by the idea that the chosen alternatives must belong to the consideration set. The proposed VAE method explicitly considers maximizing the likelihood of including the chosen alternatives in the choice set and inferring the underlying generation process. This paper derives the generalized extreme value (GEV) model with implicit availability/perception (IAP) of alternatives, for bridging the VAE with choice modeling. Specifically, the cross-nested logit (CNL) model with IAP is derived as an example of IAP-GEV models. The IAP approach assumes each alternative is associated with an implicit degree of availability/perception (likelihood in the context of VAE) to be included in the choice set. The VAE approach for route choice set generation is illustrated in a toy network. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method could reproduce the pre-defined true values. We further exemplify the VAE approach using a real dataset. The IAP-CNL model estimated has the best performance in terms of goodness-of-fit and prediction performance, compared to multinomial logit models and conventional choice set generation methods.",0191-2615,Not found
Weekly rolling stock planning in Chinese high-speed rail networks,10.1016/j.trb.2022.02.005,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"In high-speed rail networks, train units are scheduled to periodically meet all maintenance requirements while at the same time continuing to serve all scheduled passenger trips.

We model the W-RSP on a newly developed rotation network by adopting particular nodes and arcs to address the (un)coupling operations of train units, and then propose an integer linear programming formulation for the problem. To solve this formulation, we develop a customized branch-and-price algorithm, which relies on a reduced linear programming relaxation for computing the lower bound, embeds a diving algorithm for computing the upper bound, and integrates advanced branching rules for effective explorations of the solution space.

Passenger-oriented traffic control for rail networks: An optimization model considering crowding effects on passenger choices and train operations,10.1016/j.trb.2022.02.008,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"In public transport, e.g., railways, crowding is of major influence on passenger satisfaction and also on system performance. We study the passenger-oriented traffic control problem by means of integrated optimization, particularly considering the crowding effects on passenger route choices and on train traffic. The goal is to find the system optimum solution by adapting train schedules and rerouting passengers. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed, identifying the train orders and departure and arrival times, as well as finding the best route for passengers, with the objective of minimizing passenger disutility and train delay. In the model, we allow free splits of the passengers in a group onto different routes and reasonable passenger transfers between trains. We value train crowding by using time multiplier, which is defined as a piecewise constant function of the train crowding ratio (also called load factor), indicating that passengers perceive a longer travel time on a more crowded train. Moreover, we assume variations of the minimum train dwell time, caused by the alighting and boarding passengers. The nonlinear terms in the MINLP model are linearized by using an exact reformulation method and three transformation properties, resulting in an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. In the experiences, we adopt a real-world railway network, i.e., the urban railway network in Zürich city, to examine the proposed approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. The results show that, by considering the crowding effects, some passengers are forced to choose the routes that are less crowded but have larger travel/delay times, which leads to the improved passenger comfort and makes the planned train timetable less affected (in terms of delays). We also find that flexibility in train schedules brings more possibilities to serve better the passengers. Moreover, it is observed that if the train dwell time is highly sensitive to the alighting and boarding passengers, then the transport network will become vulnerable and less reliable, which should be avoided in real operations.",0191-2615,Not found

A heuristic procedure, which dynamically updates the available time windows for each of the trains, is used to control the number of train paths in the mathematical model. The mathematical model is repeatedly solved, and at each iteration we gradually modify the set of train paths available. Four different strategies to modify train time windows are used in the train path modification step and their selection depends on the solution to the mathematical model. Computational results for three networks of different sizes conclusively demonstrate that there is not only benefit in integrating these problems, with improvements of as much as 30%, but also that the proposed solution approach is highly effective.

Larger airports do have more varieties of shops whose space can be changed by development. Our main results show that, first, airport malls developed by a local government or a profit-maximizing airport are too large as compared to the socially optimal size, because either entity disregards a decrease in profit at downtown stores when deciding on the size of airport malls. Second, the planner can attain the social optimality with the use of Pigouvian subsidies, even if it delegates its decision making to a local government or a profit-maximizing airport. Third, a local government or a profit-maximizing airport has an incentive to construct an airport that is too far away from downtown (or, has little incentive to improve airport access to/from downtown).

An important problem faced by such platforms is how to elicit the agents’ information and to match their supplies and demands efficiently. To address the problem, we propose the modified Multi-unit Trading Reduction and Vickery‒Clarke‒Groves (MMTR-MVCG) mechanism for considering heterogeneous transaction costs. Under this mechanism, the shippers and carriers first decide their bids, and then the platform determines the trading agents, sets the transaction prices, and matches the shippers’ demands and the carriers’ supplies. We show that this mechanism is incentive-compatible, individually rational, budget-balanced, and asymptotically efficient. For the special case with homogeneous transaction costs, we first show that the MMTR-MVCG mechanism can be simplified. In addition, we design a new double auction mechanism for the case with asymmetric demand information and homogeneous transaction costs and show that this mechanism also is incentive- compatible, individually rational, budget-balanced, and asymptotically efficient. Moreover, we conduct numerical studies to assess the impacts of transaction costs and information asymmetry on the mechanisms and compare the performance of our mechanisms with those of two commonly used mechanisms.

The vehicle routing problem of intercity ride-sharing between two cities,10.1016/j.trb.2022.02.013,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"In this paper, we consider that a private company has developed a platform to provide intercity ride-sharing (IRS) services for riders between two cities. The riders between the two cities need to provide their travel information to the platform hours in advance. The company adopts commercial vehicles to pick up riders from one city and deliver them to the other city. The vehicle routing problem of IRS (VRP-IRS) is one of the core problems in the platform's decision making process. Due to the private nature of IRS platform, it is assumed that the platform aims to maximize the total profit of the IRS system by optimizing vehicle routing. As the IRS is long-distance travel, in order to ensure driving safety, each driver has to take a break after completing a long-distance trip. In this paper, the VRP-IRS is defined on a directed graph and formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. As the VRP-IRS is NP-hard, we propose a variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the VRP-IRS. According to the characteristics of the feasible solutions to the VRP-IRS, a greedy sequential route construction method is developed to generate the initial solutions.

However, they lack interpretability, do not ensure monotonicity conditions, and restrict substitution patterns. We address the first two challenges by modeling the systematic utility using the Choquet Integral (CI) function and the last one by embedding CI into the multinomial probit (MNP) choice probability kernel. We also extend the MNP-CI model to account for attribute cut-offs that enable a modeler to approximately mimic the semi-compensatory behavior using the traditional choice experiment data. The MNP-CI model is estimated using a constrained maximum likelihood approach, and its statistical properties are validated through a comprehensive Monte Carlo study. The CI-based choice model is empirically advantageous as it captures interaction effects while maintaining monotonicity. It also provides information on the complementarity between pairs of attributes coupled with their importance ranking as a by-product of the estimation. These insights could potentially assist policymakers in making policies to improve the preference level for an alternative.

Moreover, our study helps an airline to link a strategic decision of leasing an aircraft to the tactical aircraft assignment decisions by considering fuel efficiency and seat capacity of the aircraft alternatives in response to new passenger demand.

It is well known that SUE provides an approximation to the stationary mean of a wide class of Markov day-to-day traffic assignment models. However, as is shown in this article, it is generally impossible to find any time homogeneous random process models for discrete traffic in which SUE precisely matches the stationary mean. In response, we develop a time-inhomogeneous model with this property. That model relies on a rather unnatural description of route choice utility. We therefore propose a second time-inhomogeneous model with a more standard type of utility function, where the stationary mean equals a generalized version of SUE. While the time-inhomogeneous models are largely of theoretical interest, they also provide highly serviceable approximations to standard types of day-to-day traffic models in which travellers update their route choice utilities relatively slowly in response to recent events. For such models, the generalized form of SUE provides a closer approximation to the stationary mean than classical SUE, particularly when traffic demands are small.",0191-2615,Not found

Commuting service platform: Concept and analysis,10.1016/j.trb.2022.01.006,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"We propose and investigate the concept of commuting service platform (CSP) that leverages emerging mobility services for commuting and connect directly commuters (employees) and their worksites (employers). By applying the two-sided market analysis framework, we show under what conditions a CSP may present the two-sidedness. Both the monopoly and duopoly CSPs are then analyzed. We show how the price allocation, i.e., the prices charged to commuters and worksites, can impact the participation and profit of the CSPs. We also extend the method to consider locations of homes and worksites, and propose a general modeling framework to consider the locations.

Scaling Bayesian inference of mixed multinomial logit models to large datasets,10.1016/j.trb.2022.01.005,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Variational inference methods have been shown to lead to significant improvements in the computational efficiency of approximate Bayesian inference in mixed multinomial logit models when compared to standard Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods without increasing estimation bias. However, despite their demonstrated efficiency gains, existing methods still suffer from important limitations that prevent them to scale to large datasets, while providing the flexibility to allow for rich prior distributions and to capture complex posterior distributions. To effectively scale Bayesian inference in Mixed Multinomial Logit models to large datasets, we propose an Amortized Variational Inference approach that leverages stochastic backpropagation, automatic differentiation and GPU-accelerated computation. Moreover, we show how normalizing flows can be used to increase the flexibility of the variational posterior approximations. Through an extensive simulation study and real data for transport mode choice from London, we empirically show that the proposed approach is able to achieve computational speedups of multiple orders of magnitude over traditional maximum simulated likelihood estimation (MSLE) and MCMC approaches for large datasets without compromising estimation accuracy.",0191-2615,Not found
Electric Bus Charging Scheduling for a Single Public Transport Route Considering Nonlinear Charging Profile and Battery Degradation Effect,10.1016/j.trb.2022.03.002,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This study deals with a fundamental electric bus charging scheduling (EBCS) problem for a single public transport route by considering the nonlinear electric bus (EB) charging profile and battery degradation effect under the partial charging policy, which allows EBs to be charged any length of time and make good use of dwell times between consecutive trips. Given a group of trip tasks for an EB fleet and charger type, the problem is to minimize the total cost for a public transport operator of providing peak-hour bus services for a focal single public transport route by simultaneously determining the EB-to-trip assignment and EB charging schedule with charger type choice subject to the necessary EB operational constraints. We first build a mixed-integer nonlinear and nonconvex programming (MINL&NCP) model for the EBCS problem. To effectively solve the MINL&NCP model to global optimality, we subsequently develop two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models by means of linearization and approximation techniques. To accelerate the solution efficiency, we further create three families of valid inequalities depending on the unique features of the problem.

Optimization model for the freeway-exiting position decision problem of automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2022.03.003,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"In recent years, automated vehicles have attracted much attention all over the world. This paper focuses on the freeway-exiting position decision problem of automated vehicles (AVs). Specifically, the paper addresses the determination of the lane-changing initiation location in the process of exiting the freeway. The location of the freeway-exiting decision point has a significant impact on the safety and efficiency of automated vehicles. If the lane-changing location is too close to the off-ramp, the AV may not succeed in exiting and may even collide with other vehicles. If the decision point is too far from the off-ramp, the AV will enter into the slower lane too early, increasing the travel time. However, the freeway-exiting lane-changing position problem of AVs has not been investigated thoroughly in the existing literature. This paper proposes a freeway-exiting position decision model to find the optimal freeway-exiting decision position to balance the efficiency and safety in the freeway-existing process. Field data is collected to validate the proposed model, and simulations are also conducted to analyze the variations of the exiting success probability (ESP) and the optimal exiting decision (OED) position under various traffic conditions. The results show that the proposed model can predict the value of ESP with high performance (MAPE is less than 13%) and help an automated vehicle to generate an appropriate freeway-exiting decision point to ensure a high ESP without sacrificing efficiency. An AV can increase its ESP by decreasing or increasing its speed to meet more safe lane-changing gaps on the target lane, and the speed-decreasing method has a more significant effect than the speed-increasing method. The speed difference between the two adjacent lanes greatly influences ESP and the OED point, and maintaining the speed difference in an appropriate range can increase ESP.",0191-2615,Not found

Competition and third-party platform-integration in ride-sourcing markets,10.1016/j.trb.2021.08.002,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Recently, some third-party integrators attempt to integrate the ride services offered by multiple independent ride-sourcing platforms. Accordingly, passengers can request ride through the integrators and receive ride service from any one of the ride-sourcing platforms. This novel business model, termed as third-party platform-integration in this work, has potentials to alleviate market fragmentation cost resulting from demand splitting among multiple platforms. Although most existing studies focus on operation strategies for one single monopolist platform, much less is known about the competition and platform-integration and their implications on operation strategy and system efficiency. In this work, we propose mathematical models to describe the ride-sourcing market with multiple competing platforms and compare system performance measures between two market scenarios (i.e., with and without platform-integration) at Nash equilibrium and social optimum. We find that platform-integration can increase the total realized demand and social welfare at Nash equilibrium and social optimum, but may not necessarily generate a greater profit when the vehicle supply is sufficiently large, and/or the market is considerably fragmented. We show that the market with platform-integration generally achieves greater social welfare due to two reasons. First, platform-integration can generate a thicker market and reduce matching frictions; second, multiple ride-sourcing platforms are competing for passengers by setting lower trip fares independently.",0191-2615,Not found
Hybrid MPC System for Platoon based Cooperative Lane change Control Using Machine Learning Aided Distributed Optimization,10.1016/j.trb.2021.10.006,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This study is devoted to developing a platoon-based cooperative lane-change control (PB-CLC). It coordinates the trajectories of a CAV platoon under a platoon-centered platooning control to accommodate the CAV lane-change requests from its adjacent lane, aiming to reduce the negative traffic impacts on the platoon resulting from lane-change maneuvers, on the premise of ensuring CAVs’ safety and mobility. Mathematically, the PB-CLC control is established using a hybrid model predictive control (MPC) system. The hybrid MPC system involves an MPC-based mixed integer nonlinear programming optimizer (MINLP-MPC) for optimal lane-change decisions, which considers multiple objectives such as traffic smoothness, driving comfort and lane-change response promptness subject to vehicle dynamics and safety constraints. To ensure the feasible lane-change, this study investigates and provides a lower bound of the lane-change time window by analyzing the MINLP-MPC model feasibility. Apart from the optimal lane-change decision consideration, the hybrid MPC system is well designed to ensure the control continuity and smoothness. In particular, the hybrid MPC system control feasibility and stability are proved to enable the platoon's back-and-forth state switchings between car-following and lane-change accommodation states. Next, we developed a machine learning aided distributed branch and bound algorithm (ML-DBB) to solve the MINLP-MPC model within a control sampling time interval (< 1 second). Specifically, built upon computer simulation and the c-LHS sampling technique, supervised machine learning models are developed offline to predict a reduced solution space of the integer variables, which is further integrated into the distributed branch and bound method to solve the MINLP-MPC model efficiently online.

A two-echelon fuzzy clustering based heuristic for large-scale bike sharing repositioning problem,10.1016/j.trb.2022.04.003,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"This paper considers the large-scale bike sharing repositioning problem (BSRP) frequently encountered in modern bike sharing systems. To cope with customer demand fluctuations, BSRP aims to identify the optimal routes traveled by homogeneous vehicles to fulfill the inventory needs at each bike-sharing station in order to minimize the total cost. It is computationally intractable to obtain promising solutions, especially for large-scale instances, given its NP-hardness. This paper adapts the two-echelon structure from the vehicle routing problem (VRP) to BSRP, proposes the two-echelon BSRP model and demonstrates its competitiveness. First, a novel fuzzy clustering strategy quantitatively considering the correlation between stations is designed to construct the clusters with satellites and their corresponding customers to form the two-echelon structure. Then, a tailored fuzzy correlation based adaptive variable neighborhood search (FC-AVNS) with newly designed neighborhood structures and several feasibility and satisfaction check mechanisms is proposed to construct the routes within and between the clusters. Performance of the proposed method is compared with that of a exact model solved by CPLEX and other three state-of-the-art methods. Also, comparisons are made between the presented fuzzy clustering strategy and the other two classical clustering methods taken from the literature.

A framework for efficient dynamic routing under stochastically varying conditions,10.1016/j.trb.2022.04.001,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Despite measures to reduce congestion, occurrences of both recurrent and non-recurrent congestion cause large delays in road networks with important economic implications. Educated use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can significantly reduce travel times. We focus on a dynamic stochastic shortest path problem: our objective is to minimize the expected travel time of a vehicle, assuming the vehicle may adapt the chosen route while driving. We introduce a new stochastic process that incorporates ITS information to model the uncertainties affecting congestion in road networks. A Markov-modulated background process tracks traffic events that affect the speed of travelers. The resulting continuous-time routing model allows for correlation between velocities on the arcs and incorporates both recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. Obtaining the optimal routing policy in the resulting semi-Markov decision process using dynamic programming is computationally intractable for realistic network sizes. To overcome this, we present the edsger ⋆ algorithm, a Dijkstra-like shortest path algorithm that can be used dynamically with real-time response. We develop additional speed-up techniques that reduce the size of the network model. We quantify the performance of the algorithms by providing numerical examples that use road network detector data for The Netherlands.",0191-2615,Not found
The value of flexible flight-to-route assignments in pre-tactical air traffic management,10.1016/j.trb.2022.04.004,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"In European air traffic management, there are discussions regarding the future role of the network manager (NM): in particular, should the NM be able to assign flights to specific trajectories, should airspace users be allowed to freely choose their preferred trajectory, or something in between? In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that can be adapted to these settings to assess their effect on key performance indicators. We focus on the pre-tactical stage of planning air traffic for a future departure day, meaning that airspace capacity budgets are given and incoming flight intentions need to be offered one or several ‘trajectory products’ for a (possibly dynamically determined) charge. These trajectory products differ in the amount of flexibility that they provide the NM to route the flight. Charges are set so as to reward greater flexibility of airspace users with lower charges. The airspace user chooses one of the offered trajectory products according to a choice model that reflects their preferences given, among others, the product charges. Shortly before the departure day, the NM decides simultaneously on the routing (within the limits defined by the purchased trajectory products) and on each airspace’s sector opening scheme (within the limits of the fixed capacity budgets) so as to minimize the overall displacement cost. Methodologically, the problem deviates from typical dynamic pricing problems in various major ways, e.g., featuring a boundary condition that we show to be NP-hard as well as fairness and revenue neutrality constraints. The problem is cast in the form of a dynamic program. We exploit a certain structure in the boundary condition to formulate an efficient heuristic. Based on a numerical case study, we find that the use of dynamically priced trajectory products achieves a cost performance close to the one obtained if the NM has a mandate to simply assign flights to trajectories. Therefore, this seems an attractive design for the role of the NM, giving airspace users some choice whilst achieving low overall costs.",0191-2615,Not found

First, container storage locations in the yard need to be assigned to vessels, which essentially forms the yard template. When the arrival of the vessels becomes firmed, the operation schedule to store and retrieve containers from the yard is determined, taking into account the vessel turnaround time requirements and activity congestion in the yard. We develop a two-stage robust approximation model in the form of a single linear mixed integer program to minimize the maximum cost associated with excessive activity concentrations and travel distance from the vessel berth to the container storage locations. An accelerated column generation meta-heuristic solution approach is then proposed, which integrates adaptive large neighborhood search, evolutionary algorithm, and column generation algorithm to generate near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time.

Heterogeneous multi-depot collaborative vehicle routing problem,10.1016/j.trb.2022.03.004,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Collaborative vehicle routing of multiple logistics providers is an important component of horizontal logistic collaboration that generates economic and societal benefits. Existing research on collaborative vehicle routing is limited to the homogeneous setting where the logistics providers transport the same product. To better address the need of a general modeling framework and fast computational methods for the growth of collaboration among logistics providers carrying various products, we investigate a heterogeneous multi-depot collaborative vehicle routing problem (HMCVRP) in this paper. The key operational and computational challenge of realizing the collaborative route planning is to properly select transfer points for product transshipment between vehicles of different depots. We propose a Benders-based branch-and-cut algorithm with the technique of combinatorial Benders’ cuts to solve a mixed-integer programming formulation of HMCVRP.

Vessel deployment with limited information: Distributionally robust chance constrained models,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.006,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"This paper studies the fundamental vessel deployment problem in the liner shipping industry, which decides the numbers of mixed-type ships and their sailing frequencies on fixed routes to provide sufficient vessel capacity for fulfilling stochastic shipping demands with high probability. In reality, it is usually difficult (if not impossible) to acquire a precise joint distribution of shipping demands, as they may fluctuate heavily due to the fast-changing economic environment or unpredictable events. To address this challenge, we leverage recent advances in distributionally robust optimization and propose distribution-free robust joint chance constrained models. In the first model, we only assume support, mean as well as lower-order dispersion information of the shipping demands and provide high-quality solutions via a sequential convex optimization algorithm. Comparing with existing literature that chiefly studies individual chance constraints based on concentration inequalities and the union bound, our approach yields solutions that are less conservative and less vulnerable to the magnitude of demand dispersion. We also extend to a data-driven model based on the Wasserstein distance, which suits well in situations where limited historical demand samples are available. Our distributionally robust chance constrained models could serve as a baseline model for vessel deployment, into which we believe additional practical constraints could be incorporated seamlessly.",0191-2615,Not found
Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for adaptive coordinated metro service operations with flexible train composition,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.001,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"This paper presents an adaptive control system for coordinated metro operations with flexible train composition by using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach. The control problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) with multiple agents regulating different service lines in a metro network with passenger transfer. To ensure the overall computational effectiveness and stability of the control system, we adopt an actor–critic reinforcement learning framework in which each control agent is associated with a critic function for estimating future system states and an actor function deriving local operational decisions. The critics and actors in the MADRL are represented by multi-layer artificial neural networks (ANNs). A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is developed for training the actor and critic ANNs through successive simulated transitions over the entire metro network. The developed framework is tested with a real-world scenario in Bakerloo and Victoria Lines of London Underground, UK. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform previous centralized optimization and distributed control approaches in terms of solution quality and performance achieved. Further analysis shows the merits of MADRL for coordinated service regulation with flexible train composition.

Bayesian origin-destination estimation in networked transit systems using nodal in- and outflow counts,10.1016/j.trb.2022.04.006,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"We propose a Bayesian inference approach for static Origin-Destination (OD)-estimation in large-scale networked transit systems. The approach finds posterior distribution estimates of the OD-coefficients, which describe the relative proportions of passengers travelling between origin and destination locations, via a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling procedure. We suggest two different inference model formulations, the instantaneous-balance and average-delay model.The average-delay model is generally more robust in determining accurate and precise coefficient posteriors across various combinations of observation properties. The instantaneous-balance model, however, requires lower resolution count observations and produces estimates comparable to the average-delay model, pending that certain count observation properties are met. We demonstrate that the Bayesian posterior distribution estimates provide quantifiable measures of the estimation uncertainty and prediction quality of the model. Moreover, the Bayesian approach is at least as accurate as existing optimisation approaches and proves robust in scaling to high-dimensional underdetermined problems without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. The Bayesian instantaneous-balance model is applied to the New York City subway network, with several years of entry and exit count observations recorded at several hundred station turnstiles across the network. The posterior distribution estimates provide intuitive demand patterns and are projected to be more valuable than point estimates, since they allow for robust transport network designs that account for the uncertainty of network parameters.",0191-2615,Not found
Constructing a cell transmission model solution adhering fully to first-in-first-out conditions,10.1016/j.trb.2022.04.002,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Multi-commodity continuous flow network models, especially the cell transmission model (CTM) and the link transmission model, have been widely used in theory and practice for dynamic network loading (DNL), as well as for computing dynamic user equilibria (DUE). These models attempt to follow a first-in-first-out (FIFO) priority rule at various levels of approximation. However, previous studies have shown that these existing models and implementations do not fully ensure FIFO. Also, they allow deviations from FIFO that are not observed or permitted or physically possible in practice and these deviations can cumulate over time. A benchmark is needed for assessing the implications of FIFO violations in these models and methods, preferably over a wide range of instances. For this purpose, we propose here the first solution method that ensures perfect adherence to FIFO at the network-wide level. For clarity of exposition, the specific methods are presented here within the CTM framework. Variants of the principles presented here can be used to develop methods for ensuring FIFO for other DNL models. The proposed method is computationally intensive, and therefore suitable for small to medium size problems. As such, this method may not be applicable to large scale problems, which are considered fairly often in practice. The main value of the proposed method is therefore in the ability to produce a set of benchmark solutions, to evaluate the FIFO performance of other methods or the implications of FIFO violations in other methods.

A latent choice model to analyze the role of preliminary preferences in shaping observed choices,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.008,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"When selecting among a set of alternatives, individuals often compare each alternative with reference to some preliminary preference (PP). The preliminary preference could be the individual's preferred global option (i.e., their ideal choice) or the most ideal option within the current choice set. Previous research has shown that loss of an attribute relative to that of the PP has a stronger impact on the individual's choice compared to gain of that attribute—a phenomenon commonly known as loss aversion. To incorporate this loss aversion into choice modeling, the PP of the individuals must then be known; however, such information is generally not available when observing individual's choice behavior. To overcome the lack of knowledge of an individual's PP, this study proposes a probabilistic approach where all alternatives in the choice set have some potential of being an individual's PP. A multinomial logit (MNL) based methodology, named the latent preliminary preference (LPP) model, is used to estimate the PP probabilities entirely as a function of the decision-maker characteristics and each alternative's attributes, which overcomes the complexity that arises when choices are unlabeled. In addition, the methodology accommodates inertia that some individual's may have toward their PP, as well as the desire to try new options. Moreover, this study proposes randomizing the parameters of LPP model to account for random taste heterogeneity of individuals that would arise in a panel dataset, giving rise to random parameter latent preliminary preference (RPLPP) model. The ability of maximum likelihood inference method to retrieve the parameters of fixed parameters LPP model is demonstrated on synthetic data. The statistical significance and bias in estimated parameters are also demonstrated. The proposed model is then applied on a parking preference survey to examine the presence of loss aversion and inertia/variety seeking behavior among the respondents.",0191-2615,Not found
The Impact of High-Speed Rail Competition on Airline On-Time Performance,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.004,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The rapid development of high-speed rail (HSR) has posed substantial competition to air transport. In this paper, we build an analytical model to investigate the impacts of HSR competition on profit-maximizing and welfare-maximizing levels of on-time performance (OTP) improvement efforts by the aviation sector (both airports and airlines), as well as the corresponding realized airline OTP levels. It is found that different from airline competition, HSR competition would decrease welfare-maximizing effort levels by both airports and airlines. The profit-maximizing airport and total effort level would also be discouraged. However, the profit-maximizing airline effort level can be raised when both total effort level by the aviation sector and inter-modal air-HSR service substitutability are sufficiently high (i.e., sufficiently low air-HSR horizontal and vertical differentiation). The airline OTP is determined by airports and airlines’ joined efforts to improve OTP and also the air traffic (“effort effect” vs. “traffic effect”). The impact of HSR competition on realized airline OTP depends on the relative dominance of either effect, which does not have clear-cut conditions. Thus it is possible but not necessarily true that the airline would end up with a better OTP in the presence of HSR competition. As a result, when intervening in airline OTP, the regulator needs to differentiate OTP requirements on a route basis, considering the presence of HSR competition and the air-HSR service substitutability.",0191-2615,Not found

While strongly grounded in economic theory, most of these models have two limitations: they require specifying a budget, and usually omit any complementarity effects. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the Multiple Discrete Continuous (MDC) modelling framework: (i) an MDC model including explicit complementarity and substitution effects, and (ii) an MDC model with complementarity, substitution that requires no budget definition. Model (ii) relies on the hypothesis that total expenditure on the alternatives under consideration is small compared to the overall budget. This allows using a linear utility function for the numeraire good, leading to a likelihood function without the budget or numeraire good in it. The lack of a budget is specially useful when forecasting, as it avoids cascading errors due to an inaccurate budget specifications. The inclusion of complementarity and substitution effects enriches the interpretability of the models, while the resulting functional form avoids theoretical issues present in previous formulations. Alongside the derivation of the models, we discuss their main properties and propose an efficient forecasting algorithm for (ii). We also report four applications to datasets about time use, household expenditure, supermarket scanner data, and trip generation. Free estimation code for both models is made available online.",0191-2615,Not found
Joint berth allocation and ship loader scheduling under the rotary loading mode in coal export terminals,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.004,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Due to nonmatching between the efficiency of ship deballasting and terminal loading, operations in modern coal export terminals (CETs) are frequently interrupted and significantly restricted by ship deballasting delays. This paper addresses a novel integrated problem of berth allocation and ship loader scheduling arising in CETs with new features, including the symmetrical berth layout-based rotary loading mode (SBLRLM) and deballasting restrictions. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is proposed to make joint decisions to minimize the total tardiness of all ships. By exploring the problem's decomposable structure, an exact method that relies on logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) is proposed to obtain optimal solutions. According to the problem features, the monolithic MIP formulation is decomposed into a new MIP (master problem) and a constraint programming (subproblem). Combinatorial valid inequalities are developed to enhance the master problem model and obtain a tighter lower bound. A Benders cut strengthening heuristic is developed to generate feasibility and optimality cuts to ensure efficient algorithm convergence. To evaluate the proposed method, computational experiments are conducted on a set of test instances generated based on real data collected from a major CET in northern China. The results indicate that the LBBD algorithm can optimally solve large-scale problem instances within a reasonable amount of time. The plan generated by the LBBD algorithm achieves a 51.9% reduction in ship tardiness, on average, compared to that of practical scheduling methods. By using the proposed method, the superiority of the SBLRLM in reducing deballasting delays becomes more significant as the problem scale increases. In addition, considering different working intensities, the results could also help port operators make decisions about the number of berths in the SBLRLM.",0191-2615,Not found
Joint optimization of train timetabling and rolling stock circulation planning: A novel flexible train composition mode,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.007,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The tidal traffic phenomenon is one of the most prominent problems on some metro lines, where a large number of commuters during the peak hours might cause the non-equilibrium spatial–temporal distribution of passenger flow. In order to better match the passenger demand, this study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to jointly optimize the train timetable and rolling stock circulation plan, in which the flexible train composition mode is particularly taken into account by allowing rolling stocks to change their compositions through uncoupling/coupling operations at the both ends of the focused metro line. To solve the model, a customized heuristic algorithm based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) is developed to quickly generate high-quality solutions. Based on a small example and the real-world data from Beijing metro Batong line, two sets of numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. The computation results show that in comparison to the fixed train composition mode, the proposed approaches can bring 17.1% reduction of operation costs in morning peak periods, with no increase of passenger waiting time.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated aircraft tail assignment and cargo routing problem with through cargo consideration,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.005,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Traditionally, freight airlines assign individual aircraft to each flight and sequentially determine the cargo itineraries for each order. This may limit the option of cargo itineraries, and lead to mismatches between cargo demands and freighter capacities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concepts of through cargo connection and short through cargo connection. A through cargo connection requires cargoes to stay on the same aircraft between two connected flights, and a short through cargo connection is a through connection that needs less time than the standard cargo transshipment time. By considering the through cargo connections and short through cargo connections, we can generate the complete set of all possible cargo itineraries, so as to improve the overall schedule efficiency and robustness, and reduce the cargo ground handling cost. In this paper, two mathematical models (the connection- and string-based models) are proposed to solve the aircraft tail assignment problem (TAP) and cargo routing problem (CRP) simultaneously with through cargo considerations. We developed a column generation framework to solve the LP relaxation of the string-based model, and a diving heuristic with reoptimization strategy to find a good IP solution in a reasonable time. The proposed solution methods are tested using industrial cases from the largest freight airline in China. The computational experiments revealed that the integrated models could bring up to 5.04% ∼ 10.31% profit growth, and the through cargo savings are tripled compared with the baseline solutions. By analyzing the computational performance of two models, we recommend that airlines can apply connection-based model only if the problems are not very large and the computational time is sufficient; otherwise, the string-based model is more robust in terms of problem scales and computational time.",0191-2615,Not found
Traffic signal plans to decongest street grids,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.014,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Two new synchronization strategies are developed for signalized grids of two-directional streets. Both strategies are found to reduce congestion significantly more than do other approaches. One of the strategies is static and the other adaptive. Both use a common timing pattern for all signals on the grid but use a different offset for each. The static strategy serves the morning rush by providing perfect forward progression on all streets in the directions that point toward a reference intersection, one that is located near the center of gravity of all workplaces. For the evening rush, perfect progression is achieved for all travel directions that point away from the reference intersection. The adaptive strategy toggles between this forward synchronization mode and a second mode suited for congestion, but only in a pre-determined district surrounding the reference intersection. Toggling is based on the district's real-time traffic density. The paper shows how to switch quickly between the two synchronization modes without resorting to unacceptably short phases. It also shows that if the grid is formed by two intersecting sets of parallel streets, even if unevenly spaced, then every street can be perfectly synchronized in one of its directions. As a result, an inbound driver in the morning, or an outbound driver in the evening, is guaranteed to encounter synchronized signals over the full length of her trip. Although this is not possible for more irregular grids, the paper shows how to modify the two strategies for this case, so that they still perform well. The strategies were benchmarked with simulations against a fixed, zero-offset strategy for many scenarios, because zero-offsets are known to work well under congestion. In one important scenario representing a severely congested morning rush, both strategies were also benchmarked against a state-of-the-practice computer program. While the state-of-the-practice program reduced the zero-offset delay by a modest 7%, the proposed strategies reduced it by 21% (static) and 32% (adaptive); i.e., improving on the state-of-the-practice program by 14% and 25%. These improvements considerably exceed the 1% to 5% reductions typically reported in the literature for other state-of-the-art methods that have been compared with state-of-the-practice programs. Similarly good results were obtained for the other scenarios, which included the morning and evening rushes, various distributions of workplaces, and both regular and irregular grids.",0191-2615,Not found
Two-echelon capacitated vehicle routing problem with grouping constraints and simultaneous pickup and delivery,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.003,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper investigates the two-echelon capacitated vehicle routing problem with grouping constraints and simultaneous pickup and delivery (2E-VRPGS), which is a new variant of the classical two-echelon capacitated vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP). In the 2E-VRPGS, customers from the same administrative region are served by vehicles from the same satellite so as to ensure service consistency, with pickup and delivery being performed simultaneously in the second echelon. To solve this problem to optimality, we formulate it as a path-based model and develop a tailored branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm, which can also exactly solve two closely related variants of 2E-VRPGS in the literature: the 2E-VRP with grouping constraints (2E-VRPG), and the 2E-VRP with simultaneous pickup and delivery (2E-VRPS). In particular, a novel dominance rule in the labeling algorithm, together with several customized valid inequalities, has been put forward to effectively accelerate the solution method by exploiting the problem characteristics. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on the problems 2E-VRPG, 2E-VRPS, and 2E-VRPGS, extensive numerical experiments have been conducted on three types of benchmark instances. Computational results on the 2E-VRPGS show that our dominance rule can significantly reduce the number of generated labels and all families of valid inequalities have a great impact on strengthening the path-based model. The algorithm is found to be highly competitive when compared with the existing exact algorithm for the 2E-VRPG and some new findings and managerial insights are derived from sensitivity analysis.",0191-2615,Not found
Designing transit-oriented multi-modal transportation systems considering travelers’ choices,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.002,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"One goal of future transit-oriented transportation systems is to promote door-to-door mobility for travelers by integrating different public transportation modes into a whole. We propose a mathematical design framework for such a transit-oriented multi-modal transportation system from a societal aspect considering three categories of public transportation modes, i.e., general on-demand modes, local on-demand modes, and fixed-schedule modes. A system-state equilibrium is brought up to describe travelers’ rational travel choices and their reverse effects on agency service levels using the continuous approximation method, and a centralized system designer then manages to achieve a system-beneficial outcome with the minimum cost. To solve the design problem, we prove that the transportation system reaches a unique equilibrium when decision variables are given. By this discovery, we construct a global search framework based on the DIRECT algorithm to solve the optimal design. In analyzing the problem property, we rigorously prove that in the designed systems, the bus service as a fixed-schedule mode is absent from the design scheme under the cases with sufficiently low demands, and the design problem thus reduces to a one-dimensional line search. The ride-hailing service as a general on-demand mode is similarly proved to be excluded when the demand is sufficiently high. In this context, the approximate design parameters of the bus service and the total system cost are developed analytically. The local on-demand mode, bike-sharing service, as an option of bus feeders, is proved to be efficient under a realistic setting. Extensive numerical examples provide evidence verifying the preceding analyses and indicating the behavior of travelers and agencies. Further sensitivity tests show that the subway is favorable for intensive demands and autonomous vehicles may promote the ride-hailing industry. For completeness, an immediate application of the proposed framework in generalized cases validates the model reliability.",0191-2615,Not found
General stochastic ridesharing user equilibrium problem with elastic demand,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.001,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In this study, we propose a general stochastic ridesharing user equilibrium (SRUE) problem with elastic demand (ED) for urban transportation network analysis with ridesharing activities by extending the deterministic ridesharing user equilibrium (DRUE) problem, which is referred to as the general SRUE-ED problem. We develop a novel variational inequality (VI) model in terms of the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the ride-matching constraints for the general SRUE-ED problem. The existence and uniqueness of the SRUE-ED solution are demonstrated under mild conditions. We proceed to put up a global convergent method to solve the developed VI model by incorporating the weighted cost averaging (WCA) method. The purpose of WCA method is to solve a parametric fixed-point model formulated for the general SRUE-ED problem without the ride-matching constraints.

A stochastic optimization approach for the supply vessel planning problem under uncertain demand,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.015,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper presents a two-stage stochastic programming with recourse methodology to solve the Supply Vessel Planning Problem with Stochastic Demands (SVPPSD), a problem arising in offshore logistics and which generalizes the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Demands and Time Windows. In the SVPPSD, a fleet of vessels is used to deliver a regular supply of commodities to a set of offshore installations to ensure continuous production, with each installation requiring one or more visits per week and having stochastic demands. Both the onshore depot where the product to be distributed is kept and the offshore installations have time windows, and voyages are allowed to span more than one day. A solution to the SVPPSD consists in the identification of an optimal fleet of vessels and the corresponding weekly schedule. As a solution methodology, we embed a discrete-event simulation engine within a genetic search procedure to approximate the cost of recourse and arrive at the minimized expected cost solution. We make comparisons with two alternative approaches: an expected value problem with upscaled demand, and a chance-constrained algorithm. While alternative methodologies yield robust schedules, robustness is achieved mainly through an increase in fleet size. In contrast, a two-stage stochastic programming with recourse algorithm, by accounting for the cost of recourse in the search phase, and exploring a wider solution space, allows arriving at robust schedules with a smaller fleet size, thereby yielding significant cost savings. For the tested problem instances, the proposed algorithm leads to savings of approximately 10 to 15 million USD per year.",0191-2615,Not found
A truthful subsidy scheme for a peer-to-peer ridesharing market with incomplete information,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.010,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Traffic congestion during peak periods has become a serious issue around the globe, partly due to the high number of single-occupancy commuter trips. Peer-to-peer (P2P) ridesharing platforms can present a suitable alternative for serving commuter trips. However, they face a major obstacle that prevents them from being a viable mode of transportation in practice: ridesharing users often provide tight time windows, which ultimately leads to a low matching rate. This study addresses this issue by introducing a subsidy scheme that allocates incentives to encourage a few carefully selected set of travelers to change their desired departure or arrival times, and thereby form successful matches. In order to implement this scheme for a ridesharing platform in the existence of private information, we propose an auction-based mechanism that guarantees truthfulness, individual rationality, budget-balance, and computational efficiency. Using numerical experiments, we show the merits of the proposed subsidy scheme when compared to its no-deficit variant as well as the conventional VCG mechanism.",0191-2615,Not found
Modeling landside container terminal queues: Exact analysis and approximations,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.012,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"With the growth of ocean transport and with increasing vessel sizes, managing congestion at the landside of container terminals has become a major challenge. The landside of a sea terminal handles containers that arrive or depart via train or truck. Large sea terminals have to handle thousands of trucks and dozens of trains per day. As trains run on fixed schedule, their containers are prioritized in stacking and internal transport handling. This has consequences for the service of external trucks, which might be subject to delays. We analyze the impact of prioritization on such delays using a stochastic stylized semi-open queuing network model with bulk arrivals (of containers on trains), shared stack crane resources, and multi-class containers. We use the theory of regenerative processes and Markov chain analysis to analyze the network. The proposed network solution algorithm works for large-scale systems and yields sufficiently accurate estimates for performance measurement. The model can capture priority service for containers at the shared stack cranes, while preserving strict handling priorities. The model is used to explore the choice of different internal transport vehicles (with coupled versus decoupled operations at the stack and train gantry cranes) to understand the effect on delays. Our results show that decoupled transport vehicles in comparison to coupled vehicles can mitigate the external truck container handling delays at shared stack cranes by a large extent (up to 12%). However, decoupled vehicles marginally increase the train container handling delays at shared stack cranes (up to 6%). When train arrival rates are low, prioritizing the handling of train containers at the stack cranes significantly reduces their delays. Further, such prioritization hardly delays external truck containers.",0191-2615,Not found

Subsidy on transport adaptation investment-modeling decisions under incomplete information and ambiguity,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.016,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper models subsidy policies on transport facility's adaptation to climate change-related disasters under the government's incompleteness and ambiguity of disaster information. We consider a transport facility (an airport or a seaport) that is in a vertical structure with an upstream facility operator and a few downstream carriers. The exact probability of disaster damage level is privately known by the facility operator, while the government has incomplete information and has to form a probability distribution. If the government cannot accurately perceive such probability (misjudgment), ambiguity emerges. This is the first modeling work to integrate the incomplete information and ambiguity in one framework to analyze the transport investment under uncertainty. Modeling results suggest that such incomplete information and ambiguity in many cases allow the facility operator to secure information rent, and make the facility output, adaptation investment and social welfare downwardly distorted (i.e., less than the levels under complete information). The ambiguity can bring two countervailing effects under incomplete information, namely the “pooling effect” and the “agency cost effect,” which jointly determine the downward distortions on market outcomes and the welfare-maximizing subsidy policy. When its degree is low, the ambiguity causes a more dominant “pooling effect” that can help alleviate the distortion, improving social welfare. In presence of ambiguity, the increasing optimism of the government would deteriorate the distortion, likely to damage social welfare. Our analytical results provide support to subsidy on adaptation and policies to promote adaptation effectiveness and carrier competition in downstream market. To alleviate possible distortion, the government also needs to be cautious to reduce ambiguity through more information acquisition, and not be too optimistic on the disaster damage.",0191-2615,Not found

Under our approach, a propagated departure delay occurs when the arrival delay of the inbound flight exceeds the subsequent flight’s ground buffer. The size (or frequency) of such propagated delays relative to the size (or frequency) of arrival delays then measures the contribution of propagated delays to late arrivals. This approach differs from earlier attempts to quantify the contribution of delay propagation since it focuses on an individual flight and its immediate predecessor, without attempting to trace the sources of delay propagation back through the entire sequence of prior flights. The paper’s empirical results show that the contribution of propagated departure delays to arrival delays depends on several key determinants.",0191-2615,Not found
Bike-sharing inventory management for market expansion,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.009,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Over the past two decades, bike-sharing systems have grown significantly worldwide. Compared with that of other business sectors, the means by which revenue is obtained in the bike-sharing industry is unique. When the market in a region or city is saturated, an efficient way for a firm to increase revenue is to enter a new market. In this study, we design a revenue maximization-oriented decision tool to support the operational decisions of a new competitor firm entering into competition against a local firm. It is assumed that operational-level information from the local firm is unknown to the competitor firm. A new multi-stage max–min–max robust maximization model is proposed. It aims to optimize the dynamic bike inventory to maximize the worst-case revenue that the competitor firm may achieve. The worst-case revenue is treated as the baseline revenue for the competitor firm according to which rational decisions can be made. Specifically, we construct an uncertainty set to capture the uncertainty in the bike distribution of the local firm. To work with this nonconvex model, we design a myopic method, inspired by a special two-stage model that can be solved with a customized constraint-and-column approach, for obtaining the upper and lower bounds of the potential optimal revenue in our multistage model. The results of numerical experiments illustrate that the approximation approach has satisfactory computational efficiency and generates a tight bound of the optimal baseline revenue. Sensitivity analyses show that the new competitor firm should not increase its investment in bikes when the local firm increases its quantity of bikes because of high depreciation costs. Moreover, the two firms would allocate a similar proportion of bikes to each zone when either of them provides a large number of bikes. When the firms both provide a small number of bikes, the allocation of bikes by the new competitor firm is widely dispersed, while the local firm tends to allocate bikes across several zones with high demand. Furthermore, on the premise of a given target, increasing the bike acquisition can improve the robustness of revenue estimation for the competitor firm.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated berth and yard space allocation under uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2022.05.011,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Improving container ports’ operational efficiency to reduce the delays at ports concerns global port operators significantly.

Another lever is by strategical level planning that re-adjust the preferred visiting time windows of vessel calls. It aims to absorb the delays at the scheduling stage rather than in the operations stage. This paper integrates the planning and operations at container ports to jointly optimize strategical level planning and tactical level berth and yard space allocation under uncertain vessel arrival times and uncertain numbers of loading/unloading containers.

This market structure allows the multi-modal platform to coordinate profits across modes and also provide incentives to the passengers. Accordingly, in this paper, we use cooperative game theory coupled with the hyperpath-based stochastic user equilibrium framework to study such a market. We assume that the platform sets incentives (price discount or excess charge on passengers) along every edge in the transportation network. We derive the continuity and monotonicity properties of the equilibrium flow with respect to the incentives along every edge. The optimal incentives that maximize the profit of the platform are obtained through a two time-scale stochastic approximation algorithm. We use the asymmetric Nash bargaining solution to design a fair profit sharing scheme among the service providers. We show that the profit for each service provider increases after cooperation on such a platform.

A general maximum-stability dispatch policy for shared autonomous vehicle dispatch with an analytical characterization of the maximum throughput,10.1016/j.trb.2022.07.003,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have been studied through analytical dispatch methods and simulation. A common question of interest is how many customers can be served per SAV, which necessarily depends on the network characteristics, travel demand, and dispatch policy. We identify equations that describe the maximum set of demands that could be served if an appropriate dispatch policy were chosen. We then provide a dispatch policy that achieves the predicted level of passenger throughput. This is achieved for a general class of SAV behaviors which may include ridesharing, electric SAV recharging, integration with public transit, or combinations thereof. We accomplish this by defining a Markov chain queueing model which admits general SAV behaviors. We say the network is stable if the head-of-line waiting times remain bounded, which is equivalent to serving all customers at the same rate at which they request service. We give equations characterizing the stable region Λ — the set of demands that could be served by any dispatch policy. We prove that any demand outside Λ cannot be completely served. We further prove that our dispatch policy stabilizes the network for any demand in the stable region using Lyapunov drift, establishing Λ as the maximum set of demand that can be served.

Who benefits from air service agreements?

We analyze how such agreements, which regulate total capacity in markets, affect total welfare and its distribution. We consider the interactions between two competing cargo airlines, their end customers, logistics service providers—who serve as intermediaries between the former two agent types—as well as the policy makers. Accounting for demand uncertainty, we model this interaction as a two-stage game. In the first stage, the policy makers coordinate equal capacity allocations to the two asset providers, whereas in the second stage, the asset providers compete over prices in the spot market. Solving the model, we characterize the pricing strategies employed by the two competing capacity-constrained asset providers in the spot market when facing price sensitive demand from end customers. We further analyze the corresponding capacity decisions. We then compare this coordinated competitive setting with a collaborative setting where the two asset providers can (virtually) merge and act as a monopoly. We find that, compared with the monopoly setting, the coordinated duopoly results in lower capacity, lower profits to the asset providers, larger benefits to both end customers and logistics service providers, and overall lower total welfare. These results suggest that policy makers shall hold an open attitude towards a higher level of cooperation among the asset providers. We carry out robustness checks to verify our insights hold with three, rather than two, asset providers, with different demand distributions, when capacity is costly and when asymmetric capacities are allowed in the spot market.",0191-2615,Not found
Analytical approximation and calibration of roundabout capacity: A merging state transition-based modeling approach,10.1016/j.trb.2022.07.006,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This manuscript focuses on the theoretical advancement of causality between entry vehicle dynamics and roundabout capacity modeling, with a merging state transition-based analytical approximation and calibration approach. Gap acceptance models, such as the HCM model, usually ignore roundabout specific operating conditions, whereas empirical models are generally criticized for the lack of fundamental understanding of underlying traffic flow or driving behaviors. The roundabout geometry is firstly extracted into a Y-shaped network, and the traffic movements are illustrated with a state-space-time diagram. Next, we analyze the merging state space for the entry vehicles, and draw the state-transition diagram. The episode of a traffic flow is defined, and we show that the trajectory of an entry vehicle repeats one of four patterns within each episode. Then, state transition-based analytical derivation of roundabout capacity is presented. This is done by estimating the state transition probabilities, followed by an episode-based state transition chain analysis and, finally, finding the solution of state transitions under steady states. Circulating speed is used as a key variable to reflect the operating conditions in the target roundabout. For a special scenario, with all four entry approaches being saturated, we model the interactions between entry flow and circulating flow, and prove that the resulting model can be uniquely solved by classic root-finding algorithms. The accuracy of the proposed model is tested with OpenDD, a real-world high-resolution trajectory dataset collected by drones at four roundabouts.

A neural-embedded discrete choice model: Learning taste representation with strengthened interpretability,10.1016/j.trb.2022.07.001,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Discrete choice models (DCMs) require a priori knowledge of the utility functions, especially how tastes vary across individuals. Utility misspecification may lead to biased estimates, inaccurate interpretations and limited predictability. In this paper, we utilize a neural network to learn taste representation. Our formulation consists of two modules: a neural network (TasteNet) that learns taste parameters (e.g., time coefficient) as flexible functions of individual characteristics; and a multinomial logit (MNL) model with utility functions defined with expert knowledge. Taste parameters learned by the neural network are fed into the choice model and link the two modules. Our approach extends the L-MNL model (Sifringer et al., 2020) by allowing the neural network to learn the interactions between individual characteristics and alternative attributes. Moreover, we formalize and strengthen the interpretability condition — requiring realistic estimates of behavior indicators (e.g., value-of-time, elasticity) at the disaggregated level, which is crucial for a model to be suitable for scenario analysis and policy decisions. Through a unique network architecture and parameter transformation, we incorporate prior knowledge and guide the neural network to output realistic behavior indicators at the disaggregated level. We show that TasteNet-MNL reaches the ground-truth model’s predictability and recovers the nonlinear taste functions on synthetic data. Its estimated value-of-time and choice elasticities at the individual level are close to the ground truth. In contrast, exemplary logit models with misspecified systematic utility lead to biased parameter estimates and lower prediction accuracy. On a publicly available Swissmetro dataset, TasteNet-MNL outperforms benchmarking MNLs and Mixed Logit model’s predictability. It learns a broader spectrum of taste variations within the population and suggests a higher average value-of-time. Our source code is available for research and application.",0191-2615,Not found
Computationally efficient train timetable generation of metro networks with uncertain transfer walking time to reduce passenger waiting time: A generalized Benders decomposition-based method,10.1016/j.trb.2022.07.007,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"With more and more interchange stations in a large-scale metro network, passengers tend to transfer between different metro lines from origination to destination, sometimes even more than once. Passenger waiting time is one of the critical standards for measuring the quality of urban public transport services. To support high service quality, this paper proposes a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the train timetable generation problem of a metro network that minimizes the transfer waiting times and access passenger waiting times. In the mathematical formulation of the model, the transfer walking times at the interchange stations between two connected lines are treated as uncertain parameters. The robust train timetable generation model is formulated to optimize timetables by adjusting arrival and departure times of each train in the metro network to reduce access and transfer passenger waiting times. A robust counterpart is further derived that transforms the formulated robust model into a deterministic one.

The subproblem is a convex quadratic programming problem that can be solved efficiently.

Omnichannel facility location and fulfillment optimization,10.1016/j.trb.2022.07.005,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"E-commerce has been evolving towards omnichannel as we have witnessed many once pure e-retailers opening physical stores or showrooms to enable customers to inspect the product and quickly assess product fit. In omnichannel transportation operations, these stores can strategically fulfill online orders to improve delivery efficiency and reduce transportation costs. Motivated by this trend, this paper studies a pure e-retail company that plans to introduce the offline channel with physical stores and practice omnichannel distribution. For the e-retailer, opening stores can benefit from the reduced transportation cost and the increased revenue, both of which inherently depend on how customers choose channels and stores to make purchases. To this end, we employ a discrete choice model to estimate customers’ choices and then propose a modeling framework that jointly optimizes the location of stores and the omnichannel fulfillment strategy to maximize the profit, accounting for the revenue, the transportation cost, and the fixed operating cost of stores. To solve the model of practical scale, we develop a branch-and-cut algorithm, which leverages Benders cuts that are generated on-the-fly using two analytical separation functions. Our computational studies suggest that the proposed algorithm is efficient for solving large-scale problems. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis and draw insightful observations.",0191-2615,Not found
Globally convergent line search algorithm with Euler-based step size-determination method for continuous network design problem,10.1016/j.trb.2022.07.004,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Most solution algorithms for the continuous network design problem (CNDP) follow the line search principle. However, they mainly focus on identifying a feasible descent direction in each iteration. No efficient approaches have been proposed to determine a step size in each iteration to enhance the convergence speed because the equilibrium flows in CNDP are implicit functions of the decision variables. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a norm-relaxed method of feasible direction (NRMFD) algorithm integrated with the Euler-based approximation (EBA) method for the CNDP under user equilibrium (UE). At each iteration, after a feasible descent direction is determined by solving a quadratic program, this algorithm computes a feasible step size to reduce the value of the objective function using the EBA method. The main idea of the EBA method is to adaptively generate a sequence of candidate step sizes and estimate the respective UE link flows and objective function. The feasible step size that reduces the objective function the most is accepted in the NRMFD algorithm to achieve a faster convergence speed. The EBA method is computationally efficient as it linearly approximates the UE solution rather than solving it precisely. The NRMFD algorithm integrated with the EBA method is analytically proved to be globally convergent. Numerical examples indicate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently and effectively solve the CNDP in a few iterations.",0191-2615,Not found
Tradable mobility permits in a monocentric city with pre-existing labor taxation: A general equilibrium perspective,10.1016/j.trb.2022.07.002,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This paper studies tradable mobility permit schemes in a monocentric city with a distorting labor tax, considering spatially differentiated allocations of permits to households. Numerical results show that an allocation of permits proportional to labor supply reaches about 99.9% of first-best welfare, clearly outperforming a scheme with lump-sum allocation of permits, and being more efficient than the second-best tax for levels of the labor tax of 20% or higher. This is due to the welfare gains of incentivizing labor supply, which has an effect similar to the revenue recycling effect of conventional road pricing, and that can be optimized by the social planner by exploiting spatial differences. Other alternatives, such as an allocation of permits proportional to distance from the CBD and a cordon-based scheme do not reach those high levels of efficiency. Our results provide insights into the efficiency of tradable driving permit schemes as an alternative to road pricing to tackle present externalities, showing that a spatial differentiation of the allocation of permits can be a powerful instrument in the hands of the regulator.",0191-2615,Not found
Efficient and stable data-sharing in a public transit oligopoly as a coopetitive game,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.013,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"In this study, various forms of data sharing are axiomatized. A new way of studying coopetition, especially data-sharing coopetition, is proposed. The problem of the Bayesian game with signal dependence on actions is observed; and a method to handle such dependence is proposed. We focus on fixed-route transit service markets. A discrete model is first presented to analyze the data-sharing coopetition of an oligopolistic transit market when an externality effect exists. Given a fixed data sharing structure, a Bayesian game is used to capture the competition under uncertainty while a coalition formation model is used to determine the stable data-sharing decisions. A new method of composite coalition is proposed to study efficient markets. An alternative continuous model is proposed to handle large networks using simulation. We apply these models to various types of networks. Test results show that perfect information may lead to perfect selfishness. Sharing more data does not necessarily improve transit service for all groups, at least if transit operators remain noncooperative. Service complementarity does not necessarily guarantee a grand data-sharing coalition. These results can provide insights on policy-making, like whether city authorities should enforce compulsory data-sharing along with cooperation between operators or setup a voluntary data-sharing platform.",0191-2615,Not found
Two-sided pricing strategies for a parking sharing platform: Reselling or commissioning?,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.009,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"A parking sharing platform plays the role of a matchmaker between parking ‘slot owners/sharers’ and ‘slot renters’ who demand parking. The platform can act as either a reseller or a commissioner, and can have different economic objectives when setting prices for owners and renters. This paper is the first to address a platform operator’s pricing strategy in a two-sided parking sharing market under different business formats (reselling and commissioning) and different economic objectives (profit-maximization and social welfare-maximization). The number of parking slots rented out is assumed to be an increasing function of the number of suppliers (owners) who offer a slot for rent, and the number of demanders (parkers) who request a slot. We derive the supply–demand matching equilibrium and the platform’s two-sided pricing strategies for the alternative business formats and objectives. We also analytically and numerically examine how the buying and selling prices, and numbers of participating owners, renters, and transactions vary with parameter values in each business format. We find that a welfare-maximizing platform earns a positive profit if the matching function has decreasing returns to scale, and incurs a deficit if the matching function has increasing returns to scale. If the cost of inconvenience to slot owners from renting a slot equals their cost of disappointment from failing to rent it out, then the reselling and commissioning formats can replicate each other (i.e, they can yield identical platform profit and social welfare). If the cost of inconvenience is greater then the commissioning format is superior, whereas if the disappointment is greater the reselling format is preferred.",0191-2615,Not found
Real-time deployable and robust cooperative control strategy for a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles by factoring uncertain vehicle dynamics,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.012,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"In real-world driving environments, a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will be subject to many disturbances (e.g., aerodynamic drag, dynamic road gradients) that can prevent them from achieving desired control accurately. These disturbances can cause uncertainties in the vehicle dynamics, reducing platoon safety and mobility. To address this problem, this study proposes a robust cooperative control (RCC) strategy, developed as a minimax problem, to ensure the safe and efficient maneuvering of a CAV platoon in the worst-case situation due to uncertainties in the vehicle dynamics. The maximization subproblem of the minimax problem determines the inputs of the uncertainties to maximize the cost function (i.e., the platoon performance indicator), while the minimization subproblem seeks to optimize the control decisions for all following vehicles in the platoon to minimize the cost function using inputs of the uncertainties from the maximization subproblem. A novel partition-based method of feasible direction is proposed to solve the minimax problem. It is globally convergent and computationally efficient, enabling the RCC strategy to be deployed in real time. The conditions for robust stability of the CAV platoon are also analyzed. Results from numerical studies show that compared to a control strategy that ignores uncertainties in vehicle dynamics, the RCC strategy can substantially improve the platoon performance under disturbances. Hence, it can be used to enable the safe and efficient maneuvering of CAV platoons in a real-world driving environment.",0191-2615,Not found
Business analytics meets artificial intelligence: Assessing the demand effects of discounts on Swiss train tickets,10.1016/j.trb.2022.06.006,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"We assess the demand effects of discounts on train tickets issued by the Swiss Federal Railways, the so-called ‘supersaver tickets’, based on machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence. Considering a survey-based sample of buyers of supersaver tickets, we use causal machine learning to assess the impact of the discount rate on rescheduling a trip, which seems relevant in the light of capacity constraints at rush hours. Assuming that (i) the discount rate is quasi-random conditional on our rich set of characteristics and (ii) the buying decision increases weakly monotonically in the discount rate, we identify the discount rate’s effect among ‘always buyers’, who would have traveled even without a discount, based on our survey that asks about customer behavior in the absence of discounts. We find that on average, increasing the discount rate by one percentage point increases the share of rescheduled trips by 0.16 percentage points among always buyers. Investigating effect heterogeneity across observables suggests that the effects are higher for leisure travelers and during peak hours when controlling several other characteristics.",0191-2615,Not found
A New Flexible Generalized Heterogeneous Data Model (GHDM) with an Application to Examine the Effect of High Density Neighborhood Living on Bicycling Frequency,10.1016/j.trb.2022.09.004,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"There is growing interest in multivariate dependent outcome models that include a mixture of different kinds of discrete and continuous variables. This may be attributed to at least two reasons. The first is the ability to generate multivariate distributions through the use of relatively flexible copula-based methods and/or effective factorization techniques for the covariance matrices. The second is the development of computationally efficient ways to estimate models based on variational methods for Bayesian inference or maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood methods for frequentist inference. However, there are two important assumptions in earlier mixed data models: (i) marginal normality of unobserved factors that generate jointness among the main outcome variables of interest, and (ii) independence between the unobserved factors and the propensity equations underlying the main outcomes of interest. In the current paper, we simultaneously relax both these assumptions and develop a flexible Generalized Heterogeneous Data Model (GHDM) for mixed data modeling. We then propose a hybrid MSL-MACML inference approach for estimation. We demonstrate an application of our proposed model in the context of individuals’ high-density residential neighborhood living choice and monthly bicycling frequency.

Coordinating transportation and pricing policies for perishable products,10.1016/j.trb.2022.08.005,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"We study the joint pricing and transportation problem in a perishable product supply chain where products with different levels of quality are substitutable depending on the pricing policy and the customers’ quality sensitivity. We propose two frameworks to study this problem under sequential and integrated systems. Pricing and transportation decisions are made separately and then coordinated through an iterative process in the sequential model, but jointly optimized in the integrated system. The integration of transportation and pricing leads to a challenging mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) formulation which is intractable for the current state-of-the-art commercial solvers. We exploit the special structure of this formulation and develop a Benders type decomposition method with a transportation master problem and a collection of pricing subproblems. To evaluate the proposed models and algorithms, we perform numerical experiments on an illustrative case study. We show that the performance of the sequential model is noticeably inferior to the integrated optimization model on two key metrics: profit and product waste. We observe, counter-intuitively, that the presence of customers with lower quality sensitivity who tolerate imperfect products increases the waste to sales ratio. Moreover, due to the interrelationship between pricing and transportation policies, the waste to sales ratio is not monotone in the cost of the freshness keeping efforts. Finally, we show the practical efficiency of our proposed decomposition-based algorithm in solving the MIQP compared to the state-of-the-art solver.",0191-2615,Not found

Recently, a series of experimental studies have suggested that the stochastic factors contribute significantly to destabilizing traffic flow. Nevertheless, the traffic flow stability of the stochastic second-order macroscopic continuum model has not received the attention it deserves in past studies. More importantly, we have found that the destabilizing aspect of stochasticity is still not correctly validated in the existing theoretical stability analysis. In this paper, we analytically study the impact of stochasticity on traffic flow stability for a general stochastic second-order macroscopic model by using the direct Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations have been carried out for different typical stochastic second-order macroscopic models. Our analytical stability analysis has been validated, and our methodology has been proved more efficient.

Bayesian optimization techniques for high-dimensional simulation-based transportation problems,10.1016/j.trb.2022.08.009,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Bayesian optimization (BO) is an attractive method for tackling transportation optimization problems due to its ability to balance exploitation and exploration. However, scaling BO to solve high-dimensional problems is a major challenge which has remained unsolved. Since transportation problems can be high-dimensional, the use of BO to solve transportation problems has been limited. This paper explores the use of BO with Gaussian process (GP) models to tackle high-dimensional transportation problems. It proposes formulations of the prior mean function and covariance function of the GP that enable BO to incorporate problem-specific transportation information, while remaining computationally tractable. This is done through the use of an analytical surrogate model. We validate the method with the 1-D and 100-D Griewank functions. The impact of different forms of bias in the surrogate model was also evaluated using the 100-D Griewank function example. We then apply the method to a high-dimensional traffic signal control problem in New York City. The results indicate the added value of using the problem-specific information in the prior mean and/or the covariance function. Importantly, for surrogate models that are not accurate approximations of, but have significant (anti-)correlation with the true objective function, the better approach is to embed the information in the covariance function, rather than in the prior mean function. More generally, the use of problem-specific information in the covariance function is robust to the accuracy of the surrogate model. This opens the way for a variety of low-resolution analytical transportation models to be used to tackle high-dimensional simulation-based optimization problems.",0191-2615,Not found

It can be used to efficiently and accurately evaluate the joint (in the spatial and temporal sense) distribution of vehicle-density distributions in road traffic networks of arbitrary topology. The Gaussian approximation follows, via a scaling-limit argument, from a Markovian model that is consistent with discrete-space kinematic wave models. We describe in detail how this formal result can be converted into a computational procedure. The performance of our approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments that feature various realistic scenarios. Moreover, we discuss the computational complexity of our approach by assessing how computation times depend on the network size. We also argue that the (debatable) assumption that the vehicles’ headways are exponentially distributed does not negatively impact the accuracy of our approximation.",0191-2615,Not found
Modeling bounded rationality in discretionary lane change with the quantal response equilibrium of game theory,10.1016/j.trb.2022.08.008,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The primary purpose of discretionary lane change is to provide a speed advantage or a better driving environment. Game theory is one way to find each driver's most reasonable behavior plan by studying their competitive lane-changing behavior. Nash equilibrium provides an effective strategy to ensure the lane-changing vehicle can reach the maximum value of its expected returns. Other vehicles in the game also follow this strategy. However, due to the inadequate understanding of the driving environment and drivers’ physiological and psychological factors, it is difficult to have the entirely rational conditions required by Nash equilibrium, whose solution is usually quite different from the actual result. To quantify drivers’ rationality in lane-changing decisions, we established a model of bounded rationality based on the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), in which drivers are not perfect optimizers and face uncertainty in other drivers’ actions. The maximum likelihood estimation and data analysis from NGSIM confirm that drivers in discretionary lane-changing games exhibit bounded rationality. As the lane-changing decision continues, drivers become more aware of their surroundings to be more rational. More than 91.5% of our model predictions are in line, which means our QRE model can effectively describe discretionary lane-changing decision behavior. Compared to Talebpour's game model, our model has a stronger predictive ability and can more accurately describe discretionary lane-changing behavior.",0191-2615,Not found

We show that our proposed model, including a fractional MDC model at the lower level linked up to a Tobit model for the budget allocation to the inside goods, is strictly consistent with a two-stage budgeting utility theoretic structure. As importantly, by using reverse Gumbel distributional assumptions for the stochastic terms in the model system, we derive an incredibly simple closed-form model that, to our knowledge, is a first of its kind in the econometric literature. In doing so, we formally introduce a new distribution, which we label as the minLogistic distribution, to the statistical literature, and derive the properties of the distribution that is then used in the forecasting stage of the proposed model. An application of the proposed model to investigate the household vehicle fleet composition and usage demonstrates its potential relative to an unlinked and exogenously developed budget for the inside goods.

When aiming to follow the existing hours of service regulations, however, parking space for trucks in service areas is often scarce, especially along crowded mainlines. In this context, the paper on hand investigates whether a central platform coordinating the usage of limited parking capacity on the supply side and truck drivers’ individual drive and rest schedules on the demand side can be advantageous. Specifically, we formulate a holistic optimization problem, which jointly determines the drive and rest schedules for a given set of trucks with fixed routes and coordinates their assignment to a limited number of available parking spaces over time. To solve this problem, we introduce a heuristic solution procedure, which is benchmarked with the status quo, where each driver seeks parking space individually, and a booking platform that allows to reserve parking space ahead of arrival. Our computational results reveal that a booking platform that produces much less organizational overhead is almost as effective as a central matching platform based on perfect knowledge of all truck schedules.",0191-2615,Not found

Analytical models are developed to evaluate the expected performance of a facility location design across an exponential number of facility disruption scenarios. In each of these scenarios, customers travel to a functioning facility through a continuous space, and their destination and path choices under traffic equilibrium are described by a class of partial differential equation (PDE). A closed-form solution to the PDE is derived in an explicit matrix form, and this paper shows how the traffic equilibrium patterns across all facility disruption scenarios can be evaluated in a polynomial time.

A General Framework to Forecast the Adoption of Novel Products: A Case of Autonomous Vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2022.09.009,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Due to the unavailability of prototypes, the early adopters of novel products actively seek information from multiple sources (e.g., media and social networks) to minimize the potential risk. The existing behavior models not only fail to capture the information propagation within the individual's social network, but also they do not incorporate the impact of such word-of-mouth (WOM) dissemination on the consumer's risk preferences. Moreover, even cutting-edge forecasting models rely on crude/synthetic consumer behavior models. We propose a general framework to forecast the adoption of novel products by developing a new consumer behavior model and integrating it into a population-level agent-based model. Specifically, we extend the hybrid choice model to estimate consumer behavior, which incorporates social network effects and interplay between WOM and risk aversion. The calibrated consumer behavior model and synthetic population are passed through the agent-based model for forecasting the product market share. We apply the proposed framework to forecast the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in Nashville, USA. The consumer behavior model is calibrated with a stated preference survey data of 1,495 Nashville residents. The output of the agent-based model provides the effect of the purchase price, post-purchase satisfaction, and safety measures/regulations on the forecasted AV market share. With an annual AV price reduction of 5% at the initial purchase price of $60,000 and 90% of satisfied adopters, AVs are forecasted to attain around 80% market share in thirty-one years.

For several decades, researchers have studied the stability of traffic flow using deterministic traffic models, with less emphasis on the presence of stochastic factors. However, recent empirical and theoretical findings have demonstrated that the stochastic factors tend to destabilize traffic flow and stimulate the concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations. In this paper, we derive a string stability condition of a general stochastic continuous car-following model by the mean of the generalized Lyapunov equation. We have found, indeed, that the presence of stochasticity destabilizes the traffic flow. The impact of stochasticity depends on both the sensitivity to the gap and the sensitivity to the velocity difference. Numerical simulations of three typical car-following models have been carried out to validate our theoretical analysis. Finally, we have calibrated and validated the stochastic car-following models against empirical data.

The links carrying the traffic from one intersection to another in the network are partitioned into a series of cells whose dynamics is modelled as a nonlinear cell transmission model. A microscopic convergence analysis is presented for the network where the traffic lights at the intersections are controlled by pre-timed control in which the average flow rate along each link is assumed to be known accurately. A macroscopic convergence analysis is applied to the traffic network where the traffic lights are controlled by coordinated model predictive control. In coordinated model predictive control, each local agent optimizes the switching times of traffic light at one intersection online with sampled local traffic state around this intersection and exchanged information from neighbouring intersections. A unique periodic function for the microscopic steady state is proved to exist under pre-timed control while a unique macroscopic steady state is achieved under coordinated model predictive control for the traffic lights. This paper validates by simulations that the ability of coordinated model predictive control to stabilize the traffic demand is not worse than pre-timed control even though the average flow rate along each link is not assumed to be known and further no explicit cycle time for the traffic light is suggested. Moreover, the incurred delay from the steady state is lower on the average under coordinated model predictive control compared to pre-timed control.",0191-2615,Not found

Hybrid modeling of lane changes near freeway diverges,10.1016/j.trb.2022.09.002,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This paper proposes a discrete/continuum hybrid framework for modeling the effects of lane-changing (LC) activity near freeway diverges in an effort to explain puzzling empirical observations of congestion waves not captured by current models for discretionary lane changes (DLCs). We show that this discrepancy is explained by the disruption of mandatory lane changes (MLCs), which come to a complete stop while waiting for a gap in the target lane. This disruption causes a backup upstream of the MLC and a void downstream responsible for reducing capacity. Our contribution is the formulation of two stochastic processes to capture these effects in the context of a hybrid framework combining the kinematic wave theory and moving bottlenecks treated as discrete particles. We find that the proposed method successfully replicates empirical observations, especially when it comes to the formation and propagation of stop-and-go waves. We also show that traditional continuum methods for treating lane changing are unable to capture observations. In all, our finding indicates that a key element to replicate traffic instabilities observed near freeway exits is the disruptive nature of both MLCs and DLCs. When this extreme disruption takes place, the system becomes chaotic and congestion spreads throughout the network quickly. The proposed hybrid approach requires only two additional parameters, and research is ongoing to determine if these parameters are transferable to other locations.",0191-2615,Not found
Shall firms withhold exact waiting time information from their customers? A transport example,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.003,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Apps which allow customers to check waiting times in real time on their smartphones become increasingly popular across many industries. Waiting time information is ambiguous in the sense that it is good news for some customers and bad news for other customers depending on whether they get to know that they have to wait short or long times, respectively. This paper studies the strategic choice of information strategies by considering a transport company that charges a uniform price to passengers. Waiting times are determined by headways which are given by the time difference between vehicle departures. The sum of the price and waiting time costs (determined by the waiting times and time valuations) represent the full price of traveling which vary among passengers depending on arrival times at the station. Passengers respond to variations in the full price by adjusting their demand rates in the sense that passengers may use an alternative mode of transport or refuse to travel if they have to wait or expect to wait for too long for the next departure. Two types of information strategies are considered. The company can advertise the exact schedule or advertise only the average lengths of interdeparture times (headways). The analysis shows that the curvature of the demand-rate function in the waiting time is crucial for the choice of information strategies in both the case of profit-maximizing companies and the case of welfare-maximizing companies where welfare is calculated by the sum of profit and consumer surplus. Numerical examples further indicate the crucial role of demand rate curvatures for headway and price choices.",0191-2615,Not found
Does big data help answer big questions? The case of airport catchment areas &amp; competition,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.013,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"We develop algorithms to analyze Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) data in order to estimate individuals’ mobility at different spatial scales. Specifically, we apply the algorithms to delineate airport catchment areas in the United Kingdom’s Greater London region and to estimate ground access trip times from a very large ICT dataset. The spatial demand is regressed over demographic, socio-economic, airport-specific and ground access modal characteristics in order to determine the drivers of airport demand. Drawing on these insights, we develop a catchment area game inspired by Hotelling that analyzes the potential impact of collaboration between airports and airlines by integrating evidence of consumer behavior with producers’ financial data. We apply the game to a case study of two London airports with overlapping catchment areas for local residents. Our assessment of airline-airport vertical collusion and airport-airport horizontal collusion indicates that the former is beneficial to both producers and passengers. In contrast, whilst horizontal and vertical collusion is the equilibrium outcome in the analytic symmetric case, it is found to be less likely in the asymmetric case and the real-world, data-driven analysis, due to catchment area and cost asymmetries. Thus, such new datasets may enable regulators to overcome the long-standing information asymmetry issue that has yet to be resolved. Combining new data sources with traditional consumer surveys may provide more informed insights into both consumers’ and producers’ actions, which determines the need (or lack thereof) for regulatory intervention in aviation markets.",0191-2615,Not found
Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Driver Consistency and service time optimization,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.004,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Driver Consistency is an extension of the classic Vehicle Routing Problem in which routes for several vehicles have to be determined over a time horizon of several days. Each customer has an associated set of possible visit schedules and must be visited always by the same vehicle. In this paper, we study a variant of the PVRP-DC in which, in addition to routes and visit schedules, service times of customers have to be determined in order to maximize the utility of the service to the company. We call this problem the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Driver Consistency and Service Time Optimization.

Costs and benefits of parking charges in residential areas,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.012,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"We develop a model for empirical evaluation of the social costs and benefits of street parking charges. From the model, we derive an expression for optimal parking charges and occupancy levels: in optimum, parking search costs are balanced against the loss of consumer surplus from unused parking spaces. Contrary to rules-of-thumb common in practice, optimal occupancy levels are not constant but depend on parking turnover rates and parking search costs. We demonstrate the model's applicability in a case study from Stockholm, where parking charges were recently introduced in suburban residential areas. The charges had considerable effects on parking demand, but our analysis shows that the overall welfare effect was a substantial welfare loss. Using parameters and demand functions estimated from the case study, we calculate optimal parking charges and occupancy levels, and show that the welfare loss arises because the introduced charges were considerably higher than the optimal ones.",0191-2615,Not found
Can day-to-day dynamic model be solved analytically? New insights on portraying equilibrium and accommodating autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.003,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper develops a new approach to portray the equilibrium and analyze the appropriate lane policy during different deployment stages of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by innovatively integrating Vickrey's bottleneck model into the day-to-day dynamic model. The travel cost function in the classical bottleneck model is described by considering the impact of AVs’ value of time (VOT) reduction and AV gain. The evolution of lane choice behaviors is described using the first-order and second-order day-to-day dynamic model. Furthermore, three lane policies are proposed to accommodate AVs’ development, and the properties for the endogenous market penetration of AVs and travel cost under three lane policies are examined to recognize which policy is more suitable at different development stages of AVs. The results demonstrate that such equilibrium solutions as traffic flow, total travel cost, the convergence time are all analytically solvable and thus can perfectly answer the problem of stability and convergence involved in the day-to-day dynamic model. Finally, the numerical analysis is conducted to verify the previous findings and get some intuitive insights on system performance. This work not only provides new insights on the evolutionary process of AVs’ and regular vehicles (RVs)’ lane choice behaviors, but also recognizes appropriate lane policy to accommodate AVs from a novel perspective.",0191-2615,Not found
A random-utility-consistent machine learning method to estimate agents’ joint activity scheduling choice from a ubiquitous data set,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.005,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"We propose an agent-based mixed-logit model (AMXL) that is estimated with inverse optimization (IO) estimation, an agent-level machine learning method theoretically consistent with a utility-maximizing mixed logit model framework. The method provides joint, individual-specific, and deterministic estimation, which overcomes the limitations of discrete choice models (DCMs) given ubiquitous datasets. A case study of the CBD in Shanghai is conducted with mobile phone data of 26,149 anonymous commuters whose whole-day activity schedule on weekdays contains three sub-choices and 1,470 alternatives. AMXL is built to estimate individual tastes and predict the activity scheduling choice in different scenarios. Multinomial logit model (MNL), mixed logit model (MXL), and their dynamic forms (DMNL, DMXL) are built as benchmarks. Prediction accuracies are calculated as the percentage consistency of observed choices and predicted choices, both at individual level (to each commuter) and aggregated level (to each alternative in the choice set). The results show that empirical coefficient distributions in AMXL are neither Gumbel nor Gaussian, i.e. capturing inter-individual heterogeneities in space that are hard for DCMs to capture. The prediction accuracy of AMXL is significantly higher than the best model (DMXL) in benchmarks, improving from 8.66% to 61.68% at aggregated level and from 1.69% to 4.33% at individual level. In a comparison scenario, AMXL predicts different while reasonable change of choices compared with benchmark models. In an optimization scenario, AMXL can be directly integrated into a binary programming (BP) problem, which optimally allocates 10 blocks to send restaurant coupons to increase population consumer surplus by 19%.",0191-2615,Not found
The price of symmetric line plans in the Parametric City,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.009,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"We consider the line planning problem in public transport in the Parametric City, an idealized model that captures typical scenarios by a (small) number of parameters. The Parametric City is rotation symmetric, but optimal line plans are not always symmetric. This raises the question to quantify the symmetry gap between the best symmetric and the overall best solution. For our analysis, we formulate the line planning problem as a mixed integer linear program, that can be solved in polynomial time if the solutions are forced to be symmetric. We prove that the symmetry gap is small when a specific Parametric City parameter is fixed, and we give an approximation algorithm for line planning in the Parametric City in this case. While the symmetry gap can be arbitrarily large in general, we show that symmetric line plans are a good choice in most practical situations.",0191-2615,Not found
A comprehensive toolbox for load retrieval in puzzle-based storage systems with simultaneous movements,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.002,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Puzzle-based storage (PBS) is one of the most space-efficient types of storage systems. In a PBS unit, loads are stored in a grid of cells, where each cell may be empty or contain a load. A load can move only to adjacent empty cells. These cells are termed escorts in the literature, and their number is relatively small. When a load is requested for retrieval, a sequence of load movements is performed in order to bring it to an input/output (I/O) point of the unit. In this paper we minimize a weighted sum of two objectives. The first is the retrieval time of a requested item, and the second objective is the number of moves. While the first objective is associated with the quality of service, the second objective considers energy saving. Note that this operational problem should be solved quickly for every load request. The movement characteristics of loads in the PBS unit are determined by the technology used for its operation. In the most general and intricate case, simultaneous movements of blocks of loads can be performed, while simpler technology may allow only sequential movements or simultaneous movement of single loads. PBS units may also have one or several I/O points. In the latter case, the load may be retrieved via any one of the I/O points, based on the operator’s discretion. In this paper, we suggest a suite of complementary tools to solve load retrieval problems under various technology, including simultaneous block and load movements. First, we present a time-expanded-graph based integer linear-programming (ILP) formulation. This formulation provides optimal solutions for problems with a relatively large number of escorts and obtains lower bounds for other cases. For problems with a small number of escorts, we suggest a dynamic programming (DP) solution approach. A custom-made heuristic based on the DP approach was developed for the rest of the cases. Experiments show that our solution approaches’ ensemble yields optimal or near-optimal solutions to most of our benchmark instances.",0191-2615,Not found
Evaluating port efficiency dynamics: A risk-based approach,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.002,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This study proposes a new methodology to quantify the efficiency dynamics of a port over time. While efficiency evaluation has gained full attention in port management, researchers conducting related studies are challenged by temporal variations observed in the collected data. Existing approaches have almost exclusively relied on multivariate normal distributional assumptions of the input and output data, but empirical evidence from real data shows that the port operations data demonstrate long-tail distributions and violate the distributional assumptions. In addition, many existing models are intractable (non-convex) or lack interpretability. Motivated by these challenges, we develop an optimization-based approach for efficiency measurement under uncertainty that is compatible with the conventional non-parametric method. In particular, inspired by the coherent risk measure, we create a risk-based index to measure the efficiency of any operating unit by comparing its observations against a benchmark that is guaranteed to be production possible under a certain risk level. To facilitate the computation of the index, we develop a risk-based port efficiency evaluation (RPE) model, which can be reformulated as an exponential cone program (ECP) and solved efficiently by off-the-shelf solvers. We test our model for a multipurpose port on a real dataset of 3,394 observations showing the proposed approach’s merits. We find that the port productivity peaks on Tuesday and Saturday and troughs on Friday. We also provide evidence for the Chinese New Year effect from a port management perspective and draw managerial insights from the study.",0191-2615,Not found
Stochastic modeling and adaptive forecasting for parking space availability with drivers’ time-varying arrival/departure behavior,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.014,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Parking space availability is valuable information to travelers. This paper aims at modeling drivers’ behavioral changes in arrivals/departures over time of day and developing an adaptive forecasting approach for parking space availability. We propose a stochastic model that consists of two inter-connected Markov processes. First, the lower level of the model focuses on the parking behavior within a short time period, based on conventional M/M/C/C queueing theory with the assumption of fixed arrival and parking rates. Next, to account for the behavioral changes in drivers’ arrivals/departures over a longer time period (e.g. time of day), we incorporate a Markov regime switching process to describe the regime switching mechanism of the arrival/departure behavior. The integrated model leads to an adaptive forecasting formula with time-varying forecasting coefficients adaptively adjusted based on the arrival/departure regimes. We investigate two real traffic applications to illustrate the developed stochastic model and to test the performance of the adaptive forecasting method using out-of-sample data.",0191-2615,Not found
The effects of information publicity and government subsidy on port climate change adaptation: Strategy and social welfare analysis,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.001,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper develops an integrated economic model to examine two competing ports’ investment in adaptation to climate-change disasters. The ports have asymmetric information on the actual disaster damage. In deciding on adaptation investment, the “leader” port is a better-informed first mover and the “follower” port is a less-informed follower. The government is able to acquire and verify port adaptation information and chooses whether to publicize it (publicity policy) or keep it confidential (confidentiality policy). If the information is publicized, the leader port initiates a signaling game in which it makes a decision first, and the follower acts after observing the leader's decision. Under the confidentiality policy, both ports make their decisions simultaneously. Our analysis shows the following. 1) Under the publicity policy, the leader port does not adopt a pooling strategy; rather, it determines its adaptation and output based on true information on disaster damage (i.e., it implements a separating equilibrium). 2) The publicity policy has two effects: it increases the leader's throughput while decreasing the follower's throughput (i.e., the throughput effect), and it helps rationalize the follower's adaptation investment by making more up-to-date disaster information available (i.e., the adaptation investment effect). 3) When the degree of inter-port competition is high, the publicity policy improves social welfare by increasing the total throughput of the two ports (i.e., an overall positive throughput effect) and rationalizes the follower's adaptation investment (i.e., a positive adaptation investment effect). Otherwise, it reduces the total throughput of the ports (i.e., an overall negative throughput effect). This negative throughput effect may outweigh the positive adaptation investment effect, thereby reducing social welfare. These analytical results suggest that the government needs to promote inter-port competition if it decides to publicize port adaptation information. Finally, we find that the joint implementation of publicity and subsidy policies could result in excessive adaptation investment, leading to social welfare loss. Our study illustrates the important effects of information asymmetry on adaptation investment and has policy implications in the presence of port competition and government subsidy.",0191-2615,Not found
A multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model with ordered preferences (MDCEV-OP): Modelling framework for episode-level activity participation and time-use analysis,10.1016/j.trb.2022.09.008,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper formulates a novel, multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model with ordered preferences (MDCEV-OP) to analyze multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) choices at a disaggregate level, including the number of instances different alternatives are chosen and the amount of consumption at each instance of choice. In doing so, the proposed model ensures a logically consistent prediction of multiple choice instances of an alternative. Specifically, the model prevents the prediction of positive allocation to the jth instance (i.e., a frequency of j episodes) of a good while predicting zero allocation to the (j-1)th or lower-numbered instances of that alternative. This is achieved by imposing a non-increasing order on the baseline-preference parameters of different choice instances of an alternative. The model results in a conditional likelihood function, where the likelihood arising from the optimality conditions of the utility maximization problem is conditioned on the ordering of baseline marginal utilities. Combining this strategy with independent and identically distributed (IID) Gumbel stochastic terms in the utility functions results in a closed-form likelihood expression that is not much more difficult than that of the MDCEV model. The proposed framework is applied for an empirical analysis of disaggregate, episode-level activity participation and time allocation behavior of non-working adults in Los Angeles, California. The empirical MDCEV-OP model provided better fit and predictive accuracy (in both estimation and validation datasets) for analyzing episode-level activity participation than a disaggregate MDCEV model that does not recognize the logical ordering of episodes. At the same time, the activity-level predictions aggregated from the episode-level predictions of the MDCEV-OP model do not deviate significantly from the predictions of an aggregate MDCEV model. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed model for analyzing episode-level activity generation and time allocation.",0191-2615,Not found

The Lagrangian, in-the-flow nature of their operation offers untapped new potentials for sensing and actuation, but also presents new fundamental challenges.

To this end, we propose the Front-tracking Transition System Model, a cell-free modelling approach that can incorporate Lagrangian measurements, and has a structure that yields itself to on-line model learning and control. The model is formulated as a transition system, and based on the front-tracking method for finding entropy solutions to the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards model. We characterize the solution of this model and show that it corresponds to the solution of the underlying PDE traffic model. Algorithms for traffic state reconstruction and model learning are proposed, exploiting the model structure.

Rich arc routing problem in city logistics: Models and solution algorithms using a fluid queue-based time-dependent travel time representation,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.011,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"City logistics, as an essential component of the city operation system, aims at managing the complex flow of goods and services from providers to customers efficiently. Delays associated with peak-period traffic congestion exists in both large and small metropolitan areas. As many of the service tasks in city logistics are needed to be performed during peak hours, operators of urban management movement should consider reducing the total trip time and delay when designing service plans. Equally important, the congestion impact of service vehicles to other road users should also be considered. In this paper, we focus on formulating and solving rich arc routing problems (RARPs) in city logistics with a congested urban environment. We highlight the needs of embedding a structurally parsimonious time-dependent travel time model in RARP for producing high-quality and practically useful solutions. A fluid queue model based analytical approach is presented for link travel time calibration in the form of polynomial arrival rate functions. Accordingly, system-wide (societal) impact of vehicles routing is analytically derived and incorporated into the RARP models which enables traffic managers to systematically consider operation costs and societal impacts when designing routing policies in real-life city logistics applications. Additionally, we develop two new representation schemes for time-dependent travel time modeling in RARPs, including a discretized time-expanded representation scheme and a nonlinear polynomial representation scheme. Three modeling approaches for RARPs are proposed, with different perspectives of capturing time-dependent travel time and formulating problem-specific constraints. With a real-life sprinkler truck routing problem as the representative example of RARP, we develop two efficient exact solution algorithms, including a Lagrangian relaxation-based method and a branch-and-price based method. The latter one is embedded with an enhanced parallel branch-and-bound algorithm.

Dynamic container drayage with uncertain request arrival times and service time windows,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.010,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Container drayage plays a critical role in intermodal global container transportation, as it accomplishes the first- and last-mile shipment of containers. A container drayage operator dispatches a set of tractors and a set of trailers to transport containers within a local area. An important aspect of the operations is that the arrival times of service requests are uncertain, which means that the operator should respond to the requests dynamically. Moreover, since customers usually impose time windows on container pickup and delivery, it would be important to exploit the service flexibilities of requests when allocating resources in order to enhance the resource efficiency. In this paper, we study a dynamic container drayage problem that arises from the practical operations of container drayage. We develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model for the problem to capture the dynamic interactions between the drayage operator and the uncertain environment. For solving the MDP model, we propose a novel integrated reinforcement learning and integer programming method, in which reinforcement learning enables real-time responses to requests by determining whether each request should be served immediately upon arrival or be held for a period of time, while integer programming plans resource allocation periodically for serving the accrued requests. The proposed method aims to identify a fleet management policy that exploits requests’ service flexibilities to maximize the operator’s service capacity and profitability. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed method on instances generated from the operational data of a container drayage operator in Singapore.",0191-2615,Not found
Strategic collaboration between land owners and charging station operators: Lease or outsource?,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.004,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Many regions of the world aim to phase out conventional private gasoline cars within ten years, requiring imminent expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. However, because of high installation and maintenance costs, many landowners (LOs), such as shopping malls and commercial building owners, hesitate to install and operate large-scale EV charging facilities of their own volition. In light of this reason, government-led investment is widely provided in many cities, in which local governments provide subsidies to or directly invest in the installation of EV charging facilities. However, this mode cannot be sustained in the long run. As the charging infrastructure market grows, many charging station operators (CSOs), who specialize in EV charging facility installation and operation, have emerged in recent years. These CSOs rent parking spaces from LOs to operate their charging business, which can potentially benefit LOs by attracting more EV drivers to patronize LOs. This parking-charging integration scheme (P&C scheme) builds a symbiotic relationship between LOs and CSOs. However, such schemes may have negative impacts on LOs. Allocating parking spaces to CSOs will increase the time general consumers without charging needs spend searching for parking, which will reduce the number of general consumers. If the newly attracted EV drivers only charge but do not consume in the LO, the LO might not be better off by participating in this scheme. To analyze the economic viability of the P&C scheme and the resulting impact on consumers, we develop a sequential-move game model, taking into account the responses of general consumers and EV drivers. We analytically prove the existence and uniqueness of the market equilibrium and derive the feasibility conditions for this scheme. Interestingly, we find that when the proportion of charging drivers who choose to patronize the LO is high, the LO is willing to reward the CSO for operating the charging service. A realistic P&C example is also presented to demonstrate our analytical insights.",0191-2615,Not found

We consider self-interested traffic agents (i.e. human-driven and automated vehicles) endowed with different speed functions and interacting with each other simultaneously in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions. We propose a two-player game model to encapsulate their interactions and characterize the equilibria the agents may reach. We show that the model admits two types of Nash equilibria, one of which is always Pareto efficient. Based on this equilibrium structure, we propose a speed policy that guarantees the realized equilibria are Pareto efficient in all traffic regimes. We present two examples to illustrate the applications of this model. In one example, we construct flux functions for mixed autonomy traffic based on behavior characteristics of agents. In the other example, we consider a lane policy and show that mixed autonomy traffic may exhibit counterintuitive behaviors even though all the agents are rational.",0191-2615,Not found

We propose a model to describe and analyze the market equilibrium under the exclusion policy and present our analytical and numerical results – some of which are non-intuitive and intriguing. Considering network effects captured by both quality and quantity of service in the market, we find that both the realized supply and total labor welfare are not reduced but rather increase when the platform implements a well-designed exclusion policy. Whereas the platform’s profit, customer surplus, labor welfare, and social welfare are each non-monotonic in the QTA level – first increasing and then decreasing – a moderate level of QTA can benefit all stakeholders (platform, drivers, and passengers) in the market. We also analyze the model with alternative network effects and present the theoretical and numerical results.

We investigate a series of theoretical and numeric models, both deterministic and stochastic, that describe parking dynamics in an area as dependent on these parameters, over the entire spectrum of the demand-to-supply ratio, focusing on the case when the demand is close to or above the supply. We demonstrate that a simple deterministic model provides a good analytical approximation for the major characteristics of a parking system – the average fraction of cars among the arrivals that will find parking in the area, the average number of cars that cruise for parking, and the average cruising time. Stochastic models make it possible to estimate the distributions of these characteristics as well as the parameters defined by the distribution PDF, like the fraction of the arriving cars that find parking in less than t minutes. The results are robust to the distribution of drivers’ dwell and renege times and can be directly applied to assess the real-world parking dynamics.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimization of multi-type sensor locations for simultaneous estimation of origin-destination demands and link travel times with covariance effects,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.006,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper investigates the multi-type traffic sensor location problem for simultaneous estimation of origin-destination (OD) demands and link travel times while also considering the two sources of spatial covariance effects on a road network with uncertainties. The first source is the statistical correlation of the vehicular traffic demands for different OD pairs in a typical hourly period (e.g., morning peak hour) on a daily scale, as the travel demand patterns vary daily, weekly, and seasonally over the year. The second source is the stochastic nature of the link travel times on different road links during the peak hour period and their correlation with adjacent links in congested conditions. By considering these aspects, a novel model is formulated to optimize the number and locations of multi-type traffic sensors for simultaneous estimation of stochastic OD demands and link travel times during the same peak-hour period over a year. This estimation is supported by the data recorded by multi-type traffic sensors such as point sensors and automatic vehicle identification sensors, which yield the link speed/flow and path travel time information, respectively. Based on the integrated observations from multi-type traffic sensors, a novel Kullback–Leibler divergence-based model is developed to accommodate different probability distributions of OD demands and link travel times in different traffic conditions. Moreover, an improved firefly algorithm is developed to solve the multi-type sensor location problem. Specifically, the search strategy of this algorithm is enhanced by considering the mean and covariance of the OD demands and link travel times. Numerical examples of synthetic and real-world road networks are used to illustrate the applications and merits of the developed multi-type sensor location model for simultaneously estimating the OD demands and link travel times while also considering covariance effects.",0191-2615,Not found
"Trade-off between safety, mobility and stability in automated vehicle following control: An analytical method",10.1016/j.trb.2022.09.003,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"A recent empirical study (Shi and Li, 2021) showed that commercial automated vehicles (AVs) became more unstable as the headway was set to a smaller value, implying possible intrinsic tradeoffs between safety, mobility, and stability aspects in AV following control design. This study aims to analytically explain the underlying vehicle control mechanism that dictates these tradeoffs. To this end, a robust optimization model is formulated based upon a parsimonious linear AV following model to capture the first-order tradeoffs between safety, mobility, and stability. The robust optimization model aims to maintain a sufficient safety buffer to avoid collisions against all possible realistic preceding vehicle trajectories. As opposed to a numerical solution, we managed to solve this model to an analytical solution that captures relationships between the key parameters determining safety, mobility, and stability. The analytical solution reveals that improving AV mobility (or reducing AV following headway) would require overcoming more safety challenges (e.g., enhancing vehicle control to maintain a short safety buffer) while causing more string-instability. The theoretical findings are consistent with the empirical observations in previous studies. Further, they provide a possible explanation for the observed string instability of commercial AV following control (e.g., adaptive cruise control) as a tradeoff for a smaller headway.

A mean-CVaR approach to the risk-averse single allocation hub location problem with flow-dependent economies of scale,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.008,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The hub location problem (HLP) is a fundamental facility planning problem with various applications in transportation, logistics, and telecommunication systems. Due to strategic nature of the HLP, considering uncertainty and the associated risks is of high practical importance in designing hub networks. This paper addresses a risk-averse single allocation HLP, where the traffic volume between the origin–destination (OD) pairs is considered to be uncertain. The uncertainty in demands is captured by a finite set of scenarios, and a flow-dependent economies of scale scheme is used for transportation costs, modeled as a piece-wise concave function of flow on all network arcs. The problem is cast as a risk-averse two-stage stochastic problem using mean-CVaR as the risk measure, and a novel solution approach combining Benders decomposition and scenario grouping is proposed. An extensive set of computational experiments is conducted to study the effect of different input parameters on the optimal solution, and to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution algorithm.

Booking cum rationing strategy for equitable travel demand management in road networks,10.1016/j.trb.2022.12.004,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Trip booking and traffic rationing have been proposed as two alternative travel demand management (TDM) strategies over the last two decades. Through artificially restricting demand (vehicle travel) by booking or rationing the scarce road capacity during the peak periods, the negative externalities generated by travel demand over available supply or road capacity can be reduced. In many cases, the two strategies also have the main goal of reduction of air pollution. Trip booking system allows vehicles/drivers to reserve prescribed areas or some lanes/segments of freeways/roads for their use during specific time periods, thereby maintaining a certain level of service of the roadway space. It is often in the form of a permit to control the number of reservations issued. On the other hand, traffic rationing is often achieved in reality through restricting access into an urban cordoned-off area or city center based on the last digits of the license number on pre-established days and during certain periods, usually the peak hours. However, theoretical studies and practical implementation of the two strategies have been conducted separately. Taking their advantages, this paper proposes and demonstrates a novel hybrid strategy of booking cum rationing for efficient and equitable TDM. We show that the problem of interest can be simply formulated as a convenient linear programming problem in a general network. Simple examples are provided to elucidate how this hybrid strategy can achieve a traffic flow distribution pattern prescribed by the traffic planner while maintaining the fairness, efficiency, and flexibility of individual choices.",0191-2615,Not found
Measurement and mitigation of the “wild goose chase” phenomenon in taxi services,10.1016/j.trb.2022.10.015,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This paper examines the so-called wild goose chase phenomenon in taxi systems and proposes a new mitigation strategy based on dynamic vehicle swaps. An analytic queuing network model, including a system of differential equations, is derived to yield approximate formulas for the expected system performance in the steady-state equilibria under the vehicle swap strategy. This model is solved numerically to yield equilibrium points and the expected system performance metrics. To corroborate the theoretical predictions, a new data-processing method based on dynamic programming is proposed to identify and measure multiple distinct equilibrium states from observed data. Agent-based simulations are conducted to generate examples of such data, and to verify the formulas. Numerical results show that (i) the proposed measurement method works well in identifying the distinct equilibria, and (ii) the vehicle swap strategy works quite effectively in mitigating the wild goose chase phenomenon.",0191-2615,Not found
A target-based optimization model for bike-sharing systems: From the perspective of service efficiency and equity,10.1016/j.trb.2022.12.002,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The emergence of bike-sharing systems has considerably improved last- and first-mile transportation systems. To ensure attractiveness to end users, operators aim to design effective service-oriented operational strategies to meet the desired service targets for users. Most existing studies focus on the service efficiency of bike-sharing systems, while service equity is overlooked. In this study, we propose a target-based stochastic distributionally robust optimization (TSDRO) model that addresses both the efficiency and equity of the service level in docked bike-sharing systems under demand uncertainty. We first employ a dissatisfaction risk measure to jointly quantify the probability and magnitude of user dissatisfaction in a zone. Then, we apply a lexicographic-order approach to define the objective function to achieve equity of service among different zones. This lexicographic approach optimizes the worst-off individual and the second-worst zone in an iterative manner. To address demand ambiguity, we use a data-driven method to explore the relationship between the demand distribution and several exogenous factors, including weather and weekends, and then construct a scenario-based distributionally robust optimization model. Based on duality theory and linear decision approximation, this model can be reformulated as a tractable equivalent deterministic model, which can be solved via a bisection-search approach to optimality. Numerical experiments based on real operational data show that compared with the benchmark models, the TSDRO model achieves (i) better out-of-sample performance in terms of service efficiency and (ii) higher service equity among users in different zones. Moreover, setting a lower target level may generate a better solution.",0191-2615,Not found
A branch-and-price heuristic algorithm for the bunkering operation problem of a liquefied natural gas bunkering station in the inland waterways,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.011,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering stations are areas for bunkering LNG-powered ships via a flexible hose from either a shoreside facility, shore-based/pontoon tank, or an LNG truck. The operation management of LNG bunkering stations is complex because many factors affect the operational performance, including station layout, bunkering technology, and frequent interactions among trucks, tanks, and ships. In this study, we consider the bunkering operation problem (BOP) of an LNG bunkering station in the inland waterways. The problem involves decisions of assigning ships to tanks, managing the inventory of the tanks, and scheduling LNG trucks for bunkering ships and replenishing tanks. We first formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that aims to minimize the cost incurred by the bunkering operations. As the BOP is NP-hard, the MILP model for the problem with practical size is generally difficult to solve. We thus reformulate it into an equivalent task-based model and develop a tailored branch-and-price heuristic (BPH) algorithm to solve the new model. Several enhancement techniques are also presented to improve the solution efficiency of the BPH algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the solution algorithm. Some managerial implications are also obtained to provide scientific guidance for station operators to make operational decisions.

Hierarchical control for stochastic network traffic with reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trb.2022.12.001,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This study proposes a hierarchical control framework to maximize the throughput of a road network driven by travel demand with uncertainties. In the upper level, a perimeter controller regulates the traffic influx into the core road network. The upper level uses a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns and responds to the traffic dynamics in the core road network without the need for an underlying system model and macroscopic fundamental diagram. The lower level is a local signal control system that regulates the spatial distribution of traffic flow within the core network. The results show that the hierarchical control framework can improve road network throughput by coordinating control actions conducted at the two levels.

Recursive decomposition probability model for demand estimation of street-hailing taxis utilizing GPS trajectory data,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.014,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The flexible and personalized street-hailing taxi service constitutes an indispensable component of urban mobility. However, most studies have focused only on the observed demand (pickup record) while ignoring the unmet demand. If based only on such analysis, the effectiveness of demand management policies and taxi searching strategies will be undermined. Motivated by this, we develop a recursive decomposition probability (RDP) model to efficiently estimate the demand (the summation of observed and unmet demands) of street-hailing taxis based on GPS trajectory data. In detail, we first partition the chronologically ordered passing records of taxis in individual road segments into several observations. Then, we utilize the proposed RDP model to derive the probability of each observation. Finally, the likelihood function is established, and the demand parameters for each road are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation. A simulation analysis is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed RDP model. It is shown that the demand estimated by the proposed model is much closer to the set demand than the observed demand under all testing scenarios. In addition, by comparing with benchmarks, the proposed RDP model needs no assumptions about the taxi arrival process and the numerical results show that it performs well. Finally, empirical studies are conducted with field data, the demand during the morning peak hour in 626 roads in Xi'an, China, is estimated by the proposed RDP model and the extended geographically weighted RDP model. The result indicates that the demand is obviously higher than the observed demand, emphasizing the importance of estimating demand in demand management.",0191-2615,Not found
Measurement and ranking of important link combinations in the analysis of transportation network vulnerability envelope buffers under multiple-link disruptions,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.013,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This study proposes an optimization-based approach to rank the importance of link combinations and analyze network vulnerability in extreme and near-extreme cases of disruption under the simultaneous disruption of multiple links. A vulnerability envelope concept is used, which considers the worst and best network performance under multiple-link disruptions. This study goes a step further than previous studies, which have focused on the extreme cases that form the boundary of a vulnerability envelope, to investigate the near-extreme cases inside an envelope and the network performance buffers (i.e., the differences in network performance) between different cases. A flexible framework based on combinatorial optimization modeling is used to determine the most important link combinations and the lower and upper bounds of network performance under their disruptions, which form the vulnerability envelope. A constraint-based method is developed to iteratively identify sub-important link combinations that lead to the formation of buffers of the lower and upper bounds of the vulnerability envelope. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the properties and applicability of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the consideration of near-extreme cases yields additional valuable information that is not generated by the traditional vulnerability analysis, which is focused on extreme cases. Ranking of the most and sub-most important link combinations enables the identification of non-unique worst/best cases, thereby revealing alternative link combinations to better inform decision-making. Consideration of the network performances in extreme and near-extreme cases affords a less conservative vulnerability assessment and reveals the potential cost of considering only extreme cases in decision-making processes.",0191-2615,Not found

However, predicting network-wide traffic speed propagation is non-trivial. This study develops a traffic flow dependency and dynamics based deep learning aided approach (TD2-DL), which predict network-wide high resolution traffic speed propagation by explicitly integrating temporal-spatial flow dependency, traffic flow dynamics with deep learning method techniques. Specifically, we first develop a graph theory-based method to identify the local temporal-spatial traffic dependency of each road among neighboring roads adaptive to the prediction horizon and traffic delay. Then, traffic speed propagation on every road is mathematically described by v-CTM based on traffic initial and boundary conditions. Next, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is employed to predict boundary conditions factoring the traffic temporal-spatial dependency and historical data predicted by v-CTM. In this way, we well couple the physical models (traffic dependency and v-CTM) with the deep learning approach, and further make them coevolution under this framework. Last, an EKF is used to assimilate predicted traffic speed predicted by v-CTM coupled with the LSTMs and the field traffic data; an FNN is introduced to impute missing and corrupted data for improving the traffic speed prediction accuracy. The numerical experiments indicated that the TD2-DL predicted the network-wide traffic speed propagation in 30 minutes with accuracy varying from 85%-98%.

The solution method allows for inclusion of route queuing delays and congestion patterns besides the traditional link flows and prior demand matrix whilst the tractability of the SCCTA model avoids the need for tedious tuning of application specific algorithmic parameters. The proposed solution method solves a series of simplified optimization problems, thereby avoiding costly additional assignment model runs. Link state constraints are used to prevent usage of approximations outside their valid range as well as to include observed congestion patterns. The proposed solution method is designed to be fast, scalable, robust, tractable and reliable because conditions under which a solution to the simplified optimization problem exist are known and because the problem is convex and has a smooth objective function. Four test case applications on the small Sioux Falls model are presented, each consisting of 100 runs with varied input for robustness. The applications demonstrate the added value of inclusion of observed congestion patterns and route queuing delays within the solution method.

Robust and resilient equilibrium routing mechanism for traffic congestion mitigation built upon correlated equilibrium and distributed optimization,10.1016/j.trb.2022.12.006,168,2023-02-01,2023,2,"With the rapid development of wireless communication, mobile computing, and GPS technologies, drivers’ route decisions nowadays rely more on navigation services, such as Google or Waze. However, these navigation services don't always come with improved traffic conditions. Individual drivers often make independent and selfish route decisions that are not systematically favorable and thus often result in severe congestions. This study aims to alleviate such problems by exploiting the information gaps between individuals and the central planner (CP). Specifically, we develop a correlated equilibrium routing mechanism (CeRM) for the CP, which drives a group of vehicles’ route choices to an equilibrium with a systematically optimal traffic condition while still satisfying individuals’ selfish nature. Participating drivers would only be better off by following the suggested routing guidance than navigating on their best responses to real-time traffic information. The CeRM is modeled as a nonconvex and nonlinear program involving a large-scale of users. A distributed Augmented Lagrangian algorithm (D-AL) is developed to efficiently solve the CeRM to provide online real-time navigation service, taking advantage of the on-board computation resources of individual vehicles. Considering the D-AL relies on the wireless communications between vehicles and the CP, we proved the convergence robustness of the D-AL against random communication failures and derived the convergence rate upper bound as a function of the communication failure probability. It is noticed that the convergence rate of the D-AL degrades dramatically as the communication failure probability increases, which hampers the applicability of implementing the CeRM in practice. To improve the solution algorithm's resilience in the computation performance, we further designed and proved an acceleration scheme aided D-AL (aD-AL) to expedite the convergence rate under the high likelihood of communication failures. Numerical experiments conducted on the Sioux Falls city network confirmed the D-AL's convergence properties, robustness against random communication failures, and the resilience of the aD-AL to solve the CeRM. The experiments also show that the CeRM results in better system performance (have less system cost) compared with the existing Independent Routing (IR) mechanism and user-oriented Equilibrium Routing (uoER) mechanism.",0191-2615,Not found
Biobjective route planning of an unmanned air vehicle in continuous space,10.1016/j.trb.2023.01.001,168,2023-02-01,2023,2,"We consider the route planning problem of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) in a continuous space that is monitored by radars. The UAV visits multiple targets and returns to the base. The routes are constructed considering the total distance traveled and the total radar detection threat objectives. The UAV is capable of moving to any point in the terrain. This leads to infinitely many efficient trajectories between target pairs and infinitely many efficient routes to visit all targets. We use a two stage approach in solving the complex problem of finding all efficient routes. In the first stage, we structure the nondominated frontiers of the efficient trajectories between all target pairs. For this, we first identify properties shared by efficient trajectories between target pairs that are protected by a radar. This helps to structure the nondominated frontier between any target pair by identifying at most four specific efficient trajectories. We develop a search-based algorithm that finds these efficient trajectories effectively. For the second stage, we develop a mixed integer nonlinear program that exploits the structured nondominated frontiers between target pairs to construct the efficient routes. We compare the nondominated front we generate in the continuous space with its counterpart in a terrain discretized with three different grid fidelities.

The continuous signalized (COS) node model for dynamic traffic assignment,10.1016/j.trb.2022.12.003,168,2023-02-01,2023,2,"In macroscopic dynamic network loading, the role of the node model is to determine transfer volumes between each in- and outgoing link, while respecting in a consistent way all forward and backward-moving traffic waves (or boundary conditions) and desired turning fractions. In addition, capacity constraints on the node itself need to be respected; they result from priority rules on conflict points, or from traffic signal control. The most common way in literature to implement signalized node models is to track second by second which turns have green or are blocked by red. This imposes a fine – and thus computationally demanding – time discretization step in the numerical solution algorithm of the entire dynamic network loading, often unnecessary or even undesired for the DNL application. As an alternative, this paper proposes a continuous approach that finds the average turn (or transfer) volume over a full cycle under the prevailing link boundary conditions and traffic signal timing. This average ‘continuous’ volume can then be applied to any (fine or coarse) time discretization. To this end, it discusses in depth and proposes mathematical formulations for all boundary and consistency requirements that a traffic signal imposes, and the intricate interactions between stage timing and arrival patterns of vehicles and outflow opportunities (gaps). This COntinuous Signalized or COS node model and its iterative solution algorithm combine all these boundaries and interactions in a theoretically consistent way. In a case study, we show that COS is the only existing, theoretically consistent continuous signalized node model, as alternative models sometimes fail to produce holding-free solutions, and/or violate boundary conditions imposed by the connecting links (especially in more complicated combinations of boundary conditions involving congestion spillback).",0191-2615,Not found

The airport gate assignment problem concerns the efficient utilization of gates by assigning flights to the gates according to the flights’ planned schedules. However, due to ever-increasing air traffic demands and unpredictable weather conditions, it is hard to expect that the flights strictly follow the planned schedules. Therefore, establishing a robust gate assignment plan against uncertain flight schedule deviations is crucial for airport operators. However, ensuring the robustness of the plan by imposing too long idle times of gates may deteriorate the efficiency of gate usage. To address the trade-off between two goals, we introduce an overlap chance-constrained airport gate assignment problem that limits the probability of an overlap occurrence of flight schedules for each gate to given thresholds while maximizing the sum of preference values of flights for gates. We propose a network-based integer programming model for this problem, estimating the probability distribution using the historical flight arrival/departure deviation data. Then, we strengthen the model using the concept of gate assignment patterns, and a branch-and-price algorithm is devised to solve the model. A labeling algorithm-based efficient column generation algorithm is developed, further accelerated by clustering gates with similar characteristics. Through computational experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and the trade-off between the overlap occurrence probability and the preference is analyzed using real-life instances.",0191-2615,Not found
Exact solution approaches for the minimum total cost traveling salesman problem with multiple drones,10.1016/j.trb.2022.12.007,168,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Deployment of drones in delivery operations has been attracting growing interest from the commercial sector due to its prospective advantages for a range of distribution systems. Motivated by the widespread adoption of drones in last-mile delivery, we introduce the minimum cost traveling salesman problem with multiple drones, where a truck and multiple drones work in synchronization to deliver parcels to customers. In this problem, we aim to find an optimal delivery plan for the truck and drones operating in tandem with the objective of minimizing the total operational cost including the vehicles’ operating and waiting costs. Unlike most studies in the literature where the objective is to minimize completion time, which means one needs to know only the arrival time of the latest arriving vehicle (truck or drone) at each synchronization point, we need to keep track of all the individual waiting times of the truck and the drones to properly account for waiting costs, which makes it more challenging to handle the synchronization.

To compare our formulations/algorithms and to demonstrate their competitiveness, we conduct computational experiments on a range of instances.

An exact algorithm for the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with drones,10.1016/j.trb.2023.01.002,168,2023-02-01,2023,2,"This paper studies a new variant of the vehicle routing problem with drones, i.e., the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with drones, where multiple vehicles and drones work collaboratively to serve customers. Drones can perform multiple back-and-forth trips when their paired vehicle stops at a customer node, forming a two-echelon network. Several practical constraints such as customers’ delivery deadlines and drones’ energy capacity are considered. Different from existing studies, we treat the number of drones taken by each vehicle as a decision variable instead of a given parameter, which provides more flexibility for planning vehicle and drone routes. We first formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model, which is solvable by off-the-shelf commercial solvers. To tackle instances more efficiently, we next construct a set-partitioning model. To solve it, an exact branch-and-price algorithm is proposed, where a bidirectional labeling algorithm is used to solve the pricing problem. To speed up the algorithm, a tabu search algorithm is first applied before the exact labeling algorithm for finding desired columns in each iteration of the column generation process. Extensive numerical tests show that our algorithm can solve most instances within 25 customers to optimality in a short time frame and some instances of 35 customers to optimality within a three-hour time limit. Results also demonstrate that the allocation decisions of drones can help save the duration of all routes by 3.44% on average for 25-customer instances, compared to the case of fixing the number of paired drones on each vehicle.

To improve the service quality, this paper discusses systematically investigating a joint optimization of the robust passenger flow control strategy and train timetable on a congested metro line.

Then, the uncertain passenger demand is further considered at each station, and three integer linear programming models are formulated to derive the robust passenger flow control strategies. The first two models are related to the technique of Light Robustness, in which the uncertainty is handled by inserting expected protection levels at stations or on trains. In addition, with a stochastic scenario set that characterizes the uncertain passenger information, the last model aims to find a solution that is feasible for all involved scenarios, and thus, reduces the impact of the uncertainty in metro systems. To improve the computational efficiency of large-scale instances, a customized decomposition-based algorithm is developed.

The associated improvements are twofold: matrix inversion and matrix multiplication. A tailored preconditioner is developed to reduce the matrix inversion errors. To address multiplication errors, a tailored dot product algorithm in conjunction with a GP reformulation scheme is proposed. To validate the proposed models and methods, a link-based second-best congestion pricing problem is considered as an example.

General solution scheme for the static link transmission model,10.1016/j.trb.2022.11.012,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Most static traffic assignment models, both in the literature and in practice, are neither capacity constrained nor storage constrained. They allow flows to exceed the link capacity and/or queues to exceed the link length. Recent studies in this area have resulted in novel approaches that do consider capacity constraints, resulting in residual queues, and sometimes even storage constraints, resulting in possible queue spillback. We build upon the results of these works and in particular on the model formulated in Bliemer and Raadsen (2020) that introduced a static network loading model formulation that is both capacity constrained as well as storage constrained. Their static network loading model formulation is derived from – and consistent with - the link transmission model, a well-established dynamic network loading model. It is referred to as the static link transmission model (sLTM) in this paper. This model considers a general concave fundamental diagram for each link and a general first order node model. It is well known that ignoring queue spillback can result in significant underestimation of path travel times. This is especially true for paths that do not traverse any of the bottleneck(s) directly, but that are affected by space occupied by queues that are spilling back. The prospect of being able to capture queuing and spillback effects in static assignment provides new opportunities for improving the modelling capabilities of this paradigm. In this paper, we propose a solution scheme to sLTM capable of finding a solution on large scale networks. This is the first time that an algorithm is proposed for solving an analytical static model with queue spillback. The inclusion of a node model in a static context - while enhancing the model's capabilities – generally results in the absence of a guaranteed convergent algorithm, and introducing spillback exacerbates the issue. Given the challenges of finding a stable solution, we discuss a base solution scheme and three (configurable) extensions. Further, we investigate algorithmic settings with respect to convergence and its impact on computational cost. A large-scale case study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed scheme by finding solutions under the most challenging of conditions in a real-world setting. We show that improving convergence capabilities negatively affects computational efficiency. To this end, several potential improvements based on our findings are discussed. Lastly, we discuss the potential of this line of research in more general terms, highlighting strengths and weaknesses following our experiences.",0191-2615,Not found
Robust path recommendations during public transit disruptions under demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.004,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"When there are significant service disruptions in public transit systems, passengers usually need guidance to find alternative paths. This paper proposes a path recommendation model to mitigate congestion during public transit disruptions. Passengers with different origins, destinations, and departure times are recommended with different paths such that the system travel time is minimized. We model the path recommendation problem as an optimal flow problem with uncertain demand information. To tackle the lack of analytical formulation of travel times due to capacity constraints, we propose a simulation-based first-order approximation to transform the original problem into a linear program. Uncertainties in demand are modeled using robust optimization to protect the path recommendation strategies against inaccurate estimates. A real-world rail disruption scenario in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system is used as a case study. Results show that even without considering uncertainty, the nominal model can reduce the system travel time by 9.1% (compared to the status quo), and outperforms the benchmark capacity-based path recommendation. The average travel time of passengers in the incident line (i.e., passengers receiving recommendations) is reduced more (−20.6% compared to the status quo). After incorporating the demand uncertainty, the robust model can further reduce system travel times. The best robust model can decrease the average travel time of incident-line passengers by 2.91% compared to the nominal model. The improvement of robust models is more prominent when the actual demand pattern is close to the worst-case demand.",0191-2615,Not found
On the utilization of dedicated bus lanes for pooled ride-hailing services,10.1016/j.trb.2023.01.005,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Ride-sourcing platforms, among other solution services, offer convenience and flexibility when it comes to pick-up/drop-off time and location. Similarly, ride-splitting renders itself as an extension of ride-sourcing where platform users agree to share their rides in return for a reduced fare yet possibly a longer travel time. Despite the numerous advantages that sharing introduced to the platform operator by reducing the fleet size necessary to serve demand levels, e-hailing is still overall negatively impacting traffic performance in urban spaces. This is partially due to the current tendency of users to favor solo over shared rides. This paper aims to use aggregate traffic flow models to put forward a network space redistribution policy that has the potential to reduce total delays of the different mode users in the network. Accordingly, we investigate the solo-pool demand split that minimizes the total Passenger Hours Traveled for all network commuters in the event where shared rides are allowed to use underutilized bus lanes. As a result, the choice to share is associated with an inevitable additional detour distance but with a lower-than-expected trip time compared to standard scenarios where the whole fleet utilizes the same network space. In this paper, we present an analytical macroscopic modeling approach to evaluate equilibrium solutions between network supply and multi-modal demand. By resorting to a numerical example of the model, we show that the optimal strategy that minimizes delays for multi-modal transport users occurs when only a fraction of the pooling vehicles uses the dedicated bus lanes. This fraction is dependent on the distribution of space and the value of demand for private vehicles, buses, and ride-hailing services.",0191-2615,Not found
Freight-on-Transit for urban last-mile deliveries: A strategic planning approach,10.1016/j.trb.2023.01.004,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"We study a delivery strategy for last-mile deliveries in urban areas which combines freight transportation with mass mobility systems with the goal of creating synergies contrasting negative externalities caused by transportation. The idea is to use the residual capacity on public transport means for moving freight within the city. In particular, the system is such that parcels are first transported from origins (central distribution centers) to drop-in stations, which are stop locations on public vehicle itineraries. Then, they are transported on public vehicles to drop-out stations, from where they are delivered to destination by green vehicles (such as bikes, drones, porters, etc.). The system is known as Freight-On-Transit (FOT). In this paper, we focus on the strategic decisions related to defining the public transportation network that will take part in the delivery system, i.e., which public vehicle lines and stop locations will be included (and thus equipped for the service). We propose different formulations for the problem and effective heuristic solution approaches based on column generation. We perform exhaustive tests aimed at providing managerial insights on the performance and the efficiency of the system.",0191-2615,Not found
Discrete choice models with multiplicative stochasticity in choice environment variables: Application to accommodating perception errors in driver behaviour models,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.014,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This paper presents a mixed multinomial logit-based discrete choice modelling framework to accommodate decision-makers’ errors in perceiving choice environment variables that do not vary across choice alternatives. An analysis is undertaken to evaluate two different ways of specifying errors in the choice environment variables in discrete choice models – (a) the additive specification and (b) the multiplicative specification. Between these two approaches, the multiplicative error specification is consistent with psychophysical theories of human perception of physical quantities in that the variability in perception tends to be greater for quantities of greater magnitude. Further, it is shown that models with an additive error specification run into parameter (un)identifiability problems if the analyst attempts to accommodate errors in several variables. In contrast, models with multiplicative errors in variables allow separate identification of stochasticity in as many variables as needed, as long as those variables have a significant influence on the choice outcome. The usefulness of the proposed framework with multiplicative errors is demonstrated through simulation experiments and an empirical application for analysing driver behaviour while considering drivers’ errors in perceiving traffic environment variables. The empirical analysis is carried out using space-time trajectories of vehicles from a heterogeneous, disorderly (HD) traffic stream in Chennai, India. Results suggest that the proposed model, with power lognormal distributed multiplicative errors in traffic environment variables, outperformed the typically used mixed logit models with random coefficients (uncorrelated and correlated) or error components. Further, allowing for perception errors in traffic environment variables was found to be more important than allowing unobserved heterogeneity in the drivers’ sensitivity to those variables. In addition, the empirical model offers interesting insights into the extent of variability due to perception errors in different traffic environment variables.",0191-2615,Not found
Real-time cruising speed design approach for multiline bus systems,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.003,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"In this paper, we focus on controlling multiline buses operated in networks with curbside bus stops. In such networks, both bus bunching and bus queueing, which often result in passenger inconvenience as well as bus waiting delays, are frequently observed during bus operations. To address the adverse influences of these two phenomena, we propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) model to provide guidance on real-time bus cruising speeds based on the real-time state of the whole system. The proposed model can avoid bus bunching by coordinating bus cruising speeds and alleviate bus queueing congestion by restricting the number of bus arrivals at each stop. Specifically, to address bus bunching, the model has a quadratic objective function that minimizes the total expected passenger waiting time; while for bus queueing, the model has big-M and time-indexed constraints that restrict the number of bus arrivals in each time interval of length g based on the waiting capacity Q s of each stop s . Simulation experiments are conducted with different sizes of virtual networks, and the corresponding results show that the proposed model can lead to both a shorter average passenger waiting time and less bus congestion at stops. The improvement with respect to bus waiting delay is more significant: the percentage decrease can reach 46.9%. Moreover, the results of the average computing time show that the control model can be solved before a bus finishes service in most cases, which means decisions can be fed back to drivers in a timely manner; therefore, the proposed model can meet the requirements of real-time control. A sensitivity analysis with respect to parameters Q s and g is also performed. These two parameters are shown to only affect control performance with respect to bus waiting delays at stops, and shorter bus waiting delays can be achieved with relatively small Q s and large g . Further experiments are conducted within a real network, and the experimental results show that our method is suitable for implementation in practice.",0191-2615,Not found
Vehicle repositioning for a ride-sourcing network system providing differentiated services,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.002,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The increasing trend on adopting ride-sourcing services has brought obvious benefits to short-haul transportation systems. In this paper, we investigate a dynamic ride-sourcing system, where, in each period, a constant number of vehicles (fixed system capacity) is used to satisfy random customer demands or is reallocated within an under-investigation network. To save resources, our objective is to deploy the smallest number of vehicles to satisfy the network system with differentiated service levels. Unlike the common approaches that achieve an equilibrium solution to match supply and demand by implementing a proper pricing and waging policies, based on the fixed vehicle capacity, we need to explicitly confront the region-to-region imbalance in the system by using appropriate reallocation strategies. We first formulate a framework for this type of ride-sourcing system and investigate the lower and upper bounds for the optimal vehicle capacity. Then, we discuss the conditions of obtaining the lower bound and the optimality of the upper bound. Based on the proposed model, we further design some heuristics to appropriately reallocate the vehicles. In particular, we introduce a benchmark heuristic that robustly performs between the lower and upper bounds. A variety of experiments are conducted to validate this benchmark for a wide choice of potential settings. Finally, besides satisfying the differentiated service levels, we generalize the model by incorporating the operation costs of maintaining the vehicle fleet, route dependent costs, and unequal travel times to adapt some common real-world situations.",0191-2615,Not found
Cooperative train control during the power supply shortage in metro system: A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.015,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"In metro system, the fault of traction power supply system may cause the power supply shortage around the failure substation. In this case, the dispatching measure should be immediately taken to reduce the impacts of disruption on the train operation. To deal with this real-time traffic management problem, a cooperative control approach is proposed in this paper. In this approach, the time to apply tractive force and the level of force are simultaneously adjusted for all the operated trains, to maximize the maintained line capacity when considering the power supply capacity. Compared with the existing train timetable rescheduling approach, cooperative control is more flexible to get a better train regulation solution. To solve the challenges for developing the cooperative control model (i.e., undetermined number and dynamically changing of controlled objects), an imaginary section method is newly developed to transform the original problem into an equivalent cooperative control problem with fixed controlled objects. Then, the mathematical models for the transformed problem are constructed by using the space–time–speed network methodology. According to the formulated model, a Decentralized-Markov Decision Process (Dec-MDP) framework is designed as the basis of the applied algorithm. Next, a Collaboration Mechanism Based-Independent Deep Q-Network (CMB-IDQN) algorithm is proposed to solve the cooperative control problem. Compared with classical IDQN algorithm, a credit assignment method based on the collaboration mechanism among trains is novelly considered in the designed multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative control approach is verified by two case studies. When solving the cooperative control problem, the performance by using CMB-IDQN algorithm can be increased by up to 13.0% and 16.8% compared with other two classical reinforcement learning algorithms (i.e., DQN and IDQN), respectively. Compared with two train timetable rescheduling measures during the power supply shortage, the cooperative control approach can improve the solution quality by more than 180.4% and 17.4%, respectively.",0191-2615,Not found
An Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic for last-mile deliveries under stochastic customer availability and multiple visits,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.016,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Attended Home Delivery, where customer attendance at home is required, is an essential last-mile delivery challenge, e.g., for valuable, perishable, or oversized items. Logistics service providers are often faced no-show customers. In this paper, we consider the delivery problem in which customers can be revisited on the same day by a courier in the case of a failed first delivery attempt. Specifically, customer presence uncertainty is considered in a two-stage stochastic program, where penalties are introduced as recourse actions for failed deliveries. We build on the notion of a customer availability profile defined as a profile containing historical time-varying probability information of successful deliveries. We tackle this stochastic program by developing an efficient parallelized Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm. Our results show that by achieving a right balance between increasing the hit rate and reducing travel cost, logistics service providers can realize costs savings as high as 32% if they plan for second visits on the same day.",0191-2615,Not found
Incentive-compatible mechanisms for online resource allocation in Mobility-as-a-Service systems,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.011,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"In the context of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), the transportation sector has been evolving towards user-centric business models, which put the user experience and tailored mobility solutions at the center of the offer. The emerging concept of MaaS emphasizes that users value experience-relevant factors, e.g., service time, inconvenience cost, and travel delay, over segmented travel modes choices. This study proposes an auction-based mechanism and tractable optimization models for the demand-side management of MaaS systems wherein users’ trip requests are represented as mode-agnostic mobility resources. Users’ requests arrive dynamically in the MaaS system and users compete for mobility resources by bidding for mobility services based on their willingness to pay and experience-relevant preferences. We take the perspective of a MaaS platform regulator who aims to maximize social welfare by optimally allocating mobility resources to users in real-time. The MaaS regulator first decides whether to offer each user a MaaS bundle and identifies the optimal allocation of mobility resources for the selected users. Users have the possibility to accept or reject offered MaaS bundles by comparing the associated utility obtained from MaaS with a reserve utility obtained from other travel options. We introduce mixed-integer programming formulations for this online mobility resource allocation problem. We show that the proposed MaaS mechanism is incentive-compatible, individually rational, budget balanced, and computationally efficient. We propose a polynomial-time online algorithm and derive its competitive ratio relative to an offline algorithm. We also explore rolling horizon configurations with varying look-ahead policies to implement the proposed mechanism.

Time-varying service regions in same-day delivery,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.005,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"We study the design of same-day delivery (SDD) systems under the assumption that service regions are allowed to vary over the course of the day; equivalently, that customers in different locations may have access to SDD for different lengths of time over the service day or may have no access at all. This contrasts with the bulk of the literature, in which a service region is defined in advance and all customers in the service region can place SDD orders during the same time window. Leveraging continuous approximation techniques to capture average-case system behavior, we derive optimal service region areas and corresponding SDD order cutoff times to maximize the expected number of orders served per day. We quantify the benefit of allowing the service regions to vary, both theoretically and empirically, and discuss related equity issues in SDD systems.

The connection between the SDUE model and existing UE models is analyzed. It is theoretically proved that equilibrium solutions from previous UE models can all be included in the SDUE solution set by letting VOTs vary among users and across scenarios. Moreover, a reduced SDUE model is formulated to help calculate possible SDUE flow patterns mathematically. Numerical examples are given to illustrate that the proposed SDUE model could include the non-convex solution set and various route choice behavior by adjusting the adaptive VOT-related parameters, which is beyond the existing UE models.

For simplicity, this study considers many-to-one trip demand in a monocentric linear city. Our theoretical investigations confirm that in the short term when the service level of public transit is fixed, automobile users shift to public transit due to road congestion in the city center brought on by e-hailing services. For non-auto users, there exists an optimal connecting point where users transfer from feeder e-hailing services to public transit. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in the long term when public transit provider changes the service frequency according to the ridership, (1) the optimal connecting point remains at the same location, and (2) all public transit users in the suburb side of the optimal connecting point shifts to feeder e-hailing services. Our numerical investigations further reveal that the impact of e-hailing services on regional public transit depends on the regional dependency on automobiles. Shortly after introducing e-hailing services, the costs of users would significantly increase in a transit-dependent region, while the revenue of public transit significantly decreases in an automobile-dependent region. In the long term, the total cost for users is higher in all scenario settings compared to the base scenario without e-hailing services, which is analogous to the well-known Downs–Thomson paradox. Based on the above results, we discuss possible integrated regional transportation designs to realize desirable long-term outcomes.",0191-2615,Not found
On the effects of airport capacity expansion under responsive airlines and elastic passenger demand,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.010,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This paper investigates the effect of airport expansion on air traffic and its implications on airport congestion, airline competition and the social welfare, considering various airport administrative regimes (i.e., profit-maximization, social welfare-maximization, and budget-constrained social welfare-maximization), airline market structures (i.e., perfectly competitive, oligopoly, monopoly, leader–follower), and passenger demand patterns (i.e., regard airlines as perfect substitutes or imperfect substitutes). We develop an analytical tri-level model to examine the air traffic equilibrium in the airport–airline–passenger system, the effect of airport capacity expansion on the traffic equilibrium, and the decisions of different stakeholders. Specifically, we examine the airport’s decisions on capacity investment and airport charge in the first level, airlines’ decisions on flight volume and airfare in the second level, and the passenger choice equilibrium in the third level. The analysis in this paper suggests that (i) airport capacity expansion may induce the airline market to over schedule flights which leads to a more congested airport (i.e., capacity paradox); (ii) with a given airport charge, the capacity paradox is more likely to occur in an airline market with fewer competitive airlines; (iii) given the same airport capacity and traffic, the capacity paradox is more likely to occur when the airport operator’s objective is social welfare-maximization (compared with profit-maximization and budget-constrained social welfare-maximization); (iv) airlines with market power will internalize a portion of airport congestion based on their market share, while a leader airline with the knowledge of the follower’s response will scale up or down their airfare in order to maximize its profit; (v) under different market structures, increasing airport charge always reduces the aggregate traffic volume when the airport capacity is fixed.",0191-2615,Not found

A branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with load-dependent drones,10.1016/j.trb.2023.03.003,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"In this paper, we consider the vehicle routing problem with load-dependent drones (VRPLD), in which the energy consumption of drones is load-dependent and represented by a nonlinear function. To strengthen the collaboration between trucks and drones, a kind of facility called the docking hub is introduced to extend the service coverage of drones. When a truck visits the hub, a part number of parcels are transferred to the drones departing from the hub to serve the designated customers. We propose a mixed-integer model for the problem, which is nonlinear due to the load-dependent energy consumption. To solve the model, we develop a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm based on the Danzig–Wolfe decomposition framework, and propose a series of acceleration strategies, including two valid inequalities, to expedite the convergence of the exact algorithm. Computational results on a set of randomly generated instances reflect that the proposed algorithm outperforms Gurobi in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Compared with VRPLD, the vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) which ignores the load-dependent constraints underestimates the total travel cost by 6.83%. Another drawback of VRPD is that some results may become infeasible when considering the load-dependent energy consumption. The results under VRPLD further reveal that a more accurate description of the energy consumption makes the drones rely more on services from auxiliary facilities. We also conduct sensitivity analysis to draw some managerial insights that setting the hub at a reasonable location can significantly reduce the delivery cost and improve truck and drone cooperation efficiency.",0191-2615,Not found

The advancement of smart mobile and communication technology in recent years has stimulated the development of a new business model of city logistics, referred to as crowdsourced delivery or crowd-shipping. In this paper, we investigate a form of crowdsourced last-mile delivery that utilizes the journeys of commuters/travelers (crowd-couriers) to deliver parcels from intermediate stations to customers. We consider a logistics service provider that jointly optimizes parcel allocation to intermediate stations and the delivery routing of the crowd-couriers. The joint optimization model gives rise to a new variant of the last-mile delivery problem.

Submodularity of optimal sensor placement for traffic networks,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.008,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The need for monitoring the state of a traffic network versus the costly installation and maintenance of roadside sensors constitutes the tough sensor placement problem in designing transportation networks. Placement problems naturally lie in the category of subset selection problems, which are known to be inherently combinatorial, and therefore, finding their exact solution is intractable for large problems. Due to this intractability, numerous heuristics have been proposed in the literature for approximately solving placement problems for traffic networks. Among these approaches, it has been observed that greedy algorithms normally outperform other heuristics. In this paper, we show the mathematics of why greedy algorithms are appropriate proxies for solving these subset selection problems; similar to placement problems for linear systems, placement problems for traffic networks also normally have a submodular structure. In this work, we analyze the problem of road sensor placement for transportation networks under different information structures available: when no vehicle routing information is available, when vehicles’ routings are known, and when it is necessary to maximize the number of origin–destination (O/D) traffic flows that are monitored with a set of sensors. We show that in all these cases, the placement problem has a submodular monotone structure. It is well known that the submodularity and monotonicity of discrete optimization problems can be leveraged to derive greedy algorithms that approximate the optimal solution. Consequently, our result is of great practical importance since by exploiting the submodularity and monotonicity of a problem, we show that it is possible to use polynomial-time greedy algorithms to approximate the combinatorial optimization problem with guaranteed optimality bounds for large problems, which are intractable to solve otherwise. Our results shed light upon the success of heuristic greedy algorithms that have been developed in some of the literature for solving placement problems at scale. To demonstrate the applicability of submodular optimization for solving placement problems, we first compare the performance of our polynomial-time approximation algorithm with the true optimum in an example traffic network which is small enough for finding the exact optimal solution with enumerating all possible subsets. Then, we investigate and validate our submodular approach in a case study involving a large-scale traffic network in Berkeley, California, where finding the exact optimal solution is intractable. Submodularity of the placement problem in these scenarios provides a powerful computational tool which can be further extended to other placement problem formulations that can become a reference for solving similar problems in the transportation literature.",0191-2615,Not found

The emerging of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies inspires innovative ideas in traffic management at intersections; it not only enables new control paradigms, but also allows for possibilities to revolutionize the geometric layouts of intersections. This study proposes a novel intersection design called knotted intersection (KI), to resolve the complexity of conflicting relations at intersections in a full CAV environment. This new design is associated with a set of neat control rules for vehicles to realize the smooth traffic operation at these intersections. The design problem of intersection geometry and control strategy is optimized jointly and formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and some basic theoretical properties of KI design are derived, including nearly throughput-maximizing property and bounded within-intersection delay of vehicles. Furthermore, the KI design is then extended to a road network composed of multiple intersections to improve the overall efficiency. The optimal design of multiple knotted intersections (MKI) is developed to coordinate the traffic organization methods among intersections and a two-level solution method is proposed to solve the optimization efficiently.

Based on optimal solutions of the MPBAP for various port groups, cooperative game theory is utilized to obtain stable port groups, and then the PCSP can be formulated as a binary programming model for determining optimal port groups.

We present multiple speed-up techniques and with an extensive computational study illustrate that the consolidation-based formulation is much easier to solve with an off-the-shelf solver than the classical formulation based on a time-expanded network. To avoid instances involving large numbers of consolidations we propose a hybrid formulation that combines ideas from the consolidation and time-expanded network-based approaches to formulating the SSNDP. We show that instances of the hybrid formulation are much easier to solve than both instances of the pure consolidation-based formulation and those based on a time-expanded network formulation. Finally, we discuss how formulating with consolidations facilitates modeling issues that have not yet been addressed in the literature, such as bin-packing considerations when computing vehicle capacity needs.

Furthermore, properties of these contracts are discussed and compared with the revenue-compensated BOT contracts under symmetric cost information.",0191-2615,Not found
Simple abstract models to study stability of urban networks with decentralized signal control,10.1016/j.trb.2023.03.013,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Traffic Signal Controllers (TSCs) used to manage intersections can influence the residual queues at intersections. These residual queues can lead to an irreversible state of network gridlock. This paper discovers the advantages of locally adaptive TSCs utilizing traffic information on both upstream and downstream approaches of an intersection (e.g., back-pressure or BP control) over employing only upstream approaches information (e.g., proportional control) in avoiding gridlock. Although BP algorithms are mathematically proven to be throughput optimal as they bound network queues for all feasible demands, the proofs exist only for networks with infinite link capacities, fixed-route choices, or for TSCs with no minimum green-time requirement. We propose a simple asymmetric two-bin model to study the influence of the BP control on network behavior (e.g., gridlock probability, average time to gridlock and maximum throughput) and compare it with the other control policy. Theoretical insights from the asymmetric two-bin model are verified using microsimulation results of the asymmetric two-ring model. Both analytical and simulation results imply that BP-based TSCs have an increased capability of delaying or avoiding gridlock in heavy traffic with a larger time step at the cost of potentially lower throughput in undersaturated networks. The paper provides a framework to evaluate control policies in inhomogeneous networks and shows the superiority of BP-based TSCs against gridlock in grid networks with finite capacities of links.",0191-2615,Not found
Rational inattention in discrete choice models: Estimable specifications of RI-multinomial logit (RI-MNL) and RI-nested logit (RI-NL) models,10.1016/j.trb.2023.03.010,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"As opposed to the fully informed choice-making assumption in classical discrete choice models, the theory of Rational Inattention (RI) 1 1 RI is used interchangeably for ‘Rational Inattention’ or ‘Rationally Inattentive’ throughout the paper in discrete choice modelling has been recently proposed in the literature. Matějka and McKay (2015) proposed the RI-multinomial logit (RI-MNL), and Fosgerau et al. (2020) proposed the RI-nested logit (RI-NL) model. These models consider that choice makers are bayesian agents with prior probabilities of choices and process any further information assuming an information processing cost to have the updated/posterior choice probabilities. However, the proposed RI-MNL and RI-NL models are theoretical formulations without any estimable empirical specifications. This paper proposes econometric formulations of RI-MNL and RI-NL models that are estimable using classical maximum likelihood estimation methods and suitable for revealed crossectional choice data. The proposed models are estimated for commuting mode choices in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) using data from a household travel survey conducted in the region. Empirical investigation reveals that the induction of RI in the classical discrete choice models (MNL and NL) improves the model fit by large margins. While scale parameterization in classical MNL and NL does not make a better model, the scale parameterization better captures the choice heterogeneity within the RI framework. Between the RI-MNL and RI-NL, the RI-NL is proven to be the best. The RI-NL model can capture asymmetric (between increasing and decreasing values) elasticities of choice attributes.",0191-2615,Not found

But few studies work on platoon-level closed-loop trajectory control, which can better sustain stream traffic smoothness and efficiency. Motivated by this research gap, this study developed a system optimal platoon-centered control for eco-driving (PCC-eDriving), which can guide a platoon mixed with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) to smoothly approach, split as needed, and then sequentially pass signalized intersections, while reducing or even avoiding sharp deceleration and red idling. The effort is separated to Part I and Part II to prevent a lengthy article. Specifically, Part I of this study modeled the PCC-eDriving as a hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC) system. It involves three MPC controllers for platoon trajectory control and a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) for optimal splitting decisions. Each MPC controller is integrated with robust vehicle dynamics and an online adaptive curve learning algorithm to factor control and vehicle driving uncertainties. An active-set-based optimal condition decomposition algorithm (AS-OCD) was developed to efficiently solve the MPC controllers' large-scale optimizers in a distributed manner. The numerical experiments built upon the field and simulated data indicated that the PCC-eDriving could significantly improve traffic smoothness and efficiency while reducing energy consumption and emission at urban signalized intersections.

A smart predict-then-optimize method for targeted and cost-effective maritime transportation,10.1016/j.trb.2023.03.009,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"In maritime transportation, port state control (PSC) is the last line of defense against substandard ships. During a PSC inspection, PSC officers (PSCOs) identify ship deficiencies that lead to a ship's detention, which can cause severe economic and reputational losses to the ship operator. Therefore, this study innovatively uses PSC inspection data to design ship maintenance plans for ship operators to minimize overall operational costs. We identify three types of operational costs associated with each deficiency code: inspection cost, repair cost, and risk cost in the ship operators’ decision-making process. The risk cost of a deficiency code is strongly related to the detention contribution of the deficiency items under a deficiency code, as indicated by the feature importance of that code in the random forest (RF) model used to predict detention outcomes. To design ship maintenance plans, the sequential predict-then-optimize (PO) method typically solves the optimization problem using input parameters, including the predicted probabilities of having deficiency items under each code and the three types of operational costs. However, the loss function in this two-stage framework does not consider the effect of predictions on the downstream decisions. Hence, we use a smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) method using an ensemble of SPO trees (SPOTs). Each SPOT uses an SPO loss function that measures the sub-optimality of the decisions derived from the predicted parameters. By exploiting the structural properties of the optimization problem analyzed in this study, we demonstrate that training an SPOT for this problem can be simplified tremendously by using the relative class frequency of true labels within a leaf node to yield a minimum SPO loss. Computational experiments show that the SPO-based ship maintenance scheme is superior to other schemes and can reduce a ship's total operating expenses by approximately 1% over the PO-based scheme and by at least 3% over schemes that do not use machine learning methods. In the long run, SPO-based ship maintenance plans also improve the efficiency of port logistics by reducing the resources needed for formal PSC inspections and alleviating port congestion.",0191-2615,Not found

A sharing-carriage mode is proposed and combined with a sharing-train mode to fully exploit the remaining capacity of the existing railway schedule. The manner in which these two sharing modes are jointly involved to utilize the available capacity is investigated and optimized. First, a space–time network is constructed to analyze the distribution of flow for a given train schedule. Subsequently, the influence of integrated transportation upon passenger satisfaction is included by introducing a load-factor-based penalty cost for each train. The model is first formulated as a mixed-integer program that minimizes service and routing costs and then reformulated into a path-based model. A Benders decomposition approach is proposed to decompose the problem into two subproblems. Instead of exploring every possible path for each commodity when solving the Benders subproblem, a column-pool-based approximation approach is proposed to generate feasible solutions. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on two small-scale examples and 12 scenarios from a real-world high-speed railway network. Different train load factors, penalty costs, sharing modes, and commodity volumes are investigated to demonstrate the applicability of integrated transportation.

Therefore, this study only considers the historical daily mileages as raw inputs, and the future daily mileages are considered as ranges to generate wider maintenance time windows for train-sets. Subsequently, a 0–1 integer linear programming model for high-level maintenance scheduling is formulated. After obtaining a high-level maintenance plan, the planned daily mileages of all train-sets are calculated and verified. To make all planned daily mileages feasible, we design an iterative algorithm to adjust the time windows and update the plan.

Estimation of recursive route choice models with incomplete trip observations,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.004,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This work concerns the estimation of recursive route choice models in the situation that the trip observations are incomplete, i.e., there are unconnected links (or nodes) in the observations. A direct approach to handle this issue could be intractable because enumerating all paths between unconnected links (or nodes) in a real network is typically not possible. We exploit an expectation–maximization (EM) method that allows dealing with the missing-data issue by alternatively performing two steps of sampling the missing segments in the observations and solving maximum likelihood estimation problems. Moreover, observing that the EM method could be expensive, we propose a new estimation method based on the idea that the choice probabilities of unconnected link observations can be exactly computed by solving systems of linear equations. We further design a new algorithm, called decomposition–composition (DC), that helps reduce the number of systems of linear equations to be solved and speed up the estimation. We compare our proposed algorithms with some standard baselines using a dataset from a real network, and show that the DC algorithm outperforms the other approaches in recovering missing information in the observations.

Attendees’ heterogeneity in pre-event utility is depicted by a continuous distribution of pre-event utility sensitivity, which changes with the attractiveness (e.g., the overall price level, facility, or service levels) of the venue. Different distributions are adopted to depict the attendees’ pre-event utility sensitivity and are further used to analyse the equilibrium at the bottleneck. The conditions to eliminate the queue at the bottleneck are determined, which are related to the distribution of the pre-event utility sensitivity of the attendees. We further analyse the impact of the venue's attractiveness to attendees on the distribution of attendees’ pre-event utility sensitivity. The optimal choice of the overall price level and facility or service level is determined to maximise the profit of the venue and the total trip utilities of all attendees.

Macroscopic parking dynamics and equitable pricing: Integrating trip-based modeling with simulation-based robust optimization,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.011,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Characterizing the integrated traffic and parking dynamics in a coupled road-parking system is challenging due to the interactions between parking and non-parking vehicles and the presence of cruising-for-parking. In this paper, we propose a new trip-based macroscopic model of parking considering various sources of user heterogeneity that are key to modeling parking. The macroscopic or network fundamental diagram is used to describe the accumulation-based network speed at which vehicles are traveling. An efficient event-based simulation algorithm is proposed as the resolution scheme for the trip-based model. Numerical results reveal that after calibration, the proposed trip-based model yields similar results to those obtained using an accumulation-based approach and microscopic simulation. Taking the trip-based model as the simulation engine, we formulate a simulation-based robust optimization problem of equitable duration-based parking pricing. To solve this problem with simulation stochasticity, a new global optimizer termed NoisyDIRECT is proposed as an open-source solution algorithm. This algorithm automatically identifies the level of simulation stochasticity for each decision vector across the search space, based on which the variable number of simulation runs per point is determined. Thus, the computational resource can be better allocated so that the optimal solution can be found in a more computationally efficient and reliable manner.

Perimeter control in a mixed bimodal bathtub model,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.003,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Perimeter control involves monitoring network-wide traffic and regulating traffic inflow to alleviate hypercongestion. Implementation of transit priority with perimeter control measures, which allow transit into a controlled area without queuing at the perimeter boundary, is an effective strategy in bimodal transportation systems. However, travelers’ behavior changes in response to perimeter control strategies, such as shifts in their departure times and transportation modes, have not been fully investigated. Therefore, important questions remain, such as the use of transit during perimeter control with transit priority. This paper examines the travelers’ behavior changes in response to perimeter control with transit priority in a mixed bimodal transportation system with cars and flexible route transit (FRT) vehicles. We model departure time and transportation mode choices in such a transportation system with hypercongestion and discomfort in FRT (called the mixed bimodal bathtub model). Initially, we investigate the properties of dynamic user equilibrium without perimeter control. Then, we study the equilibrium patterns during perimeter control with transit priority. Unlike existing works, we find that the number of FRT passengers decreases with time toward the desired arrival time and that FRT may not be used around the peak of rush hour. Furthermore, transit priority may not be sufficient to promote the use of FRT, and additional incentive such as subsidy for lower fares may be required to encourage FRT use during perimeter control. Finally, we show that operating many FRT vehicles does not always decrease the equilibrium cost, even under perimeter control with transit priority.",0191-2615,Not found

We characterize the heterogeneity of customers and drivers, and we analyze the platform’s optimal pricing and wage decisions in the two systems, respectively. Comparing the two systems, we find that when the driver’s basic opportunity cost is not quite large and the difference in opportunity cost between two types of drivers is relatively small, the pooling system can achieve a win-win-win outcome for all participants (i.e., customers, drivers, and the platform). Furthermore, a high level of customers’ sensitivity to service quality can increase the platform profit in the dedicated system but has no impact on the pooling system. However, when the level of customers’ sensitivity to service quality is within a certain range (which is relatively small), quality-sensitive customers may pay a higher price to join the pooling system compared with the case in the dedicated system.",0191-2615,Not found
Trajectory Planning for an Autonomous Vehicle with Conflicting Moving Objects Along a Fixed Path – An Exact Solution Method,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.001,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) by considering conflicting moving objects (CMOs) is a challenging problem to AV operations. This paper investigates an AV trajectory planning problem where the AV follows a given spatial path, and the trajectories of CMOs are predictable. With the spatial path fixed, the two-dimensional trajectory planning problem is reduced to a one-dimensional speed planning problem that decides the optimal speeds and accelerations of the AV along the spatial path. This paper first analyzes the conflict area caused by a single CMO in the space-time diagram, which reveals upper and lower bounds to the conflict area. Then a multi-area fusion algorithm is proposed to extend the upper and lower bound analyses to a relatively complex traffic scenario with multiple CMOs. To facilitate the computation of the investigated problem, a customized dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is developed, which employs the revealed upper and lower bounds and arriving time constraints to cut invalid trajectories at each stage. With this, the number of stages and states, as well as the computational time for solving the proposed problem, are largely reduced. A set of numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the customized DP-based algorithm. The results show that the proposed customized DP-based algorithm can solve the investigated problem within milliseconds, which enables applications to real-time AV control. This much outperforms a state-of-the-art commercial solver, Gurobi, especially for complex traffic scenarios.

Non-unimodal and non-concave relationships in the network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram caused by hierarchical streets,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.002,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Unimodal, concave relationships between average network productivity and accumulation or density aggregated across spatially compact regions of urban networks—so called network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs)—have recently been shown to exist on homogeneous street networks. When present, MFD relationships facilitate the modeling of traffic congestion at a regional level and have led to the development of various regional traffic control strategies. However, real street networks are not homogeneous—they generally have a hierarchical structure where some streets (e.g., arterials) promote higher mobility than others (e.g., local roads). This paper examines how the presence of hierarchical roadway structures may potentially cause non-unimodal patterns in a network's MFD. These are observed using three types of tools: analytical models of simple network structures, simulations of various idealized roadway networks, and empirical data. The impacts of street hierarchy depend on how vehicles use different roadway types to move within the network; i.e., their routing strategy. The findings suggest that the presence of roadway hierarchies may lead to MFDs that have non-unimodal or non-concave patterns on the free-flow branch when vehicles route themselves according to user equilibrium principles, which is closest to what would be observed in realistic situations. Such patterns are contrary to what is traditionally assumed in most MFD-based modeling frameworks. However, the unimodal and concave MFD should be expected under system optimal routing conditions that maximize network productivity for a given traffic state.",0191-2615,Not found
Markov chain-based traffic analysis on platooning effect among mixed semi- and fully-autonomous vehicles in a freeway lane,10.1016/j.trb.2023.04.006,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Focusing on a freeway lane running with mixed semi-autonomous vehicles (semi-AVs) and fully-autonomous vehicles (fully-AVs), this study aims to investigate the heterogeneous platooning effect of the two types of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the travel efficiency of the mixed traffic. Such impact in the mixed semi-/fully-AV traffic, to the best of our knowledge, has not been well addressed in the literature as the existing mixed traffic studies on platooning effect typically focused on the traffic scenes with only human-driven vehicles (HVs) and fully-AVs. The existence of semi-AVs, which are optionally controlled by human drivers and semi-autonomous driving systems, and their significant difference in platooning behavior from the fully-AVs have received very limited attention. To fill the gap, we first characterize the semi- and fully-AVs’ difference in connection ability and willingness to platoon in the vehicle platooning process, and derive the heterogeneous platooning probabilities of semi- and fully-AVs. To formulate the platooned traffic after vehicle platooning process, we proceed to develop a novel Markov chain model to determine the probability distributions of vehicular platoon size and headway type among the mixed semi-/fully-AV traffic analytically. Furthermore, with the probability distributions, we derive the fundamental diagram (FD) and the capacity of the freeway lane for the mixed semi-/fully-AV traffic, and are thus able to investigate impact of platooning on the travel efficiency numerically.

Jam density and stopbar location estimation with trajectory data at signalized intersections,10.1016/j.trb.2023.02.007,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Jam density, or its reciprocal jam spacing, is a parameter difficult to estimate. In fact, most traffic signal control and traffic state estimation studies published until date generally assume a given value, with no estimation from data whatsoever. Nevertheless, estimating jam density is crucial, since any deviation from its true value will propagate to queue lengths and volume estimates. In the possession of only trajectory data, its estimation is even harder since not all vehicles are observed. In this paper, we first define the data generating process of the jam spacing parameter using sparse trajectory data. Then, we propose several estimators to estimate jam spacing and its variance. We use as measurements the distances between successive vehicle stops. The first estimator is a Maximum-Likelihood estimator (MLE) of a Geometrically Skewed Normal (GSN) distribution, to be used whenever there is lane information. The second estimator is a MLE of a shifted GSN with Normal Stopbar (SGSN-NSB) to be used when observed distances are measured from the stopbar estimate. In addition, we propose two least-squares counterparts, LSE and LSE-SB, based on least absolute remainders.

Indeed, the minimization of monetary costs for passengers is relevant in transport systems without a complete integrated fare system, where passengers may pay for each trip-leg; thus, modeling monetary costs for users is essential when referring to the system’s accessibility and route choice. To achieve our goal, we implement an epsilon-constraint algorithm capable of obtaining high-quality approximations of the Pareto front for benchmark instances in hours of computational time, which is reasonable for strategic planning problems. Numerical results show that the conflict between both objectives is evident, and it is possible to identify the more useful lines to optimize each objective, leading to relevant information for the decision-making process.

Different users are assigned with different ratios of the time saved per unit of money (RTSMs), the values of which represent the different expectations to trade more money for less travel time. Infinite indifference curves are then generated by considering continuously distributed RTSMs in the population. Accordingly, we extend the definition of the path-based time surplus for the C-TSmaxBUE model, which can be formulated as a Beckmann-type mathematical program operating in the space of RTSM boundaries. To solve the problem, we develop a path-based single-boundary adjustment (SBA) algorithm that fits the non-additive structure of the model. The algorithm involves a Newton-type flow equilibration procedure that simultaneously adjusts RTSM boundaries and path flows, as well as a column generation scheme that firstly enumerates all efficient paths and then identifies the paths that have the potential to reduce generalized travel times. Numerical results on a small network show the feature of the equilibrium flow pattern, whereas instances of practical size confirm that SBA is an efficient tool to obtain high-quality equilibrium solutions.

Motivated by the fuel consumption saving from truck platooning, carriers can collaborate for creating more platooning opportunities in an alliance.

Since an alliance satisfying these two conditions may not always exist, we aim to find a cost allocation such that the violation of efficiency and stability conditions is minimized. We first propose a cooperative AT platooning problem for a trade-off between fuel consumption savings and schedule deviation cost. Then, we model the problem as a cooperative AT platooning game and formulate cost allocation models.

Mechanism design for Mobility-as-a-Service platform considering travelers’ strategic behavior and multidimensional requirements,10.1016/j.trb.2023.04.004,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is an emerging transport model which provides access to a combination of travel modes through a single platform. A MaaS operator sits between travelers and transport service providers (TSPs), acting as a broker who purchases mobility resources from individual TSPs, constructs seamless transport services, and then sells them to travelers in response to their demand. To ensure the sustainability of such platforms, the key challenge lies in matching travelers to TSPs so that travelers’ individual needs are satisfied, TSPs gain nonnegative profits and system efficiency is achieved. To solve this matching and pricing problem, travelers’ truthful valuations and travel requirements are needed, while such information is usually unknown to operators beforehand. In this study, we develop an auction-based online mobility resource allocation and pricing mechanism to solve this problem, taking into account travelers’ strategic behavior. We first propose an offline (static) mechanism using a Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) based pricing scheme to ensure incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and system efficiency. We then develop an online mechanism based on the dynamic learning algorithm to obtain the near-optimal solution and compare it to a customized greedy based algorithm. We compare both online mechanisms to the offline VCG based mechanism and theoretically prove the competitive ratios. The efficiency and performance of the proposed mechanisms are demonstrated through a numerical study.",0191-2615,Not found

"A recursive stochastic transit equilibrium model estimated using passive data from Santiago, Chile",10.1016/j.trb.2023.102780,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"A strategic public transport equilibrium model is developed that considers each user's trip decision, covering the choices of access stop, mode and line, alighting stop, and transfer or egress. At each stage, these choices are considered to be stochastic and made under capacity constraints resulting in waiting time increases at stops and stations due to demand levels and/or arriving vehicle loads. The modeling strategy is based on the hyper-path concept, but rather than evaluate user strategies, the approach models transitions at all individual nodes, thus facilitating computational efficiency. In this approach, we develop a recursive method different from resolving explicitly a recursion based on Bellman´s equation, which is suitable for large and dense transit networks. A method is presented for estimating the model parameters, which was applied to the real case of the Santiago, Chile transit system based on passive transaction datasets generated by users’ smart cards and GPS technology aboard the system's buses. These data were used to estimate alighting stops and an exhaustive and disaggregate reconstruction of all user trips. Once calibrated, the model proved able to predict the trip assignments observed in the calibration dataset as well as datasets from later periods, making predictions that closely fit the observations and adapting well to changes in network topology, operating patterns, and user demand. Therefore, the model should have considerable potential as a powerful, flexible, and highly useful tool for system regulators and operators who define public transport structures, operations, and policies.",0191-2615,Not found
Train rescheduling for large-scale disruptions in a large-scale railway network,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102786,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper studies the problem of rescheduling trains in a large-scale railway network with the characteristics of long distance, long time horizon and a large number of trains, where a disruption causes the paralysis of a significant part of the network for a long duration. As rescheduling measures we consider train reordering and retiming as well as the option of rerouting trains along alternative paths in the railway network. Although rerouting was not previously employed in large-scale long-distance networks, we show its benefit in reducing passenger delays. We formulate the problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) model on a space–time network with the goal of minimizing the total passenger delay and the number of passengers that could not reach their destination. In order to effectively solve the ILP model for real-world instances, we propose a heuristic algorithm (LR-H), based on the Lagrangian relaxation (LR) of a subset of constraints in the ILP model. LR allows decomposing the problem into a series of independent train-based subproblems which are easy to solve. Due to the large number of constraints and to cope with the real-time requirement, LR-H employs dynamic constraint-generation. We tested LR-H on railway networks of different sizes under several disruption scenarios: first, we compared the results obtained by LR-H on a small-size instance with those found by the general-purpose ILP solver GUROBI, showing that LR-H can find near-optimal solutions in significantly shorter computing times. Then, we applied LR-H to a real-world instance of a railway network in China with 350 trains in different disruption scenarios. The experimental results show that, LR-H can obtain near-optimal solutions with an average optimality gap of 2.27% in an average computing time of about 300 s.",0191-2615,Not found
Productivity benefits of urban transportation megaprojects: A general equilibrium analysis of «Grand Paris Express»,10.1016/j.trb.2023.03.006,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The «Grand Paris Express» (GPE) reduces road congestion, a negative externality (Walters, 1961; Vickrey, 1963); while inducing job densification, which improves total factor productivity (TFP), the source of a positive externality (Marshall, 1890). To parse out the effects and interaction of these externalities empirically, we use a spatial general equilibrium model treating transportation, output, labor, real estate and land markets. The TFP externality reduces marginal costs and output prices, benefitting consumers, including those importing from the region. Wages and rents increase but only after normalization by an output price index. The unsubsidized TFP externality adds importantly to the GPE's social benefit-to-cost ratio, despite causing fiscal losses from nominal income tax, sales tax and fuel tax revenues. Pigouvian congestion tolling raises long run welfare, and although toll revenue exceeds thrice the GPE's direct cost, it recovers only 62% of the direct cost plus the fiscal losses in the short run, but only 54% in the long run when the fiscal losses are larger. In the presence of distortionary taxation, consumers elsewhere who import from the region, and the unsubsidized TFP externality, charging more than Pigouvian congestion tolls improves overall social welfare but reduces the welfare of the in-region consumers.",0191-2615,Not found
On the Relationship between Traffic Hysteresis and String Stability of Vehicle Platoons,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102785,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The existence, source, and characteristics of hysteresis loops in traffic oscillations have been extensively investigated in the past decades. At the same time, the string stability of vehicle platoons has also attracted significant attention and has been considered the main cause of the spontaneously emerging oscillations. However, the relationship between these two seemingly related properties remains underexplored, leading to deficits in knowledge about the effect of microscopic controllers’ operations on macroscopic traffic characteristics. Filling this gap becomes important with the advent of driving automation and the possibility to make future road transport not only safer but also more efficient. This would however require setting proper requirements to their operations, able to ensure that they would generate an efficient traffic flow without limiting too much the freedom of the system developers. By analyzing both simulation and real-world data, the present work has confirmed the existence of a strong correlation between hysteresis and string instability. In particular, string unstable platoons are found to be also hysteretic, while only a limited number of string stable platoons were hysteretic. Further, for a simple linear car following model, hysteresis loops are shown to emerge in the absence of inter-driver and/or intra-driver heterogeneity, which have been suggested as the main sources of hysteresis. This implies a new mechanism that can lead to hysteresis, emerging as a characteristic of the driving behavior. An analytical investigation of this mechanism shows a link to string instability, at least for the simple linear model used. Although further research will be needed in order to generalize the findings of this paper, the present results strongly suggest that introducing a requirement for string stability may lead to a significant reduction in the occurrence and the negative effects of traffic oscillations.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated deployment of dedicated lane and roadside unit considering uncertain road capacity under the mixed-autonomy traffic environment,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102784,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The rapid development of automated vehicle (AV) technologies enables us to explore how to update the urban road infrastructure to cater for the upcoming mixed-autonomy traffic with both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). In this study, we aim to seek an optimal solution to integrate the deployment of AV-dedicated lane and roadside unit assisting automated driving subject to a limited budget by considering the route choice behaviors of AVs and HVs. An AV-dedicated lane segregates AVs from the mixed traffic to create a fully automated driving environment and eliminate disturbances from HVs. The deployment of roadside units assisting automated driving could overcome the connectivity gap for AVs and lower their headway when they follow an HV. We seek to develop a robust and optimal integrated deployment solution that accommodates the uncertain road capacity caused by the stochastic mixed AV and HV fleet sequence. We first establish the stochastic network equilibrium conditions for the mixed traffic, and formulate the integrated deployment problem as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). The MPCC is approximated by a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) model, which allows existing algorithms for its global optimum. We further develop two interesting strategies, including domain reduction and breakpoint selection, to enhance the effectiveness of the MILP model.

In addition, the hub is a complex facility operating with several types of limited resources and in which import and export vehicles might not be synchronized. These aspects are usually not properly incorporated into existing hub network design models. To address these issues, we introduce the idea of generalized capacity constraints and propose two mixed-integer linear programming models to incorporate these constraints, together with a heuristic. We also provide a methodology for estimating capacity-related parameters in the context of intermodal rail-road hub network design considering non-synchronized train–truck operations. The formulations are evaluated on the well-known AP data set, and we discuss the case study of a projected intermodal transportation system in Colombia in which the transshipment equipment and storage space availability are considered limiting hub resources.

Lead-Time-Constrained Middle-Mile Consolidation Network Design with Fixed Origins and Destinations,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102782,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Many large e-commerce retailers move sufficient freight volumes to operate private middle-mile consolidation networks for order fulfillment, transporting customer shipments from stocking locations to last-mile delivery partners in consolidated loads to reduce freight costs. We study a middle-mile network design optimization problem with fixed origins and destinations to build load consolidation plans that minimize cost and satisfy customer shipment lead-time constraints. We propose models that extend traditional flat network service network design problems to capture waiting delays between load dispatches and ensure that shipment lead-time requirements are satisfied with a desired probability. We approximate these chance constraints using hyperparameterized linear constraints, resulting in new mixed-integer programs (MIPs) for service network design. To find high-quality solutions to the proposed MIPs, we develop an effective integer-programming-based local search (IPBLS) heuristic that iteratively improves a solution by optimizing over a smartly selected subset of commodities. For the largest problem instances, we propose a two-phase IPBLS heuristic that first utilizes a simplified, restricted MIP that constrains leg waiting delays individually. Computational experiments using data from a large U.S.-based e-commerce partner demonstrate the significant impact of tight lead-time constraints on the structure of the consolidation network designs and their concomitant operating costs. Notably, tighter constraints lead to solutions with increased shipment consolidation and higher dispatch frequencies on selected key transportation lanes. Such solutions trade off higher shipment transit times with significantly reduced shipment waiting times to meet lead-time constraints at lower cost.",0191-2615,Not found
Robust vehicle routing with drones under uncertain demands and truck travel times in humanitarian logistics,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102781,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Resource transport in the aftermath of disasters is critical, yet in the absence of sufficient historical data or accurate forecasting approaches, the development of resource transport strategies often faces the challenge of dealing with uncertainty, especially uncertainties in demand and travel time. In this paper we investigate the vehicle routing problem with drones under uncertain demands and truck travel times. Specifically, there is a set of trucks and drones (each truck is associated with a drone) collaborating to transport relief resources to the affected areas, where a drone can be launched from its associated truck at a node, independently transporting relief resources to one or more of the affected areas, and returning to the truck at another node along the truck route. For this problem, we present a tailored robust optimization model based on the well-known budgeted uncertainty set, and develop an enhanced branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm incorporating a bounded bidirectional labelling algorithm to solve the pricing problem, which can be modelled as a robust resource-constrained vehicle and drone synthetic shortest path problem. To enhance the performance of the algorithm, we employ subset-row inequalities to tighten the lower bound and incorporate some enhancement strategies to quickly solve the pricing problem. We perform extensive numerical studies to assess the performance of the developed algorithm, discuss the benefits of considering uncertainty and robustness, and analyse the impacts of key model parameters on the optimal solution. We also evaluate the benefits of the truck–drone collaborative transport mode over the truck-only transport mode through a real case study of the 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, China.",0191-2615,Not found

Spatial heterogeneity is addressed by partitioning the study region into a set of relatively homogeneous zones, and a set of criteria are imposed to avoid significant detours among matched passengers. A generalized multi-zone queuing network model is then developed to describe how vehicles’ states transition within each zone and across neighboring zones, and how passengers are served by idle or partially occupied vehicles. A large system of equations is constructed based on the queuing network model to analytically evaluate steady-state system performance. Then, we formulate a constrained nonlinear program to optimize the design of ride-pooling services, such as zone-level vehicle deployment, vehicle routing paths, and vehicle rebalancing operations. A customized solution approach is also proposed to decompose and solve the optimization problem. The proposed model and solution approach are applied to a hypothetical case and a real-world Chicago case study, so as to demonstrate their applicability and to draw insights. Agent-based simulations are also used to corroborate results from the proposed analytical model.

Societally optimal expansion of bicycle networks,10.1016/j.trb.2023.06.002,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"In this paper, we consider the problem of expanding bicycle networks over time. The expansion of the network at a given point in time is based on the societal cost–benefit performance, which entails system-wide effects from previous expansions. The problem is challenging due to non-linearities of travel time benefits and the dimension of the problem, which is a consequence of the combinatorial complexity of the networks and the planning horizon. It rules out the use of conventional bottom-up cost–benefit analysis as evaluating even a small set of possible solutions becomes computationally infeasible. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a novel reverse geographical mapping approach where the monetary benefits are assigned back onto the network. This allows a more detailed geographical planning breakdown at the level of network links and makes it possible to apply a more stringent optimization approach with respect to the timing and prioritization of network expansions. Based on a linear approximation of travel time savings, we propose several variants of mathematical integer programs to solve the problem. This allows us to consider the case of growing a cycle superhighway network in the Copenhagen region over a time horizon of 50 years. We show that our approximations of travel time savings are largely similar to those obtained through actual traffic assignment. Furthermore, the optimization approach renders a development plan, which yields a net present value that is ten times larger than that of the actual infrastructure upgrades implemented since 2019. In a long-term scenario, it is shown that our solution returns an accumulated benefit–cost ratio of 2.7 over the period, which is a significant improvement over previous findings. This underlines the importance of optimal prioritization schemes of where and when to invest in bicycle network expansions.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal investment in driving automation: Individual vs. cooperative sensing,10.1016/j.trb.2023.06.001,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) use sensors to scan their surrounding environment in order to make safe and efficient motion decisions. The richness of a CAV’s vision depends on the configuration of on-board sensors and the ability of CAVs to share data with nearby vehicles. High-end sensors provide quality data, allowing CAVs to rely on their own sensors through individual sensing, and to become independent of other vehicles. In contrast, sensor data sharing enhances the collective vision of CAVs through cooperative sensing. This study investigates the trade-offs in the values and costs of individual versus cooperative sensing, and it proposes optimal investment strategies for short- and long-term planning. Exploiting the setting of a CAV-exclusive corridor, we propose two nonlinear programs to determine optimal investment in corridor capacity in the long-term, and to maximize social welfare in the short-term through road pricing. Capacity analysis shows disjointed investments in individual and cooperative sensing, first in the former until sensors reach a desired resolution, and then in the latter. Social welfare analysis shows travelers are granted a reward in certain settings, encouraging flows that achieve cooperative sensing. Such rewards are not observed in human-driven vehicle settings that cannot benefit from cooperative sensing.",0191-2615,Not found

A key difference from other crew scheduling problems is that drivers can be exchanged between buses at arbitrary intermediate stops en route such that our problem requires additional synchronization constraints.

Moreover, we develop a destructive-bound-enhanced matheuristic that converges to provably optimal solutions and apply it to a real-world case study for Flixbus, one of Europe’s leading coach companies. We demonstrate that our matheuristic outperforms a standalone MIP implementation in terms of solution quality and computational time and reduces the number of required drivers by up to 56% compared to approaches currently used in practice. Our solution approach provides feasible solutions for all instances within seconds and solves instances with up to 390 locations and 70 requests optimally with an average computational time under 210 sec.

Data-driven analysis for disturbance amplification in car-following behavior of automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.005,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper presents a data-driven framework to quantitatively analyze the disturbance amplification behavior of automated vehicles in car-following (CF). The data-driven framework can be applied to unknown CF controllers based on the concept of empirical frequency response function (FRF). Specifically, a well-known signal processing method, Welch's method, together with a short time Fourier transformation is developed to extract the empirical transfer functions from vehicle trajectories. The method is first developed assuming a generic linear controller with time-invariant CF control features (e.g., control gains) and later extended to capture time-variant features. The proposed methods are evaluated for estimation consistencies via synthetic data-based simulations. The evaluation includes the performances of the linear approximation accuracy for a linear time-invariant controller, a nonlinear controller, and a linear time-variant controller. Results indicate that our framework can provide reasonably consistent results as theoretical ones in terms of disturbance amplification. Further it can perform better than a linear theoretical analysis of disturbance amplification, particularly when nonlinearity in CF behavior is present. The methods are applied to existing field data collected from vehicles with adaptive cruise control (ACC) on the market. Findings reveal that all tested vehicles tend to amplify disturbances, particularly in low frequency (< 0.5 Hz). Further, the results demonstrate that these ACC vehicles exhibit time-varying features in terms of disturbance amplification ratio depending on the leading vehicle trajectories.",0191-2615,Not found
The bus synchronization timetabling problem with dwelling times,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.010,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"We study the bus synchronization timetabling problem (BST) including bus dwelling times, motivated by the night shift of the transit system operating in Santiago-Chile. The operation at night under a frequency-setting modality could become inefficient, as at night the frequencies must be low under this type of policy, which may result in long waiting times and poor service quality for passengers. To address these inefficiencies, the authorities have required that all of their night services will operate according to fixed timetables considering the possibility of providing coordinated transfers between certain lines to reduce waiting times in night transfers. For this purpose, we propose a mixed integer programming model to define the specific timetables and the duration of the vehicle dwelling periods, taking the line frequencies as given. The model includes all the specifications and operation details of the real system, with a special focus on the synchronization of transfers at stops, pursuing the maximization of successful encounters through the inclusion of dwelling times as optimization variables together with the departure times of each line. The model was strengthened by adding different sets of valid inequalities.

cooperative trajectory control for synchronizing the movement of two connected and autonomous vehicles separated in a mixed traffic flow,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.006,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"When connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are widely used in the future, we can foresee many essential applications, such as platoon formation and autonomous police patrolling, which need two CAVs, initially separated in a mixed traffic flow involving CAVs and human-drive vehicles (HDVs), to quickly approach each other and then keep a stable car-following mode. The entire process should not jeopardize surrounding traffic safety and efficiency. The existing literature has not studied this CAV synchronization control well, and this study seeks to make up this gap partially. To do that, we developed a Model Predictive Control model embedded with a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP-MPC), which integrates micro- and macro-traffic flow models to capture hybrid traffic flow dynamics. Specifically, the MPC will generate control law at each discrete timestamp to manage the microscopic movements of the two subject CAVs while predicting their neighboring vehicles’ movement by well-accepted car-following models and estimating the distant upstream traffic’ response by the macroscopic traffic model such as cell transmission model (CTM). The MINLP-MPC is multi-objective, seeking to sustain both synchronization and traffic efficiencies. To generate such well-balanced optimal control, we noticed that the synchronization experiences two distinct phases, sequentially completing the catch-up and platooning tasks. Accordingly, we transferred MINLP-MPC to a hybrid MPC system consisting of two sequential MPCs, respectively prioritizing the catch-up and platooning control. Then, we developed a weighting strategy to tune the control priorities adaptively. The recursive feasibility of the MPC is mathematically proved. Furthermore, we generalized the MPC and the hybrid MPC system to enable multi-vehicle synchronization.

Investment timing and length choice for a rail transit line under demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102800,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This paper is motivated by the inadequate treatment of uncertainty in public transit infrastructure investments. As observed in the past, rare but dramatic events can heavily disrupt public transit system operations and negatively affect the transit riders. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused an 80%-90% transit demand decline in March 2020 in the U.S. However, the existing transit infrastructure planning studies have not modeled such sudden demand shocks. We thus improve the modeling realism of uncertain transit demand by formulating demand evolution as a jump-diffusion process, which is a combination of continuous-time Brownian motion and a discrete counting process, namely Poisson process, and present analytical optimization models for the development of a rail transit line under such uncertainty. We jointly optimize two related decisions, namely the timing for introducing rail transit to a commuter corridor and length choice for the rail line. We refute a misconception that investment in a project should always start immediately if a positive cost saving over the planning horizon is expected. We also find that investment timing and sizing decisions are closely related and behave quite differently for the same change in some parameters, such as the infrastructure construction period. The developed modeling and analysis framework should be transferable to other civil infrastructure development and investment problems under uncertainty.",0191-2615,Not found

In particular, we use continuous vector representations, called embeddings, for encoding categorical or discrete explanatory variables with a special focus on interpretability and model transparency. Although embedding representations within the logit framework have been conceptualized by Pereira (2019), their dimensions do not have an absolute definitive meaning, hence offering limited behavioral insights in this earlier work. The novelty of our work lies in enforcing interpretability to the embedding vectors by formally associating each of their dimensions to a choice alternative. Thus, our approach brings benefits much beyond a simple parsimonious representation improvement over dummy encoding, as it provides behaviorally meaningful outputs that can be used in travel demand analysis and policy decisions. Additionally, in contrast to previously suggested ANN-based Discrete Choice Models (DCMs) that either sacrifice interpretability for performance or are only partially interpretable, our main model (E-MNL) preserves interpretability of the utility coefficients for all the input variables despite being based on ANN principles. The proposed models are tested on two real world datasets and evaluated against benchmark and baseline models that use dummy-encoding. The results of the experiments indicate that our models deliver state-of-the-art predictive performance, outperforming existing ANN-based models while drastically reducing the number of required network parameters.",0191-2615,Not found

A general equilibrium model for multi-passenger ridesharing systems with stable matching,10.1016/j.trb.2023.05.012,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This paper proposes a general equilibrium model for multi-passenger ridesharing systems, in which interactions between ridesharing drivers, passengers, platforms, and transportation networks are endogenously captured. Stable matching is modeled as an equilibrium problem in which no ridesharing driver or passenger can reduce his/her ridesharing disutility by unilaterally switching to another matching sequence. This paper is one of the first studies that explicitly integrates the ridesharing platform’s multi-passenger matching problem into the model. By integrating matching sequence with hyper-network, ridesharing-passenger transfers are avoided in a multi-passenger ridesharing system. Moreover, the matching stability between the ridesharing drivers and passengers is extended to address the multi-OD multi-passenger case in terms of matching sequence. The paper provides a proof for the existence of the proposed general equilibrium. A sequence-bush algorithm is developed for solving the multi-passenger ridesharing equilibrium problem. This algorithm is capable to handle complex ridesharing constraints implicitly. Results illustrate that the proposed sequence-bush algorithm outperforms general-purpose solver, and provides insights into the equilibrium of the joint stable matching and route choice problem. Numerical experiments indicate that ridesharing trips are typically longer than average trip lengths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that a properly designed ridesharing unit price is necessary to achieve network benefits, and travelers with relatively lower values of time are more likely to participate in ridesharing.",0191-2615,Not found

A parsimonious corridor transit design model is developed that differentiates travelers according to their location-based access to opportunities. Its objective is defined by the underlying ethical principle: maximizing the total accessibility for the utilitarian principle and maximizing the accessibility of the most disadvantaged for the difference principle. When transit service is homogeneous everywhere along the corridor, we prove ethical principles make no difference in the optimal design. In response to this finding, spatial supply heterogeneity is introduced into the design models. We then find the egalitarian design has a prominent equity-enhancing effect, whereas the utilitarian design exacerbates inequity, especially when the spatial distribution of opportunities is highly uneven. The results highlight the usefulness of the difference principle, notably its ability to identify the upper limit of equity when the decision is bounded by limited resources or the underlying structure of the problem at hand. However, correcting innate inequality by applying the difference principle may entail interventions that not only appear “discriminatory” but also impose a steep price in the form of lost total accessibility—up to 40% in our numerical experiments.",0191-2615,Not found
Humanitarian transportation network design via two-stage distributionally robust optimization,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102805,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Natural disasters are highly unpredictable, with varying degrees of magnitude, and thus require a reliable and robust humanitarian relief network. Faced with the adverse effects of disasters, we advocate taking pre-disaster preventive actions, e.g., road link strengthening, to mitigate post-disaster disruptions to road networks. In this paper, we study a highly integrated humanitarian relief network design problem, in which the network strengthening plan and inventory pre-positioning scheme are optimized cooperatively. The proposed problem is formulated as a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model, in which the first and second stages correspond to pre- and post-disaster relief operations, respectively. By leveraging prior data and the Wasserstein metric, a tailored ambiguity set is constructed to capture both node- and link-wise uncertainties. We demonstrate that the two-stage DRO model over the Wasserstein ambiguity set has an equivalent reformulation that can be solved via the L-shaped method with bilinear subproblems. Based on observations of the problem structure and the spirit of separation optimization, both exact and heuristic approaches are proposed to address the bilinear subproblems. Via the case study of the Yushu earthquake, we highlight the value of jointly optimizing network strengthening and inventory pre-positioning decisions. Specifically, with the same investment budget, integrating network strengthening into inventory pre-positioning can easily achieve an approximately 60% reduction in shortage penalties. Furthermore, our method can produce reliable solutions, based on which we explore several managerial implications.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated optimization of rolling stock allocation and train timetables for urban rail transit networks: A benders decomposition approach,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102815,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"We investigate the integrated optimization of rolling stock allocation and train timetables (RATT) in an urban rail transit network with multiple connected lines and rolling stock depots. Different from most existing research on single-line cases, we consider that the rail manager plans to allocate a certain fleet of rolling stock to depots to implement the operational timetables of multiple lines, where each depot can serve more than one line but has limited capacity. By means of the construction of a space–time network, we formulate RATT into a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The model can simultaneously generate the rolling stock allocation plan and train schedules for the considered lines, with the aim of optimizing both the investment cost of rolling stock and the service quality of passengers. Due to the computational complexity of large-scale real-world instances, we develop a Benders decomposition-based solution algorithm, which decomposes the MILP into a rolling stock assignment problem and a set of independent subproblems, i.e., a train scheduling subproblem for each line. As the subproblems also contain integral variables, we further prove that a large portion of the subproblems, after proper reformulation, has the integrality property and can be solved rapidly via linear relaxation. We test our integrated approach and solution algorithms on real-world instances from the Beijing rail transit network. The results show that our solution approach can obtain near optimal solutions, while the commercial solvers cannot even return feasible solutions on real-world instances. Compared to the existing plan in the Beijing metro, our RATT approach can improve the service quality by 17.6%, on average, using the same fleet size of rolling stock.",0191-2615,Not found
Fare evasion in public transport: How does it affect the optimal design and pricing?,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102803,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Fare evasion produces significant revenue losses in public transport systems. Recent research has found that low service quality and high prices are important determinants of fare evasion. However, the economic literature that studies the optimal public transport provision has overlooked the phenomenon. We develop a demand model of horizontal differentiation to investigate how fare evasion affects the design and pricing of public transport that maximizes utilitarian social welfare. We show analytically that fare evasion can create incentives to reduce public transport prices and improve service quality, putting upward pressure on its subsidization. We perform numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of these incentives on the public transport provision. These simulations confirm that the incentive to reduce fare evasion can lead to an optimal design and price that requires subsidies.",0191-2615,Not found
A hybrid modelling framework for the estimation of dynamic origin–destination flows,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102804,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The dynamic origin–destination flow estimation (DODE) problem requires scalable methods for large scale traffic networks and consistent techniques for capturing both uncongested and congested traffic conditions. Despite numerous efforts on incorporating multifold data sources and developing manifold mathematical models, the DODE problem remains a challenging problem in terms of both scalability and consistency. To fill this gap, we propose a novel hybrid DODE framework that integrates region-level (macro) and centroid-level (micro) traffic dynamics. The region-level traffic flows are described by the macroscopic fundamental diagram, while the centroid-level traffic flows are represented by the linear mapping of origin–destination flows onto link counts. This hybrid approach enables us to (i) incorporate region-level traffic measures into the problem, addressing scalability issues arising in large scale traffic networks, and (ii) capture non-linear behaviour of traffic in the regional context, enhancing consistency of the estimation results with respect to traffic conditions. The proposed methodology is experimented in a large-scale traffic network, which is benchmarked for DODE problems. The results indicate an outstanding performance of the hybrid DODE particularly in congested traffic conditions and highlight the effectiveness of aggregated (regional) traffic models in enhancing DODE methods with minimal computational burden.",0191-2615,Not found
Crowd-shipping as a Service: Game-based operating strategy design and analysis,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102802,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Crowd-shipping as a Service (CSaaS), a novel concept proposed in this study for the Online-to-Offline (O2O) market, integrates different kinds of shipping services provided by individuals and public transport (PT) operators and enables booking and payment through a single CSaaS platform. It largely increases the shipping capacities and provides a flexible shipping mode for consignees with parcel delivery requests. Focusing on the role of the CSaaS platform, we design the commission-based and integrator-based operating strategies in the presence of CSaaS, where the CSaaS platform acts as an intermediary and a reseller, respectively. To explicitly depict the interactive relations among O2O players, i.e., the CSaaS platform, the individual-based crowd-shipping (I-CS) platform, the PT operator, the conventional logistics (CL) platform, and consignees, we adopt a game-theoretic approach to formulate the business models with and without CSaaS and derive the optimal behaviors of these players, i.e., the price decisions of platforms/operators and the choice decisions of consignees regarding which shipping mode (i.e., the I-CS, CSaaS, and CL modes) to choose. Analytical results show that the commission-based operating strategy outperforms the integrator-based strategy with a larger CSaaS platform's profit. In addition, the impact of CSaaS on O2O players is also identified by comparing the results of two business models, which is found to be closely related to the urban structure regarding PT accessibility.

Service-oriented container slot allocation policy under stochastic demand,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102799,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The liner shipping industry plays a pivotal role in global cargo transportation, catering to both contract and spot shippers. Proper capacity allocation between these shippers is vital for maintaining service quality and improving revenue. This research investigates the service-oriented container slot allocation problem under stochastic demand, aiming to maximize total freight revenue while providing adequate service levels to contract shippers for sustaining their market loyalty. We use the fill rate (i.e., the proportion of satisfied demand) as a metric for service level and formulate the research problem as a stochastic linear programming model. To solve this model, we convert it into a multi-objective attainability problem by setting a target for total revenue, and apply Blackwell’s Approachability Theorem to theoretically determine the feasibility of any given revenue and service level requirements. Leveraging these insights, we devise near-optimal policies to guide the slot allocation decision under each demand scenario. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the benchmark policies in the literature. Furthermore, it can also achieve near-optimal performance closely resembling the sampling average approximation (SAA) solution while significantly reducing the computational time.",0191-2615,Not found
RIde-hail vehicle routing (RIVER) as a congestion game,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102819,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The RIde-hail VEhicle Routing (RIVER) problem describes how drivers in a ride-hail market form a dynamic routing strategy according to the expected reward in each zone of the market. We model this decision-making problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and view the drivers as playing an MDP routing game, with “congestion” induced by competitive matching in a zone. The meeting probability (i.e., the probability of successfully picking up a passenger after cruising in a zone for one period) is derived from a physical model, which is specified for street-hail and e-hail service modes separately, and calibrated with simulation data. We define a Wardrop equilibrium for the MDP routing game, and then prove it exists and can be obtained by solving a fixed-point problem. We further show a system optimum – corresponding to the maximum total expected reward accumulated over time by all drivers – can be achieved if drivers make individual routing decisions according to a cooperative reward rather than the personal reward. In other words, the proposed cooperative strategy “decentralizes” the system optimal solution in the MDP routing game. The results from numerical experiments, including a case study of Chicago, indicate the service mode plays a critical role in shaping system performance. While e-hail enjoys a higher fleet utilization rate than street-hail thanks to its more advanced matching technology, it may lead to a more uneven spatial distribution of vacant vehicle supply. As expected, cooperative routing improves system performance in terms of both total reward and equal distribution of supply. Yet, its benefit is much stronger in e-hail than in street-hail, especially when the supply is overly abundant. We also find, when a local demand surge occurs, the cooperative rewards rise in sync, similar to surge pricing on the supply side. Interestingly, the impact of the price surge spreads broadly in space, propagating far beyond the epicenter of the demand surge.",0191-2615,Not found

An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with crowdsourced bids and transshipment,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102831,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This paper addresses a pickup and delivery problem with crowdsourced bids and transshipment (PDPCBT) in last-mile delivery, where all requests can be satisfied by either using the own vehicle fleet or outsourcing with a small compensation to crowdshippers through transshipment facilities. The crowdshippers show their willingness to deliver by submitting bids to the e-commerce company. To minimize both the travel cost of vehicles and the compensation of crowdshippers, the routes of vehicles and the selection of bids need to be optimized simultaneously. We formulate the PDPCBT into an arc-based formulation and a route-based formulation, where the latter is strengthened by the subset row inequalities. Based on the route-based formulation, we present a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm to solve it exactly. To deal with two possible ways of serving requests, we first decompose the corresponding pricing problem into a shortest path problem and a knapsack problem, and then tackle them in the same bi-directional labeling algorithm framework. We also discuss acceleration techniques and implementation details to speed up the performance of the overall procedure. Computational experiments are conducted on a set of classic request instances, together with a set of randomly generated bid instances.

Recent developments presented models focusing on ride-hailing (solo rides) and traditional ride-sharing, but no work addressed ridesplitting (a type of ride-sourcing service with shared rides) in dynamic contexts. Here, we sought to develop a dynamic aggregated traffic network model capable of representing ride-sourcing services and background traffic in a macroscopic multi-region urban network. We combined the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) with detailed state-space and transition descriptions of background traffic and ride-sourcing vehicles in their activities to formulate mass conservation equations. Accumulation-based MFD models might experience additional errors due to the variation profile of trip lengths, e.g., when vehicles cruise for passengers. We integrate the so-called M-model that utilizes the total remaining distance to capture dynamics of regional and inter-regional flows and accumulations for different vehicle (private or ride-sourcing) states. This aggregated model is capable to reproduce the dynamics of complex systems without using resource-expensive simulations. We also show that the model can accurately forecast the vehicles’ conditions in near-future predictions (e.g., 30 min ahead). Later, a comparison with benchmark models shows lower errors in the proposed model in all states. Finally, we evaluate the model’s robustness to noises in its inputs, and forecast errors remain below 15% even where inputs are 20% off the actual values for ride-sourcing vehicles. The development of this model prepares the path for developing real-time feedback-based management policies such as priority-based perimeter control or repositioning strategies for idle ride-sourcing vehicles and developing regulations over ride-sourcing in congested areas.",0191-2615,Not found
Work schedule arrangements in two-adult households with children,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102822,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The concept “work schedule arrangement” refers to the decision how many hours per week to work and how to allocate these hours across the days of the week. In two-adult households with children, the work schedule arrangement of parents is more complicated owing to the presence of children, which induces a series of activities that parents need to organize and coordinate. Besides considering personal preferences, parents also need to trade-off between working longer to generate more income and have better promotion opportunities, and working less hours to have enough time to organize and conduct other activities, especially children-related activities. In modeling work schedule arrangements of two-adult households with children, we first develop a random utility model to represent the work schedule decision-making process. It assumes that the utility of work arrangements is not only a function of work duration and other job characteristics, but also of the (joint) time to spend with or take care of the children. We therefore include the state of the children, which indicates the location where they are at any given moment in time (home, school/day care). Under the assumption that households maximize the utility derived from their work schedule, weekly work schedules for each spouse are generated, subject to observed daily and weekly total household and/or individual working hours. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the model, we compare the difference between the generated and observed work schedules of the households. The results show that the model accurately predicts observed work schedules in terms of start time, number of working hours and days of the week.",0191-2615,Not found

Dynamic battery swapping and rebalancing strategies for e-bike sharing systems,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102820,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"A new generation of the e-bike sharing system (EBSS) is emerging, where the e-bikes are dockless but need to be parked in designated zones defined by electric fences. The operation of the EBSS relies on the efficient swapping of batteries, in addition to e-bike rebalancing. The replaced power-deficient batteries can be charged in a central depot or street-side cabinets. This paper proposes an approach for modeling the system states of the EBSS containing e-bike stations and battery cabinet stations based on Markov chain dynamics considering both e-bike number and battery power level. Utilizing the prediction of e-bike inventory levels at e-bike stations and batteries’ status at e-bike stations/battery cabinets, a fast and adaptive one-step Markovian strategy is introduced, informing the operating staff of the next station to visit and detailed operations for battery swapping at e-bike/cabinet stations and rebalancing at e-bike stations. Besides, a rolling-horizon Markovian strategy is proposed to make a globally optimal plan of battery swapping and e-bike rebalancing by solving an integer nonlinear programming problem, which gives an approximate upper bound for integrated operations. By considering future demand and making optimal decisions, the proposed Markovian strategies can achieve a profit improvement of over 20% on average, compared to the current strategy used by the industry, as illustrated by the numerical simulations on a real-world EBSS.",0191-2615,Not found

Ensuring the robustness of link flow observation systems in sensor failure events,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102849,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Network link flow data are an intuitive information for monitoring the traffic condition of the entire network, and can be used to enhance traffic management and control. Link flow observation systems are typically designed using flow conservation equations to obtain the information of flow on unobserved links by inference. The occurrence of sensor failures in such systems may lead to flow information loss on both observed and inferred links. Most studies on this issue have considered sensor deployment and failure evaluation as separate processes. In contrast, in this study, both processes are integrated to establish a link flow observation system that withstands sensor failures. First, we propose a novel model to solve the sensor location problem for full link flow observability. The proposed model is then modified to evaluate the link flow information loss in sensor failure event, and incorporated into a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for the sensor location problem concerned. The DRO model minimizes the worst-case expected information loss of the system during the planning horizon with different types of sensors. Moreover, we extend the DRO model to a target-based version, into which a convex risk measure named Observation fulfillment risk index is introduced to evaluate the risk of failing to meet the predetermined observation target for any sensor installation schemes. The devised models can be directly solved by commercial solvers for networks like Nguyen–Dupuis, and a matheuristic genetic algorithm is designed for large-scale example networks. Numerical experiments are performed for networks with different sizes. The DRO model generates robust sensor location schemes with worst-case performances that are superior to those achieved using benchmark methods, such as stochastic programming. The use of the Observation fulfillment risk index enhances the system stability and target fulfillment level and decreases the standard deviation of the link flow information loss.

We first characterize the dynamic pricing problem with a clear distinction between historical prices and current prices. We then translate our dynamic pricing problem into Markov Decision Process (MDP) and prove the existence of a deterministic stationary optimal policy. Our solutions are based on an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm called twin-delayed deep determinant policy gradient (TD3) that performs offline learning of the optimal pricing policy using historical data and applies the learned policy to the next time slot, e.g., one week.

At the end of the period, the individual credit balance will be settled by the government at a charging (redemption) price for credit deficits (surpluses). From the viewpoint of travelers, we consider their heterogeneity in value of time and characterize their periodic mode usage equilibrium by formulating a decision optimization problem. From the viewpoint of the government, we discuss the design of CCR schemes without and with revenue constraints. We also investigate the Pareto-improvement and revenue-neutrality of CCR schemes.

The main difficulty of the string-based model is that the number of constraints grows with the newly generated flight delay decisions in the variable generation subproblem. Therefore, the traditional column generation method can not be applied directly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a machine learning-based column-and-row generation approach. The machine learning method is used to uncover the critical delay decisions of short through connections in each column-and-row generation iteration by eliminating the poor flight delay decisions.

The source of stochasticity is the uncertainty inherent in the arrival process of the two classes of vehicular flow.

The model has two main components, a probabilistic link model and a probabilistic node model. The link model is a stochastic formulation of the link transmission model (LTM), which captures the boundary conditions of a link and approximates the evolution of link state distribution. The node model, on the other hand, characterizes the flow transmissions across a network node. It reflects the between-link dependency by evaluating the expected transmission flow through an iterative algorithm, with an explicit consideration of the interactions between supply and demand constraints associated with a node. The developed model is validated versus replicated running of the deterministic LTM as well as microscopic traffic simulations, and the results reveal that it yields relatively accurate estimations.

A novel metamodel based on a mixed-integer program (MIP) is formulated. The metamodel is embedded within a general-purpose discrete SO algorithm. The proposed algorithm is validated with synthetic toy network experiments. The algorithm is then applied to a high-dimensional Boston case study using reservation data from a major US car-sharing operator. The method is benchmarked versus several algorithms, including stochastic programming. The experiments indicate that the analytical network model information, provided by the MIP to the SO algorithm, is useful both at the first iteration of the algorithm and across subsequent iterations. The solutions derived by the proposed method are benchmarked versus the solution deployed in the field by the car-sharing operator. Via simulation, the proposed solutions improve those deployed with an average improvement of profit of 6% and of vehicle utilization of 3%. The combination of the problem-specific analytical MIP with a general-purpose SO algorithm enables the discrete SO algorithm to: (i) address high-dimensional problems, (ii) become computationally efficient (i.e., it can identify good quality solutions within few simulation observations), (iii) become robust to the quality of the initial points and of the stochasticity of the simulator. More generally, the information provided by the MIP to the SO algorithm enables it to exploit problem-specific structural information. This leads to an algorithm with both asymptotic convergence guarantees as well as good short term performance (i.e., performance given few simulation observations).

Day-to-day traffic control for networks mixed with regular human-piloted and connected autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102847,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The emerging connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology offers a significant opportunity to address the congestion problem caused by the selfish routing behavior of human drivers. If the transportation management center (TMC) can control the routing of all vehicles on the network, they could easily reverse this effect. However, during the transition period, CAVs will share roads with human-piloted vehicles (HVs). In the era of mixed autonomy, a more realistic scenario is to route the CAVs to lead the traffic state towards the desired equilibrium. We first consider a repeated routing game in which the TMC can control the routes of CAVs to minimize the system travel time, i.e., CAVs follow the system optimal (SO) routing principle. In this manner, we can influence the travel time traversing each link, which indirectly influences HV users’ route choices. As a consequence, HV users may adjust their routes dynamically through day-to-day (DTD) learning to minimize individual travel cost. On the other hand, the SO routing strategy may induce higher travel time for CAVs than HVs within the same origin–destination (OD) pair. To address such inherent unfairness, road pricing is used to influence route choices of HVs to achieve specific supply regulation targets, e.g., traffic restraint. We present qualitative analysis on the stability of the controlled DTD dynamics and the effect of road pricing regarding the unfairness. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to design dynamic pricing schemes for a mixed autonomy system under DTD learning dynamics. We carry out numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control schemes. The cooperative CAVs could reduce the total travel time when the market penetration rate of CAVs reaches the lower minimum control ratio that the network could escape the user equilibrium (UE) condition. When the market penetration rate of CAVs reaches the upper minimum control ratio, the network would achieve SO condition even though there are non-cooperative HVs. On the other hand, the pricing scheme can reduce the unfairness index and total travel time of the network when the market penetration rate of CAVs is low.",0191-2615,Not found
Mathematical modeling of the platform assignment problem in a ride-sourcing market with a third-party integrator,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102833,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"In the rapidly evolving ride-sourcing market, emerging third-party integrators offer passengers the convenience of accessing services from multiple platforms simultaneously. This innovative business model allows a third-party integrator to send ride service requests from passengers to multiple ride-sourcing platforms, ultimately selecting the most desirable one from the ones that respond. In this study, we address the integrator’s platform assignment problem in a ride-sourcing market, taking into account the stochastic nature of passenger waiting times influenced by factors such as the random locations of idle vehicles. Our findings reveal that a third-party integrator, using minimum waiting time as a criterion for platform assignment, can effectively reduce passengers’ generalized trip costs and increase both passenger demand and social welfare under specific moderate conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the waiting time on each platform follows the Weibull distribution with the scale parameter linearly dependent on the number of idle vehicles, the passenger waiting time with an integrator follows the same distribution as merging all platforms into one. Additionally, the probability of a platform being assigned to passengers equals the proportion of its idle vehicles across the entire integrated market under this distribution type. Moreover, we extend the proposed integrator platform assignment model to a scenario where the integrator makes assignments among selected options for passengers. Numerical examples demonstrate that when platforms have identical fares, platforms with smaller fleet sizes are more likely to benefit from integration, while those with larger fleet sizes may experience losses. We further demonstrate that platform competition for trip fares decreases passenger demand and social welfare if passengers cannot choose platform options. However, in cases where passengers have the freedom to select platform options, platform competition increases passenger demand and social welfare.",0191-2615,Not found
The economics of speed choice and control in the presence of driverless vehicle cruising and parking-as-a-substitute-for-cruising,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102834,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The capability of self-driving cars to relocate occupant-free is suggested to become one of the most disruptive yet beneficial features in the era of fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs). One relocation option is cruising: Once arriving at the destination, a traveler may instruct her FAV to circle around to bridge the time span between drop-off and pick-up, implying no need to park at all. This seems promising, given the various inefficiencies associated with parking. In this paper we show that driverless vehicle cruising is accompanied by its own inefficiency and, thus, should be a major issue of concern. By developing and applying an integrated economic equilibrium speed and parking choice model, we identify the counterpart of the classical (negative) cruising-for-parking externality in the world of non-autonomous vehicles, namely a (positive) speeding-when-cruising externality that may occur in the era of self-driving cars. The externality emerges because driverless vehicle cruising entails moving at very low speed, thereby imposing congestion on regular (non-cruising) traffic. We show that when not accounted for by cruising FAVs themselves (e.g.via a Pigouvian speed subsidy), not corrected through regulation (e.g.via speed control) or planning (e.g.via dedicated lanes), the traffic system fails to achieve a socially optimal outcome. When parking-as-a-substitute-for-cruising is feasible and properly priced, a welfare-maximizing speed regulator would enforce cruising speeds that deter travelers from choosing inefficient cruising. In this case, welfare is improved and parking would be even socially desirable (at least in the short term). However, when parking is free and parking externalities are substantial, the transport system features too many parkers, but to limit the efficiency losses in the parking market, socially optimal speed regulation enables cruising too. In that case, the result is a huge welfare loss even with regulation stemming from traditional cruising-for-parking induced by parkers, and road congestion caused by cruisers. Our findings support the idea of adopting economic instruments, planning tools, command-and-control approaches, and parking-as-a-substitute-for-cruising to tackle the potential inefficiencies resulting from driverless vehicle cruising, but also underscore the inappropriateness of parking-as-a-substitute-for-cruising when it is heavily underpriced.",0191-2615,Not found
Optimal network-wide adjustments of initial airport slot allocations with connectivity and fairness objectives,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102801,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Due to serious demand-supply imbalances, many airports around the world are highly congested. Access to these highly congested (Level 3, coordinated) airports is controlled through the use of the IATA World Airport Slot allocation Guidelines (WASG). At an individual airport, slots requested by each airline are allocated at the airport under consideration independently without taking into account the interactions between slots allocated at different airports. However, in order for the air-transport network to operate seamlessly, ensuring network-wide connectivity of flights, and the interdependencies existing between the slots allocated at individual airports need to be considered. Several models have been proposed in the literature to deal with the optimum allocation of slots at a single airport. However, the literature currently does not adequately address the network-wide slot allocation problem. In this paper, we are introducing a novel approach to address the network-wide slot allocation problem. Our approach considers as an input the individual airport schedules generated during the slot allocation process at individual airports and optimally adjusts them to ensure network-wide flight connectivity by taking into account the interdependencies existing between flights connecting pairs of airports. To this end, we propose bi-objective mathematical models, which consider schedule efficiency and inter-airline fairness objectives, and incorporate the importance that different airports have for the functioning of the air transport network, using the IATA connectivity indices and the betweenness centrality measures. We solve the proposed models using the ε − constraint method to investigate trade-offs between network-wide schedule efficiency and fairness, and we investigate the effect of these trade-offs on the airlines and the airports. Results from the application of the proposed models to a test network suggest that the consideration of the contribution of the airports to network connectivity affect the way that the total network-wide schedule displacement is distributed among the airports. Specifically, we found that the use of the IATA connectivity index tends to allocate less schedule displacement to airports with frequent flights to many destinations, while the use of the betweenness centrality measure allocates less schedule displacement to airports that are more critical in ensuring the connectivity of other airports in the network.",0191-2615,Not found
A branch-price-and-cut algorithm for the local container drayage problem with controllable vehicle interference,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102835,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"This paper investigates a local container drayage problem with controllable vehicle interference (LCDP&CVI) under the tractor-and-trailer separation mode in which a tractor can be coupled or decoupled with a trailer at a customer location or a terminal. The container drayage requests proposed by customers should be fulfilled by a set of vehicle fleets, and each vehicle fleet comprises of a certain number of tractors and trailers that should be matched to each other. The controllable vehicle interference (CVI) means that the routes of any tractors from different vehicle fleets are independent of each other, implying that the interference between tractors is restricted only to the tractors from the same vehicle fleets. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for the LCDP&CVI. To exactly solve the problem, we develop a branch-price-and-cut algorithm based on the reformation of the MILP model, including a master problem and a pricing sub-problem. The pricing sub-problem that deals with the temporal synchronization constraints is formulated as the multi-vehicle shortest path problem with interference. By adding the tractor to the temporal-spatial network, a new representation of the pricing sub-problem is constructed, which enables us to solve the sub-problem by the multi-label method. In addition, the symmetrical elimination and dominance rules are incorporated into the multi-label method to enhance its effectiveness. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model and solution algorithm. For small-scale instances, the proposed solution algorithm is able to solve instances with up to 24 requests to optimality within two hours, which outperforms significantly the commercial MILP solver in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. For large-scale instances, the proposed algorithm can yield competitive solutions that are superior to the heuristic algorithms reported in the literature. Our experimental results also show that the controllable vehicle mechanism can strike a good balance between computational efficiency and operational costs by meticulously designing the structure of vehicle fleets.",0191-2615,Not found

To capture the dynamic arrival feature and real-time acceptance/rejection decision of the booking request, we formulate the DCSAP as a dynamic programming (DP) model with the objective of maximizing the total revenues generated by accepted container booking requests over the entire booking horizon. Due to the well-known curse of dimensionality of solving a DP model, we develop a series of models to transform the intractable DP model into a solvable approximate linear programming (ALP) model.

A flexible train composition strategy with extra-long trains for high-speed railway corridors with time-varying demand,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102875,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"To accommodate the uneven spatio-temporal distribution of passenger demand and improve the maximum transportation capacity for high-speed railway (HSR) corridors, this study proposes a demand-oriented flexible train composition strategy. The proposed strategy allows flexibility in selecting the number of train composition units (e.g., train carriages) for each train to accommodate the demand variations, where extra-long trains (longer than the length of the train station platform) might be utilized. Under such a strategy, a seat allocation method coupled with a train stopping position control strategy is proposed to avoid the need for cross-carriage walking during passenger boarding or alighting (for those extra-long trains). The train stopping position control strategy specifies the carriages that dock at or extend beyond the station platform, while the seat allocation method allocates seats within each carriage to specific origin-destination pairs. The studied problem can be formulated as an integer nonlinear programming model, where the weighted sum of the HSR operating cost and passenger travel time cost is minimized. The proposed model is then reformulated into an integer linear programming model via a series of linearization techniques. A tailored heuristic algorithm based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) and GUROBI solver is designed to produce high-quality solutions for large-scale problems. Two numerical examples, i.e., a small example and a real-world Shanghai-Hangzhou HSR line example, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computation results show that, in comparison to traditional fixed and flexible train composition strategies without extra-long trains, the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the total operating cost and total travel time cost.",0191-2615,Not found
Dynamic spatio-temporal interactive clustering strategy for free-floating bike-sharing,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102872,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"As an important part of green travel mode, operation service of bike-sharing system is increasingly intelligent and refined. Operators can effectively match supply to demand through reasonable delivery and rebalancing methods. One of the most important foundations of these strategies is zone management. Therefore, this paper establishes a new framework of management area division, which includes three parts: data reconstruction, clustering model and model performance. Firstly, we reconstruct the original demand data through Coarse Grain and Visibility Graph methods. The reconstructed data highlights the characteristics of demand fluctuation and filters the noise. Secondly, we build a new spatio-temporal interactive clustering model. Through time dimension clustering analysis, we not only divide the clustering window, but also give three types of temporal labels of the demand series. At the same time, we give the clustering results of spatial dimensions. We interact the spatial clustering results of the demand series with the temporal labels under the combination of the Integration and Constraint criterions in each clustering window. Thirdly, we use the information entropy index to measure the stability of the clustering results and compares the distance cost of rebalancing before and after clustering. Empirical results show that after the spatio-temporal interaction clustering, demand fluctuation in each cluster has high consistency and stability in both time and space dimensions. The average information entropy not only decreases by more than 69 % compared with the results before clustering, but also smaller than the average level of merging without spatio-temporal interaction. Moreover, the rebalancing cost after spatio-temporal interactive clustering is only 61.26 % of the actual rebalancing cost. This helps operators give more efficient rebalancing strategies and more stable rebalancing routing than before.",0191-2615,Not found
Integrated scheduling optimization of AGV and double yard cranes in automated container terminals,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102871,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Double yard cranes in one yard block refer to two yard cranes that run in different rails and can pass each other.

Deep hybrid model with satellite imagery: How to combine demand modeling and computer vision for travel behavior analysis?,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102869,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Classical demand modeling analyzes travel behavior using only low-dimensional numeric data (i.e. sociodemographics and travel attributes) but not high-dimensional urban imagery. However, travel behavior depends on the factors represented by both numeric data and urban imagery, thus necessitating a synergetic framework to combine them. This study creates a theoretical framework of deep hybrid models consisting of a mixing operator and a behavioral predictor, thus integrating the numeric and imagery data for travel behavior analysis. Empirically, this framework is applied to analyze travel mode choice using the Chicago MyDailyTravel Survey as the numeric inputs and the satellite images as the imagery inputs. We found that deep hybrid models significantly outperform both classical demand models and deep learning models in predicting aggregate and disaggregate travel behavior. The deep hybrid models can reveal spatial clusters with meaningful sociodemographic associations in the latent space. The models can also generate new satellite images that do not exist in reality and compute the corresponding economic information, such as substitution patterns and social welfare. Overall, the deep hybrid models demonstrate the complementarity between the low-dimensional numeric and high-dimensional imagery data and between the traditional demand modeling and recent deep learning. They enrich the family of hybrid demand models by using deep architecture as the latent space and enabling researchers to conduct associative analysis for sociodemographics, travel decisions, and generated satellite imagery. Future research could address the limitations in interpretability, robustness, and transferability, and propose new methods to further enrich the deep hybrid models.",0191-2615,Not found

We then conduct a local stability analysis of each type when density, demand and the unit travel time (inverse speed) evolve gradually and simultaneously according to dynamical systems of differential equations. Some hypercongested equilibria may be stable when demand adjusts quickly enough to congestion. Other hypercongested equilibria, which have counterintuitive comparative statics, are never stable.

Optimal investments of port authorities facing ambiguity on uncertain market demands,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102856,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This study explores how two competing port authorities facing ambiguity about uncertain market demands determine their optimal investments. Using the Choquet expected utility function, the port authorities are categorized into four types: ambiguity-averse and risk-averse, ambiguity-neutral and risk-averse, ambiguity-averse and risk-neutral, and ambiguity-neutral and risk-neutral. Each type can reach equilibria through no-port investing, only-one-port investing, or both-port investing. Our findings indicate that considering ambiguity does not alter the types of equilibrium investments for port authorities, regardless of their risk aversion or neutrality. However, the emergence of equilibrium investments for each type is affected by the consideration of ambiguity. Specifically, when risk-neutral port authorities transition from ambiguity-neutral to ambiguity-averse, they will invest more (less) if they are optimistic (pessimistic) enough. Nevertheless, this relationship may not apply to risk-averse port authorities, as the magnitudes of the first to the fourth moments of probability distributions, which maximize and minimize the expected utility of ports, also impact their investment decisions. Importantly, our results hold true even when ports exhibit ambiguity-loving characteristics, possess distinct ambiguity or risk attitudes, consider Knight uncertainty, or compete in prices.",0191-2615,Not found
Carsharing equitable relocation problem: A two-stage stochastic programming approach with learning-embedded endogenous uncertainty in demand,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102868,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Uncertain demand may exacerbate the imbalance of the supply–demand for a one-way carsharing system and complicate vehicle relocation decisions. To consider the effect of the uncertainty, this study proposes a two-stage stochastic nonlinear programming model, integrating long-term and short-term decisions and maximizing the profit of the carsharing companies. Specifically, in the first stage, tactical decisions of fleet sizing and initial vehicle distribution are determined before the realization of the uncertain demand. Operational decisions of both operator-based and user-based relocation are optimized in the second stage. Moreover, this paper first studies the user-based relocation incentives, which affect the distribution of uncertain demand with an endogenous relationship. A learning-embedded optimization method is introduced to learn such a distribution, enabling the decision-making optimization model to achieve higher performance under the guidance of the demand uncertainty. Second, we envision an equitable relocation issue that considers an uneven distribution of the unsatisfied demand with two different equity criteria measured from the aspects of stations and OD pairs, respectively. Third, the large problem scale, the nonlinear objective function and constraints, and the endogenous demand uncertainty constitute the nontrivial challenges to the feasible solution. For solving the problem efficiently, we linearize the nonlinear terms and develop a dedicated two-phase solution algorithm with a learning-embedded trust-region method in phase I to solve the continuous relaxation problem and a mixed-integer linear programming guided iterative rounding in phase II to obtain the integer solutions of carsharing operations.

In this study, we establish a novel route choice model, named the paired combinatorial weibit (PCW) model, to capture the route overlap and route-specific perception variance. The PCW model retains a closed-form probability solution, which allows the development of an equivalent mathematical programming (MP) formulation for the PCW-based stochastic user equilibrium (PCW-SUE) model. Specifically, we propose two equivalent MP formulations for modeling the fixed demand (FD) and elastic demand (ED), named PCW-SUE-FD and PCW-SUE-ED, respectively.

Statistical inference of travelers’ route choice preferences with system-level data,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102853,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Traditional network models encapsulate travel behavior among all origin–destination pairs based on a simplified and generic travelers’ utility function. Typically, the utility function consists of travel time solely, and its coefficients are equated to estimates obtained from discrete choice models and stated preference data. While this modeling strategy is reasonable, the inherent sampling bias in individual-level experimental data may be further amplified over network flow aggregation, leading to inaccurate flow estimates. In addition, individual-level data must be collected from surveys or travel diaries, which may be labor-intensive, costly, and limited to a small time horizon. To address these limitations, this study extends classical bi-level formulations to estimate travelers’ utility functions with multiple attributes using system-level data. This data tends to be less subject to sampling bias than individual-level data, it is cheaper to collect and it has become increasingly diverse and available. To leverage system-level data, we formulate a methodology grounded on non-linear least squares to statistically infer travelers’ utility function in the network context using traffic counts, traffic speeds, the number of traffic incidents, and sociodemographic information obtained from the US Census, among other attributes. The analysis of the mathematical properties of the optimization problem and its pseudo-convexity motivates the use of normalized gradient descent, an algorithm developed in the machine learning community that is suitable for pseudo-convex programs. More importantly, we develop a hypothesis test framework to examine the statistical properties of coefficients attached to utility terms and to perform attribute selection. Experiments on synthetic data show that the travelers’ utility function coefficients can be consistently recovered and that hypothesis tests are reliable statistics to identify which attributes are determinants of travelers’ route choices. Besides, a series of Monte-Carlo experiments showed that statistical inference is robust to various levels of sensor coverage and to noises in the Origin-Destination matrix and the traffic count measurements.

While retaining the closed-form probability expression, the proposed model handles the oddball alternative using a multiplicative random disutility function assuming Weibull distributed random components. The proposed model thus allows disutility-dependent perception variances of both the conventional and oddball alternatives and a flexible variance ratio between them, which are effective to reflect the way how individuals perceive varying magnitudes of travel disutility from different attributes. This gives the proposed model more flexibility to consider various heterogeneity issues, including the heterogeneous perceptions of conventional alternatives, heterogeneous perceptions of unique and common attributes of the oddball alternative, and heterogeneous features of conventional and oddball alternatives. The empirical application of the proposed model is explored to highlight its practical performance. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in the choice contexts where both oddball effect and heterogeneity issues need to be considered.

According to the independently and identically distributed (IID) assumption, the MNL model cannot account for the route similarity and user heterogeneity. This study provides a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation by incorporating a newly developed paired combinatorial weibit (PCW) model to relax the IID assumption for determining the optimal P&R facility location.

In addition, using the Weibull distribution permits the consideration of heterogeneous perception variance. Its two-level tree structure for evaluating the marginal and conditional probabilities allows a linearization scheme to obtain a set of linear constraints. Numerical examples reveal the influence of the IID assumption relaxation on the results. The two probabilities from the tree structure and the binary location variables are combined to present a corresponding PCW model under open/close P&R facility solution.

Delay-throughput tradeoffs for signalized networks with finite queue capacity,10.1016/j.trb.2023.102876,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Network-level adaptive signal control is an effective way to reduce delay and increase network throughput. However, in the face of asymmetric exogenous demand, the increase of network performance via adaptive signal control alone is at the expense of service fairness (i.e., phase actuation fairness and network resource utilization fairness). In addition, for oversaturated networks, arbitrary adaptive signal control seems to have little effect on improving network performance. Therefore, under the assumption that the mean routing proportions/turn ratios of vehicles at intersections are fixed, this study investigates the problem of optimally allocating input rates to entry links and simultaneously finding a stabilizing signal control policy with phase fairness. We model the stochastic optimization problem of maximizing network throughput subject to network stability (i.e., all queue lengths have finite means) and average phase actuation constraints to bridge the gap between stochastic network stability control and convex optimization. Moreover, we further propose a micro-level joint admission and bounded signal control algorithm to achieve network stability and throughput optimization simultaneously. Joint control is implemented in a fully decomposed and distributed manner. For any arrival rate, joint control provably achieves network throughput within O ( 1 / V ) of optimality while trading off average delay with O ( V ) , where V is an adjusted control parameter. Through a comparative simulation of a real network with 256 O-D pairs, the proposed joint control keeps network throughput at maximum, guarantees service fairness, and fully utilizes network capacity (i.e., increases network throughput by 17.54%).",0191-2615,Not found

Ship risk profile (SRP) is currently the most common method of quantifying ship risk, but the thresholds of the factors that determine a ship’s risk and classification in the SRP framework are subjective and can make the ship selection process less efficient. In this study we propose a data-driven bi-objective nonlinear programming model, referred to as the SRP+ model, to optimize the thresholds in the original SRP framework. To solve the model, we first linearize the nonlinear optimization model using the big-M method, and then develop an augmented epsilon-constraint method to transform the bi-objective model to a single-objective model and obtain all Pareto optimal solutions. We also conduct a case study using real PSC inspection records at the Hong Kong port to construct and validate the SRP+ model. The results suggest that the threshold of the total weighting points to classify a ship as high-risk ship should be slightly increased, the thresholds of ship age should be significantly increased, the threshold of historical deficiency number should be increased, while the threshold of historical ship detention times should be decreased. The proposed SRP+ model can benefit both conservative and open-minded port authority decision makers by identifying ships with more deficiencies and/or higher detention probability more efficiently. The model can also be applied to other risk management problems in transportation and supply chain management, in addition to the maritime transport domain.",0191-2615,Not found
Single-leg shipping revenue management for expedited services with ambiguous elasticity in transit-time-sensitive demand,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102886,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The growing demand for expedited shipping services from transit-time-sensitive (TTS) shippers poses a dilemma for ocean carriers, who must navigate the trade-off between transit time and the associated fuel costs. Charging a premium for expedited services offers a potential solution, but it requires careful consideration to avoid detrimental effects on demand. This study focuses on single-leg shipping revenue management (S-SRM) to optimize the pricing strategies of ocean carriers, which simplifies complex real-world phenomena, provides a concise representation of the underlying mechanism, and forms a foundation for multi-leg shipping revenue management. Specifically, the study addresses the challenge faced by ocean carriers when they possess partial prior knowledge about the distribution of shippers’ willingness to pay for expedited services on a single shipping leg. By developing a model that captures the TTS demand and accounts for uncertainties in shippers’ willingness to pay, the analysis explores various decision-making approaches under uncertainty, such as maximax, maximin, and the Hurwicz criterion. Leveraging the insights gained from the TTS demand model, the study derives closed-form solutions to optimize pricing strategies, shedding light on the intricacies of the S-SRM problem. In addition, we investigate the tramp shipping fixture and the joint optimization of sailing speed and freight rate. The practical application of the proposed model is further demonstrated through a case study of salmon transportation using a reefer vessel, highlighting its relevance in different scenarios.",0191-2615,Not found
Continuum dynamic traffic models with novel local route-choice strategies for urban cities,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102888,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In dynamic traffic assignment problems, travelers choose routes that minimize their cost of traveling to their destination. In traditional continuum models, travelers have a global perception of traffic; in this study, two novel reactive route-choice strategies are devised in which travelers have a local perception of traffic. In Strategy A, travelers identify a set of feasible temporary destinations that are equidistant from their final destination, and then choose an optimal path within the local perception region that minimizes their cost of traveling to the temporary destination set. In Strategy B, travelers identify a direct path that they can follow to move closer to their final destination within a short, fixed time. These route-choice strategies are used to formulate complete continuum dynamic models for traffic flows in an urban city that consist of a conservation law and a set of eikonal equations or optimization problems involving ordinary differential equations. High-order numerical schemes and suitable solution algorithms are applied to solve these equations on unstructured triangular meshes.

This problem has many real-world application contexts such as the emerging on-demand transportation and logistics services (e.g., ridesharing, customized buses). The lower bounds of the expected optimal tour length are analytically derived by considering a so-called “trapping effect”, which explicitly addresses probabilistically the situation that some of the tour legs must connect points that are not neighbors. A parametric approach is developed to estimate the expected optimal tour length for both Euclidean and rectilinear metrics.

Autonomous Vehicles: Moral dilemmas and adoption incentives,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102894,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In unavoidable traffic accidents, autonomous vehicles (AVs) face the dilemma of protecting either the passenger(s) or third parties. Recent studies show that, in accidents involving an AV, most people prefer the AV to behave such that it minimizes expected harm. At the same time, however, they are more willing to adopt an AV if it prioritizes the passenger(s), i.e. themselves. A regulator therefore needs to set a rather high level of driver protection in order to increase the market penetration of AVs. Using a game-theoretic model, we analyze how the second-best optimal level of AV passenger protection depends on (i) the AV safety advantage, (ii) the intensity of drivers’ other-regarding preferences, and (iii) the (preference) cost of AV adoption. We show that a higher AV safety advantage may either increase or decrease the second best optimal level of AV driver/passenger protection. In an extension, we find that increasing the degree of driver protection has the additional benefit of leading to higher care levels of other road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.",0191-2615,Not found
A branch-and-cut algorithm for scheduling train platoons in urban rail networks,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102891,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"With the emerging of virtual coupling technologies, the concept of train platoon, where different vehicles can be flexibly and dynamically grouped or decoupled, has become a hot research topic. In this study, we investigate the scheduling of train platoons for urban rail networks with time-dependent demand to mitigate passenger inconvenience. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that simultaneously optimizes the train-platoon (de)coupling strategies, arrival/departure times at each station, and the running orders of trains, while considering limited rolling stock resources at the depots and the safety of trains at cross-line zones. To tackle computational challenges in real-world instances, we develop a customized branch-and-cut solution algorithm, based on the analysis of mathematical properties of our MILP model, to generate (near-)optimal solutions more efficiently. In particular, we propose three sets of valid inequalities that are dynamically added to the model to strengthen the linear relaxation bounds at each node. We also design a customized branching rule in the search tree by imposing to branch on the key decision variables regarding the train orders at the cross-line zones. Real-world case studies based on the operational data of Beijing metro network are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results demonstrate that our branch-and-cut-based approach evidently outperforms commercial solvers in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Compared to the current train schedule with fixed compositions in practice, our approach with flexible coupling strategies can reduce the passenger dissatisfaction by over 15%.",0191-2615,Not found
The dry dock scheduling problem,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102893,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Dry docks are essential facilities for ship maintenance and thus are critical assets of a shipyard. In this paper, we study a dry dock scheduling problem that arises from shipyard operations and management. The problem involves decisions on assigning ships to a set of dry docks and sequencing the ships in each dry dock, subject to complicated but realistic operational constraints such as parallel ship service, sequence-dependent setup times, and compatibility between ships and dry docks, to minimize the total departure tardiness cost of ships. Because accurate ship service times are not available until ships have been mounted on the placing blocks of dry docks and have undergone detailed inspections, the uncertainty of ship service times should be taken into account in dry dock scheduling. The structure of the problem enables us to develop a two-stage robust optimization model to capture ship service time uncertainty. We show that given the first-stage decisions, i.e., ship assignment and sequencing, the optimal second-stage decisions, i.e., the service start times, setup times, service times, and departure tardiness of the ships in the worst-case scenario, can be obtained by a dynamic programming algorithm that runs in pseudo-polynomial time. We incorporate this dynamic programming algorithm into an iterative solution method to generate an optimal solution to the two-stage robust optimization model. Through computational experiments on problem instances generated from the operational data of a shipyard in Singapore, we show that the robust optimization approach ensures the shipyard operator’s resilience against uncertain ship service times and significantly outperforms the current practice for dry dock scheduling.",0191-2615,Not found
A bathtub model of transit congestion,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102892,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Studies of transit dwell times suggest that the delay caused by passengers boarding and alighting rises with the number of passengers on each vehicle. This paper incorporates such a “friction effect” into an isotropic model of a transit route with elastic demand. We derive a strongly unimodal “Network Alighting Function” giving the steady-state rate of passenger flows in terms of the accumulation of passengers on vehicles. Like the Network Exit Function developed for isotropic models of vehicle traffic, the system may exhibit hypercongestion. Since ridership depends on travel times, wait times and the level of crowding, the physical model is used to solve for (possibly multiple) equilibria as well as the social optimum. Using replicator dynamics to describe the evolution of demand, we also investigate the asymptotic local stability of different kinds of equilibria.",0191-2615,Not found
Weighting strategies for pairwise composite marginal likelihood estimation in case of unbalanced panels and unaccounted autoregressive structure of the errors,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102890,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Composite Marginal Likelihood (CML) estimation and its advancements are popular ways to reduce the computational burden involved in the estimation of Multinomial Probit (MNP) models. CMLs use the product of marginal likelihoods of decision makers instead of the complete joint likelihood, reducing the numerical load. This allows for the estimation of models for larger and more complex data sets. The definition of the CML involves power weights on the marginal likelihoods that influence the statistical properties of the estimator. In this paper, we discuss how to effectively use the power weights in the cases of (1) unbalanced panel settings, where the weights help to reduce the variance of the estimator, and (2) unaccounted autoregressive structure of the errors, where the weights help to reduce the asymptotic bias of the estimator due to misspecification.",0191-2615,Not found
Phase transitions of the price-of-anarchy function in multi-commodity routing games,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102922,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"We consider the behavior of the price of anarchy and equilibrium flows in nonatomic multi-commodity routing games as a function of the traffic demand. We analyze their smoothness with a special attention to specific values of the demand at which the support of the Wardrop equilibrium exhibits a phase transition with an abrupt change in the set of optimal routes. Typically, when such a phase transition occurs, the price of anarchy function has a breakpoint, i.e., is not differentiable. We prove that, if the demand varies proportionally across all commodities, then, at a breakpoint, the largest left or right derivatives of the price of anarchy and of the social cost at equilibrium, are associated with the smaller equilibrium support. This proves – under the assumption of proportional demand – a conjecture of O’Hare et al. (2016), who observed this behavior in simulations. We also provide counterexamples showing that this monotonicity of the one-sided derivatives may fail when the demand does not vary proportionally, even if it moves along a straight line not passing through the origin.",0191-2615,Not found
Distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization for the integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102923,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In this paper, we are the first to propose a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) optimization model for the integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem (BACAP) in container terminals. In contrast to the classical deterministic BACAP model, we consider the arrival time to be uncertain due to the frequent arrival delays in ports. We then impose a chance constraint that the service time must start after the uncertain arrival time with a probability of at least 1 − ϵ , where 1 − ϵ represents the target service level in container terminals ( ϵ represents the target risk tolerance of the port manager). Under the moment-based ambiguity set, we reformulate the DRCC model into a mixed integer semi-definite programming (MISDP) model. Additionally, we develop an efficient decomposition branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the MISDP model and obtain the exact solution. Fortunately, a special case of the DRCC model arises when the mean and covariance utilized in the ambiguity set are precise, allowing for the transformation of the DRCC model into a mixed integer programming (MIP) model. This conversion significantly reduces the complexity of the problem. Impressively, the solving time of the MISDP model with the decomposition branch-and-bound algorithm is comparable to that of the transformed MIP model. The numerical results show that our model can achieve a schedule with high service at low cost. Meanwhile, we have made an intriguing discovery that the correlation between the target risk tolerance and the actual service level can be depicted as a staircase function regardless of the datasets. This finding offers crucial insights for port management, enabling them to strike a balance between the cost and actual service level by determining an appropriate target service level.",0191-2615,Not found
Macroscopic modeling of mixed bi-modal urban networks: A hybrid model of accumulation- and trip-based principles,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102921,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Network-level traffic flow models either assume steady-state urban flows (i.e. accumulation-based models) or track the movement of all vehicles (i.e. trip-based models). The steady-state assumption present in the accumulation-based models may pose a challenge in light of the multi-modal nature of urban flows. It might be indeed a rough assumption for the flow of some transportation modes like buses, cruising-for-parking vehicles, taxis, and on-demand vehicles. Trip-based models address this concern, however, they need significant parameter calibration effort and are not computationally efficient, which substantially reduces the practicality of these models in real-world applications. Nevertheless, despite the critical importance of developing multi-modal traffic flow models, few attempts have been made to investigate these models in network macroscopic fundamental diagram (NMFD)-related literature. This paper bridges this gap by developing a hybrid network-level traffic flow model for mixed bi-modal (i.e. car and bus) networks. The present hybrid model reproduces the dynamics of car flows via accumulation-based model principles while tracking the movement of buses using the trip-based model. This effort also includes the development of a new FIFO-based entrance function to ensure different modes experience the same delay under saturated traffic conditions. Different numerical experiments are conducted to study the hybrid model performance and to compare it with that of accumulation-based and trip-based models in both steady-state and transition periods under different traffic conditions. Our observations reveal that the hybrid model simulates the dynamics of cars and buses by closely following the behavior of its components under free-flow conditions. The model also outperforms the accumulation-based model under saturated traffic conditions while being considerably less demanding than the trip-based model. A further investigation of the model performance is performed for networks with different bus shares in both free-flow and saturated traffic conditions, confirming the results of the initial numerical experiments. The hybrid model’s computational efficiency is demonstrated. The potential real-world applications of the hybrid model in development of bi-modal network-level simulation models, NMFD-based control strategies along with bus space allocation policies, public transport operation problems, modeling of cruising-for-parking vehicles, taxis, and on-demand vehicles, and modeling and application of autonomous modular vehicles are discussed and future research directions are highlighted.",0191-2615,Not found
Self-financing roads under coarse tolling and preference heterogeneity,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102909,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"We consider whether a road is self-financing under flat or step tolling and optimized bottleneck capacity while incorporating preference heterogeneity and price-sensitive demand. Previous work has shown that a sufficient condition for the toll revenue to equal the capacity cost is that the toll equals the marginal external costs (MECs) of all types of users at all their travel moments. However, under ‘ratio’ heterogeneity between the value of time (VOT) and values of schedule delay, a coarse toll must differ from the heterogeneous MECs. We expand the literature by showing that the capacity rule also has a second-best correction: the capacity is set higher than following the first-best rule to reduce the distortion from overpricing High-VOT users. This issue has been ignored in previous work and makes self-financing less likely than previously thought, but it can still occur if Low-VOT users are much more price sensitive than High-VOT users. In our numerical model, the Low-VOT type must be almost twice as price sensitive as the High-VOT type for there not to be a loss, and, typically, there is a 0 % to 10 % loss. Nevertheless, imposing self-financing only causes a tiny welfare loss. We also discuss other forms of heterogeneity. Under proportional heterogeneity, the self-financing result holds as the coarse toll equals the homogeneous MEC. Under heterogeneity in the preferred arrival time, the self-financing typically also holds.",0191-2615,Not found
Autonomous vehicles policy and safety investment: An equilibrium analysis with endogenous demand,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102908,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The safety concerns for autonomous vehicles (AV) are shown to be a roadblock to their adoption. This paper addresses these concerns by studying a unified, game-theoretic framework (leader–follower game) of mixed traffic in which AVs and human-driven vehicles (HV) coexist, with endogenous vehicle demand and different types of accidents emerging in mixed traffic as crucial building blocks. We study the interaction between three types of players: (i) a policymaker, who decides on the liability regime and the level of V2I connectivity infrastructure, (ii) an AV producer, who decides on the AV price and safety level, and (iii) consumers, who differ in their preference for each vehicle type and choose the one they like best. Using both analytical and numerical tools, we analyze how the two policy variables, liability and V2I connectivity, affect behavior on the demand and supply side of the vehicle market and, in turn, AV market penetration and overall road safety. We also characterize optimal policies, thereby taking into account the market participants’ behavioral responses. Our findings provide guidance for a fast adoption of AVs and a smooth transition from existing traffic conditions to a mixed traffic environment, and assist in decision making for policymakers, legal agencies, traffic operation and transportation planning agencies, as well as car manufacturers.",0191-2615,Not found

We show that the Integrator platform, whose structure alleviates harmful price externalities with two operators, such that it everywhere welfare dominates the Free-Market, can also limit beneficial competitive forces with more operators, reversing this welfare ordering. This is important since M a a S envisages platforms bringing together multiple operators and services in practice. However, calibrations show that where the Integrator platform fails to outperform the Free-Market (with higher operator numbers and lower substitutability), a new platform-based model that we introduce, is optimal. Furthermore, the Integrator is promoted in welfare terms in the presence of non-trivial marginal costs and mid- to high-end market demand elasticities, conditions both consistent with the inclusion in the M a a S journey mix of taxi cabs and other on-demand services which are common-place in M a a S offerings. We also introduce a number of extensions to the modelling framework incorporating additional real network characteristics. Though this can result in the welfare supremacy of the Integrator relative to the Free-Market being undermined, it again tends to be restored under mid- to high-range market elasticity calibrations. Finally, profit incentives tend to neither align across platform providers and operators, nor promote the welfare-best regime, indicating potential for regulatory oversight.",0191-2615,Not found
"Ring road investment, cordon tolling, and urban spatial structure",10.1016/j.trb.2024.102905,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Ring roads, as candidate cordons, provide a convenient condition for implementing cordon tolling schemes. This paper presents a methodology for investigating the ring road investment and cordon tolling problems in a congested ring-radial city. A two-dimensional urban system equilibrium for a ring-radial city is first formulated, in which interrelated equilibria among stakeholders, including the authorities, property developers, households and commuters, are explicitly considered. Two social welfare maximization models for optimizing the ring road investment and cordon tolling schemes, a short-sighted and a far-sighted one, are then proposed. In the short-sighted model, the ring road investment decision is first made, and then the cordon tolling scheme is optimized based on the determined ring road locations as candidate cordons. However, in the far-sighted model, a simultaneous decision of the ring road investment and cordon tolling is made. The proposed models explicitly incorporate the estimation of the intra-area travel. A case study applied to the city network of Chengdu China shows that ring road investment and cordon tolling can reshape the urban spatial structure as a result of the tug-of-war between the dispersion effects due to ring road investment and the concentration effects due to cordon tolling. The far-sighted solution entails building more ring roads than the short-sighted solution, and is closer to the social optimum solution. Whether all ring roads are tolled, or just one, the far-sighted solution yields an appreciably higher welfare gain. The optimal single-cordon tolling scheme performs nearly as well as the optimal multi-cordon tolling scheme in terms of the social welfare.

Instead of complete failures, we allow the disrupted relief facilities only lose part of their capacity. To deal with the uncertainties, we propose a two-stage recoverable robust optimization model, where the location decision of relief facilities, the allocation decision of delivering relief supplies from relief facilities to affected areas, the transfer decision of transporting casualties from affected areas to rescue centers etc are defined in two stages where the first-stage solution should be robust against the possible effects of a disaster that are revealed in the second stage, and the second-stage solution involves some recovery actions, which we term as multi-mitigation strategies: re-opening and re-operation, re-allocation, and relief supply sharing, to mitigate the effects. To solve the model to optimality, we develop a nested two-stage decomposition algorithm that iterates between a master problem considering only a subset of disaster scenarios solved by a Benders decomposition algorithm that incorporates some non-trivial acceleration strategies, and an adversarial separation problem that identifies disaster scenarios to enhance the worst-case recovery cost of the master problem. We introduce some warm-start techniques to accelerate the convergence of the solution algorithm.

A new flexible and partially monotonic discrete choice model,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102947,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The poor predictability and the misspecification arising from hand-crafted utility functions are common issues in theory-driven discrete choice models (DCMs). Data-driven DCMs improve predictability through flexible utility specifications, but they do not address the misspecification issue and provide untrustworthy behavioral interpretations (e.g., biased willingness to pay estimates). Improving interpretability at the minimum loss of flexibility/predictability is the main challenge in the data-driven DCM. To this end, this study proposes a flexible and partially monotonic DCM by specifying the systematic utility using the Lattice networks (i.e., DCM-LN). DCM-LN ensures the monotonicity of the utility function relative to the selected attributes while learning attribute-specific non-linear effects through piecewise linear functions and interaction effects using multilinear interpolations in a data-driven manner. Partial monotonicity could be viewed as domain-knowledge-based regularization to prevent overfitting, consequently avoiding incorrect signs of the attribute effects. The light architecture and an automated process to write monotonicity constraints make DCM-LN scalable and translatable to practice. The proposed DCM-LN is benchmarked against deep neural network-based DCM (i.e., DCM-DNN) and a DCM with a hand-crafted utility in a simulation study. While DCM-DNN marginally outperforms DCM-LN in predictability, DCM-LN highly outperforms all considered models in interpretability, i.e., recovering willingness to pay at individual and population levels. The empirical study verifies the balanced interpretability and predictability of DCM-LN. With superior interpretability and high predictability, DCM-LN lays out new pathways to harmonize the theory-driven and data-driven paradigms.",0191-2615,Not found

Flow-based observations were mapped to the link flow variables in the frequency-based passenger assignment model, and individual-based observations were mapped to the passenger space-time trajectory variables in the schedule-based passenger assignment model. To estimate the consistent internal states of the system between path choice and space-time trajectory, we formulated the coupling path flow constraint, which serves as a bridge between flow-based and individual-based decision variables. A general least-squares estimation framework was developed to integrate the path choice estimation in a frequency-based passenger assignment model and the space-time trajectory estimation in schedule-based passenger assignment with coupling constraints.

The proposed ILP model is a set partitioning-based model with only one type of important duty selection variable that connects the two-level problem and circumvents the drawbacks of conventional approaches that usually formulate the crew scheduling and rostering problems separately and couple these two problems through linking constraints. This study demonstrates that the structure of the underlying network used to model the problem enables the development of an effective, heuristic branch-and-price procedure. The study compares the proposed approach with two other decomposition methods, namely Lagrangian relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), on problems of different sizes and shows that the method provides lower bounds that are on average 16.4% better than Lagrangian relaxation and 5.03% better than ADMM, respectively. Furthermore, the study shows that, with an average optimality gap of 3.28%, the proposed approach obtains high-quality integer solutions to the integrated problem.",0191-2615,Not found
Regulating for-hire autonomous vehicles for an equitable multimodal transportation network,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102925,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"This paper assesses the equity impacts of for-hire autonomous vehicles (AVs) and investigates regulatory policies that promote spatial and social equity in future autonomous mobility ecosystems. To this end, we consider a multimodal transportation network, where a ride-hailing platform operates a fleet of AVs to offer mobility-on-demand services in competition with a public transit agency that offers transit services on a transportation network. A game-theoretic model is developed to characterize the intimate interactions between the ride-hailing platform, the transit agency, and multiclass passengers with distinct income levels. An algorithm is proposed to compute the Nash equilibrium of the game and conduct an ex-post evaluation of the performance of the obtained solution. Based on the proposed framework, we evaluate the spatial and social equity in mobility benefits using the Theil index, and find that although the proliferation of for-hire AVs in the ride-hailing network improves overall mobility, the benefits are not fairly distributed among distinct locations or population groups, implying that the deployment of AVs will enlarge the existing spatial and social inequity gaps in the transportation network if no regulatory intervention is in place. To address this concern, we investigate two regulatory policies that can improve transport equity: (a) a minimum service-level requirement on ride-hailing services, which improves the spatial equity in the transport network; (b) a subsidy on transit services by taxing ride-hailing services, which promotes the use of public transit and improves the spatial and social equity of the transport network. We show that the minimum service-level requirement entails a trade-off: as a higher minimum service level is imposed, the spatial inequity reduces, but the social inequity will be exacerbated. On the other hand, subsidies on transit services improve mobility for low-income households in underserved areas. In certain regimes, the subsidy increases public transit ridership and simultaneously bridges spatial and social inequity gaps. These results are validated through realistic numerical studies for San Francisco.",0191-2615,Not found
Towards a multimodal charging network: Joint planning of charging stations and battery swapping stations for electrified ride-hailing fleets,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102928,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"This paper considers a multimodal charging network in which charging stations and battery swapping stations are jointly built to support an electric ride-hailing fleet synergistically. Our argument is based on the observation that charging an EV is a time-consuming burden, and battery swapping faces scaling issues due to its deployment costs. However, charging stations are cost-effective, making them ideal for scaling up EV fleets, while battery swapping stations offer quick turnaround and can be deployed in tandem with charging stations to improve fleet utilization and reduce operational costs. To fulfill this vision, we consider a ride-hailing platform that jointly builds charging and battery swapping stations to support an EV fleet. An optimization model is proposed to capture the platform’s planning and operational decisions. In particular, the model incorporates essential components such as elastic passenger demand, spatial charging equilibrium, charging and swapping congestion, etc. The overall problem is formulated as a nonconcave program. Instead of pursuing the globally optimal solution, we establish a tight upper bound through relaxation and decomposition, allowing us to evaluate the solution optimality even in the absence of concavity. Through case studies for Manhattan, New York City, we find that joint planning of charging and battery swapping stations outperforms deploying only one of them, yielding a total profit that is 11.7% higher than swapping-only deployment under a limited budget, and 17.5% higher than charging-only deployment under a sufficient budget. These results underscore the complementary benefit between charging and battery swapping facilities.",0191-2615,Not found
Scheduling shared passenger and freight transport for an underground logistics system,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102907,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"With the introduction of freight transportation into the passenger transit network, underground city logistics are regarded as a desirable alternative to address the challenges due to truck movements in urban freight transport. Furthermore, some metro lines suffer from low-capacity utilization because of the unbalanced demand, which provides the potential to expand the extra capacity for freight transportation. Therefore, this study integrates the train unit scheduling problem with combined transportation of passengers and freight during off-peak hours. The objective is to fully utilize the remaining capacity by not only integrating passenger and freight flows but also allowing a flexible composition such that the capacity can better meet the demand. The composition of a trip is defined as its state. A three-dimensional space–time–state network is constructed to capture the composition transitions and passenger/freight trajectories. The problem is formulated as an integer linear programming model to minimize the weighted sum of train unit operational, passenger travel, and freight travel costs. Utilizing the problem-specific characteristics, a constrained-gap-based branch-and-bound approach is developed to efficiently solve the model. The worst bound for each objective is guaranteed by introducing two gaps in the passenger- and freight-related objectives. The nodes with estimated lower bounds exceeding the designated gaps are pruned. A beam search procedure is also included to further reduce the computational complexity. The developed algorithm is tested on real-life instances from the Beijing Metro Network. The results provide insights into the benefits and applicable scenarios for integrating passenger and freight transportation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of train units should be carefully determined considering the tradeoff between passenger service quality and freight demand volume.",0191-2615,Not found
On endogenously distinguishing inactive paths in stochastic user equilibrium: A convex programming approach with a truncated path choice model,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102940,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"This paper develops a convex programming approach with a truncated path choice model to resolve a fundamental drawback of conventional stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) models; that is, assign strictly positive flow to a path, irrespective of the length of its travel time. The centerpiece of the truncated path choice model is to truncate the path choice probability to zero when the travel time exceeds travelers’ maximum acceptable travel time, while the choice probabilities of other paths follow the utility maximization principle. Although the truncated path choice model has a non-smooth expression, the truncated SUE condition can be equivalently formulated as a twice-differentiable convex mathematical programming (MP), which has a simple structure comparable to that of Fisk’s MP formulation of the multinomial logit SUE model. Moreover, the origin–destination pair-specific parameter of the maximum acceptable travel time, which is explicitly expressed in the truncated path choice model, is endogenized and implicit in the devised MP formulation. This substantially decreases the computational effort required for parameter calibration. The desirable MP formulation enables us to establish the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium path flow under mild assumptions and to develop convergent and efficient solution algorithms. Specifically, we develop a path-based gradient projection algorithm incorporating an Armijo-type Barzilai-Borwein step size scheme for solving the truncated SUE model. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the truncated SUE model and the efficiency and robustness of the devised algorithm.",0191-2615,Not found
Congestive mode-switching and economies of scale on a bus route,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102930,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"This paper introduces a type of circular causation called Congestive Mode-Switching (CMS) that may arise when an increase in congestion penalizes transit relative to driving. In turn, rising congestion persuades some transit riders to drive, which exacerbates congestion further, and so on. This circular causation can beget multiple equilibria with different levels of congestion and transit ridership. The paper explores this logic with a static model of a bus route. When the bus fleet size is fixed, CMS applies because congestion raises the bus cycle time and thus lowers bus frequency, resulting in higher wait times. When the fleet size depends on bus ridership, CMS is joined by economies of scale as a second source of circular causation. We derive the system’s equilibria using a static model in the vein of Walters (1961), which permits us to graphically characterize equilibria in useful ways. The comparative statics of a road improvement show how feedback alters first-order effects. A Downs-Thomson paradox is not possible, because a road improvement aids buses even more than cars. Continuous-time stability analysis shows that multiple equilibria may be stable.",0191-2615,Not found
Keep on moving: Optimized placement of moving walkways in airport terminals,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102926,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Since its inception in 1955, when Delta Airlines pioneered the hub-and-spoke system at their Atlanta hub, airports have been engaged in fierce competition to ensure efficient and dependable transfers for passengers and airlines between connecting flights. In line with this overarching objective, we present a long-term layout design problem that focuses on optimizing the placement of moving walkways within the corridors of an airport terminal. Our primary goal is to facilitate faster transfers on these walkways, thereby improving gate connectivity. To achieve this, we propose the following budget-constrained optimization task: Maximize the weighted number of gate pairs that passengers can transfer between, without exceeding the specified minimum connecting time for each gate pair. We mathematically formulate the resulting optimization problem and provide a comprehensive analysis of its computational complexity. Additionally, we introduce suitable solution methods to tackle this challenging optimization task. Through a comprehensive computational study, using real-world terminal data, we evaluate the performance of our solution approaches.

"On the relationship between free public transport, stop spacing, and optimal frequencies",10.1016/j.trb.2024.102924,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Recent years have witnessed a reignition of the debate about free public transport, especially after a wider implementation due to the pandemic. However, most implementations have consisted of eliminating the fare without further structural adjustments, and one of the main reported concerns is that they seem to primarily attract commuters from active modes rather than car drivers. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to investigate how the design of a representative public transport line, situated in a corridor where it competes with both walking and cars, should be adjusted in response to fare reductions. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the effect of frequency and spacing on mode choice, showing that while increased frequencies attract both walkers and drivers, an increased spacing tends to attract long-distance commuters (often drivers) and discourage short-distance ones (which are more likely to walk). Hence, spacing can play a crucial role in inducing a desired mode choice. Afterwards, we study the optimal response of public transport design under two possible objectives. If the aim is to minimise users’ plus operator’s costs in public transport, a decrease in the fare should be joined by an increased frequency and, potentially, a reduced spacing. If the objective is to induce a more sustainable mode split, the measures are the opposite: increase spacing and reduce frequencies. These divergent findings show that it is crucial to have a clear goal when reducing the fare, as no singular policy can achieve all of the objectives. We remark that an increased spacing and reduced frequency reduce the financial burden of the system, although it is most likely not enough to compensate for the loss of revenue when fares go free.",0191-2615,Not found
A new car-following model with incorporation of Markkula's framework of sensorimotor control in sustained motion tasks,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102969,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"This study develops a car-following model called the “Markkula Intelligent Driver Model (MIDM)” based on Markkula's Framework of Sensorimotor Control.

The MIDM also accurately represents the actual shape and duration of acceleration maneuvers. Fifty drivers’ car-following behavior was observed in 2 different scenarios using a driving simulator – reaction to a decelerating lead vehicle and reaction to a stopped lead vehicle. Trajectory data from the NGSIM project were also used for the evaluation. Compared to the Gipps Model, the Wiedemann Model and the IDM, the MIDM realistically reproduced trajectories of speed, acceleration, jerk and spacing for both simulator and NGSIM data.

Robust safety driver scheduling for autonomous buses,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102965,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Autonomous buses offer a promising solution to the first- and last-mile problems, but their initial deployment requires safety drivers to supervise bus operations. Compared to traditional bus driver scheduling, the safety driver scheduling is more flexible and allows safety drivers to start/end their tasks at any bus stop/terminal. However, uncertainties such as delays in public bus services can bring new challenges to the flexible safety driver scheduling. To address these challenges, we put forward a robust safety driver scheduling problem (RSDSP) for autonomous bus services in order to achieve the trade-off between cost reduction and robustness against possible delays. The proposed robust optimization model takes into account the propagation, uncertainty, and correlation of delays. Besides, we develop both exact and heuristic solution methods to solve the RSDSP efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution methods through the extensive numerical experiments in which the instances are generated based on the historical operational data of Singapore’s bus lines. The results highlight the importance of incorporating robust optimization into the safety driver scheduling for autonomous bus services. The proposed methods can also be applied to other robust driver/crew scheduling problems in public transportation.",0191-2615,Not found
A bilevel hybrid iterated search approach to soft-clustered capacitated arc routing problems,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102944,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"This work studies a soft-clustered capacitated arc routing problem that extends the classical capacitated arc routing problem with an important constraint. The problem has a set of required edges (e.g., the streets to be serviced) that are partitioned into clusters. The constraint ensures that all required edges of the same cluster are served by the same vehicle. This problem can be found in a variety of practical applications, such as waste collection, postal delivery, snow plowing, and meter reading. Due to its non-deterministic polynomial-time hard nature, it is decomposed into capacitated vehicle routing problems at the cluster-level and rural postman problems at the edge-level, and then an effective bilevel hybrid iterated search method is proposed to solve it. The proposed method consists of a bilevel variable neighborhood search that sequentially executes a random order-based variable neighborhood descent at the cluster-level and a lower bound-guided variable neighborhood descent at the edge-level, and a similarity-driven hybrid perturbation that conditionally switches between a backbone-based directed perturbation and a destroy-repair random perturbation. Extensive evaluations on 611 existing benchmark instances show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution quality and computation time. Its excellent performance is also verified on 30 newly generated large instances that are derived from real-world road networks.

Using frequency domain analysis to elucidate travel time reliability along congested freeway corridors,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102961,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Travel time reliability (TTR) is an essential measure of service for traffic performance management, especially for congested freeway corridors. This paper proposes a systematic analytical framework to analyze the predictable and unpredictable variations in route TTR in corridor networks. More specifically, the predictable variation in route TTR is estimated with a deterministic fluid-based polynomial arrival queue (PAQ) model, while the unpredictable variation in route TTR is analyzed through the residual induced by the PAQ estimation model. Based on the output of the PAQ estimation model, a frequency-domain approach is proposed to decompose the observed time-domain travel time into underlying unobserved factors in different temporal resolutions. With the discrete-time Fourier transform method and the Butterworth low-pass filtering technique, it is capable of analytically uncovering different temporal scales of predictable variations in TTR, including the trend of day-to-day variations, the dynamics of within-day variations, as well as the stochasticity of within-period variations. Connecting with the unpredictable variations represented by the residual due to the PAQ approximation model, we can comprehensively elucidate TTR for congested freeway corridors. Case studies are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-domain approach in elucidating and measuring different contributing elements in TTR, and more specifically, the four components, i.e., the trend of day-to-day variations, the dynamics of within-day variations, the stochasticity of within-period variations, and the residual induced by the PAQ estimation model, account for 64.9 %, 20.2 %, 1.2 %, 13.7 % of variations in the route travel time, respectively, based on a case study with the PeMS dataset.",0191-2615,Not found
Schedule negotiation with ADA paratransit riders under value of time uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102962,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"When paratransit riders book their travels, operators have the flexibility to adjust the requested pickup time within a predetermined limit for efficiency purposes in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations. This practice, known as schedule negotiation, is widely adopted across the United States (U.S.). However, the existing paratransit literature lacks optimization methods to support decision-making in this context. To address this research gap, we propose a new mathematical formulation, enabling an operator to simultaneously determine how a new travel request can be accommodated and how incentives can be designed to maximize the operator’s payoff (revenues minus total costs). In addition, to enhance the realism of behavioral modeling in the paratransit literature, we explicitly consider the privately held value of time information for riders, which results in probabilistic responses. Eventually, the formulation is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). We thus design a decomposition-based fix-and-optimize algorithm that ensures global optimality despite the nonconvexity. We validate and evaluate our proposed method through synthetic analyses and real-world case studies, which demonstrate substantial advantages of schedule negotiation in improving paratransit operational efficiency. We also highlight the efficiency of the proposed solution approach relative to a benchmark approach based on complete enumeration. The proposed optimization method is thus expected to advance the state of the practice in pickup time negotiation in paratransit and other related mobility services.",0191-2615,Not found
Robust cooperative control strategy for a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles against sensor errors and control errors simultaneously in a real-world driving environment,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102946,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"In a real-world driving environment, a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is subject to many internal and external disturbances, resulting in uncertain vehicle dynamics. In general, the disturbances can be categorized into two types: disturbances due to vehicle sensor errors (e.g., GPS error) and disturbances due to vehicle control errors (e.g., actuator delay). In the literature, many control strategies have been proposed to improve the robustness of the CAV platoon against uncertain vehicle dynamics induced by these disturbances. However, most of these strategies only consider one type of disturbance and cannot tackle both types of disturbances simultaneously. Furthermore, they are designed to maximize the benefits of each vehicle in the platoon independently, which can deteriorate the performance of the platoon. To address these problems, this study proposes a robust cooperative control (RCC) strategy to maneuver the vehicles in the platoon cooperatively to counteract the impacts of both types of disturbances. The RCC strategy is developed based on a minimax problem, where the maximization subproblem seeks to find the worst inputs for the uncertainty terms in the vehicle dynamics equation to minimize the platoon performance, while the minimization subproblem seeks to find the optimal control decisions for all subsequent vehicles to maximize the platoon performance in the worst case. To solve the minimax problem, this study proposes a globally convergent solution algorithm. It can solve the minimax problem very efficiently to enable real time deployment of the RCC strategy. Numerical application indicates that compared to the existing methods, the RCC strategy can dramatically improve the robustness of the CAV platoon against the uncertain vehicle dynamics induced by both vehicle state detection errors and vehicle control errors. Therefore, it can maneuver the CAV platoon safely and efficiently in a real-world driving environment.",0191-2615,Not found

In practice, HHC supply chain networks often struggle to meet high demand due to a shortage of service vehicles. Additionally, disruptions caused by natural calamities and pandemics (e.g., COVID-19) further compound these challenges, necessitating the consideration of real-life characteristics such as patient priorities, infrastructure locations, and transportation of medical supplies with uncertain demands. To formulate the problem, we propose a multi-depot and multi-period chance-constrained optimization model with precedence constraints, assuming that the demand quantities for medical supplies are random variables. Since patients’ medical conditions vary in severity, the priority of each patient is translated into a time-dependent potential healthcare cost that changes dynamically over the planning horizon. The solution to the proposed model determines the optimal locations for the base Mobile Health Facilities (MHFs) and the fleet size of HHC vehicles, and generates scheduling and routing plans to visit patients within specified time windows. We propose a unique three-phase solution approach, integrated with stochastic simulation, to address the problem. We then assess the robustness of the proposed model based on a realistic case of HHC service provision in Hong Kong and explore the optimal values for two model parameters, namely the Vehicle Threshold Index and the MHF Threshold Index.

While this approach offers a natural and intuitive modeling approach for multiple-choice analysis, the large number of subsets of choices in the formulation makes its estimation and application intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce directed acyclic graph (DAG) based representations of choices where each node of the DAG is associated with an elemental alternative and additional information such as the number of selected elemental alternatives.

The CTOP finds applications across various domains such as disaster response, maintenance, marketing, tourism, and surveillance, where coordinated teams are required to efficiently explore and gather prizes from different sites. The complexity of this problem is further compounded by uncertainties in predicting specific attributes of each location, making it hard to plan routes accurately in advance. In numerous scenarios in practice, subjective predictions for these parameters may exist, but their precise values remain unknown until a location is visited by one of the vehicles. Given the unpredictable nature of these parameters, there is a pressing need for innovative online optimization strategies that can adapt to new information, ensuring the strategic allocation of resources and route planning within set constraints. To address this challenging online optimization problem, we offer a detailed analysis through the lens of theoretical and empirical competitive ratios.

The proposed model extends past work that is based on a stochastic formulation of the link transmission model, which itself is an operational formulation of Newell’s simplified theory of kinematic waves. The proposed model yields a probabilistic description of the link’s upstream and downstream boundary conditions. The model only tracks the transient probabilities of two of the link’s boundary states. This leads to a model with a state space dimension that is constant, i.e., it does not depend on any link attributes, such as link length. In other words, the model has constant complexity, whereas past formulations have a complexity that scales linearly or cubically with link length. The gain in computational runtime is of at least one order of magnitude and it increases with link length. This makes the proposed model suitable for large-scale network optimization. The model is validated versus a simulation-based implementation of the stochastic link transmission model. Its performance is also benchmarked with other past analytical formulations. The proposed model yields estimates with comparable accuracy, while the computational efficiency is enhanced by at least one order of magnitude. It is also validated versus a microscopic traffic simulator, the results indicate that the proposed model accurately approximates the link’s boundary conditions for realistic traffic situations, such as signalized links and platoon arrival patterns.

We adopt distributed control as the basic scheme for network-wide control and use information sharing to achieve cooperation among different intersections. We use CAV information to estimate HDV state and develop a “safety check” technique to control CAVs in the mixed traffic flow.

We propose the so-called “hold-dispatch” operation strategy, which imposes a target number of shared rides (termed the ride-pooling size) for each vehicle to enhance RP’s transportation efficiency. Analytical models are formulated at the planning level to estimate the costs of the RP operator and the patrons. Accordingly, the design problem is constructed to minimize the total system cost concerning the system layout (i.e., in terms of service zone partitioning), resource deployment (i.e., fleet size), and operational decisions (i.e., RP size). The proposed models admit spatial heterogeneity arising from the non-uniformity of demand distributions and service locations, and can furnish heterogeneous designs. Closed-form formulas for the optimal zoning and fleet size are developed, which unveil fundamental insights regarding the impacts of key operating factors (e.g., demand density and distance to the terminal). Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate (i) the effectiveness of heterogeneous service designs and (ii) the advantage of the proposed RP service with hold-dispatch strategy over alternative designs studied in the literature, i.e., RP with a “quick-dispatch” strategy and flexible-route transit, in a wide range of operating scenarios. These findings can assist transportation network companies and transit agencies in successfully integrating RP and transit services.",0191-2615,Not found
Sequential feasibility and constraint properties of CAV platoons under various vehicle dynamics and safety distance constraints,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102966,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) platooning technologies have been extensively studied. Many CAV platoon control schemes, e.g., model predictive control schemes, are formulated as constrained optimization problems since they can effectively handle vehicle dynamics, physical and safety constraints, and desired performance. At each time, a control input is generated from a constrained optimization problem, whose constraint set is time-varying and depends on states and controls in the past times. A fundamental question is whether the underlying optimization problem is sequentially feasible, i.e., whether the constraint set is nonempty at each time along a platoon state solution, assuming that it starts from an arbitrary initial condition which satisfies the physical and safety distance constraints. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of sequential feasibility and related constraint properties under various vehicle dynamics and safety distance constraints. In particular, we consider three types of linear or nonlinear vehicle dynamic models and a wide range of representative spacing policy based safety distance constraints as well as physical constraints. We show that the constant spacing based safety distance constraint does not yield sequential feasibility, whereas most of variable spacing policy based safety distance constraints, along with the physical constraints, ensure sequential feasibility under mild, easily verifiable conditions on constraint or vehicle dynamics parameters. Extensions to general and unified forms of safety distance constraints have been made. We also show that under additional assumptions, each non-polyhedral constraint set has nonempty interior if sequential feasibility holds. This constraint property plays an important role in robust sequential feasibility analysis and optimization algorithm development.",0191-2615,Not found
Risk-aware urban air mobility network design with overflow redundancy,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102967,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"In urban air mobility (UAM), as envisioned by aviation professionals, novel flight vehicles will transport passengers and cargo at low altitudes within urban and suburban areas. To operate in urban environments, precise air traffic management, in particular the management of traffic overflows due to physical and operational disruptions will be critical to ensuring system safety and efficiency. To this end, we propose UAM network design with reserve capacity, i.e., a design where alternative landing options and flight corridors are explicitly considered as a means of improving contingency management. Similar redundancy considerations are incorporated in the design of many critical infrastructures, yet remain unexploited in the air transportation literature. In our methodology, we first model how disruptions to a given UAM network might impact on the nominal traffic flow and how this flow might be re-accommodated on an extended network with reserve capacity. Then, through an optimization problem, we select the locations and capacities for the backup vertiports with the maximal expected throughput of the extended network over all possible disruption scenarios, while the throughput is the maximal amount of flights that the network can accommodate per unit of time. We show that we can obtain the solution for the corresponding bi-level and bi-linear optimization problem by solving a mixed-integer linear program. We demonstrate our methodology in the case study using networks from Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan areas and show how the throughput and flexibility of the UAM networks with reserve capacity can outcompete those without.",0191-2615,Not found
The use of pooled RP-SP choice data to simultaneously identify alternative attributes and random coefficients on those attributes,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102988,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Random utility maximization-based discrete choice models involve utility functions that are typically specified with explanatory variables representing alternative-specific attributes. It may be useful to specify some alternative-specific attributes as stochastic in situations when the analyst cannot accurately measure the attribute values considered by the decision maker. In addition, the parameters representing decision makers’ response to the attributes may have to be specified as stochastic to recognize response heterogeneity in the population. Ignoring either of these two sources of stochasticity can lead to biased parameter estimates and distorted willingness-to-pay estimates. Further, in some situations the analyst may not even have access to measurements of important alternative-specific attributes to include them in the utility specification. In this study, we explore the feasibility of simultaneously inferring alternative attributes and the corresponding coefficients, as well as stochasticity in both – without the help of external measurement data on alternative attributes – using mixed logit models on pooled revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) choice datasets. To do so, we first theoretically examine parameter identifiability for different specifications and distributional forms of alternative attributes and their coefficients. Next, we illustrate this through simulation experiments in a travel mode choice setting and demonstrate the conditions under which pooled RP-SP data can help disentangle stochastic alternative attributes from random coefficients. In addition, an empirical application is presented in the context of commute mode choice in Bengaluru, India, to demonstrate the importance of recognizing stochasticity in mode-specific in-vehicle travel times along with the random coefficient on in-vehicle travel times.",0191-2615,Not found
Using traffic assignment models to assist Bayesian inference for origin–destination matrices,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103019,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Estimation of traffic volumes between each origin and destination of travel is a standard practice in transport engineering. Commonly the available data constitute traffic counts at various locations on the network, supplemented by a survey-based prior estimate of mean origin–destination traffic volumes. Statistical inference in this type of network tomography problem is known to be challenging. Moreover, the difficulties are increased in practice by the presence of a large number of nuisance parameters corresponding to route choice probabilities, for which we have no direct prior information. Working in a Bayesian framework, we determine these parameters using a stochastic user equilibrium route choice model. We develop an MCMC algorithm for model fitting. This requires repeated computation of stochastic user equilibrium flows, and so we develop a computationally cheap emulator.

This study explores the competitiveness of MaaS-enabled multi-modal travel options versus private car usage through equilibrium analysis. In addition to pricing that affects the fixed cost for travel, we examine the often overlooked inconvenience cost associated with multi-modal trips. We establish our analysis for the commuting problem of a one-origin-one-destination network, where a highway and a mass transit line connect the residential area and the central business district (CBD) area. Travelers choose their departure time and travel mode among auto, Park-and-Ride (PnR), ride-hailing and transit (RnT) to minimize their total travel cost. Inconvenience costs associated with searching for parking and waiting for ride-hailing are explicitly modeled. We analytically provide the mode share and departure time windows under all possible equilibria. Our findings reveal the complex nature of mode choice, distinctly affected by fixed and inconvenience costs, with demand playing an even more significant role. Notably, fixed costs set an entry fee to adopt different modes, and the feature of inconvenience costs affects the utilization of available transportation resources. More importantly, to benefit the overall system, we encourage maintaining a balanced mode share by implementing pricing and capacity strategies rather than aiming for a completer transition of private car users to MaaS.",0191-2615,Not found

Beyond centralization: Non-cooperative perimeter control with extended mean-field reinforcement learning in urban road networks,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103016,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Perimeter control is a traffic management approach aimed at regulating vehicular accumulation within urban regional networks by managing flows on all border-crossing roads.

Recent advancements in the cell transmission model (CTM) have attempted to address this limitation but are hindered by their reliance on centralized control, which requires the availability of full information and authority over traffic generation sites. Our study proposes an innovative decentralized, game-theoretical framework for perimeter control to address these practical challenges. It is structured around two key groups of agents: perimeter agents, tasked with managing border roads, and interior agents, focused on traffic within generation sites. The framework also incorporates mechanisms for interactions between these agents and the road network, aiming to optimize their individual utilities.

From silver to platinum: The impact of frequent flier tier levels on air travellers’ behaviour,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102986,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"We estimate the switching costs created by tier levels, one of the main components of airline frequent flier programs, by exploiting discrete tier thresholds. We first demonstrate that travellers increase their demand to reach a higher tier level just before the end of the calendar year when tier levels are determined, but do not manipulate demand in earlier months. This allows for a novel fuzzy discontinuity approach to identify causal demand effects of higher tier levels, from which we derive the airline switching costs. While the lowest level creates only negligible switching costs, the switching costs associated with the highest tier level are in the range of 30%–41% of the price of a ticket, representing an important determinant of travel behaviour in airline markets. These results especially provide evidence of the use of tier levels to induce loyalty from high-frequency travellers for whom free flight awards alone would not create substantial switching costs.",0191-2615,Not found
A multi-stage spatial queueing model with logistic arrivals and departures consistent with the microscopic fundamental diagram and hysteresis,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103015,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This paper introduces a spatial queueing model for a single bottleneck during morning peak hours. Utilizing the logistic function and after appropriate calibration, it articulates the arrival and departure flows in continuous, differentiable terms. By validating the model across different peak periods and locations, the demand model’s robustness is superior to other commonly used functions. This model also incorporates constant or varying capacity scenarios. It effectively captures key aspects of morning peak traffic, including the emergence of hysteresis loops in fundamental diagrams (FDs) of density and flow. The model’s multi-stage approach recognizes three distinct phases in traffic flow: freeflow, transition, and queued segments, ensuring spatial consistency in flow and density across these stages. It accounts for the growth of the queued segment and vehicle spillback under various bottleneck intensities, with the resulting FDs for speed and density also displaying hysteresis loops. The calibration of model parameters utilizes time-series data of traffic flow and density space–time maps derived from real-world data. The validation results accurately reflect real traffic scenarios, emulating the counterclockwise hysteresis loops observed in density and its heterogeneity, and provide both planar and three-dimensional FDs at different points along the traffic link, each mirroring real-life traffic patterns.

The E-ADARP considers the following perspectives: (i) a weighted-sum objective that minimizes both total travel time and total excess user ride time; (ii) the employment of electric autonomous vehicles and a partial recharging policy. This paper presents the first labeling algorithm for a path-based formulation of the DARP/E-ADARP, where the main ingredient includes: (1) fragment-based representation of paths, (2) a novel approach that abstracts fragments to arcs while ensuring excess-user-ride-time optimality, (3) construction of a sparser new graph with the abstracted arcs, which is proven to preserve all feasible routes of the original graph, and (4) strong dominance rules and constant-time feasibility checks to compute the shortest paths efficiently.

In addition, we analyze the impact of incorporating the total excess user ride time within the objectives and allowing unlimited visits to recharging stations. The following managerial insights are provided: (1) solving a weighted-sum objective function can significantly enhance the service quality, while still maintaining operational costs at nearly optimal levels, (2) the relaxation on charging visits allows us to solve all instances feasibly and further reduces the average solution cost.",0191-2615,Not found
Is order-2 proportionality good enough for approximating the most likely path flow in user equilibrium traffic assignment?,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103007,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The proportionality condition is a standard approach to dealing with the non-uniqueness issue in the user equilibrium (UE) traffic assignment problems (TAP). Although the proportionality condition can reduce the degree of arbitrariness, it remains unclear how much arbitrariness remains and whether it can meaningfully affect model outcomes and relevant decisions that depend on them. The answers to these questions are impeded by the lack of an efficient algorithm that can find the exact maximum entropy UE path flow solution for networks of practical size. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing a high-performance augmented Lagrangian algorithm that effectively exploits the special problem structure. Our numerical results reveal that there are a considerable number of links with non-negligible arbitrariness in the solution generated by the proportionality condition, and that this problem becomes worse if the level of congestion increases in the network.

Mathematical formulations for the multi-period alternative fuel refueling station location problem with routing under decision-dependent flow dynamics,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102999,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The refueling station location problem with routing considers vehicles’ ranges and drivers’ preferences about their routes to improve the alternative fuel station infrastructure. Comprehensive planning is necessary for developing a mature infrastructure to overcome budgetary constraints and spatial limitations. Hence, adopting a multi-period planning approach becomes crucial when taking into account the evolving demand for alternative fuel vehicles over time. The evolution of demand can be dependent on exogenous and endogenous factors. Although it is typical to account for exogenous demand growth in multi-period planning, a few studies also take into account an endogenous factor which is the refueling opportunity of drivers on their paths. In this study, in addition to the refueling opportunities, we consider the proximity of each individual station to the flow-based demands. We draw attention to the significance of considering the effects of individual station locations on demand evolution, as these strategic locations can play an important role in reducing the drivers’ range anxiety and increasing their acceptance of the technology. Hence, we introduce a multi-period alternative fuel refueling station location problem with routing under different vehicle flow evolution dynamics that employ various weights for the factors where the natural growth rate is exogenous and the decisions of station locations and flow coverage are endogenous to the problem. We propose three mixed integer linear programming formulations for different evolution dynamics.

A state-owned vehicle manufacturer is assumed to be the producer of these vehicles. Two typical rationing schemes for the GV and EV ownership that have been implemented in some Chinese megacities, namely a simultaneous lottery scheme for both GV and EV and a hybrid scheme consisting of lottery for GV and first-come-first-served (FCFS) for EV, are investigated. Multi-period social cost minimization models are proposed for determining the optimal auto quota (i.e., the number of vehicles to be produced) and the optimal frequency of ownership allocation for each scheme in the given time horizon. In the proposed models, residents’ heterogeneity is considered in terms of their values of time (VOTs). The properties of the proposed models are analytically explored, and a comparison between the lottery mode and the FCFS mode is made. The results show that the lottery mode outperforms the FCFS mode in terms of the total social cost. The VOT threshold of the subsequent participants in auto rationing schemes tends to be higher than that of the preceding participants. The decision of EV subsidy should be cautiously made due to a tug of war between the resultant decreased pollutant emissions and increased traffic congestion. The implementation of the auto ownership rationing schemes can cause inequity issue in terms of the changes of travel costs of different-income residents. A Pareto-improvement strategy is presented to balance equity and efficiency of the rationing schemes.",0191-2615,Not found
Railway line planning with passenger routing: Direct-service network representations and a two-phase solution approach,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102989,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The railway line planning problem (LPP) plays a crucial role in determining the quality of services provided to passengers, as well as operation costs borne by railway companies. In periodic railway LPPs, it is common to consider passenger transfers between train lines to realize a general passenger travel cost setting in the railway system. While detecting passenger transfers requires incorporating passenger routing into mathematical formulations, thereby significantly complicating the problem. Studies on transfer-included LPPs are generally based on the Change&Go network that is constructed based on a pre-given line pool, which however is usually non-exhaustive due to computational intractability. To efficiently include passenger transfers in large-scale railway LPPs, this paper proposes a novel extended direct-service network representation of LPP, where lines are dynamically generated within the optimization process, and part of passenger transfers between lines can be precisely captured without the need for explicit modeling of passengers’ distribution on specific lines. A two-phase solution approach based on the representation is designed. The first phase formulates LPP with part of transfers as a path-based service network design model, solved using a branch-price-and-cut algorithm. The second phase conducts a neighborhood search around the first-phase solution to seek better ones when considering all passenger transfers. Numerical results showcase the good performance of the two-phase solution approach. It delivers optimal solutions in 18 out of 24 test instances for a small case and achieves optimality gaps within 2.85% across all small instances.

How mandatory are ‘Mandatory’ lane changes? An analytical and experimental study on the costs of missing freeway exits,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102994,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Lane changing, recognised as one of the most intricate manoeuvres in road traffic, has attracted extensive scholarly interest. To date, the concept of lane change has been categorised into two distinct classifications, namely mandatory and discretionary. Mandatory lane changes (MLCs) are often regarded as absolute, implying that the possibility of not executing the lane change is frequently disregarded. This paper questions this widely accepted proposition by evaluating the costs of neglecting an MLC. Specifically, we examine the costs associated with not making MLCs for exiting freeways, effectively quantifying the cost of missing such exits. The core of this study involves a dual approach comprising an analytical model for the costs of missing exits alongside an empirical analysis of two GPS datasets from the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area. The performance of the analytical model is validated by cross-referencing it against exit-missing costs from the top 50 metropolitan areas in the US. Regarding the empirical study, it was found that while both time and distance costs are associated with missing exits, the magnitudes of these costs are not substantial. The results obtained in this study offer novel insights into the nature of MLC, and we argue that future models should consist of discretionary (DLC), mandatory (MLC), and expedient (ELC) lane changes.

The consistent vehicle routing problem with stochastic customers and demands,10.1016/j.trb.2024.102968,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This paper introduces the consistent vehicle routing problem with stochastic customers and demands. We consider driver consistency as customer-driver assignments that remain fixed when the realizations of the random variables are observed. We study the problem in a two-stage scenario-based stochastic programming framework. In the first stage, customers are assigned to drivers, while in the second stage, customers are selected and delivery routes are designed for each of the scenarios. We assume that the realization of the random variables becomes known before the vehicles depart from the depot. The routes are then optimized according to the observed customers and their demands. The first-stage driver-customer assignments can violate the consistency requirement, which is modeled as a desired maximum number of drivers assigned to each customer. This is modeled as a soft constraint with a penalty in the objective function. It is hence possible to assign multiple drivers to a specific customer in the first stage. In the second stage, a customer can only be visited by one of the preassigned drivers. Our problem, therefore, consists in finding assignments that minimize the consistency violation penalties, the expected routing costs, and the penalties for unserved customers when the uncertain parameters are revealed. We present a mathematical formulation and a sample average approximation (SAA) approach for the problem. We introduce a branch-and-cut and a Benders decomposition method to solve the sample problems in our SAA algorithm. Computational experiments show that SAA allows finding good-quality solutions for instances with large sets of scenarios.

The problem is modeled to maximize profits in a stochastic demand environment, where a portion of the demand may remain unserved depending on the trade-off between profits, costs, and carbon emissions. The model explicitly incorporates a carbon tax into the objective function, along with transportation and hub operation costs. To ensure compliance with the carbon cap, a constraint is incorporated to limit the emissions across the entire transportation network. The carbon emission on each arc of the network is modeled using a generic convex function that depends on the total demand routed on the arc which is then approximated by a piecewise linear function to derive a mixed-integer stochastic formulation. A Benders-decomposition-based algorithm coupled with a sample average approximation scheme is developed to solve the stochastic model.

Automated lane changing control in mixed traffic: An adaptive dynamic programming approach,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103026,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The majority of the past research dealing with lane-changing controller design of autonomous vehicles ( A V s) is based on the assumption of full knowledge of the model dynamics of the A V and the surrounding vehicles. However, in the real world, this is not a very realistic assumption as accurate dynamic models are difficult to obtain. Also, the dynamic model parameters might change over time due to various factors. Thus, there is a need for a learning-based lane change controller design methodology that can learn the optimal control policy in real time using sensor data. In this paper, we have addressed this need by introducing an optimal learning-based control methodology that can solve the real-time lane-changing problem of A V s, where the input-state data of the A V is utilized to generate a near-optimal lane-changing controller by approximate/adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique. In the case of this type of complex lane-changing maneuver, the lateral dynamics depend on the longitudinal velocity of the vehicle. If the longitudinal velocity is assumed constant, a linear parameter invariant model can be used. However, assuming constant velocity while performing a lane-changing maneuver is not a realistic assumption. This assumption might increase the risk of accidents, especially in the case of lane abortion when the surrounding vehicles are not cooperative. Thus, in this paper, the dynamics of the A V are assumed to be a linear parameter-varying system. Thus we have two challenges for the lane-changing controller design: parameter-varying, and unknown dynamics. With the help of both gain scheduling and ADP techniques combined, a learning-based control algorithm that can generate a near-optimal lane-changing controller without having to know the accurate dynamic model of the A V is proposed. The inclusion of a gain scheduling approach with ADP makes the controller applicable to non-linear and/or parameter-varying A V dynamics. The stability of the learning-based gain scheduling controller has also been rigorously proved. Moreover, a data-driven lane-changing decision-making algorithm is introduced that can make the A V perform a lane abortion if safety conditions are violated during a lane change.

The latter is understood as an improvement of a set of edges to increase their individual performance, e.g., a decreased unit transportation cost. The goal is to obtain an improved optimal solution to the problem compared to that obtained if upgrading was not done. A budget constraint is assumed to limit the upgrading operations. A flow-based formulation is initially proposed that extends a classical model for uncapacitated single-allocation hub location with complete hub networks. Nevertheless, the fact that the unit costs after upgrading may violate the triangle inequality needs to be accounted for. Since the proposed formulation has a high computing burden, different possibilities are discussed for enhancing it. This leads to devising an efficient branch-and-cut algorithm with different variants. Additionally, a formulation based on the discrete ordered median function is also introduced that is also enhanced and embedded into a branch-and-cut algorithm again with several variants. All models and algorithms are also adapted to problems embedding hub network design decisions. Extensive computational tests were conducted to assess the methodological contributions proposed.",0191-2615,Not found
Approximate dynamic programming for pickup and delivery problem with crowd-shipping,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103027,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"We study a variant of dynamic pickup and delivery crowd-shipping operation for delivering online orders within a few hours from a brick-and-mortar store. This crowd-shipping operation is subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to the stochastic arrival of online orders and crowd-shippers that impose several challenges for efficient matching of orders to crowd-shippers. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and develop an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) policy using value function approximation for obtaining a highly scalable and real-time matching strategy while considering temporal and spatial uncertainty in arrivals of online orders and crowd-shippers. We incorporate several algorithmic enhancements to the ADP algorithm, which significantly improve the convergence. We compare the ADP policy with an optimization-based myopic policy using various performance measures. Our numerical analysis with varying parameter settings shows that ADP policies can lead to up to 25.2% cost savings and a 9.8% increase in the number of served orders. Overall, we find that our proposed framework can guide crowd-shipping platforms for efficient real-time matching decisions and enhance the platform delivery capacity.",0191-2615,Not found
Queue replacement principle for corridor problems with heterogeneous commuters,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103024,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This study investigates the theoretical properties of a departure time choice problem considering commuters’ heterogeneity with respect to the value of schedule delay in corridor networks. Specifically, we develop an analytical method to solve the dynamic system optimal (DSO) and dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) problems. To derive the DSO solution, we first demonstrate the bottleneck-based decomposition property, i.e., the DSO problem can be decomposed into multiple single bottleneck problems. Subsequently, we obtain the analytical solution by applying the theory of optimal transport to each decomposed problem and derive optimal congestion prices to achieve the DSO state. To derive the DUE solution, we prove the queue replacement principle (QRP) that the time-varying optimal congestion prices are equal to the queueing delay in the DUE state at every bottleneck. This principle enables us to derive a closed-form DUE solution based on the DSO solution. Moreover, as an application of the QRP, we prove that the equilibrium solution under various policies (e.g., on-ramp metering, on-ramp pricing, and its partial implementation) can be obtained analytically. Finally, we compare these equilibria with the DSO state.",0191-2615,Not found
What drives drivers to start cruising for parking?

It introduces a probabilistic model that describes the transition from normal driving to actively searching for parking, aiming to minimize journey costs. The model is tested using real-world data collected via a smartphone app that tracks the start of parking searches. Results validate the model, showing that drivers are more likely to begin searching for parking earlier when parking spaces are scarce and driving speeds are reduced (e.g., by congestion). Additionally, various factors influence the start of the parking search, including driver age, vehicle class, and familiarity with the destination. Specific conditions such as proximity to amenities, rush hour timing, and destination familiarity prompt earlier search initiation. The study also identifies scenarios where drivers skip the search process and park immediately, influenced by factors like driving home, short parking durations, and destination familiarity.",0191-2615,Not found
Adaptive rescheduling of rail transit services with short-turnings under disruptions via a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103067,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"This paper presents a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach for real-time rescheduling of rail transit services with short-turnings during a complete track blockage on a double-track service corridor. The optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process with multiple control agents rescheduling train services on each directional line for system recovery. To ensure computational efficacy, we employ a multi-agent policy optimization solution framework in which each control agent employs a decentralized policy function for deriving local decisions and a centralized value function approximation (VFA) estimating global system state values. Both the policy functions and VFAs are represented by multi-layer artificial neural networks (ANNs). A multi-agent proximal policy optimization gradient algorithm is developed for training the policies and VFAs through iterative simulated system transitions. The proposed framework is implemented and tested with real-world scenarios with data collected from London Underground, UK. Computational results demonstrate the superiority of the developed framework in computational effectiveness compared with previous distributed control algorithms and conventional metaheuristic methods. We also provide managerial implications for train rescheduling during disruptions with different durations, locations, and passenger behaviors. Additional experiments show the scalability of the proposed MADRL framework in managing disruptions with uncertain durations with a generalized model.

Integrated aircraft routing and cargo routing problem for combination airlines,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103063,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"The combination airlines operate both passenger aircraft and freighter aircraft to meet passenger and cargo demand. At present, combination airlines employ a sequential approach to allocating their capacity for passenger and cargo demand. Nevertheless, implementing an integrated resource allocation procedure has the potential to improve overall resource allocation efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an integrated model to help combination airlines integrate their aircraft routing and cargo routing decisions to maximize the expected overall profits derived from both passenger and cargo demand. We considered the stochastic nature of passenger baggage and proposed a set of individual chance constraints to ensure the robustness of the integrated solution. We reformulate the chance constraints using piecewise linear approximation to ensure solution efficiency. In addition, we proposed a column-and-row generation based solution approach that removes the through-connection related constraints at the beginning of the solution process and then adds the columns and rows during the iterations as needed. We proved that the proposed column-and-row generation approach can obtain an optimal solution for the LP relaxation problem. The model and the solution approach were tested in a number of scenarios obtained from a major Chinese combination airline. The computational results show that the combination airline can improve their expected profits by integrating capacity allocation. The results also demonstrated that the proposed column-and-row generation solution approach can decrease the solution time of the integrated model.

Environmental and welfare implications of sustainable aviation fuel policies,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103062,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) serves as a critical short-term measure for reducing aviation's carbon footprint. Two main policy tools, subsidy and quota, have been developed to support its usage. We build an economic model to compare the environmental and welfare impacts of these two policies. First, we find that if an airline uses the same portion of SAF under both policies, the subsidy approach results in reduced SAF costs, augmented airline output, and heightened emissions. Second, the subsidy policy is better than the quota policy in terms of consumer surplus, airline profits, SAF blender profit, and social welfare, if the traditional aviation fuel is sufficiently inexpensive and the emission regulation under the subsidy policy is adequately stringent. Finally, to demonstrate the empirical relevance of our theoretical framework, we have employed empirically-validated parameters for model calibration. Sensitivity analysis indicates that SAF production costs and market potential are pivotal factors influencing governmental policy formulation. With the reduction in SAF production expenses and the growth of the aviation sector, the government is positioned to adopt a more aggressive policy stance, characterized by higher SAF quotas and increased subsidies, to stimulate the uptake of SAF by airlines.",0191-2615,Not found
Platform integration in ride-sourcing markets with heterogeneous passengers,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103041,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"This paper explores the impacts of a novel business model termed platform integration, which enables passengers to simultaneously request on-demand rides from multiple ride-sourcing platforms via a third-party integrator. In particular, we employ an equilibrium model where passenger demand and driver supply are endogenously dependent on the prices and wages that emerge from the competitive interaction between two platforms, with and without an integrator. A Hotelling model is adopted to characterize passengers’ heterogeneity in service preference for different platforms. We employ the concepts of a Nash equilibrium and a shared monopoly to analyze equilibrium outcomes that can arise in various settings of demand and supply characteristics with and without platform integration. We find that how the platform should adjust its price and wage at Nash equilibrium as potential demand increases is affected by the nature of supply. We also find that the profit at Nash equilibrium can increase or decrease in supply capacity depending on the competitive situation of the platforms. We build on these equilibrium results to analyze how platform integration affects the platform’s decision-making of price and wage, and market performance. We find that platform integration can increase platform profit but reduce driver income, and may hurt passengers who have a strong preference for one certain platform, especially in the case of a less heterogeneous supply.",0191-2615,Not found
Measuring gendered values of time for married couples by life stage based on an intertemporal household utility-maximization model,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103025,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"We investigate the value of time as a resource (VOTR) and the value of childcare time saving (VOCTS) for a married couple with children by life cycle stage. Extending the framework of DeSerpa (1971), we develop a novel intertemporal utility-maximization model that can represent trade-offs within an individual and within a couple between different activities in their life stages based on a household lifetime equilibrium, and we derive wives’ and husbands’ time values when their first child is of pre-school age and after their first child reaches school age. Applying the model to the 2004–2018 Japan Household Panel Survey, we analyze couples in two life stages to empirically find the value of time by gender. The results show that the wives’ average VOTR is greater than 4400 yen/hour with statistical significance when their first child is of pre-school age; the value, however, drastically drops to around 400 yen/hour with statistical insignificance after their first child reaches school age. Conversely, the magnitudes of the husbands’ VOTRs do not change much in different life stages. In the background mechanisms, the wives’ high and low VOTRs reflect their short and long work and commute hours, respectively, whereas the husbands reduce their work and commute hours only slightly over time. For the dual-income households that only spend the minimum required time on childcare, VOCTS is statistically insignificant when their first child is of pre-school age but is greater than 28,000 yen/hour after their first child reaches school age. Using the estimated time values for urban and transport policy simulations, we find that enabling work flexibility could help households increase welfare more compared to transportation improvement and childcare support services.",0191-2615,Not found
Allocation problem in cross-platform ride-hail integration,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103056,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"We consider a ride-hail system in which a third-party integrator receives ride requests and allocates them to ride service platforms. The ride allocation problem (RAP) is modeled as a Stackelberg game. The integrator, as the leader, chooses the allocation that maximizes its profit, by pricing the rides such that no platform (i.e., follower) can find a more profitable allocation. In pursuit of self-interest, the integrator may refuse to match as many rides as the platforms are willing to serve, thereby injecting an artificial scarcity into the system. To protect the platforms from over exploitation, an exogenous reserve price is introduced to bound their per capita profit from below. We formulate RAP as a bilevel pricing problem, and convert it to a single-level problem by dualizing the lower level. When artificial scarcity is eliminated and all reserve prices are set to zero, we prove the single-level problem can be turned into a mixed integer-linear program that equals its linear relaxation, thus becoming polynomially solvable. Moreover, this version of RAP is shown to be related to cooperative assignment games. Numerical experiments confirm that artificial scarcity negatively affects matching productivity and social welfare. The integrator is favored to take most profits, and leveraging artificial scarcity strengthens its dominance. Moreover, the tighter the supply, the more the integrator benefit from artificial scarcity. The reserve price helps redistribute benefits from the integrator to the platforms. However, demanding an excessively large reserve price may depress the platforms’ profits, while undermining system efficiency.",0191-2615,Not found
Dynamic tugboat deployment and scheduling with stochastic and time-varying service demands,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103059,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Container ports serve as crucial logistics hubs in global supply chains, but navigating ships within such ports is complex due to restricted waterways. Tugboats play a critical role in ensuring safety and efficiency by escorting and towing ships under these conditions. However, the tugboat deployment and scheduling problem has received little attention. To fill the research gap, we propose a new research problem - the dynamic tugboat deployment and scheduling problem, in which not all requests are confirmed initially but dynamically confirmed over time and future tugging demands need to be anticipated when managing the utilization of tugboats. To formulate the problem, we propose an extended Markov decision process (MDP) that incorporates both reactive task assignment decisions and proactive tugboat waiting decisions, creating a reactive and proactive MDP. To solve the advanced MDP model efficiently for real-time decisions, we develop an anticipatory approximate dynamic programming method that incorporates appropriate task assignment and waiting strategies for deploying and scheduling a heterogeneous tugboat fleet and embed the method into an improved rollout algorithm to anticipate future scenarios. The effectiveness, efficiency, and performance sensitivity of the developed modeling and solution methods are demonstrated via extensive numerical experiments for the Singapore container port.",0191-2615,Not found
Strategic coopetition among transportation service providers considering supply–demand congestion effects and asymmetric bargaining power,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103043,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"The phenomenon of transportation service providers (TSPs) engaging in both competition and cooperation, commonly referred to as coopetition, has become increasingly prevalent in the transportation market. This is driven by the rapid advancements in information technology and sharing economy. In practice, competitive TSPs can engage in a resource exchange scheme to share their resources to improve their service quality. However, such a resource exchange scheme may not be sustained since the service prices and profits will be further changed due to the competition in the end market. This study proposes a two-stage sequential-move game to characterize the coopetition problem between TSPs, wherein the first-stage resource exchange problem is modeled with a Nash bargaining game, and the second-stage pricing problem is modeled with a non-cooperative Nash game. Different from prior studies, our model incorporates the supply–demand congestion effects and the asymmetric bargaining power of TSPs. The subsequent impacts on social welfare, TSPs, and end users are investigated. Analytical results show that only when the unit price of the exchanged resources decreases in the exchanged resource quantity will the resource-exchange scheme succeed. Furthermore, we find that TSPs prefer to leave some “buffer zone” in between to avoid fierce competition with price wars.",0191-2615,Not found
On-demand mobility-as-a-Service platform assignment games with guaranteed stable outcomes,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103060,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) systems are two-sided markets, with two mutually exclusive sets of agents, i.e., travelers/users and operators, forming a mobility ecosystem in which multiple operators compete or cooperate to serve customers under a governing platform provider. This study proposes a MaaS platform equilibrium model based on many-to-many assignment games incorporating both fixed-route transit services and mobility-on-demand (MOD) services. The matching problem is formulated as a convex multicommodity flow network design problem under congestion that captures the cost of accessing MOD services. The local stability conditions reflect a generalization of Wardrop's principles that include operators’ decisions. Due to the presence of congestion, the problem may result in non-stable designs, and a subsidy mechanism from the platform is proposed to guarantee local stability. A new exact solution algorithm to the matching problem is proposed based on a branch and bound framework with a Frank-Wolfe algorithm integrated with Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient optimization, which guarantees the optimality of the matching problem but not stability. A heuristic which integrates stability conditions and subsidy design is proposed, which reaches either an optimal MaaS platform equilibrium solution with global stability, or a feasible locally stable solution that may require subsidy. For the heuristic, a worst-case bound and condition for obtaining an exact solution are both identified. Two sets of reproducible numerical experiments are conducted. The first, on a toy network, verifies the model and algorithm, and illustrates the differences local and global stability. The second, on an expanded Sioux Falls network with 82 nodes and 748 links, derives generalizable insights about the model for coopetitive interdependencies between operators sharing the platform, handling congestion effects in MOD services, effects of local stability on investment impacts, and illustrating inequities that may arise under heterogeneous populations.",0191-2615,Not found
Alternative service network design for bus systems responding to time-varying road disruptions,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103042,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In practice, road disruptions occur frequently, interrupting multiple bus routes at the same time and causing widespread passenger delays. Typically, these disrupted roads are repaired sequentially and then gradually put into service. In response to such time-varying road disruptions, this paper aims to assist bus operators in developing effective alternative service networks for passengers. The proposed approach involves the joint optimization of service-based route adjustments, bus timetables, and passenger assignment to minimize the total passenger cost and weighted bus operation time. Specifically, a novel service-based adjustment strategy is introduced to flexibly adapt each bus service to time-varying road disruptions. An integer programming model is built for the studied problem based on the set of passengers’ time-space itineraries. To efficiently generate these time-space itineraries and solve models for large-scale problems, this paper develops a hierarchical solution framework. The framework consists of three key parts: (1) a column generation procedure to iteratively explore passengers’ spatial paths; (2) a customized extension algorithm to extend these spatial paths to time-space itineraries; and (3) a tailored adaptive large neighbourhood search heuristic to solve the final itinerary-based model. After that, the overall methodology is tested with both an illustrative example and a real-world example in Beijing. Experimental results show that our methodology produces a high-performance solution with only 7.3% of unserved passengers. Besides, compared to the two benchmark adjustment strategies, our service-based adjustment strategy reduces the average itinerary cost for all passengers by 27.0% and 43.3%, respectively.",0191-2615,Not found
Intermodal container terminal location and capacity design with decentralized flow estimation,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103092,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper studies an intermodal container terminal (IMT) location and design problem, where the IMT operator wants to locate a set of open-access IMTs and design their capacity levels to maximize its profit. Following the IMT operator’s decisions, network users, responsible for container transportation, will independently choose their routes and may procure intermodal services from the IMT operator. Since only limited information is available before the existence of the network, we employ the entropy maximization principle as a least-biased approach to estimate the flow distribution resulting from the network users’ route choices. This enables the IMT operator to predict profit and evaluate the quality of its network design decisions. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer bilevel nonlinear program, automatically embedding a decentralized flow estimation scheme into the optimization of IMT location and capacity design. By exploring the rationale behind the entropy maximization principle, our problem can also be interpreted as a leader–follower game, in which the IMT operator (as the leader) aims to maximize its profit and the network users (as the follower) maximize their welfare. Due to the bilevel structure and the nonlinear entropy function, the problem is extremely changeling. To support its application in real-world contexts, we propose both exact and approximation algorithms.

Tailored priority allocation in the bottleneck model with general user heterogeneity,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103093,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"We propose to enhance the efficiency of road bottlenecks by strategically implementing metering-based priority (MBP) schemes. Under MBP, a portion of the bottleneck capacity is reserved for priority users but made available for nonpriority users when no priority users are queueing. Previous studies have found that MBP is Pareto-improving regarding individual trip costs with homogeneous users, but its effectiveness becomes ambiguous when users have heterogeneous scheduling preferences. To address this, we consider a finite number of user groups with group-specified scheduling preferences. The design of optimal MBP schemes to minimize the total trip cost is formulated as a bilevel problem, allowing for varying fractions of priority users across groups. Under the identified conditions, convex optimization algorithms can be used to solve optimal MBP schemes. When these conditions are not met, we propose a general solution framework to find solutions with satisfactory accuracy. We study the theoretically optimal system efficiency achievable by MBP through numerical simulations. We also explore the benefits of integrating MBP with other travel demand management policies, such as high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Importantly, the implementation challenges of MBP schemes are also discussed, particularly the difficulty of distinguishing users based on their preferences. We investigate the efficiency of implementing optimal MBP schemes in an aggregated manner, emphasizing the significance of selecting appropriate aggregating patterns. We also propose a type of heuristic MBP scheme that ensures that nonpriority users’ departures can be unaffected by MBP. Such schemes are Pareto-improving and remarkably do not require observing individual preferences. These heuristic schemes can be decentralized by assigning priority status through pricing in certain cases. Numerical results demonstrate that the heuristic approach achieves comparable efficiency levels to optimal MBP schemes in considered scenarios.",0191-2615,Not found
Airline cabin crew pairing with accurate characterization of cross-class substitution: A branch-and-price approach,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103084,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Given the increasing heterogeneity of the types of aircraft operated, many airlines have switched from the traditional team scheduling approach to the individual scheduling approach for cabin crew planning. The individual approach not only allows for greater scheduling flexibility, but also helps achieve better utilization of available manpower through cross-class substitution (i.e., assigning a high-class crew member to substitute a low-class crew member), which is especially important in view of the recent industry-wide manpower shortage led by the post-pandemic traffic recovery. In this study, we present a new crew pairing approach with accurate characterization of cross-class substitution. This approach is novel as it can distinguish the substitutions among different pairs of crew classes with precise characterization of work time and costs. We develop a branch-and-price solution approach. A new specialized flight network that characterizes each crew class for each flight is constructed to realize the recognition of substitution heterogeneity. Although the size of the new flight network increases dramatically, it can be simplified to consider only one crew class for each flight in each column generation iteration without affecting optimality. We also propose a new column-fixing branching strategy to identify integer solutions for the newly developed model with non-negative integer variables. Computational experiments based on real-world collected flight schedules are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed approach in obtaining high-quality solutions (e.g., achieving a 0.01% optimality gap). The cost saving of the new crew pairing approach is examined, which is shown to vary greatly across different manpower availability levels and part-time cost settings. Besides, rich managerial insights are derived. Among others, we find that if it is expensive for a high crew class to directly substitute a low class (e.g., one that is experiencing a shortage), indirect assistance can be provided through an intermediate class.",0191-2615,Not found

The paper extends an expansion strategy with fixed demand recently published in Paulsen and Rich (2023). Accommodating induced demand requires that we can express how expansions of the network affect demand through changes in travel time, and also how demand contributes to the net present value function due to accumulated health and travel time savings. It is shown how the net present value function can be approximated through approximations of demand and consumer surplus functions enabling optimisation on a large scale. This process is formulated as a sequence of binary mathematical programs spanning the entire period. We test the approach by applying it to a large-scale network of Cycle Superhighways for Greater Copenhagen. It is demonstrated that the optimised infrastructure investment plan renders benefit–cost ratios exceeding 10 and that accounting for demand effects in the optimisation increases the societal net present value by more than 15% while also changing the geographical structure of the invested network.

In our previous work (Shao et al., 2016), we proposed a flow conservation system using turning ratios as prior information, and suggested that installing sensors on all exclusive incoming road links in the traffic network (called ""incoming layout"") can uniquely determine the flow information of all network links. However, the link flow observed by the sensor is inevitably subject to measurement errors, and there is also a risk that some deviation in prior information (i.e., turning ratios) will be propagated while extending flows over the whole network. Considering these two types of uncertainty, the ""incoming layout"" is not only a feasible solution, but in this study, has been proved to minimize the cumulative uncertainty in the process of inferring all link flows caused by the sensor measurement error and the deviation of prior information. Specifically, the superiority of the ""incoming layout"" is proved theoretically, including two cases. (i) Considering only the sensor measurement error, the error propagation theory is analytically expressed using the knowledge of linear algebra. The related error propagation matrix is found to be the key to help demonstrate that the cumulative uncertainty of the ""incoming layout"" is always smaller than that of the ""general layout"".

Impacts of a sustainable aviation fuel mandate on airline competition — Full-service carrier vs. low-cost carrier,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103098,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The aviation industry has proposed the collective goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In addition to the existing market-based methods (MBMs), the use of renewable energies, in particular, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), could be one of the most promising means for achieving this long-term target. This paper investigates how an SAF mandate from the government can lead to heterogeneous impacts on two types of airlines, namely, full-service carriers (FSCs) and low-cost carriers (LCCs), that compete in the same markets. A game-theoretic economic model is constructed that accounts for the different service quality levels and cost structures (i.e., fuel efficiency) between FSCs and LCCs. Our analytical results suggest that the SAF mandate favors LCCs over FSCs. The share of SAF blended into fuel raises the airfares of both types of airlines while reducing the traffic and profit of FSCs. The impacts on the LCC traffic and profit depend on its fuel efficiency relative to that of FSC. When LCCs are sufficiently fuel efficient, the SAF mandate can increase their traffic and profit. The government subsidy on airline's SAF use is also analyzed, deriving the optimal subsidy levels for FSC and LCC respectively to achieve pareto-improvement in social welfare and consumer surplus. We also examine how air passengers’ environmental awareness affects the outcomes of SAF mandate implementation. Our economic model also accounts for passengers’ heterogeneous preferences in terms of service quality and price sensitivity.",0191-2615,Not found

The model presented describes a spatial price equilibrium due to its reliance on the notion that freight movements occur in response to differences between the local and distant prices of goods for which there is excess demand; moreover, local and distant delivered prices are equated at equilibrium. We propose and analyze a differential variational inequality (DVI) associated with dynamic spatial price equilibrium to study the Nash-like aggregate game at the heart of DSPE using the calculus of variations and optimal control theory. Our formulation explicitly considers inventory and the time lag between shipping and demand fulfillment. We stress that such a time lag cannot be readily accommodated in a discrete-time formulation. We provide an in-depth analysis of the DVI's necessary conditions that reveals the dynamic user equilibrium nature of freight flows obtained from the DVI, alongside the role played by freight transport in maintaining equilibrium commodity prices and the delivered-price-equals-local-price property of spatial price equilibrium. By intent, our contribution is wholly theoretical in nature, focusing on a mathematical statement of the defining equations and inequalities for dynamic spatial price equilibrium (DSPE), while also showing there is an associated differential variational inequality (DVI), any solution of which is a DSPE. The model of spatial price equilibrium we present integrates the theory of spatial price equilibrium in a dynamic setting with the path delay operator notion used in the theory of dynamic user equilibrium. It should be noted that the path delay operator used herein is based on LWR theory and fully vetted in the published dynamic user equilibrium literature. This integration is new and constitutes a significant addition to the spatial price equilibrium and freight network equilibrium modeling literatures. Among other things, it points the way for researchers interested in dynamic traffic assignment to become involved in dynamic freight modeling using the technical knowledge they already possess. In particular, it suggests that algorithms developed for dynamic user equilibrium may be adapted to the study of urban freight modelled as a dynamic spatial price equilibrium. As such, our work provides direction for future DSPE algorithmic research and application. However, no computational experiments are reported herein; instead, the computing of dynamic spatial price equilibria is the subject of a separate manuscript.",0191-2615,Not found

This study investigates a train timetabling problem for the end-of-service period, which concentrates on the coordination of the service ending time on different lines and the last several train timetables. A mixed-integer linear programming model based on a space–time network is proposed to determine the number of train services provided in the end-of-service period while coordinating the timetables of both last and non-last trains, of which the objective function minimizes the number of inaccessible passengers and operation costs. To address the computational challenges, a Benders decomposition algorithm is developed and enhanced with dedicated acceleration strategies. A dual solution algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate the optimal dual solution of the subproblems. A reformulation and update strategy is proposed for the Benders cuts, and a relax-and-fix heuristic is developed to improve solving efficiency of the master problem. Small-scale numerical experiments demonstrate the optimality and efficiency of the proposed Benders decomposition algorithm. Large-scale experiments in the Wuhan network show that the proposed model and algorithm can improve passenger accessibility by 6.8% without additional operation cost, and by 38.7% with a 28.4% increment in operation cost.",0191-2615,Not found
The multi-compartment truck and trailer petrol station replenishment problem with domino hazard risks,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103078,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Petroleum is the foundation of the oil industry and many transportation systems. As a typical hazardous material, transportation of petroleum products by road trucks will create an explosion risk and pose a potential threat to safety. The petrol distribution system with economic viability and safety calls for a well-designed distribution network and effective transportation management. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-compartment truck and trailer petrol station replenishment problem with domino hazard risks, a topic of great practical significance but with limited research attention. The problem jointly optimizes truck routing-scheduling, trailer routing-scheduling, and inventory decisions for oil depots and petrol stations. The evaporation effects of petrol during the transportation, transfer, and inventory process are explicitly considered. Multi-source data are acquired to construct the weighted social factor, including population density, GDP output intensity, POI density, and travel intensity. The comprehensive risk assessment model tailored with the domino effect and social factor is applied to quantitatively measure the risks associated with storage and transportation processes. To tackle this complex non-convex multi-objective problem, we propose a problem decomposition strategy that decomposes the original master problem into two subproblems. A customized multi-objective adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm, combining the benefits of multi-objective random variable neighborhood descent search procedure, archived multi-objective simulated annealing, and hypercube-based selection mechanism, is developed to solve the trailer-related subproblem. For the truck-related subproblem, a first-in-first-out heuristic and a linear relaxation method combined with valid inequalities are employed to rapidly compute the upper and lower bounds. This integrated matheuristic framework effectively coordinates the solutions of the two subproblems. Our model is applied to a metropolitan-wide real-world case study in Guangzhou, China. The results highlight a trade-off between distribution cost minimization and social risk minimization. The detachable mode for trucks and trailers reduces transportation costs, particularly as the distribution network expands. The compartment structure of the trailer greatly affects the efficiency of the distribution network.",0191-2615,Not found
Robust convoy movement problem under travel time uncertainty,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103091,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"A convoy represents a collection of vehicles traveling with a spacing of 50–100 m between them for tactical purposes. The convoy movement problem is a variant of the vehicle routing problem, an NP-hard problem aimed at determining the paths and schedules of convoys. Given the uncertainties in travel times during wartime, attributable to various factors such as road conditions and enemy threats, it is essential to consider uncertain travel times when determining convoy paths and schedules. Therefore, this study introduces a robust convoy movement problem under travel time uncertainty. A polyhedral set for uncertain travel times is used to derive a robust counterpart for the problem. To solve the proposed problem, we establish an exact algorithm that determines optimal solutions by iteratively generating and integrating multiple paths of convoys. This algorithm involves four steps: generation of k-th robust shortest paths, construction of path combinations, adjustment of departure times, and conduction of optimality check. These steps are iterated sequentially until the optimal solution is obtained. In computational experiments, the exact algorithm demonstrates superior performance and reduced computation time compared with the commercial solver CPLEX on both real instances and randomly generated instances. In addition, we conduct a sensitivity analysis for several parameters related to the problem, providing valuable managerial insights for decision-makers.",0191-2615,Not found
Liner fleet deployment and empty container repositioning under demand uncertainty: A robust optimization approach,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103088,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper investigates a robust optimization problem concerning the integration of fleet deployment and empty container repositioning in a shipping line network, where a fleet of vessels is dispatched to transport both laden and empty containers, aiming to fulfill a predetermined set of requests over a defined time horizon. The sizes of customer demands are uncertain and are characterized by a budgeted uncertainty set. This study aims to ascertain the vessel types assigned to each shipping route, the routing of laden containers, and the repositioning of empty containers in a manner that minimizes the total cost. Simultaneously, it ensures the feasibility of all transportation plans for any realization of demand within the uncertainty set. We introduce a path-based two-stage robust formulation for addressing the problem. In the first stage, the assignment of vessel types to each shipping route is determined, and the second stage focuses on establishing the routing of laden containers and repositioning of empty containers under a worst-case scenario. We propose the Column-and-Constraint Generation algorithm for solving the proposed robust formulation. To address large-scale size instances, we propose an acceleration technique, i.e., the piece-wise affine policy, which reduces the dimensions of the uncertainty set while maintaining a bounded compromise in solution quality.

"An iterative method for integrated hump sequencing, train makeup, and classification track assignment in railway shunting yard",10.1016/j.trb.2024.103087,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"In a railway shunting yard, the transformation of inbound trains into properly composed outbound trains is a complex task because it involves decisions of multiple operations processes. This study addresses the integrated optimization of hump sequencing, train makeup, and classification track assignment problem in a railway shunting yard. Several key practical yard operation constraints are considered, including train formulation constraints, hump sequencing constraints, and limitations of the maximum number and capacity of classification tracks. By introducing a new representation of block flow, the integrated problem, which adopts the extended single-stage strategy and the train-to-track policy, is formulated as a unified 0-1 integer linear programming model. The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the weighted-sum of the total dwell time of all railcars and the formulation deviation penalties of all outbound trains. Then, an iterative two-phase decomposition approach is developed to reduce the complexity of solving the integrated problem. The first phase aims to explore all feasible humping sequences using a Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithm. Each time a new humping sequence is generated in the first phase, the second phase containing a Branch-and-Price (B&P) algorithm is applied to solve the integrated train makeup and classification track assignment problem with the known humping sequence found in the first phase. In addition, greedy heuristics and lower bounding techniques are designed in both phases to improve computational efficiency. Comprehensive experiments are investigated based on a set of real-life instances. The results show that exact approaches provide optimal solutions, whereas heuristic approaches yield satisfactory solutions within a shorter computation time. Moreover, sensitivity analyses on the number of classification tracks and the effects of different deviation penalties are also performed to gain more managerial insights.",0191-2615,Not found
Freelance drivers with a decline choice: Dispatch menus in on-demand mobility services for assortment optimization,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103082,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"With the prosperity of sharing economy, more part-time and freelance suppliers (i.e., drivers) join on-demand mobility services. Because of suppliers’ autonomy and behavioural heterogeneity, the platform cannot ensure that suppliers will accept a dispatch order. One approach to mitigate this supply uncertainty is to provide suppliers with personalized menus of dispatch recommendations. A key issue then is to determine which dispatch orders (that can be passenger or goods services) should be allocated into the assortment menu of each supplier. This paper probabilistically models the suppliers’ order acceptance and choice behaviour, including a decline option. We propose two assortment optimization problems, disjoint and joint menus, to maximize the expected number of matches. We show that the objective function of the disjoint menu assortment problem is monotone non-decreasing submodular. In contrast, the objective function of the joint menu assortment problem is non-monotone and non-submodular. Accordingly, we present a standard greedy (SG) algorithm to solve the disjoint assortment problem, and γ ∗ -greedy and local search (LS) algorithms for the joint assortment problem. By bundling orders into consolidated routes, this paper extends the proposed menu assortment methods to the context of meal delivery services. A case study is presented based on the real-world demand in the Manhattan road network. The results show that drivers’ autonomy to decline the dispatch orders creates substantial coexistence of idle drivers and unmatched orders in the market. The proposed menu assortment methods curb such matching friction. Moreover, the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the traditional dispatching policies applied in practice, e.g., one-to-one matching, in terms of platform efficiency, e.g., achieving more matches, customers’ experiences, e.g., reducing waiting time, and benefits for drivers, e.g., tapering off the income inequality among drivers.",0191-2615,Not found
An online auction-based mechanism for pricing and allocation of instant delivery services,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103086,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Recently, instant delivery has been growing rapidly, with numerous platforms emerging to offer such services. Requestors dynamically arrive at the platform to place delivery service requests that detail their pickup locations, recipient locations, package weights, departure times, and willingness-to-pay (WTP). The platform then uses its dedicated riders, scattered in different places, to fulfill these requests. Given the dynamic and fluctuating characteristics of the demand, coupled with limited rider resources and heterogenous pickup costs, the platform faces the critical problem of dynamically pricing the requests and assigning the riders to maximize social welfare. To address this problem, we propose an online auction-based transaction mechanism. Specifically, we first propose a scoring function to evaluate the values of the requests over multi-period operations taking into account the requests’ attributes, riders’ delivery costs, and resource availability. Based on the scoring function, we design a time-varying Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG)-like payment rule that can reflect the impacts of fluctuating supply-demand imbalances. Under this rule, a requestor will pay more during undersupply periods than during oversupply periods. To carve out the different impact degrees of the supply-demand imbalances, we further consider the linear, quadratic, and exponential time-varying resource parameters to construct the payment rule. In addition, we develop an online instant delivery resource allocation model to efficiently assign the riders to fulfill the accepted requests. We show that the proposed mechanism has desirable properties (individual rationality, budget balance, and incentive compatibility) and is computationally efficient. Furthermore, we give a lower bound for the mechanism efficiency. To validate the practicality of our mechanism and get some managerial insights into the operations of the instant delivery platform, we conduct numerical studies to compare the performance of our mechanism to the First-in, first-out (FIFO) allocation mechanism and to investigate the impacts of pricing functions, rolling horizon configurations, and rider numbers on the mechanism's performance.",0191-2615,Not found
An aggregate matching and pick-up model for mobility-on-demand services,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103070,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper presents an Aggregate Matching and Pick-up (AMP) model to delineate the matching and pick-up processes in mobility-on-demand (MoD) service markets by explicitly considering the matching mechanisms in terms of matching intervals and matching radii. With passenger demand rate, vehicle fleet size and matching strategies as inputs, the AMP model can well approximate drivers’ idle time and passengers’ waiting time for matching and pick-up by considering batch matching in a stationary state. Properties of the AMP model are then analyzed, including the relationship between passengers’ waiting time and drivers’ idle time, and their changes with market thickness, which is measured in terms of the passenger arrival rate (demand rate) and the number of active vehicles in service (supply). The model can also unify several prevailing inductive and deductive matching models used in the literature and spell out their specific application scopes. In particular, when the matching radius is sufficiently small, the model reduces to a Cobb–Douglas type matching model proposed by Yang and Yang (2011) for street-hailing taxi markets, in which the matching rate depends on the pool sizes of waiting passengers and idle vehicles. With a zero matching interval and a large matching radius, the model reduces to Castillo model developed by Castillo et al. (2017) that is based on an instant matching mechanism, or a bottleneck type queuing model in which passengers’ matching time is derived from a deterministic queue at a bottleneck with the arrival rate of idle vehicles as its capacity and waiting passengers as its customers. When both the matching interval and matching radius are relatively large, the model also reduces to the bottleneck type queuing model. The performance of the proposed AMP model is verified with simulation experiments.",0191-2615,Not found
Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of 1D and 2D traffic flows: Nonlocal models with generalized look-ahead rules,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103083,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper presents a study on traffic flow models in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) lattices. The models incorporate generalized look-ahead rules that consider nonlocal slow-down effects. The proposed cellular automata (CA) models use stochastic rules to determine the movement of cars based on the traffic configuration ahead of each car. Specifically, a look-ahead rule is used that considers both the car density ahead and a generalized interaction function based on the distance between cars. The CA models are simulated using an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm. The numerical results in 1D demonstrate that the flows from the KMC simulations align with the macroscopic averaged fluxes for the look-ahead rule, across various parameter settings. In the 2D results, a sharp phase transition is observed from freely flowing traffic to global jamming, depending on the initial density of cars.",0191-2615,Not found
Dynamic scheduling of flexible bus services with hybrid requests and fairness: Heuristics-guided multi-agent reinforcement learning with imitation learning,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103069,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Flexible bus is a class of demand-responsive transit that provides door-to-door service. It is gaining popularity now but also encounters many challenges, such as high dynamism, immediacy requirements, and financial sustainability. Scientific literature designs flexible bus services only for reservation demand, overlooking the potential market for immediate demand that can improve ride pooling and financial sustainability. The increasing availability of historical travel demand data provides opportunities for leveraging future demand prediction in optimizing fleet utilization. This study investigates prediction failure risk-aware dynamic scheduling flexible bus services with hybrid requests allowing for both reservation and immediate demand. Equity in request waiting time for immediate demand is emphasized as a key objective. We model this problem as a multi-objective Markov decision process to jointly optimize vehicle routing, timetable, holding control and passenger assignment. To solve this problem, we develop a novel heuristics-guided multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework entailing three salient features: 1) incorporating the demand forecasting and prediction error correction modules into the MARL framework; 2) combining the benefits of MARL, local search algorithm, and imitation learning (IL) to improve solution quality; 3) incorporating an improved strategy in action selection with time-related information about spatio-temporal relationships between vehicles and passengers to enhance training efficiency. These enhancements are general methodological contributions to the artificial intelligence and operations research communities. Numerical experiments show that our proposed method is comparable to prevailing benchmark methods both with respect to training stability and solution quality. The benefit of demand prediction is significant even when the prediction is imperfect. Our model and algorithm are applied to a real-world case study in Guangzhou, China. Managerial insights are also provided.",0191-2615,Not found
Local detouredness: A new phenomenon for modelling route choice and traffic assignment,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103052,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This study introduces the novel concept of local detouredness, i.e. detours on subsections of a route, as a new phenomenon for understanding and modelling route choice. Traditionally, Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) traffic assignment models have been concerned with judging the attractiveness of a route by its total route cost. However, through empirical analysis we show that considering solely the global properties of a route is insufficient. We find that it is important to consider local detouredness both when determining realistic and tractable route choice sets and when determining route choice probabilities. For example, analysis of observed route choice data shows that route usage tends to decay with local detouredness, and that there is an apparent limit on the amount of local detouredness seen as acceptable. No existing models can account for this systematically and consistently, which is the motivation for the new route choice model proposed in this paper: the Bounded Choice Model with Local Detour Threshold (BCM-LDT). The BCM-LDT model incorporates the effect of local detouredness on route choice probability, and has an in-built mechanism that assigns zero probabilities to routes violating a bound on total route costs and/or a threshold on local detouredness. Thereby, the model consistently predicts which routes are used and unused. Moreover, the probability expression is closed-form and continuous. SUE conditions for the BCM-LDT are given, and solution existence is proven. Exploiting the special structure of the problem, a novel solution algorithm is proposed where flow averaging is integrated with a modified branch-and-bound method that iteratively column-generates all routes satisfying local and global bounds. Numerical experiments are conducted on small-scale and large-scale networks, establishing that equilibrated solutions can be found and demonstrating the influence of the BCM-LDT parameters on choice set size and flow allocation.",0191-2615,Not found
Comparing hundreds of machine learning and discrete choice models for travel demand modeling: An empirical benchmark,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103061,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Numerous studies have compared machine learning (ML) and discrete choice models (DCMs) in predicting travel demand. However, these studies often lack generalizability as they compare models deterministically without considering contextual variations. To address this limitation, our study develops an empirical benchmark by designing a tournament model to learn the intrinsic predictive values of ML and DCMs. This novel approach enables us to efficiently summarize a large number of experiments, quantify the randomness in model comparisons, and use formal statistical tests to differentiate between the model and contextual effects. This benchmark study compares two large-scale data sources: a database compiled from literature review summarizing 136 experiments from 35 studies, and our own experiment data, encompassing a total of 6970 experiments from 105 models and 12 model families, tested repeatedly on three datasets, sample sizes, and choice categories. This benchmark study yields two key findings. Firstly, many ML models, particularly the ensemble methods and deep learning, statistically outperform the DCM family and its individual variants (i.e., multinomial, nested, and mixed logit), thus corroborating with the previous research. However, this study also highlights the crucial role of the contextual factors (i.e., data sources, inputs and choice categories), which can explain models’ predictive performance more effectively than the differences in model types alone. Model performance varies significantly with data sources, improving with larger sample sizes and lower dimensional alternative sets. After controlling all the model and contextual factors, significant randomness still remains, implying inherent uncertainty in such model comparisons. Overall, we suggest that future researchers shift more focus from context-specific and deterministic model comparisons towards examining model transferability across contexts and characterizing the inherent uncertainty in ML, thus creating more robust and generalizable next-generation travel demand models.",0191-2615,Not found
Exploring the sensing power of mixed vehicle fleets,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103066,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Vehicle-based mobile sensing, also known as drive-by sensing, efficiently surveys urban environments at low costs by leveraging the mobility of urban vehicles.

We formulate the drive-by sensing coverage (DSC) problem, proposing a method to quantify sensing utility and an optimization procedure that determines fleet composition, sensor allocation, and vehicle routing for a given budget. Our air quality sensing case study in Longquanyi District (Chengdu, China) demonstrates that using a mixed fleet enhances sensing utilities and achieves close approximations to the target sensing distribution at a lower cost.

Optimization of subsidized air transport networks using electric aircraft,10.1016/j.trb.2024.103065,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Electric aircraft represent a major technological breakthrough with a promise of revolutionizing aviation systems towards more sustainable and accessible services. Prominent electric aircraft prototypes feature limited seating capacity and short ranges, which make them well-suited for efficiently operating thin routes—particularly, regional routes serving remote regions—in the near future. To capitalize on this opportunity, this paper proposes an original optimization framework in support of the strategic design of subsidized air transport networks using electric aircraft. We first develop a quadratic optimization model to disaggregate air transport demand data based on demand generation and allocation properties, resulting in refined demand estimates at the territorial scale (instead of at the airport level). We then develop an integrated bi-objective optimization model for network and fleet planning, utilizing a novel time-space-energy formulation. This model aims to balance the two primary objectives of planning subsidized air transport networks: maximizing passenger surplus and minimizing system-wide subsidization costs, while incorporating detailed modeling of demand accommodation and electric aircraft operations. To address large-scale problems, we develop a solution approach involving reformulation and a tailored binary relaxation scheme. By considering a real-world case study of Sweden, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach and highlight its major insights—in terms of route network, fleet, number of chargers, flight schedules, fleet assignment and environmental emissions—with a comparison of conventional, electric, and mixed fleets. Our results demonstrate that a complete substitution of first-generation electric aircraft may diminish consumer surplus, while a combined use of electric and conventional aircraft yields superior solutions, resulting in higher passenger surplus and reduced emissions for the same subsidy spending.",0191-2615,Not found
