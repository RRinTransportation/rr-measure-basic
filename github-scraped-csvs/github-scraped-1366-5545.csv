The influence of aggregation level and category construction on estimation quality for freight trip generation models,10.1016/j.tre.2018.07.007,121,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper analyzes the impacts of aggregation level and category construction on the relevance and quality of freight trip generation (FTG) models. More precisely, constant generations and functional form models are compared, as well as activity and activity-workforce categories. The paper proposes a method to compare constant generation and functional form models on different category classifications based on MAPE estimations. Functional forms are assessed via linear regression and compared using Pearson coefficient. Results show that the aggregation level has not always a positive impact on the model’s accuracy and the choice of suitable functional form leads to more accurate models.",1366-5545,Not found

A disaggregate freight transport chain choice model for Europe,10.1016/j.tre.2018.10.004,121,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper presents the estimation of a discrete freight transport chain choice model for Europe, which was developed for the European Union as part of the Transtools 3 project. The model describes nine different multi- and single mode chain alternatives of which three can be either container or non-containerised, and it segments freight into dry bulk, liquid bulk, containers and general cargo. The model was estimated on the basis of disaggregate data at the shipment level (Swedish CFS and French ECHO data). Several transport costs specifications and nesting structures were tested and elasticities compared with reference literature. It was found that freight models are characterised by heterogeneity, non-linearity in transport costs and hence Value of Times and non-constant rates of substitution. Not taking these elements into account will have consequences for the evaluation of transport policies using the freight transport model.",1366-5545,Not found
"Joint mode and port choice for soy production in Buenos Aires province, Argentina",10.1016/j.tre.2018.04.010,121,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This study analyses the decision of port and mode choice of soy consolidators and producers from southern Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Nested logit models were estimated combining stated and revealed preference data. Estimations for Willingness to pay for one-day reduction in inventory, travel time, elasticities, iso-utility curves and hinterland were made. FAS (Free Alongside Ship) price, typically not considered, proved to be a relevant parameter in the mode-port choice. Other variables included were Service headway, freight price and travel time.

Dynamic freight flow modelling for risk evaluation in food supply,10.1016/j.tre.2018.03.002,121,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper presents a calibrated dynamic multi-scale multi-regional input–output (MSMRIO) model of the German food supply system based on real data. The model comprises 51 commodity groups from farm to fork differentiating three different temperature ranges as well as living animals. Spatially, it works on an aggregate level of 402 regions within Germany as well as its 50 most important trading nations. It determines the commodity flows and the additionally needed transport capacity in case of disruptions.

Discrete shipment size choice models are estimated for different homogenous segments formed by latent class analysis. A machine learning technique called Bayesian classifier is applied to link segments obtained from a sample to data of commodity flows being available on a national level. Finally, in an exemplary scenario, the impact of information and communication technologies on shipment size distributions is calculated, revealing moderate elasticities and a predominant substitution of less than truck loads by full truck loads.",1366-5545,Not found

Moreover, this study proposes the treatment of missing information as a latent variable by specifying a hybrid version of the joint copula-based model. Model estimates show the practicality of enriching a dataset with missing information via a robust econometric solution.

Entropy-based freight tour synthesis and the role of traffic count sampling,10.1016/j.tre.2017.10.010,121,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper describes a Freight Tour Synthesis (FTS) model designed to infer aggregate pick-up/delivery tour flows using secondary data, such as traffic counts and zonal freight trip generation estimates. The formulation combines an entropy maximization demand model together with the secondary data constraints. The entropy function is maximized subject to the system constraints to estimate the most likely freight tours that best fit the secondary data. To assess the role of traffic counts, the authors design four different heuristics to identify the locations of the traffic counts to be used in the estimation, and assess their performance under different scenarios of traffic counts availability.",1366-5545,Not found
Modelling change in supply-chain-structures and its effect on freight transport demand,10.1016/j.tre.2017.08.009,121,2019-01-01,2019,1,The paper introduces a model to determine possible impacts of changes in supply chain structures on freight transport demand. Examples are centralisation or vertical (des)integration within supply chains. The model first generates a population of establishments and commodity flows in space which is then manipulated according to different scenarios. It uses methods from transport planning and optimisation as well as scenario technique. To demonstrate its applicability a centralisation in food supply chain structures in Germany is analysed. The results show that a more educated discussion is needed for such changes since the range of possible impacts is large.,1366-5545,Not found
Assessing the impacts of collection-delivery points to individual's activity-travel patterns: A greener last mile alternative?,10.1016/j.tre.2017.08.007,121,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The transport impacts of collection-delivery points (CDPs), as an alternative to home delivery, are rarely studied. As e-shopping becomes increasingly popular, trips to collect deliveries at CDP, especially by car travel, may generate a considerable amount of external effects, such as emissions. Therefore, this paper analysed the “picking up/leaving goods” trips selected from the Swedish National Travel Survey and jointly modelled the individuals’ mode choice and trip chaining decisions using a panel cross-nested logit model. The roles of trip chain characteristics, individual socio-demographics and land use characteristics on each trip chain and mode choice combination are investigated. The results indicate observed and unobserved heterogeneities of trip chaining and mode choice decisions among populations. Young adults living with partners/spouses, single adults with children and partnered adults with children have the preference of using cars in collection-delivery trips compared to other life-cycle groups. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to estimate the effect of distance to CDPs on vehicle kilometres travelled. The calibrated model is used to estimate the VKT of collection-delivery trips in the greater Stockholm area. The results indicate a 22.5% reduction of VKT from collection-delivery trips by relocating 5% CDPs from urban areas to suburban and rural areas.",1366-5545,Not found
Duplicating nodes or arcs in green vehicle routing: A computational comparison of two formulations,10.1016/j.tre.2018.11.003,122,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This study addresses a family of green vehicle routing problems. A unified framework incorporating several key modeling aspects such as mixed fleets, refueling at customer and non-customer locations, and refueling policies into two competing formulations, namely node- and arc-duplicating is provided. Additionally, both formulations are strengthened via (i) two label setting algorithms to tighten the bounds of common variables, and (ii) improved lower bound on the number of routes.

Quantity discount pricing for rail transport in a dry port system,10.1016/j.tre.2019.01.004,122,2019-02-01,2019,2,A dry port is an inland intermodal terminal connected to a seaport via railways. This paper studies a rail transportation pricing problem with quantity discounts in a dry port system consisting of one dry port and multiple shippers. This problem is modeled as a Stackelberg game where the dry port is the leader and the shippers are followers. An all-units quantity discount pricing scheme with a single breakpoint is adopted. Optimal properties are analyzed and the global optimal solution is derived. Numerical studies are conducted to examine the effectiveness of quantity discount pricing under various scenarios.,1366-5545,Not found

We show that uniform pricing always reduces the online demand size and increases the retail price if the online logistics cost is low. Therefore, it can be a win-win-win solution for channel coordination, traffic congestion reduction and supply chain sustainability improvement. We also show that, an online-to-store channel might result in a high retail price and low online demand size, which benefits the retailer when the logistics cost is high.",1366-5545,Not found

"Pricing decisions for service platform with provider's threshold participating quantity, value-added service and matching ability",10.1016/j.tre.2018.12.020,122,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Affected by the online supply-demand matching, traditional pricing decisions cannot be applied to recent ‘online-to-offline’ (O2O) platforms, which should consider more about the features of the demander side, provider side and platform matching. Models with a profit-maximizing platform that considers the pricing decision effects of the provider’s threshold participating quantity, value-added service (VAS) and matching ability are developed in this study. Specifically, the main conclusions are divided into two parts: low-demand state and high-demand state. In the low-demand state, we show that the threshold participating quantity significantly affects pricing decisions when the basic demand is relatively low. There are two different critical values that make the pricing decisions into three cases. Second, regardless of the platform’s capital and the basic demand, the VAS always benefits the platform. Third, when the basic demand is relatively low and the threshold participating quantity is relatively high, the platform will not benefit from a higher matching ability, which is counter-intuitive. In the high-demand state, we show that the threshold participating quantity will not affect the pricing decisions. Second, developing the VAS still contributes to the improvement of platform’s profit. Third, different from the low-demand state, the platform’s profit always increases with the matching ability.",1366-5545,Not found
Overbooking and delivery-delay-allowed strategies for container slot allocation,10.1016/j.tre.2018.12.019,122,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Due to uncontrollable markets and unreliable factors in liner container shipping industry, the deviation between the actual and estimated shipment demand of containers always exists, resulting in a waste of shipping capacity or unfulfilled shipping requirements.

Extended consumer responsibility: Syncretic value-oriented pricing strategies for trade-in-for-upgrade programs,10.1016/j.tre.2018.12.016,122,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Nowadays, consumers play a central role in shaping the right retailing strategy. Motivated by the popularity of trade-in-for-upgrade (TIFU) programs in consumer electronics industries, this study adopts a multi-methodological approach to comprehensively explore TIFU-related behavioral pricing and market competition challenges. Grounded upon consumer psychology and behavior theories, this study develops a generalized consumer choice behavior model which takes into account the potential effect of reference dependence choice behavior. A behavior-grounded analytical model is established. Both analytical and quantitative empirical analyses using multiple empirical data sources are conducted. One distinctive feature of the proposed model is the conceptualization of vendor-buyer collaborative value orientation (termed as syncretic value orientation in this paper) in business objective functions, where we advocate that the extended consumer responsibility (ECR) should be incorporated into the modeling and analysis. In particular, this study derives a generalized form of the analytical model to determine the syncretic value-oriented prices and trade-in rebates under TIFU market competition. The results further reveal that involving the syncretic value in business objectives favors not only a price-leading firm’s expansion of market share but also gaining additional profits with a low-price-low-rebate strategy. Utilizing a low-price-high-rebate strategy, a price follower can seize the opportunity to lead in market share when the price leader solely sets profit maximization as its goal in a competitive market.",1366-5545,Not found

By comparing a hub-and-spoke network (HS), a point-to-point network (PP) and a mixed network (MX), we find the following. First, the optimal total flight frequency may be higher under HS than PP. Moreover, because of the inclusion of congestion delays, the optimal aircraft size is smaller under HS than PP, and the airline may choose PP even when the extra travel time disutility of one-stop services is relatively low. Finally, welfare analysis shows the airline’s inefficient bias towards PP.",1366-5545,Not found

Ownership concentration, measured as the ownership stake of the largest shareholder, reinforces the positive effect of freight rates on investment, indicating a higher relative efficiency of capital allocation. The positive impact ownership has on the investment-freight rate sensitivity also translates into higher firm value.

Modeling the effects of airline slot hoarding behavior under the grandfather rights with use-it-or-lose-it rule,10.1016/j.tre.2018.11.006,122,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The prevalent airport slot policy, based on the grandfather rights and use-it-or-lose-it rule, may induce the so-called slot hoarding behavior, i.e., airline intentionally operates excessive or even unprofitable flights. This paper develops a vertical-structured model to explore the effects of such slot policy on airline’s service decisions (flight frequency, aircraft size and airfare) and airline profit, and the resultant implications for a profit-maximizing airport or a welfare-maximizing airport. The effects of airline competition on slot hoarding behavior are also examined with an oligopoly competition model in which the carriers provide horizontally differentiated flight services. Analytical solutions are derived and compared with the “no slot policy” scenario. We find that the claimed negative effects of the slot policy on airport congestion may be overstated since an airline chooses to hoard slots if and only if the demand/capacity ratio is significantly low. When the airline has to hoard slots by operating excessive flights, it would use smaller aircraft, charge a higher airfare and serve more passengers. For a private airport, the slot policy may increase the airport’s profit by allowing the airport to transfer some of the negative effects of weak travel demand to airlines. For a public airport, the slot policy does not decrease social welfare unless passengers’ valuation toward frequency benefit is low. Finally, for airlines with equal access to airport slots, as the substitutability among airlines and/or the number of competing airlines increases, the incentive of slot hoarding decreases. Hence, regulators may expect a much milder negative effect of slot hoarding in a competitive aviation market.",1366-5545,Not found

Robot-storage zone assignment strategies in mobile fulfillment systems,10.1016/j.tre.2018.11.005,122,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The robotic mobile fulfillment system (MFS) is widely used for automating storage pick and pack activities in e-commerce distribution centers. In this system, the items are stored on movable storage shelves, also known as inventory pods, and brought to the order pick stations by robotic drive units. We develop stylized performance evaluation models to analyze both order picking and replenishment processes in a mobile fulfillment system storage zone, based on multi-class closed queueing network models. To analyze robot assignment strategies for multiple storage zones, we develop a two-stage stochastic model. For a single storage zone, we compare dedicated and pooled robot systems for pod retrieval and replenishment. For multiple storage zones, we also analyze the effect of assigning robots to least congested zones on system throughput in comparison to random zone assignment. The models are validated using detailed simulations. For single zones, the expected throughput time for order picking reduces to one-third of its initial value by using pooled robots instead of dedicated robots; however, the expected replenishment time estimate increases up to three times. For multiple zones, we find that robots that are assigned to storage zones with dedicated and shortest queues provide a greater throughput than robots assigned at random to the zones.",1366-5545,Not found

Reliable service systems design under the risk of network access failures,10.1016/j.tre.2018.11.002,122,2019-02-01,2019,2,"In service systems with natural or anthropogenic barriers (e.g., rivers, railroads), customers who intend to visit facilities for service must first pass through certain network access points (e.g., bridges, railway crossings). Possible blockage or disruptions of these access points could change the customer-facility assignments or even affect reachability of various facilities, and thus introduce facility reliability and correlation issues. This paper incorporates network access points and their probabilistic failures into a joint optimization framework. A layer of network access points are added and connected to facilities to imply the real-world connections between facilities and access points. The access points are assumed to be subject to disruptions with site-dependent probabilities.

Order timing and tax planning when selling to a rival in a low-tax emerging market,10.1016/j.tre.2019.01.014,123,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Many one-belt-one-road (OBOR) markets are attracting multinational firms (MNFs) by offering preferential tax policies. Being aware of this, should a MNF build a retailing division in the low-tax OBOR market for the benefits of tax-planning, especially when there exists local competition? To answer this question, we consider a co-opetitive supply chain comprising a Chinese MNF and his local rival, who buys goods from the MNF for reselling. The MNF has a manufacturing division located in a high-tax region and a retailing division in the low-tax OBOR market. Both the MNF’s retailing division (at a transfer price) and his local rival (at a wholesale price) source from the MNF’s manufacturing division. We focus on the MNF’s order timing decisions. Interestingly, we find that, the MNF might give up the first-mover advantage by charging his local rival a high wholesale price and reducing his own sales volume, when the tax difference is small. In contrast, when the tax difference is large, the MNF prefers early ordering and hence, charge the local rival a low wholesale price. We further study supply chain sustainability issues, and identify a moderate range of the tax difference, where the MNF’s early ordering results in both profitable sustainability and environmental sustainability.",1366-5545,Not found

Synchronizing e-commerce city logistics with sliding time windows,10.1016/j.tre.2019.01.007,123,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The cost-effective and high-quality city logistics service is a key for the success of e-commerce enterprises. Synchronization (sync) is emerging as a typical yet challenging requirement, which asks for simultaneous deliveries of multiple products to the same customer. This paper is among the first to model the sync constraints with sliding time windows (STW). STW is a special type of time window of which only the window size is defined. Unlike traditional time windows, the start and end time of STW could be adjusted earlier or later, so long as their difference equals to the pre-defined window size. In this sense, the STW is a time constraint with partially unknown factors. Such flexibility of STW can greatly improve the efficiency of vehicle tours, because customers could be served in a more flexible sequence decided by the transporter. A novel divide and conquer based algorithm is developed to tackle the proposed problem with partially unknown time constraints. The values for STWs will dynamically be determined during the algorithm. Numerical studies show that by modelling sync requirements with STW, transportation cost could be saved as much as in half. We also carry out sensitivity analyses on the key factors such as promised sync level to customers and the complexity of online orders.",1366-5545,Not found
Freight service network design with heterogeneous preferences for transport time and reliability,10.1016/j.tre.2019.02.008,124,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Value of time and value of reliability are two important user attributes that reflect shippers’ behavioral preferences, and as such influence the design of transport service networks. As shippers preferences will vary widely, it is important to consider these variations between users in the design of service networks. Up to now, network design research has ignored the combined use of time and reliability valuations for heterogeneous user populations. The objective of this paper is to address these attributes in a model for freight service network design targeting service performance improvement. We present a new frequency based service network design model with transshipments, capacity constraints and heterogeneous users. We apply the model to demonstrate that including heterogeneity explicitly in network design pays off in terms of an improved user performance of the network. A case study is conducted for a railway network in China. Values of time and reliability are estimated from a recent Stated Preference survey and used to determine distinct user classes. The proposed optimization problem is solved using an improved Simulated Annealing based heuristic method, for the case of the aggregate user group and the case of two distinct classes. Results show that by taking variations in shippers’ VOT and VOR into account, users’ total generalized cost is reduced while service levels improve.

While shipment size could be considered as an explanatory variable in modeling mode choice (or vice-versa), it is more likely that the decision of mode and shipment choice is a simultaneous process. A joint model system is developed in the form of an unordered choice model for mode and an ordered choice model for shipment size. We adopt a closed form copula-based model structure for capturing the impact of common unobserved factors affecting these two choices. Further, we explore alternatives to the traditional random utility structure in modeling mode choice. Specifically, we explore both the random utility (RU) based multinomial logit and the random regret (RR) minimization based multinomial logit (MNL) within a copula-based model. The shipment size is analyzed using ordered logit (OL) model within the copula structure. The RU and RR MNL structures are explored for several copula-based structures including Gaussian, Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM), Clayton, Gumbel, Frank and Joe. The proposed approach considers copula models with multiple copula-based dependencies within a single model. The copula-based model dependency is also allowed to vary across the data by parameterizing the dependency as a function of observed attributes. The models are estimated based on the data from 2012 U.S. Commodity Flow Survey data. The copula RRM based MNL-OL copula with Frank and Joe copula dependencies offered the best data fit indicating the strong interconnectedness between shipment mode and shipment size choice decisions.

Peer-to-peer collaborative consumption for fashion products in the sharing economy: Platform operations,10.1016/j.tre.2019.03.016,126,2019-06-01,2019,6,"With the advance of platform technologies, peer-to-peer collaborative consumption (P2P-CC) is getting very popular for fashion products in the sharing economy. With this arrangement, one important implication to consumers is that the fashion product’s value seems to be larger with P2P-CC than without. Motivated by the observed industrial practice on P2P-CC for fashion products, we construct stylized models and conduct an analytical study in this paper. We analytically prove that comparing between the operations with and without P2P-CC, the presence of P2P-CC always benefits the fashion brand (i.e. the firm) as well as the consumers who buy the product. For the relative benefits brought by P2P-CC between the firm and consumers, we prove that the firm’s expected profit is double compared to the consumers under the case without P2P-CC. However, this proportion is smaller under the case with P2P-CC. Regarding the platform, we find that it is beneficial for the platform to adopt the revenue sharing scheme, instead of the fixed service charging scheme, even though adopting either one does not change the qualitative conclusion on the benefits of P2P-CC. To check the robustness of results, we extend the model and conduct further analysis to highlight the impacts brought by the fashion brand’s advertisement decisions, the presence of different consumer segments, and the probable service delivery charge. We uncover that the main derived conclusion remains true in all these extensions. Managerial implications are then discussed.",1366-5545,Not found

To address this problem, we propose a location–allocation model that divides the topography of affected areas into multiple layers; considers constrained number and capacity of facilities and fleets; and allows decision-makers to explore trade-offs between response time and logistics costs. To illustrate our theoretical work, we apply the model to a real dataset from the 2015 Nepal earthquake response. For this case, our method results in a considerable reduction of logistics costs.",1366-5545,Not found
Storage space sharing among container handling companies,10.1016/j.tre.2019.05.001,127,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper discusses the possibility of sharing container storage space among different container handling companies in a port. For the implementation of storage space sharing, this study proposes methods for allocating shared spaces efficiently to participating companies and for allocating costs to them. Two cost allocation methods, which are based on a linear programming (LP) model, are proposed: one using dual variables of the LP model and the other using the Lagrangian multipliers of the relaxed LP model. It is proved that the cost allocation, determined by the two methods, is an imputation in the core of the cooperative game. Using numerical experiments, it is shown that a heuristic cost allocation method based on the Lagrangian multipliers satisfies ideal properties that the competitive, as well as, the cooperative game should have.",1366-5545,Not found

Insights on strategic air taxi network infrastructure locations using an iterative constrained clustering approach,10.1016/j.tre.2019.06.003,128,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Expected to launch globally in the forthcoming years, air taxis are brand-new aviation ridesharing services that will be provided by international logistic pioneers. This study is one of the first to estimate the demand for such a service and provide recommendations on the potential location of facilities to support this network operations. We adopt a two-phase approach: phase-1 estimates the demand for air taxi services by taking a subset of the regular taxi customers who are likely to avail this service, and phase-2 proposes a constrained clustering approach, with multimodal transportation-based warm start technique, to identify potential sites for locating infrastructures based on the estimated demand. We test the feasibility of the proposed approach using millions of real-life New York City taxi records. Results indicate that large facilities with a capacity of nearly 150 landings/hour have to be established in JFK International Airport and South Central Park, while smaller stops are required in World Trade Center, Washington Square and Allerton Ballfields. In addition, we evaluate the impact of the commuter’s “willingness to fly” rate, demand fulfillment rate and time-cost tradeoffs. Our analysis shows that the percentage of time savings and “willingness to fly” rate did not significantly impact location decisions and the number of sites, while it is necessary to conduct an intense market study to determine on-road travel limits.

We study the effectiveness of online solution algorithms for this proposed strategy. Queueing-theoretic vehicle dispatch and idle vehicle relocation algorithms are customized for the problem. Several experiments are conducted first with a synthetic instance to design and test the effectiveness of this integrated solution method, the influence of different model parameters, and measure the benefit of such cooperation. Results suggest that rideshare vehicle travel time can drop by 40–60% consistently while passenger journey times can be reduced by 50–60% when demand is high. A case study of Long Island commuters to New York City (NYC) suggests having the proposed operating strategy can substantially cut user journey times and operating costs by up to 54% and 60% each for a range of 10–30 taxis initiated per zone.

The supply chain consists of a dominant manufacturer and a newsvendor retailer, both of whom may be inequity-averse. Their utility function involves disadvantageous inequity aversion when their trade partner’s profit is regarded as the reference point. Considering the availability of information on the distribution function of market demand, we build an analytical model to derive equilibrium results in three scenarios and then compare them with the results obtained in a normative retailer situation. We show that, in the absence of information on the distribution, for any given wholesale price, the retailer will choose to “under-order” as long as disadvantageous inequity occurs. If the environmental constraint is not binding, the risk-neutral manufacturer will keep the green level unchanged, whereas the inequity-averse manufacturer will reduce it. If the constraint is binding, the manufacturer will increase the green level in response to the reduction of order quantities. As a result, the equilibrium-expected profit of the manufacturer may decrease. The manufacturer can control the impact of the retailer’s inequity aversion by selecting an appropriate combination of wholesale price and green effort level.",1366-5545,Not found

In the PI-RE decision mechanism, two emission control policies—carbon tax and carbon cap & trade are implemented. Numerical analysis is demonstrated to show the application of the models, and the managerial implications are put forward.

A robust optimization for a home health care routing and scheduling problem with consideration of uncertain travel and service times,10.1016/j.tre.2019.05.015,128,2019-08-01,2019,8,"In today’s competitive environment, one of the most critical objectives for Home Health Care (HHC) companies is to meet the demand of patients in a timely fashion. According to the feedback from HHC companies, caregivers have to deal with some uncertainties when carrying out a given schedule to visit their patients. However, a majority of the previous work only considers the deterministic models which ignore the uncertainties, and solutions obtained by these deterministic models are usually less robust in case of any possible changes in practical situations. Inspired by this point, in this work, we formulate a model for an HHC Routing and Scheduling Problem with taking into account uncertain travel and service times, from the perspective of Robust Optimization (RO). Specifically, the non-deterministic variables are defined based on the theory of budget uncertainty, and then the arrival time of each caregiver is rewritten as a complicated recursive function. After that, Gurobi Solver, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Variable Neighborhood Search are adapted to solve the model respectively. Finally, a series of experiments have been performed to validate the proposed models and algorithms. Experimental results from Monte Carlo simulation highlight the strength of considering uncertainties when modeling the problem. Additional, the influences of other characters in instances, like the width of time-window, distributed location have also been empirically analyzed.

Our results for the basic model show the following: (1) Coordinating the purchase quantities from both suppliers does not always increase the channel’s and the assembler’s profits. (2) The assembler obtains the highest profit under a quantity-payment contract with sequential contracting. (3) The supplier with private information and the channel both prefer a two-part tariff contract over a quantity-payment contract.

This method obtains the solution values related to the Lagrangian and uncapacitated relaxation problems and performs a regression analysis with these identified solutions and the optimal values to generate the optimal solution patterns. The generated knowledge pertaining to these optimal patterns is extended from small- to large-sized problems using the extrapolation and quadratic regression approaches. When solving large-sized problems, the method employs the extrapolated knowledge in a local search procedure to fix some of the variables and combines an optimization method to solve the reduced-sized problems. We compare this optimization method with other existent methods in the literature. The computational results indicate that with the use of the same computational resources, our optimization method can identify supply chain decisions at lower costs.",1366-5545,Not found

Canal effects on a liner hub location problem,10.1016/j.tre.2019.09.002,130,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The Panama Canal and the Suez Canal are two key canals around the world, both of which have a great number of connections with other ports because of various liner shipping service routes. Liner carriers can facilitate container transshipment operations by opening hub ports around the canal. This paper aims to investigate canal effects on hub location in liner shipping. Different from the conventional hub location problem with fixed costs, our hub location problem with fixed costs can be reduced to a p-median problem, while addressing the research issue considered in the conventional hub location problem with fixed costs. In order to describe canal effects, besides its geographic location, this paper mainly considers three aspects: canal toll, canal congestion, and ship capacity limitation when passing through a canal. Several binary linear programming models are mainly developed for our hub location problem considering canal effects. Moreover, a theoretical analysis is also developed for simplified hub location around a canal. Numerical results show that ship capacity limitation has a bigger impact on hub location around a canal, as compared with canal toll and canal congestion. Such phenomenon can be partly supported by the theoretical analysis. This insight to some extent justifies the recent canal expansion projects to widen or add a new lane waterway for the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal, respectively.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal parking supply in bi-modal transportation network considering transit scale economies,10.1016/j.tre.2019.09.003,130,2019-10-01,2019,10,"In this paper, we investigate the optimal parking supply when considering the transit scale economies in a bi-modal network. Firstly, we formulate auto travel cost and transit travel cost and discuss the scale economies of transit service. Considering passenger’s waiting time, travel time and in-vehicle crowding cost, the function of transit travel cost is no longer monotone, but a “U” shape. Secondly, we derive the bi-modal equilibrium without parking restraint and analyze the uniqueness of the equilibrium. Then, we investigate the bi-modal equilibrium with parking restraint. When parking spots are inadequate, drivers would depart earlier to obtain parking spots and deadweight loss arises from competition for parking spots. It was found that parking permits distribution is very efficient in reducing the deadweight loss in Zhang et al. (2011). Thirdly, we study optimal parking supply with the schemes of no management and parking permits managements and analytically discuss the implication of restricting parking supply and parking permits distribution in a single OD pair. It is revealed that total travel costs do not always decrease as the provision of parking spots increases and there is an optimal provision of parking spots at the destination. Meanwhile, the optimal parking provision is discussed in the various schemes of parking permit distribution and trading with consideration of scale economy of transit in a many-to-one network.

Integrated reconfiguration of both supply and demand for evacuation planning,10.1016/j.tre.2019.08.016,130,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Evacuation planning is a challenging task due to the suddenly increased large transportation demand in emergency situations. The imbalance between demand and supply of transportation systems is the key problem during evacuation. Existing literature has tried to increase the traffic capacity but not to reduce the demand. This paper proposes a novel integrated reconfiguration strategy that reconfigures both the supply and demand sides of transportation systems; in particular, the evacuation demand is reconfigured using a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles and the traffic capacity supply is reconfigured through a heterogeneous contraflow technique. Four strategies, i.e., do-nothing, supply reconfiguration, demand reconfiguration, and integrated reconfiguration, are compared. The general integrated strategy is formulated as a bi-level programming model which is solved by a two-layer algorithm composed of the tabu search (TS) and priority-based minimum cost flow (P-MCF) algorithm.

Being fair or efficient? A fairness-driven modeling extension to the strategic airport slot scheduling problem,10.1016/j.tre.2019.08.010,130,2019-10-01,2019,10,"An increasing thrust of research has recently explored scheduling methods and models with a view to allocating efficiently scarce airport slots among competing airlines, a problem also known as strategic airport slot scheduling. Existing models have mainly placed the research focus on scheduling efficiency objectives, while it was only recently that fairness considerations were introduced in relevant literature. Borrowing principles from congestion pricing, our paper capitalizes on the conjecture that the intensity of congestion and delay phenomena are strongly affected not only by the demand volumes but also the temporal distribution and peaking characteristics of demand. Hence, we propose a fairness-informed extension of the strategic airport slot scheduling model aiming to ensure that each airline absorbs its “fair share” of congestion in the form of additional schedule displacement exerted onto other competing users. The results of the proposed model are demonstrated and validated in two IATA schedule coordinated airports in Portugal and Greece. The newly proposed fairness weights penalize mostly the “big contributors to congestion”, assigning them with higher displacement weights on the basis of “the contributor pays” principle. Furthermore, we assess the “cost of fairness” by quantifying the impacts of fairness-driven scheduling on efficiency and various Level of Service indicators. The main findings of our research suggest that the adoption of the proposed fairness-driven scheduling approach may come at reasonable “cost” particularly at low or moderate fairness levels as compared to the previous “fairness indifferent” case.",1366-5545,Not found

We demonstrate that the relation between the volatility of futures prices and the slope of the forward curve is non-monotonic and convex, that is, it has a V-shape.

We develop a stylized two-period model in which either the retailer or the manufacturer could decide to invest in GPD in the second period. We find that the manufacturer investing in GPD is dominating because both supply chain members could earn more and the manufacturer could save more on the environmental tax. Under certain conditions, the prices are lower in the second period. However, the corresponding demand in the second period is always lower than the first period when the products become green.",1366-5545,Not found

Discrete-time dynamic road congestion pricing under stochastic user optimal principle,10.1016/j.tre.2019.09.009,131,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Road pricing is believed to be an effective instrument for alleviating roadway congestion. Most existing road pricing schemes are developed based on traditional static traffic equilibrium models, in which a fixed toll can be obtained to support the corresponding traffic flow pattern as an equilibrium. However, static models cannot consider the evolution process of traffic flow caused by the day-to-day fluctuations of road users’ route choices. Under practical traffic conditions, the multiple traffic equilibria may exist (e.g., due to the asymmetric travel cost function). Indeed, the fixed road pricing scheme derived from the equilibrium model cannot guarantee that the dynamic traffic system can converge to the desired equilibrium state from any initial traffic state. This study, assuming that travelers follow the stochastic user optimal principle, develops a day-to-day dynamic road pricing scheme that can drive the traffic dynamic system to converge to a given stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) even when the traffic system has multiple SUE states. The characteristic of this dynamic road pricing scheme is verified by rigorous proof and numerical tests in this study.",1366-5545,Not found

Using data of residential travel survey in Shenzhen, China in 2014, this paper investigated how built environment affected transit travel in urban villages where low-income group resided, and they are all tenants. Structural equations modelling was employed to express the effects of socio-economic, public transit service related and built environment variables on travel mode choice, travel time and distance, with control for residential self-selection. It is found that after considering the self-selection effect, the influence of density and transit availability on travel distance, travel time and transit mode choice in urban villages are still significant. For urban villages, transit availability matters greatest for transit promotion, but the negative effect of density on transit mode choice and none effect of mixed land use are unusual as previous findings. This is partly because of relatively low income, low car ownership, and less elastic travel demand of tenants living in urban villages. Our findings provide some insights into transit-oriented urban renewal that when transforming urban villages, emphasis should be put on enhancement of transit availability, and the mixed land use could be put in the last consideration when there is limited time and funds.",1366-5545,Not found

We focus on the impact of deviations from target capital structure on mergers and acquisitions (M&A); an increasingly important corporate growth vehicle for shipping companies, with directly measurable outcomes. Deviations from optimal leverage display a strong association with the likelihood to consummate acquisitions, deal size, the financing method as well as the M&A outcome.

In this paper, two-stage stochastic programming models are proposed to illustrate the problem, and a numerical test is conducted to better understand the effects of physical risks. The mechanism for controlling risk will be forward physical contracts. The results show that the real financial risk is much higher than the importer might believe if physical risks are not considered. Unless the importer is risk neutral, more forward crude oil will be imported when physical risks are considered, and the distribution of forward crude oil will depend strongly on correlations among risks.",1366-5545,Not found

The algorithm formulates the deviation path calculation process as repeated one-to-one searches for the shortest path in a dynamic network, where only a node and a link are restored at each search. Using this formulation, the proposed algorithm maintains and updates a single shortest path tree rooted at the destination. A re-optimization technique, lifelong planning A*, is incorporated into the algorithm to efficiently calculate each deviation path by reusing the shortest path tree generated at the previous search. To verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments were conducted using several real road networks, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm performed significantly better than state-of-the-art algorithms.",1366-5545,Not found
"Manufacturer's financing strategy in a dual-channel supply chain: Third-party platform, bank, and retailer credit financing",10.1016/j.tre.2019.101820,133,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The third-party platform channel has been widely used in addition to the traditional retail channel to sell products. In practice, some third-party platforms provide financing services to small businesses that sell products on them. However, few studies addressed the capital constraint problem faced by a manufacturer who sells products through both retailers and third-party platforms, especially when considering the third-party platform’s lending service behavior. This research establishes a model where a capital-constrained manufacturer sells products through a retailer and a third-party platform and may pursue a financing strategy by borrowing from the third-party platform (3PF), the retailer (RF), or the bank (BF). We investigate the impact of the third-party platform’s or retailer’s dual role—lending provider and channel participant—on dual-channel operational management and study the manufacturer’s financing strategy choices by comparing profits under different financing strategies. The results of our analysis show that for the manufacturer, the 3PF strategy is always better than the BF strategy. Furthermore, the manufacturer is more likely to prefer the RF strategy to the 3PF strategy as the channel competition increases or as the revenue sharing rate or unit production cost decreases. We also find that the retailer’s retail price increases as the revenue sharing rate increases if there is no capital constraint, but it decreases under the BF and 3PF strategies. This indicates that the manufacturer’s financing behavior has a significant impact on the retailer’s retail price decision. We extend our model by considering random demand and find that these findings continue to hold when the potential demand equals its expected value.",1366-5545,Not found
Modelling a closed-loop supply chain with a heterogeneous fleet under carbon emission reduction policy,10.1016/j.tre.2019.11.007,133,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The paper studies a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) focusing on managing, scheduling and routing problems to achieve economical and environmental sustainability. Generally, a logistic based green supply chain is studied to help multiple stakeholders. Here, we investigate the CLSC to reduce the total transportation cost including carbon emission from a heterogeneous fleet with limited capacity. The forward chain includes manufacturers, depots, distributors/collectors and customers. In the reverse chain, the distributors collect the returned items and sort into three groups through quality-screening and send them to the secondary chain facilities (emerging markets or decomposition centres) which one is fitted. This investigation is contributed by all the demonstrating issues through considering customers’ demand, an extensive emission display and the vulnerability of an expanded convey of vehicles. The proposed model addresses four distinct environmental policies viz. cap, carbon tax, cap-and-purchase and cap-and-sale for carbon emission regulations.

Intelligent logistics integration of internal and external transportation with separation mode,10.1016/j.tre.2019.10.011,133,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Many multinational companies operate their business in both domestic and overseas markets with different logistics modes, namely freight transportation by truck for domestic and short-haulage transshipment by container for overseas. To effectively optimize these operations for the two types of logistics systems, we propose an intelligent integration of external and internal transportation with the separation of drayage trucks and containers. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes both fixed and variable costs. The fixed cost occurs when the drayage truck is incurred in integrating transportation, and the variable cost is generated per travel distance increment. By dividing customers into different subsets and proposing a special penalty matrix, we provide an intelligent model that integrates the internal and external container transportation problems. A customized genetic algorithm is proposed. Based on the instances of real-life data on 888 orders, the results show that our approach can reduce the overall cost by 16.8%.",1366-5545,Not found
New approaches for solving the convoy movement problem,10.1016/j.tre.2019.10.007,133,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The convoy movement problem (CMP) involves the routing and scheduling of a large number of vehicles and personnel across a network. A convoy is a group of (typically, army) vehicles and personnel that travel together as a group. Given the nature and context of these movements, it is necessary to avoid convoys crossing each other at a node, overtaking, or crossing each other on a road as they travel in the network from their individual origins to their destinations. The lengths and travel speeds are also major factors that determine the optimal travel paths and schedules for these convoys. In this paper, we review different variants of the CMP in the literature. We then propose a generalised problem statement for the CMP that accommodates all common variants. This generalised problem definition addresses several important side constraints that typically occur in real-world problems. We adapt and enhance existing formulations of the CMP in such a way that the generalised version can also be modelled. Further, we propose new approaches for solving large instances of the generalised CMP. Our computational experiments show that the techniques introduced in this paper substantially outperform existing approaches in the literature.

Intelligent service capacity allocation for cross-border-E-commerce related third-party-forwarding logistics operations: A deep learning approach,10.1016/j.tre.2019.101834,134,2020-02-01,2020,2,"With the rise of “cross-border-e-commerce”, the third-party-forwarding-logistics (3PFL) service becomes increasingly popular. Different from the traditional third-party-logistics (3PL) service, the 3PFL company provides forwarding services cost-effectively by consolidating orders from different e-tailers/platforms. The random arrivals of orders create a big challenge. Different from most of the existing studies, a deep learning based one-step integration optimal decision making approach S2SCL(Seq2Seq based CNN-LSTM) is proposed in this paper which intelligently integrates inventory optimization and demand-forecasting process. The Seq2Seq based forecasting architecture, which integrates CNN and LSTM network, is able to model the system dynamics and dependency-relations in varying demand for logistics services. Besides generating the point forecasting results, the proposed approach can quantify demand uncertainty via a dynamic distribution and make optimal decision on logistics service capacity allocation. Through a case-study analysis with real data obtained from a 3PFL company in China’s Great Bay Area, we compare the proposed S2SCL with two benchmark models, including a one-step statistics based integration approach ARIMA and a two-step optimization based approach PSO-ELM, for two tasks: (1) point forecasting and (2) optimal logistic service capacity (LSC) allocation.

Gift card payment or cash payment: Which payment is suitable for trade-in rebate?,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101857,134,2020-02-01,2020,2,"New trade-in services such as online trade-in, trade-in on e-commerce platforms and omni-channel trade-in, are emerging due to the development of e-commerce. To offer these new trade-in services, firms need to determine the optimal product price and rebate and decide whether to pay the rebate with a gift card (G) or cash (C). To address these challenges for firms, our paper considers a firm selling a new product to new consumers and offering a trade-in service to replacement consumers. In addition, we develop theoretical models to examine the optimal decisions in the cases of G and C and explore the optimal payment for the rebate. We reveal that G payment is a better choice for the firm only if the used product residual value is relatively low and the market size ratio between replacement and new consumers is relatively low; otherwise, the firm should choose C payment. Interestingly, replacement consumers’ preferred trade-in rebate payment (i.e., C payment) leads a lower trade-in demand than G payment and C payment may be harmful. In the extension, we consider a firm with online and offline sales channels and different types of replacement consumers who own different used products, and find that our main results regarding the optimal rebate payment still hold. Moreover, we find that in the context of a used product with a relatively medium residual value, firms with online and offline sales channels are more likely to choose G than firms with one sales channel; otherwise, firms are more likely to choose C.",1366-5545,Not found

Analytical results show that CEA significantly affects green product diffusion in terms of firms’ pricing strategies and market shares. The market structure also has effects on diffusing a green product: the pricing strategies and environmental performance of diffusing a green product in a Bertrand competition market are different from those in a Stackelberg game market. When considering green-design decision, it is interesting to show that the green product’s price decreases with the increase of CEA, which is contrary to the pricing strategy without green design. From the numerical study of the CEA-featured WOM diffusion case, we find that CEA-featured WOM does not affect the pricing strategies of the green and conventional products, but does have a significant impact on the market shares of both products.",1366-5545,Not found

Multiple equilibrium behaviors of auto travellers and a freight carrier under the cordon-based large-truck restriction regulation,10.1016/j.tre.2019.101829,134,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The cordon-based large-truck restriction regulation (CBLTRR) makes large truck based cargo movement process interrupted because large trucks are deterred from moving into some specified areas within given time periods. As a result, cargoes carried by a large truck need to be transferred from the large truck to small ones at a freight distribution center (FDC) for the last few miles. This study aims to analyze the multiple equilibrium behaviors for auto travellers and one freight carrier under the CBLTRR. A link flow based generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) model is first developed to characterize mixed routing behaviors of these two types of users. In the model, auto travellers follow first Wardropian principle to find their individual shortest paths, while the freight carrier minimizes its total freight cost. We then proceed to explore the existence and uniqueness of pure strategy equilibrium, and reduction to variational inequality. When the pure strategy equilibrium does not exist or is intractable, we propose an approach to construct a mixed equilibrium with restricted action space (i.e., the path choice set) (called restricted mixed equilibrium). The restricted action space is formed based on recurring best-responses of two types of users which could reflect their actual interactive decisions of a non-cooperative traffic pattern evolution.

There exists a unique coefficient of credit guarantee for the supplier to decide whether to provide a trade credit. Numerical studies and extension are discussed to obtain more managerial implications.",1366-5545,Not found

When blockchain meets social-media: Will the result benefit social media analytics for supply chain operations management?,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101860,135,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Social media analytics is very critical in modern supply chain operations management (SCOM). However, in terms of methods, conducting social media analytics (SMA) for SCOM faces many challenges. Problems such as data accuracy (e.g., fake data), user privacy, data security, etc. are all present. Recently, with the emergence of blockchain technology (BCT), many new social media apps and platforms are developed. Motivated by the fact that (i) SMA is important for SCOM, (ii) the traditional social media (TSM) has insufficiency, and (iii) the “blockchain technology supported social media” (BSM) platforms have emerged, we explore whether and how the BSM would enhance social media analytics for SCOM. To be specific, by reviewing papers published in leading SCOM journals, we identify the applications and limitations of SMA for SCOM. Then, we conduct real case studies to examine the shortcomings of the TSM platforms and reveal features of their BSM counterparts. We investigate how the blockchain technology would potentially improve the use of SMA for SCOM. Finally, a future research agenda is proposed.",1366-5545,Not found
The optimal speed in container shipping: Theory and empirical evidence,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101903,136,2020-04-01,2020,4,"By focusing on several critical speeds, this paper proposes a simple and applicable method to seek the optimal speed for carriers. The results show that carriers will reduce ship speed if the saved fuel cost outweighs the incurred capital and operating costs. The measure of critical fuel prices at different critical speeds is powerful to examine the optimal speed. Meanwhile, deploying extra ships and calling extra ports could be an optimal strategy for carriers in implementing slow steaming.

Predicting the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on global supply chains: A simulation-based analysis on the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) case,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101922,136,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model’s behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks.

Hundreds of aid workers are killed, injured, or kidnapped when delivering supplies on the road each year. We propose the humanitarian flying warehouse (HFW) as a solution to these issues. The HFW is an airship that stays at high altitudes and uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deliver supplies. This innovation will enable safe and timely delivery to hard-to-reach populations in a manner that significantly exceeds the capacity of current practices. Crucially, the HFW eliminates the motivations behind many delivery disruptions. These disruptions are caused by asymmetric commons dilemmas: entities with different accessibility and power race to grab shared relief goods before others. The problem we address is the operation of HFW to make safe and timely delivery of critical items such as health supplies to the hard to reach populations. This study constitutes proof of concept for the HFW system in conflict zones through a multi-objective mathematical model.

Order batch picking optimization under different storage scenarios for e-commerce warehouses,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101897,136,2020-04-01,2020,4,"To improve the operational efficiency of e-commerce warehouses, multi-location storage systems which means each stock keeping unit can be stored in multiple locations or a location can contain multiple stock keeping units, have been developed and applied in practice. When orders are picked in a batch, how to select the picking location from storage locations holding the identical stock keeping unit obviously affects how far the pickers must travel to complete the picking tasks. However, few works have systematically studied how to optimize order batch picking from the perspective of different storage systems. This paper formulated the order batch picking optimization problems for three typical storage systems and developed the algorithm package including location interval distance algorithm, location selection algorithm, routing algorithm and order batching algorithm to tackle them. Our work is particularly capable to covering the situation of multi-location storage system. The numerical experiment results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm combinations is satisfactory to solve the problems with different size both in solution quality and computation efficiency. The applicable algorithm combinations used in practice are also recommended by comparative analysis.

Service purchasing and market-entry problems in a shipping supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101895,136,2020-04-01,2020,4,"In the shipping industry, forwarders can purchase a “one-stop” service from an ocean shipping (OS) company or a dual “ocean + inland” service from an OS company and an individual inland shipping (IS) company. Additionally, the OS company can strategically decide whether or not to enter the downstream market for cargo-canvassing, which will form a co-opetition relationship with incumbent forwarders. We investigate a strategy matrix based on the following two questions: “What kind of shipping service should be purchased by the forwarder?” “Is it beneficial for OS company to enter the market?” We find that when the forwarder’s cargo-canvassing effort level is low, a dual-service purchasing strategy will benefit both the stakeholders, while market-entry is a self-interested behavior and hurts the forwarder. Enhancing the cargo-canvassing effort level may help the forwarder to overcome this dilemma. However, with an increasing level of effort, there is a mutual inhibition of dual-service purchasing and market-entry, which hurts both the stakeholders’ profits simultaneously. Interestingly, we show that a win-win situation exists when the forwarder adopts a dual-service purchasing strategy without market-entry. Furthermore, we verify that this win-win situation is Pareto-optimized.",1366-5545,Not found

Weight-categorized truck flow estimation: A data-fusion approach and a Florida case study,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101890,136,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Knowledge of spatial distributions of weight-categorized truck flows in a region is critical to the understanding of movements of empty or partially-loaded trucks and devising appropriate strategies to reduce empty or partially-loaded truck flows and improve truck utilization efficiency in the region. However, such disaggregated information cannot be directly obtained from existing data sources and models. In this paper, we propose a compact model for estimating weight-categorized truck origin–destination (OD) flows and link-level truck counts by fusing several freight datasets. The proposed model minimizes the squared errors between the estimated and observed truck OD flows and link volumes considering the flow conservation of trucks and commodity weights. To illustrate a real-world application of this model, a case study is conducted to estimate the spatial distribution of empty or partially-loaded truck flows into, within, and out of the State of Florida. With the case study results, high production- and attraction-zones of empty or partially-loaded truck trips are also identified. Such results can potentially inform freight planning and policy decisions to learn spatial patterns of empty or partially-loaded backhauling truck flows and devise countermeasures to reduce such flows and improve freight transportation efficiency.

Co-op supply chains with a local media company: Models and analysis,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101893,136,2020-04-01,2020,4,"A cooperative (co-op) advertising program is an incentive scheme in which a manufacturer shares its retailers’ local advertising costs. Such programs have received increasing academic attention in the past two decades. However, the local media company, as the agent of local advertising, has been ignored by previous literature. Another practical aspect being ignored is that the manufacturer only shares the retailer’s local media advertising cost – the retailer’s in-store advertising cost is not subsidized. To investigate the role of local media companies in co-op advertising programs, we focus on a system consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer, and a local media company. With a co-op advertising model incorporating these two previously ignored aspects, we derive the equilibrium decisions of the three members. Our results show that the local media company should implement a differential pricing strategy based on co-op, i.e., to offer retailers a discount if manufacturers provide them co-op, and all three members can benefit from such a strategy. In addition, different from the classic conclusion, we find that in some condition the manufacturer’s participation rate may increase in the retailer’s marginal profit.

Information sharing is a strategy often used in collaborative mechanisms, and we investigate information sharing and study its effect on carbon emission reduction. We construct a formal Bayesian forecast updating model and find out that information sharing benefits the supplier but hurts the retailer. Demand information sharing has no impact on global emission reduction but significantly reduces the “wasted emission”, i.e., emission from producing unwanted products. Upgrading manufacturing technology provides an incentive for the retailer to share information with a highly cost-efficient supplier to achieve the reduction of global emission and wasted emission. Meanwhile, consumers’ green awareness strengthens this effect. We extend the model to investigate the impact of additional ordering cost in QR mode and risk-averse decision making behaviors, assessing information sharing’s effects in these cases. We demonstrate that information sharing can amplify treatments’ positive effects and diminish the measures’ negative influences when applied in the supply chain.

Issues of supply chain efficiency and coordination are addressed. A platform supply chain is also investigated, and it is found that a platform may invest in reducing the channel cost even if it does not bear any part of this cost. In this case, the percentage fee is found to be an important parameter.",1366-5545,Not found
"Pricing, ordering, and quick response for online sellers in the presence of consumer disappointment aversion",10.1016/j.tre.2020.101925,137,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Consumers are usually uncertain about the product value in the online channel. They may feel disappointed if the outcome is worse than their prior expectation. This paper explores the effect of consumer disappointment aversion on the online seller’s decisions about pricing, ordering and quick response, where the seller can implement either a partial-coverage strategy or a full-coverage strategy. We identify conditions under which the seller should choose a partial-coverage strategy to target only “high-value” consumers. Furthermore, we show that disappointment aversion has a significant impact on the employment of quick response. In particular, when the degree of disappointment aversion is sufficiently high, the seller who implements a no-refund policy should not adopt quick response. Finally, we find that the effect of consumers’ disappointment aversion on the seller’s profit depends on the latter’s return policy. If the seller provides no refund to consumers, disappointment aversion is always detrimental to the seller. However, a seller who provides a full refund to consumers may benefit from disappointment aversion. Particularly, it is profitable to adopt a full-refund policy when disappointment aversion and salvage value exceed certain thresholds.",1366-5545,Not found
Reverse channel design with a dominant retailer and upstream competition in emerging markets: Retailer- or manufacturer- collection?,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101924,137,2020-05-01,2020,5,"By considering different regulations on retailers’ recycle responsibly (the retailers in emerging markets are “encouraged” to collect used products while those in developed markets are “required” to do so), we study a dominant retailer’s collection decision under upstream competition. The equilibrium collection model and effort are derived under different regulations. We find that the lenient regulation in the emerging markets is more likely to induce a socially inefficient equilibrium, and the strict regulation in the developed market induces a socially efficient equilibrium. The results suggest that the policymaker should motive the retailer to undertake more collection responsibility when the intensity of upstream competition is not too low.",1366-5545,Not found
Maritime port network resiliency and reliability through co-opetition,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101916,137,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Local and global economies are for many nations highly dependent on the import and export of goods. These goods are shipped through global intermodal (IM) freight land-water transportation systems that rely on truck, rail and maritime networks and their IM terminals. These terminals are crucial to creating and maintaining efficient international trade routes. This paper considers port reliability and resilience, as well as the role of ports in supporting a larger resilient maritime system. Specifically, stochastic, bi-level, game theoretic optimization models for assessing and improving the resiliency and reliability of the global port network are presented. Proposed models are devised for a set of independent ports with interacting investment problems for competitive, but potentially cooperative (co-opetitive) environments. Uncertainties in traversal times and port throughput capacities are accounted for by adopting a stochastic optimization method using expected or max-min functions to simultaneously hedge against the consequences of multiple possible future port-related disaster events. Alternative centralized, but stochastic formulations are also provided. This stochastic, co-opetitive methodology and alternative centralized methods fill an important gap in the maritime resiliency literature.",1366-5545,Not found

We examine the associated market value with sustainable practice adoption of luxury firms from an institutional theoretical lens and an identity mismatch perspective. Based on 289 announcements made by public luxury firms, results from event study show that the stock market reacts negatively to the announcements of sustainable practices. Nevertheless, the negative effect attenuates in more recent year announcements, and more profitable and smaller luxury firms.

Evacuating offshore working barges from a land reclamation site in storm emergencies,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101902,137,2020-05-01,2020,5,"This paper investigates a barge evacuation planning problem (BEPP) that can arise during land reclamation projects. The problem was motivated by the issue faced in actual practice by the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). In this problem, a fleet of heterogeneous barges working at an offshore land reclamation site needs to be evacuated to coastal shelters prior to the arrival of a storm. Having no propulsion power of their own, these barges must be towed by tug boats in order to be evacuated. The problem under consideration is very complicated since it involves a series of inter-correlated assignment and scheduling decisions at different planning levels. To solve the problem, this paper first formulates the problem as a nonlinear Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. The model is then linearized. We further proved that the BEPP is NP-hard in the strong sense. In view of the complexity of the problem, a tailored heuristic method is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments and a case study are performed, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the solution method. Land reclamation projects have become increasingly popular in recent years, and the proposed method is applicable to solving BEPPs arising in similar scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found

"Sustainable efforts, procurement outsourcing, and channel co-opetition in emerging markets",10.1016/j.tre.2020.101960,138,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Emerging markets have witnessed the logistics volume surge along with economic growth, which also brings environmental issues such as packaging waste. Therefore, many responsible logistics service providers (LSPs) are observed to put efforts in developing sustainable logistics. Such efforts improve the LSP’s brand image to expand the market potential, and benefit the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who use the LSP’s logistics service. In this paper, we consider an OEM and a LSP’s preferred outsourcing structures by incorporating the LSP’s sustainable efforts and the competition with the OEM when it has the self-branded business. The introduction of sustainable efforts alter the LSP’s cost structure, and eventually, the supply chain parties’ preferences over the OEM’s procurement outsourcing. For the OEM, the bundled outsourcing (outsourcing both procurement and logistics functions to the LSP) does not necessarily yield a lower procurement cost than only outsourcing the logistics, because the LSP possesses sufficient service pricing flexibility. Interestingly, the LSP prefers the OEM’s bundled outsourcing when the OEM’s brand image advantage is either not significant or very significant. The driving force is the tradeoff between the profits from product sales and outsourcing services. Lastly, we compare the environmental performances under alternative outsourcing structures, showing the simultaneous improvement of the OEM’s profits, the LSP’s profits, and the environmental performance is achievable when the OEM outsources the bundled functions of procurement and logistics.",1366-5545,Not found

Analysis of the air cargo transport network using a complex network theory perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101959,138,2020-06-01,2020,6,"In this paper, we present a complex network analysis of the air transport network using the air cargo, instead of the passenger, perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work where a global cargo network comprising passenger airlines, full-cargo airlines, and integrators’ capacity was studied. We used estimated yearly cargo capacity between airport pairs as input to the model. After assessing network characteristics of the sub-networks representing different carrier types, the full network was obtained as a super-imposition of the individual sub-networks. The resulting network has both small-world and scale-free characteristics. Its topological properties resulted in a higher flow imbalance and concentration with respect to its passenger counterpart, with a smaller characteristic path length and diameter. This result is consistent with the larger catchment area of cargo airports, which heavily rely on road feeder services for the ground leg. Finally, we showed how different attack strategies result in hubs of hub-and-spoke systems or airports behaving as bridges between communities being attacked first. We believe this work to be of relevance both for academics and for practitioners in an era where, due to the soaring of e-commerce and next day delivery, new players are entering the air cargo business and competition is constantly increasing.",1366-5545,Not found

Adaptive large neighborhood search for the time-dependent profitable pickup and delivery problem with time windows,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101942,138,2020-06-01,2020,6,"The rise of e-commerce has increased the demands placed on pickup and delivery operations, as well as customer expectations regarding the quality of services provided by those operations. One strategy a logistics provider can employ for meeting these increases in demands and expectations is to complement and coordinate its fleet operations with those of for-hire, third-party logistics providers. Herein, we study an optimization problem for coordinating these operations: the time-dependent profitable pickup and delivery problem with time windows. In this problem, the logistics provider has the opportunity to use its fleet of capacitated vehicles to transport shipment requests, for a profit, from pickup to delivery locations. Owing to demographic and market trends, we focus on an urban setting, wherein road congestion is a factor. As a result, the problem explicitly recognizes that travel times may be time-dependent. The logistics provider seeks to maximize its profits from serving transportation requests, which we compute as the difference between the profits associated with transported requests and transportation costs. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm. The results of our extensive computational study show that the proposed algorithm can find high-quality solutions quickly on instances with up to 75 transportation requests. Furthermore, we study its impact on profits when explicitly recognizing traffic congestion during planning operations.",1366-5545,Not found
Integrated optimization on yard crane scheduling and vehicle positioning at container yards,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101966,138,2020-06-01,2020,6,"A container yard is a storage facility that allows handling resources to improve operational efficiency by facilitating container flows at a container terminal. The container yard system consists of a set of storage blocks with yard cranes performing stacking and unstacking operations for containers to be transported by vehicles. High operational efficiency can be achieved by managing and coordinating the handling operations of yard cranes and vehicles (e.g., the yard crane scheduling, vehicle job dispatching, and coordinating handshakes between yard cranes and vehicles). This study proposes an integrated optimization approach for simultaneously determining the yard crane schedules and the vehicle parking positions under the Chebyshev movement allowing for the simultaneous movement of gantry and trolley of the yard crane. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated to optimize the problem, and the two-stage heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently.

Not controlling such disasters brings about severe disruptions in the supply chains and communities and, thereby, irreparable losses will come into play. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of these disasters that has caused severe disruptions across the world and in many supply chains, particularly in the healthcare supply chain. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, develops a practical decision support system based on physicians' knowledge and fuzzy inference system (FIS) in order to help with the demand management in the healthcare supply chain, to reduce stress in the community, to break down the COVID-19 propagation chain, and, generally, to mitigate the epidemic outbreaks for healthcare supply chain disruptions. This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system (namely, very sensitive, sensitive, slightly sensitive, and normal) and by two indicators of age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure). Then, these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class.

Such a transfer incurs a cost that nonetheless may be compensated by savings both in the installation costs and in the distribution costs. Mixed-integer mathematical programming models are proposed for the problem. A distinction is made between the case in which the triangle inequality holds for the transfer costs and the case in which it does not. We present compact models, which are enhanced with valid inequalities that are separated in a branch-and-cut fashion.

Development of a two-stage ship fuel consumption prediction and reduction model for a dry bulk ship,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101930,138,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Shipping industry is the backbone of global trade. However, the large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), cannot be ignored.

In this study, a two-stage ship fuel consumption prediction and reduction model is proposed for a dry bulk ship. At the first stage, a fuel consumption prediction model based on random forest regressor is proposed and validated. The prediction model takes into account ship sailing speed, total cargo weight, and sea and weather conditions and then predicts hourly fuel consumption of the main engine. The mean absolute percentage error of the random forest regressor is 7.91%. At the second stage, a speed optimization model is developed based on the prediction model proposed at the first stage while guaranteeing the estimated arrival time to the destination port. Numerical experiment on two consecutive-8-day voyages shows that the proposed model can reduce ship fuel consumption by 2–7%.

A reactive phase against disruptions for designing a proactive platelet supply network,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102008,140,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Previous studies in blood supply chain network design often follow a commonly used approach in protecting the chain against disruptions, considering the effects of disruptions on the designing phase. However, in many real-world situations, disruptions cannot be adequately measured in advance. Moreover, using disruptions in the designing phase through the common two-stage stochastic programming models impose high costs on the network, since they cannot be updated based on unpredicted disruptions. This paper proposes an updatable two-phase approach which deals with disruptions in the operational phase, not in the strategic design phase. In the first step, called the proactive phase, a nominal platelet supply chain network is designed under operational uncertainty, using the whole-blood collection method. In the event of disruptions, the second step, called the reactive phase, is applied, and the tailored network is updated based on the realized data, using apheresis as the collection mechanism. The operational risks are captured using a fuzzy programming approach in the model.

Moreover, the copycat will be less likely to enter the market when the manufacturer releases a fighter brand. Some insights regarding consumer surplus and social welfare are also provided.",1366-5545,Not found
Behavioral and technical perspectives of green supply chain management practices: Empirical evidence from an emerging market,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102013,140,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Recently, companies in emerging markets have implemented green supply chain management (GSCM) practices to tackle environmental issues. Drawing upon socio-technical systems theory, this study develops a conceptual model suggesting a sequential effect between two distinct categories of GSCM practices, namely behavioral (human and soft aspects) and technical (tangible and hard aspects) practices, on performance. We employ structural equation modeling method to test hypotheses based on survey responses from 200 Chinese manufacturers. The categorization of behavioral and technical GSCM practices and research findings contribute to the GSCM literature. Statistical results demonstrate the complete mediation effect of technical GSCM practices (e.g., green design, green manufacturing and reverse logistics) on the relationship between behavioral GSCM practices (e.g., relationship with customers and suppliers) and organizational performance. Such results recommend that companies in emerging markets should highlight behavioral GSCM practices first and then implement necessary technical GSCM practices to reap economic, environmental and operational performance.",1366-5545,Not found
Combined maritime fleet deployment and inventory management with port visit flexibility in roll-on roll-off shipping,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101988,140,2020-08-01,2020,8,"We consider a combined fleet deployment and inventory management problem in Roll-on Roll-off shipping. Along given trade routes there are ports with inventories that should be kept within their limits. Current planning practice is to visit all ports every time a trade route is serviced. We instead aim at determining the sailing routes of each voyage along the trade route, where some ports can be skipped on certain voyages. A novel mixed integer programming model is proposed and tested on realistic instances. The results indicate that substantial gains can be achieved from this more flexible way of planning.",1366-5545,Not found

An eigenvector centrality analysis of world container shipping network connectivity,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101991,140,2020-08-01,2020,8,Container shipping accounts for most of the world merchandise trade. Better maritime connectivity leads to lower freight rates and greater economic growth. This paper presents a novel max–min integer optimization model to facilitate better shipping network connectivity by analysing the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of the (asymmetric) frequency weighted adjacency matrix. An algorithm is presented that can quickly identify which link not currently in the container shipping network would best improve its connectivity. A demand matrix is not required by this method of analysis and network symmetry is not assumed. The method could strengthen direct connection between port pairs.,1366-5545,Not found

This problem considers not only classical assumptions of the intermodal transportation, but also introduces the availability of containers as a new concept. For this purpose, we first describe the industrial context and provide the mathematical optimization model which combines a set of known and new constraints. We then propose a solution approach based on variable neighborhood search algorithm combined with pairing and insertion heuristics, as well as with variable neighborhood descent and tabu search methods. Optimization has then been embedded into a simulation model which designs the rail/road terminal. To be more specific, this optimization model can be used to evaluate several distribution policies, which results in a set of routing decisions and can adopt the best policy in a distribution network with competing rail and road transport services.

Scheduling the distribution of blood products: A vendor-managed inventory routing approach,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101964,140,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Blood shortage may lead to immeasurable losses. But the perishable nature of blood products limits the possibility of storing a large amount of it, and the quality of blood products reduces rapidly with transportation time. Specifically, in China, the management of blood products is even more complicated due to the significant demand for clinical blood, which increases every single year because of the reformation of the health system and the resulting scale expansion of hospitals. In this research, we aim to optimize the blood product scheduling scheme by constructing a vendor-managed inventory routing problem (VMIRP) for blood products, which balances the supply and demand such that the relevant operational cost is minimized. Then a decomposition-based algorithm is developed to solve the proposed mathematical model efficiently. Based on a series of numerical experiments of platelets, we obtain and examine the distribution plan and optimal transportation path over the planning horizon. In addition to the illustrated high algorithm efficiency, the computation results show that the VMIRP scheme can considerably decrease the operational cost of the blood supply chain.",1366-5545,Not found

Such a single-path constraint is motivated by currently emerging requirements in bulk transportation, express delivery, hazardous material transportation, etc. We model this problem with two mathematical formulations, i.e., node-arc and arc-cycle formulations, both of which lead to large-scale and computationally difficult mixed-integer programs. The node-arc formulation faces a significant computation burden. To that end, we develop a two-stage mathematical integer programming based heuristic for the arc-cycle formulation to produce high-quality solutions. In the first stage, a column generation procedure is executed to generate an optimal solution for the linear relaxation of the restricted master problem, and in the second stage, four heuristic strategies are designed to efficiently generate integer feasible solutions for the original problem. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach by comparing it with a commercial solver (CPLEX). We also examine the performance differences among four heuristic strategies, in terms of the frequency of finding integer feasible solutions and the quality of solutions.",1366-5545,Not found

We hence study two competing luxury brands’ production outsourcing decisions by incorporating tradeoffs among competition intensity, origin preferences, and quantity limits. Interestingly, we find that when luxury brands have the option, they tend to outsource production to an overseas contract manufacturer even when origin preferences for overseas goods are not strong and the downstream competition is mild. Correspondingly, if a brand’s rival has no outsourcing options, its profit might be hurt when origin preferences for overseas goods and competition intensity are both moderate.",1366-5545,Not found

A non-myopic atomic game is formulated to address competition for parking through assignment of vehicles to candidate parking facilities that takes into account the differences in travel times for the vehicles from their point of origin to the parking facilities and the differences in walking times for the drivers from the parking facilities to their final destination, as well as dynamic pricing, cruising times, and occupancies of the parking facilities. This study integrates a socially efficient price that accounts for the waiting times of drivers in their search for parking. We incorporate a game model into the social optimum problem by considering the competition of drivers for parking spaces where the drivers’ preferences are reflected in a collective decision such as social welfare.

Among them, many service operations, which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the “static service operations” to become the “bring-service-near-your-home” mobile service operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers.

We consider the case of environmentally aware customers that request to ship orders with no more than a specified amount of greenhouse gases, which establishes so-called emission limits. In order to ensure that a routing plan complies with each order’s emission limit, it is necessary to estimate emissions caused by the used transport services and to allocate these emissions to the orders. We model this problem under cost-, emission- and service-objectives and apply it to an intermodal rail/road network in Europe.",1366-5545,Not found

Increasingly, platforms emerge as facilitators for this kind of collaborative transportation. However, individual actors connected to a platform might refuse to share (parts of) their information due to reasons of competition. Though the need for realistic information sharing models is widely acknowledged by transportation researchers and practitioners, the precise value of such information is mostly unknown. We investigate the quality of solutions that can be obtained when different types and levels of carrier data are available. We consider an auction-based Multi-Agent System to solve large-scale, dynamic pickup and delivery problems, and vary whether carriers’ positions or route plans are available, and whether carriers are fully cooperative or more competitive in placing their bids by sharing or hiding their marginal costs. In total, we evaluate 9 different information sharing policies. The availability of vehicle position and route plan information turns out to be important for decreasing total route costs, and sharing marginal costs has a positive impact on service level. We provide detailed insights into trade-offs of carriers’ confidentiality concerns and a range of system performance objectives (service level, travel costs, and carrier profits) under different circumstances (various numbers of auctions, penalties for rejected orders, emission or congestion fees, and different problem characteristics). Based on these results, platform providers can stimulate sharing of certain information to improve the total system efficiency.",1366-5545,Not found
Tolerance-based column generation for boundedly rational dynamic activity-travel assignment in large-scale networks,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102034,141,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Boundedly rational dynamic activity-travel assignment (BR-DATA) endogenously integrates activity-travel scheduling and dynamic traffic assignment to determine the interaction between land use transport supplies and activity-travel demands of boundedly rational travelers. The combinatorial explosion of activity-travel patterns (ATPs) involving multi-dimensional choice facets poses severe challenges to the model applicability in large networks. This study refines a tolerance-based column generation (TBCG) algorithm for solving BR-DATA problems in multi-state supernetworks without ATP enumeration. The refined TBCG algorithm employs spatial-temporal exploration to allocate activity-travel flows only to potential ATPs in the intermediate assignment process. The spatial-temporal exploitation intensifies ATP generation and network loading, which results in fewer iterations and ultimately substantial speedups compared with the original column generation algorithm. We prove that the TBCG algorithm is capable of finding solutions that satisfy the BR-DATA user equilibrium conditions. A series of numerical examples demonstrate that the TBCG algorithm has a speedup factor larger than two whilst producing approximately the same BR-DATA solutions as the original column generation algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found
Modular transit: Using autonomy and modularity to improve performance in public transportation,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102033,141,2020-09-01,2020,9,"In this paper we investigate a new form of automated public transportation, named ‘modular transit’, configured to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional bus, including the first- and last-mile problem, low occupancy, and low levels of comfort, accessibility, and flexibility.

Using our model, we first analyze how adoption of BOPS affects a retailer’s optimal prices, total demand and profit under consistent and inconsistent pricing strategies where a retailer employs the same pricing strategy both before and after BOPS implementation. We then conduct a comparative analysis of the two pricing strategies, discussing which one is most profitable to the retailer. Subsequently, we analyze the scenario where a retailer uses consistent pricing before BOPS adoption and inconsistent pricing afterwards and the scenario where a retailer uses inconsistent pricing before BOPS adoption and consistent pricing afterwards. We conduct numerical studies to obtain insights on when BOPS is most advantageous and which pricing strategy is better to use. Our study results show that BOPS is not always beneficial to the retailer, depending on the unit operating cost and customer hassle cost in the BOPS channel and the cross-selling profit. We also identify under what conditions a retailer is better off under different scenarios.

We analyze both when the O2O platform has self-scheduling delivery capacity and when it does not. We find that two widely used pricing schemes—revenue sharing and fixed fee—are equivalent. If the O2O platform does not itself have any self-scheduling delivery capacity, it outsources home-delivery service to a delivery platform, which may result in incentive misalignment. We find that it is not always necessary for the O2O platform to coordinate the decentralized system. Under some conditions, the decentralized system will yield higher profit than the centralized system due to the risk protection effect. If coordination is needed, we propose subsidy contracts for the O2O platform to align its and the delivery platform’s objectives.",1366-5545,Not found

Identifying the role of stated process strategies in business location decisions,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102028,141,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Discrete choice studies are increasingly used in urban planning to understand preferences and to make informed decisions based on its outcomes. Traditional discrete choice modelling approaches have evolved in a setting in which some very specific behavioural assumptions are made in specifying decision-making. These assumptions have given rise to the study of alternative process strategies in decision-making, such as majority of confirming dimensions (MCD), attribute non-attendance (ANA), or value learning (VL). In this paper, a stated choice experiment was designed to understand business location decisions, where a location specialist had to compare their current location with two alternative locations. After each choice task, respondents were asked whether they used ANA in processing the choice tasks, and at the end of the experiment a number of questions were asked to identify whether specific process heuristics were used such as MCD and VL. Choice models were estimated to compare the influence of including different stated heuristics responses as conditioning effects. The results show that the model which included the stated heuristics responses is superior in terms of the goodness of fit and in the estimates’ significance levels than the model that assumes everyone might be using the heuristics. The willingness to pay estimates derived from a traditional model were statistically equivalent to the ones derived from the stated multiple heuristics model. However, the median WTP derived from the stated multiple heuristics model was slightly lower and the confidence intervals higher than in the traditional model.",1366-5545,Not found
Reversible lane network design for maximizing the coupling measure between demand structure and network structure,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102021,141,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This paper investigates demand-originated reversible lane design plans for transportation networks, where the tidal and asymmetrical characteristics of the demand structure are taken into consideration.

Specifically, this study first defines a coupling measure to quantify the relationship between network structure and demand structure. Then, focusing on maximizing the coupling measure, a nonlinear bilevel mixed-integer programming model is presented to find the optimal lane combination strategy in the considered network from the viewpoint of systematology. For solving the proposed model, we design heuristic algorithms to obtain its approximate optimal solution.

Risk-averse optimization of disaster relief facility location and vehicle routing under stochastic demand,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102015,141,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Disasters such as fires, earthquakes, and floods cause severe casualties and enormous economic losses. One effective method to reduce these losses is to construct a disaster relief network to deliver disaster supplies as quickly as possible. This method requires solutions to the following problems. 1) Given the established distribution centers, which center(s) should be open after a disaster? 2) Given a set of vehicles, how should these vehicles be assigned to each open distribution center? 3) How can the vehicles be routed from the open distribution center(s) to demand points as efficiently as possible? 4) How many supplies can be delivered to each demand point on the condition that the relief allocation plan is made a priority before the actual demands are realized? This study proposes a model for risk-averse optimization of disaster relief facility location and vehicle routing under stochastic demand that solves the four problems simultaneously. The novel contribution of this study is its presentation of a new model that includes conditional value at risk with regret (CVaR-R)—defined as the expected regret of worst-case scenarios—as a risk measure that considers both the reliability and unreliability aspects of demand variability in the disaster relief facility location and vehicle routing problem. Two objectives are proposed: the CVaR-R of the waiting time and the CVaR-R of the system cost. Due to the nonlinear capacity constraints for vehicles and distribution centers, the proposed problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and is solved with a hybrid genetic algorithm that integrates a genetic algorithm to determine the satisfactory solution for each demand scenario and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to obtain the non-dominated Pareto solution that considers all demand scenarios. Moreover, the Nash bargaining solution is introduced to capture the decision-maker’s interests of the two objectives. Numerical examples demonstrate the trade-off between the waiting time and system cost and the effects of various parameters, including the confidence level and distance parameter, on the solution. It is found that the Pareto solutions are distributed unevenly on the Pareto frontier due to the difference in the number of the distribution centers opened. The Pareto frontier and Nash bargaining solution change along with the confidence level and distance parameter, respectively.",1366-5545,Not found

Robot scheduling for pod retrieval in a robotic mobile fulfillment system,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102087,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In order to increase the order picking efficiency, e-commerce retailers have started to implement order picking systems where mobile robots carry inventory pods to pick stations. In pick stations, pickers pick the products from inventory pods and put them in customer bins. In such a robotic mobile fulfillment center, pickers are constantly busy with picking customer orders and avoid non-value adding activities such as walking to reach storage locations. To fulfill customer orders, each robot needs to complete a sequence of missions and each mission includes a set of retrieval requests. We study the operational problem of scheduling a mobile robot fulfilling a set of customer orders from a pick station. The mobile robot needs to bring each pod from a retrieval location to the pick station and return the pod to a storage location. The objective is to minimize the total travel time of the robot which can be considered as a proxy for other objectives such a shorter lead time, higher throughput and less capital investment. We formulate the basic problem as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem. We then extend the model by adding general precedence constraints to give different priorities to customer orders based on their urgency (e.g. same-day, one-day, two-day, and standard orders). We also study a variation of the problem where the pod can be stored in multiple alternative locations. In this case, we model the problem as a generalized asymmetric traveling salesman problem. An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is developed to efficiently solve real size instances. The method outperforms the heuristics commonly used in practice.",1366-5545,Not found

In this paper, we review the literature on time-dependent routing problems, with a specific focus on benchmarks and performance criteria used to experimentally evaluate the interest of exploiting time-dependent data, showing the lack of studies on the impact of spatio-temporal features of the benchmark on solutions. Hence, we introduce a new benchmark produced from a realistic traffic flow micro-simulation of Lyon city, allowing us to consider different levels of spatial granularity (i.e., number of sensors used to measure traffic conditions) and temporal granularity (i.e., frequency of measures).

Tugboat scheduling for container ports,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102071,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Container ports play an important role in global logistics and supply chains by providing container handling services for container ships. In a port, container ships usually need the assistance of tugboats in order to undergo berthing, shifting, and unberthing movements. Effective scheduling of the tugboats for serving the ships is thus of great importance for ensuring safe and efficient container ship movements in a port. However, research on tugboat scheduling is scarce in the literature. We contribute to the literature by studying a real-life tugboat scheduling problem (Tug-SP). We formulate the Tug-SP using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model taking into consideration various practical constraints. In view of the specific problem structure, we further develop six families of valid inequalities to strengthen the MILP model. To efficiently solve the Tug-SP, we develop a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm by incorporating these valid inequalities into a standard branch-and-bound solution framework.

An increasing number of designer brands are finding ways to cooperate with rental platforms rather than compete with them. We develop a stylized model to study the impact of business-to-consumer product sharing on luxury fashion brands. Specifically, we consider a setting where a designer brand firm provides a luxury fashion product to a rental platform, which can either purchase the product from the firm then rent to consumers, or allow the designer brand firm to use its platform to reach the consumers directly with a commission fee. Our analysis reveals that the presence of a rental platform leads to two simultaneous effects: a market expansion effect and a cannibalization effect. In the base model, we show that the market expansion effect dominates the cannibalization effect. Therefore, the designer brand firm can benefit from the appearance of a rental platform. Further, our analysis reveals that the optimal choice between the wholesale and agency contract of the firm and the platform depends critically on two parameters: the revenue-sharing proportion and salvage value. We illustrate that when the revenue-sharing proportion is relatively large and salvage value is relatively small, both the firm and the platform benefit more under the agency contract. Moreover, we illustrate the robustness of our main insights to consider the presence of different consumer segments, consumers’ conspicuous behavior, competition between rental platforms, and two-period rental setting.",1366-5545,Not found
A healthcare logistic network considering stochastic emission of contamination: Bi-objective model and solution algorithm,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102060,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This paper presents a novel healthcare waste location-routing problem by concentrating on a new perspective in healthcare logistics networks. In this problem, there are healthcare, treatment, and disposal centers. Locations of healthcare centers are known, however, it is required to select appropriate locations for treatment, recycling, and disposal centers. Healthcare wastes are divided into infectious and non-infectious wastes. Since a great volume of healthcare wastes are infectious, the emission of contamination can have obnoxious impacts on the environment. The proposed problem considers a stochastic essence for the emission of contamination which depends on the transferring times. In this respect, transferring times between healthcare and treatment centers have been considered as normal random variables. As transferring time increases, it is more likely for the contamination to spread. Having visited a treatment center, infectious wastes are sterilized and they will no longer be harmful to the environment. This research develops a bi-objective mixed-integer mathematical formulation to tackle this problem. The objectives of this model are minimization of total costs and emission of contamination, simultaneously. Complexity of the proposed problem led the researchers to another contribution. This study also develops a Multi-Objective Water-Flow like Algorithm (MOWFA), which is a meta-heuristic, to solve the problem. This algorithm uses a procedure based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank the non-dominated solutions in the archive set. By means of a developed mating operator, the MOWFA utilizes the best ranked solutions of the archive in order to obtain high quality offspring. Two neighborhood operators have been designed for the MOWFA as the local search methods.

Carbon emission-compliance green location-inventory problem with demand and carbon price uncertainties,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102038,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In emerging markets, the growth of supply chain networks and logistics industry leads to a significant increase in energy consumption and induces high carbon emissions. To design a sustainable low-carbon supply chain network, we consider a carbon emission-compliance green location-inventory problem. It is characterized by uncertain demand and volatile carbon prices under a multi-year emission regulation, inspired from the carbon-trading scheme in China. A two-stage stochastic mathematical model is built and is solved with a three-phase hierarchical metaheuristic on extensive numerical experiments, which mimic the business context of a supply chain network operated in China. The results show to which extent the carbon-trading emission-compliance scheme, with uncertainties in demand and carbon price, impacts the strategic decisions. Besides, carbon emissions and supply chain profits of the design solutions produced under alternative emission regulations are evaluated and discussed. We also underline the sensitivity of the amount of carbon emissions to the demand uncertainty, and to the level and volatility of the carbon price in the carbon-trading system. These results provide managerial insights for supply chain emitters, and indicate that reasonable and stable carbon prices should be maintained by governments in emerging markets.",1366-5545,Not found
A variant of the split vehicle routing problem with simultaneous deliveries and pickups for inland container shipping in dry-port based systems,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102057,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In this paper, we will study a typical problem in inland container shipping, concerning the barge transportation of maritime containers between a dry port and a set of seaport terminals. The barges depart from the dry port and visit a set of sea terminals, where containers need either to be dropped off or picked up. The goal is to achieve economies of scale with barges and avoid trucking as much as possible. The decision thus involves finding the best allocation of containers to barges in order to guarantee on-time delivery and meet capacity restrictions. The problem will be modeled as a variant of the split vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries coupled with time features. The model includes parameters that can be tuned to improve barge utilization and travelling distance. A hybrid local search meta-heuristic algorithm, combined with a branch-and-cut solver, will be developed to solve the model. Numerical experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the algorithm and provide solution analysis for practical insights. Real-world data has been collected from a local barge operator based in the Port of Rotterdam region and will be used as input for the experiments. This will result in an in-depth analysis into current planning practices. The proposed framework complements existing models in the literature and contributes to the development of a comprehensive set of decision support tools, which help in the decision-making process for inland terminals.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal allocation of shared parking slots considering parking unpunctuality under a platform-based management approach,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102062,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"An effective way to solve the parking difficulty is to utilize idle private parking slots as temporary parking supplies under the shared parking mode. A platform-based management approach can make reasonable use of parking slots by gathering the parking time windows of owners and consumers in advance. However, the actual parking time is difficult to be consistent with that registered on the platform. Owners and consumers may be unpunctual when arriving and departing. The parking unpunctuality is a stochastic factor and affects the allocation of parking slots. This paper focuses on how to model and optimize the parking unpunctuality in the shared parking slot allocation problem. We formulate the parking probability function of consumers and owners in different time slots and transform the stochastic programming model into an expectation model. It is found that in a certain time slot, the optimal number of idle parking slot reserved is related to the probability of unpunctuality, as well as the number of cars registered to arrive and depart in the neighboring time slots. The numerical experiments indicate that when considering the parking unpunctuality, the allocation is less compact; the satisfaction of consumers is decreased, especially when the supply is limited or the consumer demands are excessive. In the middle and later periods throughout the daytime, parking slots are more likely to be overloaded.",1366-5545,Not found

Automated technologies in freight transportation represent an opportunity to develop more efficient systems characterized by the integration of different and complementary modes. In this study, we focus on the possibility of implementing an integrated truck-robot system for the last-mile delivery. This typology of problem shares similarities with truck-drone problems, although robots are characterized by much slower speeds and can perform several consecutive deliveries. Based on these particular features, a heuristic that efficiently identifies solutions based on initial truck tours and corresponding joint robot operations is presented. This solution approach leverages a special version of the “Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem,” which allows for a very efficient Dynamic Programming solution. The developed solution approach is adopted to analyze the influence on efficiency of different features concerning the robot’s design and operation, and the surrounding environment.

Optimal charging scheduling and management for a fast-charging battery electric bus system,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102056,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Battery electric buses (BEBs) are rapidly being embraced by public transit agencies because of their environmental and economic benefits. To address the problems of limited driving range and time-consuming charging for BEBs, manufacturers have developed rapid on-route charging technology that utilizes typical layovers at terminals to charge buses in operation using high power. With on-route fast-charging, BEBs are as capable as their diesel counterparts in terms of range and operating time. However, on-route fast-charging makes it more challenging to schedule and manage charging events for a BEB system. First, on-route fast-charging may lead to high electricity power demand charges. Second, it may increase electricity energy charges because of charging that occurs during on-peak hours. Without careful charging scheduling and management, on-route fast-charging may significantly increase fuel costs and reduce the economic attractiveness of BEBs. The present study proposes a network modeling framework to optimize the charging scheduling and management for a fast-charging BEB system, effectively minimizing total charging costs. The charging schedule determines when to charge a BEB, while the charging management strategically controls the actual charging power. Charging costs include both electricity demand charges and energy charges. The charging scheduling and management problem is first formulated as a nonlinear nonconvex program with time-continuous variables. A discretizing method and a linear reformulation technique are then adopted to reformulate the model as a linear program, which can be easily solved using off-the-shelf solvers, even for large-scale problems. Finally, the model is demonstrated with extensive numerical studies based on two real-world bus networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively determine the optimal charging scheduling and management for a fast-charging BEB system, which carries the potential for use in large-scale real-world bus networks.",1366-5545,Not found

Should competing firms cooperate to reduce congestion?,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101929,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Consider two profit-maximizing service firms in the presence of congestion-sensitive customers. Firms set their prices and compete to capture market share. We compare cases where the firms can invest either independently (competition) or jointly (co-opetition) in congestion-reduction (CR) activities. Using a stylized analytical model, we find that when the market is covered (that is when everyone buys a product), the firm with a lower marginal CR cost earns more profit under competition than under co-opetition. When the market is uncovered, co-opetition is more profitable if the joint marginal CR cost is less than a threshold. We find that when the market is covered, neither firm makes any CR investment but when the market is uncovered, there will be a CR investment provided the marginal CR cost is lower than a threshold. Our analysis shows that when prices are regulated, firms under competition make CR investments but firms under co-opetition do not. The impact of proximity on each firm’s choice of location under competition and co-opetition are different. We find that if the marginal CR cost under joint investment is larger than a cutoff, then social welfare is also higher under competition than under co-opetition.",1366-5545,Not found
Predicting peak load of bus routes with supply optimization and scaled Shepard interpolation: A newsvendor model,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102041,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The peak load of a bus route is essential to service frequency determination. From the supply side, there exist ineffective predicted errors of peak load for the optimal number of trips. Whilst many studies were undertaken to model demand prediction and supply optimization separately, little evidence is provided about how the predicted results of peak load affect supply optimization. We propose a prediction model for the peak load of bus routes built upon the idea of newsvendor model, which explicitly combines demand prediction with supply optimization. A new cost-based indicator is devised built upon the practical implication of peak load on bus schedule. We further devise a scaled Shepard interpolation algorithm to resolve discontinuities in the probability distribution of prediction errors arising from the new indicator, while leveraging the potential efficacy of multi-source data by adding a novel quasi-attention mechanism (i.e., scaling feature space and parameter optimization). The real-world application showed that our method can achieve high stability and accuracy, and is more robust to predicted errors with higher capacity. Our method can also produce a larger number of better trip supply plans as compared to traditional methods, while presenting stronger explanatory power in prioritizing the relative contribution of influential factors to peak load prediction.",1366-5545,Not found

Nonprofit peer-to-peer ridesharing optimization,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102053,142,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Both for-profit and nonprofit peer-to-peer (P2P) ridesharing services have gained enormous popularity in recent years due to their advantages over solo driving and public transit. We study the rideshare matching and routing problem in a nonprofit P2P ridesharing system consisting of a matching agency, drivers and riders. The matching agency is a government or a not-for-profit organization and its objective is to maximize the societal benefits of ridesharing. The drivers involved are commuters and hence have their own travel plans, which are executed regardless of whether riders are matched with them. We consider both static and dynamic versions of the nonprofit P2P ridesharing problem. Existing modeling and solution approaches for similar P2P ridesharing problems can only solve relatively small problem instances optimally. We propose an exact solution algorithm for the static version of the problem by taking advantage of its special characteristics. This exact solution approach formulates and solves the problem as a set packing formulation using route-based variables, and uses an efficient graph-based approach to generate all necessary vehicle routes in the formulation quickly. We also develop a column generation (CG) based heuristic approach for the static problem. Finally, we propose two dynamic dispatching policies for the dynamic version of the problem. Our proposed exact algorithm solves very large problem instances (e.g., with 600 drivers and 1800 riders) of the static problem and our CG based heuristic can find near-optimal solutions for even larger instances of the static problem in short computation time. Our dynamic dispatching policies can generate near-optimal solutions for the dynamic problem in real-time fashion. We also generate some important insights based on some taxi trip data in Washington DC. First, P2P ridesharing can bring significant cost-saving, especially when the participants have a relatively flexible schedule. For every 10% increase in schedule flexibility, there is an about 4% to 7% increase in cost-saving. Second, the cost-saving due to ridesharing increases with the vehicle capacity, but this increase slows down quickly when the vehicle capacity reaches 4. Third, ridesharing generates more cost savings during peak hours and in urban areas.",1366-5545,Not found

Consumers are heterogeneous in their usages and valuations and they get utility by consuming products rather than owning them. The creator can choose to provide a product menu that contains two types of packages or only provide one type of package to match the consumers’ usages and valuations.

We show that consumers’ usages and valuations have a large impact on deciding the creator’s optimal pricing strategy and project target regardless of whether the exogenous or endogenous package sizes are used. In addition, market outcomes depend not only on the optimal pricing strategy but also on the optimal project target. Moreover, the creator can benefit from providing two types of packages instead of one type of package.

Airline network competition in inter-continental market,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102117,143,2020-11-01,2020,11,"As the number of countries liberalizing their skies increases, some airlines, notably carriers in the Middle East, have extended their hub-and-spoke networks beyond domestic borders. This allows them to serve international destinations without the need to go through traditional gateway hubs, so that they can compete with airline alliances relying on the traditional dual-gateway, or the so-called “dog-bone” networks. This paper proposes a stochastic optimization model to address the location choice issue of additional gateway airports, with a consideration of the competition between airlines running traditional dog-bone networks and hub-and-spoke networks in a liberalizing inter-continental market. A two-stage approach is adopted to model the effects of demand uncertainty. In the first stage, the future passenger demand is not observable and thus airlines or airline alliances aim to maximize their own expected profit by choosing additional gateway airports from the set of candidate gateway airports pre-specified by the regulator. In the second stage, with the passenger demand observed and the gateway scheme fixed, airlines determine their aircraft sizes and service frequencies to maximize their own profit, and air passengers choose routes that minimize their own travel disutility. Based on a calibration of the demand dispersion parameters in elastic demand function, the proposed model is applied to the China-Europe aviation market, which includes the inter-continental international market and the associated Chinese and European domestic markets, so that to ascertain the comparative advantages of different network configurations.

Motivated by the potential impact of ATS, this study provides a review of air taxi systems and associated operations. We first discuss the current developments in the ATS (demand prediction, air taxi network design, and vehicle configuration). Next, we anticipate potential future challenges of ATS from an operations management perspective, and review the existing literature that could be leveraged to tackle these problems (ride-matching, pricing strategies, vehicle maintenance scheduling, and pilot training and recruitment). Finally, we detail future research opportunities in the air taxi domain.",1366-5545,Not found
Investigation of crowdshipping delivery trip production with real-world data,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102106,143,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Crowd-shipping (CS) is an innovative logistics service that occasional and professional couriers sign up for via an online platform to deliver packages upon requests by senders. Currently the demand and supply of CS is not yet well understood, largely due to the limited real-world data. This study aims to first fill this gap by analyzing the real-world CS data from the city of Atlanta, GA between April 2015 and August 2018. We first present an overview of the real-world CS data in three aspects: (1) the CS pricing scheme; (2) the CS spatial and temporal delivery patterns; and (3) comparison of preferences between the senders’ requests and the couriers’ bids. The analysis finds that the CS service has a clear price advantage over FedEx in the same-day and express service, as well as in the large, extra large, and huge size package delivery. The data analysis also reveals considerable discrepancies between senders’ and couriers’ preferences. We then compare two classes of the state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) methods in their ability to predict short-term CS delivery trip production. One class captures only the temporal features, namely the Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (BDLSTM), and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The other class considers both spatial and temporal features, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM. The results show that ConvLSTM has overall the best predictive performance among the six DL methods considered, proving the importance of capturing both the spatial and temporal features of the delivery trip production data, as well as the convolutional nature of the spatial and temporal features in the data.",1366-5545,Not found
Role of financial leasing in a capital-constrained service supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102097,143,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Financial leasing (FL) has become a common solution to financing problems encountered by firms. The main difference between FL and some conventional supply chain financing strategies is the separation of ownership and the right of use of the equipment/products. This paper studies a service supply chain that consists of a capital-constrained downstream firm that provides service to consumers and an upstream firm that manufactures the equipment needed during the service process. The downstream firm has three alternative financing solutions, including FL, bank credit financing (BCF), and trade credit financing (TCF). In this study, game theoretical models are constructed to analyze and compare the optimal prices, order quantities, and profits in different financing scenarios. Results corroborate that FL outperforms other conventional financing strategies when the profitability of service provision is low or the premium revenue of the FL firm due to its better utilization of the equipment is relatively high. Moreover, the preference of the downstream firm on alternative financing models might not be exactly consistent with that of the upstream firm or the supply chain system. Under some conditions, the downstream firm prefers TCF to other strategies, while the upstream firm and the supply chain system is better off under FL. Furthermore, we extend our research to some general situations, e.g., endogenous interest rate in BCF, positive quantity of equipment endowed with the downstream firm, and integrated union of the upstream firm and the FL firm. Most of the results derived in the basic model can be further applied in most of the general situations.",1366-5545,Not found

However, lacking in the contemporary scholarly discourse is a deeper understanding of how businesses respond to such pandemics. In this research note (RN), a conceptual framework of firms’ responses is advanced. Using the global airline industry, the analysis delineates a host of internally generated and externally imposed firms’ strategic and tactical responses to the pandemic including in-flight service changes, flight cancellations, seeking emergency aids and financial supports, and firm closures. The analysis demonstrates that in responding to the crisis, many airlines sought to minimise erosion of long-developed knowledge, market capabilities, route networks, access to airports, customer base and relationships/trust with customers prior to COVID-19 to equip them for recovery.

Request acceptance in same-day delivery,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102083,143,2020-11-01,2020,11,"We study request acceptance dynamics in same-day delivery systems by formulating the Dynamic Dispatch Waves Problem with Immediate Acceptance, which models integrated management and distribution for dynamically arriving customer requests. We consider an e-commerce platform that attempts to serve most customers with same-day delivery service. When a shopper attempts to place an order, a decision is made immediately to offer same-day delivery service (accept the request) or to deny service. Accepted requests are not available for immediate dispatch; they must be processed (picked and packed) before they are loaded for delivery. Vehicle routes are updated dynamically and serve each accepted delivery request no later than the end of the service day. In this work, we limit the study to the case of a single vehicle serving requests, potentially using multiple trips from the distribution center. The objective is to make request acceptance and distribution decisions that minimize the expected sum of vehicle travel costs and penalties for service denials. We develop a framework for dynamic decision policies over continuous time for such systems, where a feasible vehicle dispatch plan is redesigned and used to guide decisions over time. We design methods for determining an initial optimal a priori plan and for updating the plan using a heuristic roll-out procedure. Our methods are tested on a family of simulated instances against two common-sense benchmarks and an infeasible relaxed policy that allows the dispatcher to delay the acceptance or rejection of a request until the end of the service day. We demonstrate in our computational study that the cost-per-request of the best benchmark policy is on average 9.7% higher than our proposed dynamic policy and furthermore that the dynamic policy leads to only a 4.4% cost increase over the infeasible relaxed policy lower bound.",1366-5545,Not found
Design of a sustainable maritime multi-modal distribution network – Case study from automotive logistics,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102086,143,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Multi-modal transportation takes advantage of multiple transport modes and can be an effective way to ease the negative environmental effects of freight transportation. This paper addresses a multi-modal distribution network design problem with the aim of balancing the trade-off between economic and environmental benefits. The distribution network that we consider includes both transportation with trucks and ships. We propose a new mixed integer programming (MIP) model which decides the optimal design of the system, i.e. how many ships of each type to use, their corresponding routes and sailing speeds. It also suggests an optimal cargo flow through the maritime and road-based network. We show how the MIP model can be used to provide decision support through a case study from the distribution of automobiles in India, which has a vast coastline that can be used for maritime transportation. Environmental emissions from automobile transportation in India have been rapidly increasing in recent years with the fast economic development, and it has become a major contributor to regional air pollution and road congestion. One possible way to ease these negative environmental consequences is to consider a modal shift where some of the automobile transportation from the production facilities located close to the coastline is replaced by roll-on roll-off (RoRo) ships. Our study shows that multi-modal distribution is both environmentally friendly and economically beneficial, especially if more industrial players can collaborate to create economies of scale.",1366-5545,Not found
Does shipping market affect international iron ore trade?– An equilibrium analysis,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102107,144,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Whether shipping market affects international iron ore trade arouses a lot of discussions in recent years. To evaluate the impact of shipping, we build a mixed complementarity-based equilibrium model to understand the strategic behavior and interaction among major players, including importers, exporters, and carriers. Different from models found in other resource trades, this one considers the heterogeneity of iron ores and the production capacity allocation of exporters. In this three-party equilibrium model, importers and exporters compete in a Cournot fashion, incorporating the endogenous freight rate derived from a carrier module. This model is an instance of Discretely Constrained Mixed Complementarity Problem (DC-MCP), for which we provide a solution procedure based on Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) reformulation and convexification techniques. Our model performs better compared with those with given shipping cost and production capacity constraint. In addition, we apply the model to analyze the impact of shipping on the iron ore international trade through a numerical study. The results show that shipping can slightly dampen the negative impact on iron ore trade volume from an unexpected reduction in importer budget. For different exporters, this dampening effect varies by freight rate.",1366-5545,Not found

The decoy effect is the phenomenon whereby consumers change their preference between two options when presented with a third option that is less desirable. We examine the product propositions in a competitive supply chain adopting decoy effect from the perspectives of a high-end firm or a low-end firm, respectively. We also investigate impacts of consumers’ behavioral factors on the decoy effect, such as rationality, social influence, and loss-aversion preference. Further, we test whether decoys can be as effective online as they are offline, and effective in a monopolistic supply chain as well.

New uncertainty modelling for cargo stowage plans of general cargo ships,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102151,144,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The current approach to the cargo stowage plans (CSP) of general cargo ships (GCS) is safety-driven, which means that any CSP satisfying minimum safety requirements can be used in practice. Such an approach taking into account no economic and environmental concerns cannot help sustain GCS growth in today’s competitive freight transportation market. This paper introduces a revised evidential reasoning (ER) approach to cope with the complex decision-making problem associated with the CSP of GCS. The complexity mainly results from the dynamic interdependency between the decision criteria and alternatives. The revised ER can determine the functions of the safety-related criteria in the decision making process by considering the extent to which each decision alternative meets the minimum safety requirements. The model is tested in multiple forms by an empirical study using a national GSC loading laboratory, and a real-life application by a shipping company in practice. The results reveals that the new model can aid general ship owners to make sustainable CSPs from a multiple-dimensional perspective and select an optimal CSP based on specific voyage scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found

To mitigate the effects of the gray market, a luxury brand manufacturer may strategically select its sales channels to sell the product in both markets simultaneously, in both markets sequentially, or exclusively in the high price market. We derive the equilibria for each strategy, and demonstrate that selling strategy can mitigate the negative the impact of gray market. The results further show that gray market is active only if the customer’s valuation discount for gray products is moderate and the gap between the customer’s perceived status valuation of the two markets is relatively large. As compared to the case without the gray market, we find an interesting and counter-intuitive result, that gray market activity can mitigate the double marginalization effect and lead to a Pareto improvement for both the manufacturer and its retailer. Our research enriches the literature on gray markets by offering new insights and implications, and our results provide international luxury brand manufacturers with guidelines for efficiently managing cross-market sales channels.",1366-5545,Not found

Hence, a new freight rate function with respect to the delivery time considering port congestion is proposed for time-sensitive cargoes, and two different slot allocation strategies are proposed: Loyal Strategy and Expansive Strategy. Accordingly, we formulate the problem as a one-stage container slot allocation model and a two-stage container slot allocation model, respectively. Both of the two models are stochastic mixed-integer quadratic programming models with chance constraints due to the involvement of dynamic pricing, port congestion, and uncertain demand. To solve the proposed models, a tailored algorithm that combines the Sample Average Approximation approach and the Reformulation Linearization Technique (SAA-RLT) is developed in this paper.

Exact approaches for routing capacitated electric vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102126,144,2020-12-01,2020,12,"We investigate a variant of the standard Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), where each vehicle is powered exclusively by electricity stored in its rechargeable battery. Consequently, each vehicle should visit not only customer nodes but also (possibly) some charging stations before the battery got depleted. The importance of this problem stems from the fact that logistics companies are increasingly relying on electric vehicles in urban distribution. We propose three exact approaches. The first one requires solving a compact polynomial-sized formulation. The second approach is a branch-and-cut algorithm. An original feature of this algorithm is that it embeds the first exact separation of the well-known rounded capacity constraints. Finally, the third approach is a hybrid algorithm that requires solving an augmented variant of the compact formulation. We report the results of a computational study that was carried out on a set of 125 instances, providing evidence that the polynomial-sized formulation can consistently solve instances having up to 30 customer nodes and 21 charging stations, and that the hybrid algorithm solves some instances having up to 100 customer nodes and 21 charging stations while requiring moderate CPU times.

The proactive scheduling strategy considers the expected degree of variability and uncertainty during the execution of a tugboat fleet schedule while the reactive scheduling strategy properly adjusts the initial schedule to cope with unexpected scenarios with minimum recovery cost. A mixed-integer linear programming model for the proposed tugboat scheduling problem is established.

Robust airline crew scheduling with flight flying time variability,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102132,144,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The crew pairing problem is one of the most important but challenging tasks for commercial airlines. However, the operation environment of the aviation industry is highly volatile with diverse uncertainties. Flight flying time variability is an important disruption that usually causes deviations of flight departure/arrival times from the schedule. Traditional crew pairing frameworks without considering flight flying time variability can generate pairings that are fragile to flight delays. However, the impact of flight flying time variability on crew pairings is under-explored. In this paper, we propose two robustness enhancement strategies based on the consideration of flight flying time variability (i.e., encouraging deviation-affected-free flights and discouraging deviation-affected flights). Besides, two robustness measurements are developed to construct two novel robust crew pairing models. One is time based while the other is number based. A customized column generation based solution algorithm is proposed. Computational experiments based on real flight schedules show that our new models can greatly enhance solution robustness (e.g., 49.1% more deviation-buffer time) at a price of an acceptable increase in operating costs (e.g., 9.7%) compared with the traditional model. Besides, extreme-delay flights can be completely avoided in the proposed models. Moreover, the solutions obtained from the time-based model show higher resistance against the disruption of flight flying time variability with a lower operating cost than the number-based model.",1366-5545,Not found

This paper investigates the management performance of the TCS on high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes with the approach of equilibrium analysis. The analysis is based on a commuting scenario in which commuters use a multi-lane highway with HOV lanes. We developed a basic system in which commuters have two alternative travel modes: driving alone in general-purpose (GP) lanes or carpooling in HOV lanes. Under this assumption, the HOV lane management with TCSs is formulated as a mathematical programming problem. We analyze the effects with respect to feasible TCSs, effective TCSs, and optimal TCSs, respectively. We extend the basic system by considering regular carpoolers with the scenario of HOVs choosing GP lanes. Under this situation, the HOV lane management with TCSs is formulated as a variational inequality problem. We further analyze the management effects of different TCSs. Numerical examples demonstrate system indicators with several typical states, the impact of key parameters on TCS management performance, and the feature of the extended system in typical scenarios. Results show that the optimal TCS is achievable in the basic system by limiting the traffic flow of GP lanes. However, the optimal TCS may not exist in the extended system considering regular carpoolers, and a sufficient condition is proposed to guarantee its existence.",1366-5545,Not found

Increasing ship traffic in ports leads to the growing emission of air pollutants, which influences the air quality and public health in the surrounding areas. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted relevant regulations (e.g., Annex VI of IMO's pollution prevention treaty (MARPOL) and mandatory energy-efficiency measures) to address ship emissions. To ensure the effective implementation of such regulations and measures, air emission detection and monitoring has become crucial. In this paper, a dynamic multitarget path planning model is developed to realize multi-UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) performing synergistic detection of ship emissions in ports. A path planning algorithm under a dynamic environment is developed to establish the model. This algorithm incorporates a Tabu table into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve its optimization ability, and it obtains the initial detection route of each UAV based on a “minimum ring” method. This paper describes a multi-UAVs synergistic algorithm to formulate the path reprogramming time in a dynamic environment by judging and cutting the “minimum ring”. This finding proves the improved efficiency of air pollution detection by UAVs.

However, this service may facilitate consumer webrooming behavior. Such behavior lead to a virtual channel in which consumers view web showrooms online but buy products at physical stores. This study aims to investigate the channel strategies for online retailers regarding whether to introduce web showrooms in the face of consumer webrooming behavior. To address this challenging issue, we develop a theoretical dual-channel retailing model under two market environments when the online channel and the offline channel are owned by a monopolistic retailer or two independent retailers, respectively. Our results show that the presence of consumer webrooming behavior is heavily dependent on the hassle cost of viewing web showrooms and the travel cost of visiting physical stores. Interestingly, when both costs are sufficiently large, more consumers exhibit webrooming behavior in the duopoly market than in the monopoly market. The results further show that it is beneficial for an online retailer to introduce web showrooms when consumer sensitivity to the travel cost is relatively low under both market environments. In particular, the monopolistic retailer benefits from the web showroom service by increasing its selling price, whereas the online retailer in the duopoly market gains benefits by inducing consumer switching behavior. Notably, when consumer sensitivity to the travel cost is relatively high, offering web showrooms in the duopoly market may increase the offline retailer’s profit but reduce the online retailer’s profit, which is counterintuitive.",1366-5545,Not found
Risk analysis in logistics systems: A research agenda during and after the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102190,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Risk has long been an important aspect of logistics.

Contracting in ocean transportation with empty container repositioning under asymmetric information,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102173,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"In the paper, we examine a contracting problem under asymmetric information in a two-port system involving two freight forwarders and one carrier providing ocean container transportation services between the two ports. We develop a two-stage game model to capture the unique characteristics of the ocean freight transportation with empty container repositioning. We first analyze the forwarders’ optimal strategies, and then characterize the optimal contract for the carrier under symmetric and asymmetric information. Through computational studies, we investigate the impacts of empty container repositioning cost and information asymmetry on the system performances. The numerical experiments reveal that (1) if the market demand is likely to be high, the ocean carrier is more eager to procure private information so as to prevent profit loss from information asymmetry; (2) the degree of information asymmetry has different impacts on the empty container repositioning cost in different transportation directions.",1366-5545,Not found

Comparative analysis of models and performance indicators for optimal service facility location,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102174,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"This study investigates the optimal process for locating generic service facilities by applying and comparing several well-known basic models from the literature. At a strategic level, we emphasize that selecting the right location model to use could result in a problematic and possibly misleading task if not supported by appropriate quantitative analysis. For this reason, we propose a general methodological framework to analyze and compare the solutions provided by several models to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the location decisions from several different perspectives. Therefore, a battery of key performance indicators (KPIs) has been developed and calculated for the different models’ solutions. Additional insights into the decision process have been obtained through a comparative analysis. The indicators involve topological, coverage, equity, robustness, dispersion, and accessibility aspects. Moreover, a specific part of the analysis is devoted to progressive location interventions over time and identifying core location decisions. Results on randomly generated instances, which simulate areas characterized by realistic geographical or demographic features, are reported to analyze the models’ behavior in different settings and demonstrate the methodology’s general applicability.

Strategic network design and analysis for in-motion wireless charging of electric vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102179,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"We address a network design problem arising in the deployment of wireless charging stations (WCSs) within an urban transportation network. It is widely acknowledged that, despite the availability of EV conventional charging facilities, the relatively short driving range of EVs (due to low energy density of the batteries) and the long battery charging times (collectively leading to a phenomenon known as “range anxiety”) remain the major factors that hamper EV adoption. Thus, in this research, we study a cost-effective WCS deployment network design that facilitates EV adoption by alleviating these two major anti-adoption factors. We consider the problem from the perspective of a city as the decision maker whose aim is to satisfy the charging demands of all EVs in its urban traffic network at the minimum cost including installation and charging costs. For this purpose, we suggest a new mathematical model to strategically deploy WCSs in the network in such a way that no EV runs out of energy before reaching its destination. To solve the proposed model, we devise a combined combinatorial-classical Benders Decomposition approach and further enhance its efficiency via employing surrogate constraints and an upper bound heuristic. We present computational results illustrating the algorithmic efficiency of our approach as well as an analysis of the effect of varying system and new technology related parameters (i.e., product design) on the resulting network design based on a case study with urban network data from Chicago, IL.",1366-5545,Not found

Matching daily home health-care demands with supply in service-sharing platforms,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102177,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The availability of innovative technologies (e.g., the Internet of Things, big data analytics, blockchain, the cloud, and applications) has led to a shift in the provision of home health-care (HHC) services from traditional institutions to service-sharing platforms. In the HHC context, one main challenge faced by service-sharing platforms is the matching of demand with supply, while considering the heterogeneity of care requests and service providers. From a centralized perspective of service-sharing platforms regarding three stakeholders (i.e., platform, caregiver, and customer), different matching strategies are used, including the “self-interested”, “customer-first”, “hard-work-happy-life”, and “social-welfare” strategies. When addressing the matching problem at an operational level, the platforms must comply with various requirements and rules, including break requirements, temporal dependencies, and flexible service durations. In this study, mixed-integer linear programming models and a branch-and-price approach are designed to match demand with supply using different matching strategies while satisfying all of the requirements and rules. The effects of key factors on performance indicators (e.g., platform revenue, caregiver profit, and customer surplus) are examined, and the matching strategies are compared. The results indicate that the “customer-first” and “self-interested” strategies benefit more from flexible service durations, however they are more and less negatively affected by break requirements and temporal dependencies, respectively, as compared to the “social-welfare” and “hard-work-happy-life” strategies. A comparison between the “social-welfare” strategy and the other three strategies indicates that the former strategy is beneficial for all three stakeholders of the service-sharing platforms as well as the government. Another comparison between the service-sharing platforms and traditional HHC institutions indicates the sharing economy has a positive impact on caregiver profit and customer surplus.",1366-5545,Not found
A theoretical framework to evaluate the traffic impact of urban freight consolidation centres,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102134,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"City logistics and goods movement using road freight is an outcome of the economic activities that sustain urban life. However, they produce negative externalities like traffic congestion and pollution. There are key areas within cities that are largely affected by logistics activities, such as commercial centres and retail districts. These locations attract many freight vehicles attempting to fulfil deliveries, often with limited parking supply. This results in long queues of delivery trucks waiting for parking spaces or illegal kerbside parking. Therefore, urban planners and decision-makers are motivated to initiate policies that can mitigate these impacts. Urban freight management policies like delivery time or truck size restrictions, and Urban Consolidation Centres (UCC) have been proposed as potential solutions. A UCC is a facility that allows deliveries to be consolidated before entering a busy commercial area. The focus of this study is to offer a theoretical framework for predicting the impact of a UCC on the number of freight trips attracted to a retail district in any city. A mathematical model is developed and used to analyse two possible policy cases concerning the location of a UCC: one where the UCC is located within the retail district, and another where the UCC is located outside the retail district. This model is subsequently applied to examine a retail district in Singapore using real-world data. The critical level of participation in a UCC scheme required for the retail district to experience fewer freight trips is characterised. The results show a diminishing marginal benefit associated with achieving greater consolidation by operating the UCC. This contribution offers a theoretical explanation for the traffic impacts of urban freight consolidation, and aids with the development an ex-ante evaluation of a UCC. The model may be readily applied to any city considering this initiative, by adjusting the model parameters for local conditions.",1366-5545,Not found
Truck platooning in the U.S. national road network: A system-level modeling approach,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102200,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Truck platooning enables a group of trucks to move close together, which helps reduce truck fuel use and increase effective road capacity. In this paper, a system-level equilibrium model is developed to characterize spontaneous truck platooning with coexistence of non-platooning vehicles in a network, by explicitly accounting for the interlocking relationship among platoon formation time, truck fuel saving, and increase in effective road capacity. To equilibrate the relationships, an algorithm is proposed which involves a diagonalization approach and a bush-based algorithm to solve decomposed subproblems. The condition of proportionality is imposed to obtain unique traffic flows for each class of vehicles on road links. In addition, a spatially constrained multivariate clustering technique is employed to construct origin/destination zones that are smaller than the coarse Freight Analysis Framework (FAF) zones, while maintaining reasonable computational burden for network traffic assignment. Model implementation in the U.S. shows that platooning could lead to 7.9% fuel saving among platoonable trucks in 2025 and a comparable increase in effective capacity of platoonable road links, which would account for 60% of rural interstate roads. The fuel saving and road capacity improvement translate into an annual cost reduction of $868 million for the U.S. intercity trucking sector and reduced road infrastructure investment needs worth $4.8 billion. Extensive sensitivity analysis further reveals that fuel saving of platoonable trucks increases with platoon size but decreases with inter-truck distance in a platoon. Fuel saving potential suggests that priority should be given to rural rather than urban roads in deploying platooning technologies. As expected, greater market penetration of platooning technologies means higher fuel saving and greater increase in effective road capacity.",1366-5545,Not found

Prediction of aircraft trajectory and the associated fuel consumption using covariance bidirectional extreme learning machines,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102189,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Accurate prediction of the aircraft trajectory and associated fuel consumption has become an important research topic owing to the increasing importance of air traffic management. Currently, trajectory prediction and fuel estimation are usually accomplished via complex mathematical energy-balance methods. In these methods, the prediction error could get increased due to the possible usage of global values and outdated database, resulting from that most of the information regarding aircraft operations is unavailable. In this paper, we propose a covariance bidirectional extreme learning machine (CovB-ELM) for predicting aircraft trajectories and estimating fuel consumption. The selection of randomly generated parameters for the hidden unit, such as the input weight and bias, to improve the accuracy and numerical stability of the extreme learning machine (ELM), is an open problem. The fundamental idea behind the proposed method is to maximise the covariance between the hidden unit and network errors through partially updating the hidden-unit parameters randomly generated in bidirectional ELM so that the output weight norm value is minimised and the convergence gets improved. The merits of the proposed CovB-ELM are demonstrated by the experiments involving regression problems and international airline historically flight data, which suggests that the CovB-ELM outperforms, in terms of generalisation performance, several existing methods, e.g., airline mathematical approach, backpropagation neural network, and constructive ELM methods.",1366-5545,Not found

Integrated E-waste transportation using capacitated general routing problem with time-window,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102169,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Formal collectors of electronics waste in the developing countries are struggling to survive despite receiving governmental subsidies at the early stages of their activities. The formal collection enterprises fail to collect much of the electrical and electronic equipment wastes (WEEE) due to the operational limitations and the households' preference for the traditional door-to-door collection services; this situation has resulted in inappropriate management of the WEEE stream. This study puts forward an integrated collection scheme that simultaneously considers the on-call and door-to-door demands. To explore how to effectively implement the proposed approach, an original capacitated general routing model with time-window (CGRPTW) is studied, which facilitates the general routing methodology for WEEE collection practices. A set of test instances – testbed – based on real data is developed to investigate the proposed collection scheme under various operational situations. On this basis, it is shown that the resulting improvement is more significant under certain operational, i.e. capacity- and time-management decisions. Overall, this study explores trade-offs between profit- and service-oriented paradigms for the management of the collectors' behavior within the integrated WEEE collection scheme.",1366-5545,Not found

Money is paid for the utility value derived from using the product. To ensure the product runs well, the servicizing manufacturer bears the cost for operating it. We establish a Stackelberg game to investigate the interaction between a manufacturer and an operator using the product provided by the manufacturer. As a servicizing firm, the manufacturer is more likely to be capital-constrained. When the manufacturer has to raise funds for the production, it has two channels: external financing, which means raising funds from a bank, and internal financing, which means raising funds from the operator. Both the manufacturer and the operator may act as the leader under external financing, while under internal financing, the operator always moves first. We find that under external financing, moving first is not always beneficial. Also, high operating efficiency benefits both chain members when the manufacturer is the leader, but both are hurt when the operator leads. We find that it can be optimal to provide a subsidy not only when the operating efficiency is low but also when it is very high. Furthermore, when the per-unit price is high, the manufacturer should accept a high interest rate to facilitate earning more profit.",1366-5545,Not found

This paper explores two forms of elimination mechanisms: sub-elimination and sequential-elimination. Using game theory and auction theory approaches, we model the game between a contest seeker and participants and derive the equilibrium results under these two forms, including the equilibrium decisions and corresponding expected payoff for the contest seeker and the effort strategy at each stage and total expected surplus for all participants. Our results show that: (i) Under both forms, it is optimal to have exactly two participants competing with each other in the final stage; (ii) In equilibrium in the sub-elimination contest, all participants exert more effort in each stage when the number of participants remaining is smaller. The equilibrium effort strategy of high-ability participants has the same trend in a sequential-elimination contest, but the low-ability participant’s equilibrium effort level in the final contest is first decreasing and then increasing in the number of remaining participants; (iii) The optimal two-stage elimination form is sequential-elimination for the contest seeker when compared with no-elimination and sub-elimination because under sequential-elimination, all participants in the second stage will exert more effort, leading to higher-quality solutions. Additionally, we find that this form is also preferred by high-ability participants.",1366-5545,Not found
Online operations strategies for automated multistory parking facilities,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102135,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Parking at megacities has become a major problem that is garnering increasing attention. The fundamental cause of the parking problem is the imbalance of demand and supply in core areas, where parking demand is high but parking provision is limited owing to exorbitant land prices. The idea of multistory parking facilities is proposed to serve larger parking demands with fewer land possessions. The newly developed automated multistory parking facilities are able to pick-up and place cars on different stories automatically. This paper proposes online operations method (OOM) of automated multistory parking facilities in response to intensive parking demands to reduce customers’ waiting time. The proposed online optimization model is composed of two tiers: in the first tier, a reinforcement learning framework is adopted to determine parking spot selections for incoming parking demands, and the second tier executes the plan acquired from the first tier by optimizing the action sequences of the automated elevator. Numerical experiments with multiple demand patterns are conducted to verify the proposed methodology. The results show that the learned strategy distinguishes from common practice in that it shows non-greedy patterns for some time during the day, and achieves significant improvements in various cases.",1366-5545,Not found
Should multinational firms implement blockchain to provide quality verification?,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102121,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The e-tailers selling global brands’ products on cross-border e-commerce platforms have been suffering from low-quality image. To solve this problem, some platforms (e.g., eBay, Lazada, and Tmall Global) have utilized blockchain for quality verification that creates customers’ trust and guarantees the products’ quality. It is widely acknowledged that the operations of blockchain require all supply chain parties’ participation. Therefore, whether the owners of the global brands have incentives to verify the quality and origin of the goods via blockchain can be critical, especially when the brand-owners are multinational firms (MNFs) owning retail divisions in the same market. In this paper, we study a co-opetitive supply chain consisting of an MNF located in high tax country/region and an e-tailer sourcing from the MNF and reselling the goods. The e-tailer competes with the MNF’s retail division in a low-tax country/region. We find that, blockchain is a double-edged sword for the MNF. It increases the MNF’s wholesaling profit, but reduces the MNF’s retailing profit and tax-planning benefit. Consequently, the MNF will not participate in blockchain if the tax disparity is large and the downstream competition is fierce.",1366-5545,Not found
“Ship-from-store” strategy in platform retailing,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102153,145,2021-01-01,2021,1,"In the omnichannel retailing context, some online-first retailers open the offline channel to implement cross-channel operational strategies to improve the consumer’s experience. This paper develops an analytical model of the retailer’s offline entry and omnichannel fulfillment option (i.e., the Ship-from-Store option) under competition through the platform’s self-run store. In the omnichannel scenario, the retailer can provide time-sensitive consumers with a quick logistics service by implementing the Ship-from-Store option. We focus on the value of the Ship-from-Store option and explore the effects of this option on the pricing decisions of the retailer and platform. We also explore how consumer heterogeneities (time sensitivity and transportation costs) affect the retailer’s omnichannel operations. In addition, we identify conditions under which the retailer can benefit from the Ship-from-Store option. Some managerial insights are provided.",1366-5545,Not found

This situation is regardless of whether airlines have the freedom to change the base terminal.",1366-5545,Not found
Implications of government subsidy on the vaccine product R&amp;D when the buyer is risk averse,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102220,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This paper analyses the choice of subsidy offered to a vaccine supply chain with a risk-averse buyer. We find that for a higher innovation effort and level of social benefits, the per-unit production subsidy is better when there is a low innovation cost coefficient, a low level of risk aversion, or a high potential demand. Otherwise, under the opposite conditions, the R&D innovation effort subsidy should be selected. Furthermore, from an evolutionary game theoretical perspective, we also present the stability performance for the subsidies, and the results show that when the manufacturer’s innovation cost coefficient is relatively low, the more profitable per-unit production subsidy may be abandoned due to its performance instability.",1366-5545,Not found
Waterway maintenance budget allocation in a multimodal network,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102215,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The U.S. inland waterway system has more than 11,000 miles of maintained navigation channel, which carries a significant percentage of the national freight total. Maintenance operations, including dredging and lock and dam maintenance/repair, are important to ensuring the effective and efficient operation of the inland marine transportation system. This study specifically deals with maintenance fund allocation to these projects. It proposes a multimodal approach to formulate the waterway maintenance problem in a network that considers rivers, locks/dams, highways and railways. The random effects of channel infilling known as shoaling are also considered. Maintenance on locks and dams reduces the delay therein, the cost of which is also considered in the model. The solution identifies maintenance projects to fund with an objective to serve the OD demand and minimize the total shipping costs on the network. The model is tested using data from the Ohio River Basin network. The proposed model is effective, and the result indicates a trade-off between lock/dam maintenance versus channel dredging. A distinct feature of this study is its explicit modeling of the interdependency between projects in realizing the system benefits as well as the random shoaling effect.",1366-5545,Not found
Humanitarian relief supply network design: Expander graph based approach and a case study of 2013 Flood in Northeast China,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102178,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,The frequent occurrence and catastrophic consequence of natural disasters have made it important to design an appropriate humanitarian relief supply network that can provide (cost-) effective and timely rescue for affected people. This paper presents a humanitarian relief supply network design model for large-scale natural disasters such as flood and hurricane. The model is constructed through the adoption of a Ψ -expander structure which is a variant of expander graph and a sparse yet highly connected structure with good flexibility. The Ψ -expander structure guarantees that either the network can satisfy the total demand among affected areas or utilize at least Ψ proportion of the total pre-positioned relief supply. The model optimizes the decisions of emergency facility location and relief supply pre-positioning simultaneously under uncertain demand in each affected area. The objective is to minimize the total cost of fixed location and relief supply pre-positioning. The model is cast as a nonlinear integer program with an exponential size of the Ψ -expander constraints. We address it using a cutting-plane approach. We also analyze the complexity of the separation problem that must be solved in each iteration of the cutting-plane approach and prove that it is NP-hard. A case study based on the 2013 Flood in Northeast China is presented to verify the performance of the model. Computational results demonstrate that the model is able to design a humanitarian relief supply network with a high demand fill rate effectively.,1366-5545,Not found
Vehicle product-line strategy under government subsidy programs for electric/hybrid vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102221,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"To reduce the carbon emissions produced by the traditional fuel-driven vehicles, governments have recently proposed various subsidy programs to promote the electric/hybrid vehicles (EVs), such as the consumer subsidy (CS) program and the R&D subsidy (RS) program. In the presence of subsidy programs, vehicle manufacturers would decide whether to develop or adjust their product lines, i.e., whether to produce traditional fuel vehicles (FVs) and/or electric/hybrid vehicles. We show that when the manufacturer’s technology capacity for improving the energy-saving levels of EVs is at an intermediate level, she prefers to produce both types of vehicles, and otherwise, she would choose to offer one type of vehicle only. Moreover, contrary to our intuition that the government programs can always decrease the carbon emissions, we find that both CS and RS programs might pose negative impacts on the environment. These programs can effectively reduce the carbon emissions only when the manufacturer decides to offer both EVs and FVs. Moreover, we show that the economic and environmental interests of the subsidy programs may not be always aligned. We derive the conditions under which the CS program can outperform the RS program from both the environmental and economic perspectives. In addition, we also discuss a mixed subsidy program (MS) wherein the government offers both a consumer subsidy and a R&D subsidy simultaneously. We discuss whether this mixed program can reduce carbon emissions more effectively than the CS and RS programs.",1366-5545,Not found
The adoption of self-driving delivery robots in last mile logistics,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102214,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Covid-19, the global pandemic, has taught us the importance of contactless delivery service and robotic automation. Using self-driving delivery robots can provide flexibility for on-time deliveries and help better protect both driver and customers by minimizing contact. To this end, this paper introduces a new vehicle routing problem with time windows and delivery robots (VRPTWDR). With the help of delivery robots, considerable operational time savings can be achieved by dispatching robots to serve nearby customers while a driver is also serving a customer. We provide a mathematical model for the VRPTWDR and investigate the challenges and benefits of using delivery robots as assistants for city logistics. A two-stage matheurisitic algorithm is developed to solve medium scale VRPTWDR instances. Finally, results of computational experiments demonstrate the value of self-driving delivery robots in urban areas by highlighting operational limitations on route planning.",1366-5545,Not found
Effects of information-processing mechanisms on Internet-based purchase order financing,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102222,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This paper investigates how small and medium-sized original design manufacturers (SM-ODMs) obtain sufficient purchase order financing (POF) and ultimately improve their financial performance through Internet-based supply chain financial platforms. Based on information-processing theory, this paper explores the impacts of two information-processing mechanisms (formal information integration and informal information exchange) on Internet-based POF loans and financial performance from SM-ODMs’ perspective. The posited relationships are verified through analysis of second-hand project data derived from 207 distinct customer purchase orders and first-hand survey data collected from 33 SM-ODMs, using a structural equation modeling approach. The findings indicate that SM-ODMs can secure larger Internet-based POF loans and improve their financial performance by integrating formal information more extensively. This can be done by exchanging informal information more frequently and proactively at a high level. However, exchanging informal information more frequently and proactively at a low level results in smaller Internet-based POF loans. Finally, SM-ODMs can improve their financial performance through larger Internet-based POF loans.

A competitive dynamics perspective on the diversification of third-party logistics providers’ service portfolios,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102219,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The diversification of service portfolios is one of the key strategies employed by third-party logistics providers (3PLs) to remain competitive. Moving from traditional transportation and warehousing services, many 3PLs now offer a one-stop shopping experience to shippers by combining these services with customized offerings such as inventory management, integrated supply chain management, and consulting. Academic literature has identified key drivers of this phenomenon, such as the need to meet shippers’ increasing expectations, a 3PL’s strategic orientation, or to capitalize on existing resources and capabilities. Yet, work focused on the theoretical and empirical analysis of competitive drivers of 3PL diversification is scant. Grounded in competitive dynamics theory and the theory of strategic groups, we investigate the effects of the addition of new services by peer 3PLs on a focal 3PL’s diversification of service offerings. In particular, we hypothesize—and find based on the analysis of a large archival panel dataset—that a focal 3PL is more likely to expand its service portfolio when its peers introduce services that put them in direct competition with the focal 3PL. The same behavior is observed, though to a lesser extent and with longer time lags, when peers introduce services that the focal 3PL did not previously offer. The results also indicate that when there is greater similarity between the service portfolios of a focal firm and its peers, these relationships will be stronger. Collectively, these findings contribute to the logistics outsourcing and diversification literatures and offer refinements to competitive dynamics theory. Our work also offers managerial insights relevant to 3PL decision makers as they design their service portfolios.",1366-5545,Not found

Selling to a financially constrained E-commerce retailer with bankruptcy cost and tax,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102180,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Although it is well-known that a firm’s decisions are affected by its financial constraints and tax rate, few studies have investigated a financially constrained e-commerce supply chain when both bankruptcy cost and tax are considered. This paper fills this gap in the literature by analysing an e-commerce supply chain with a financially constrained e-commerce retailer (e-tailer) who faces uncertain demand in the presence of bankruptcy cost and corporate taxes. In this scenario, the e-tailer may need to secure short-term loans from a bank to place orders. With a Stackelberg game setting, we characterize the equilibrium interest rate, order quantity, and wholesale price. For both exogenous and endogenous wholesale prices, we show that the e-tailer’s optimal order quantity decreases in the tax rate and increases in the bank’s recovery rate (after e-tailer bankruptcy). However, the effect of internal capital on the e-tailer’s order quantity and profit depends on both the tax and recovery rates. Specifically, when the tax rate or recovery rate is low, an e-tailer with more internal capital would order more and may earn a higher profit; this is not always the case when the tax rate or recovery rate is high. For the endogenous wholesale price case, we demonstrate that the e-tailer’s order quantity and the upstream manufacturer’s profit are both greater than those in the traditional newsvendor setting (with taxes), provided the tax rate is relatively high.",1366-5545,Not found

However, long recharge times and battery degradation inhibit adoption. To overcome these barriers, swap stations enable quick battery exchange. We introduce a stochastic scheduling, allocation, and inventory replenishment problem which determines the charging, discharging, and replacement decisions at a swap station over time. The decisions are complex because recharging is necessary for short-term operation but causes degradation and the need for future replacement. We model the problem as a Markov Decision Process, solve it using backward induction, and show that the problem suffers from the curses of dimensionality. Hence, we propose two approximate methods, a heuristic benchmark policy and a reinforcement learning method, which provide high-quality solutions. Using a designed experiment, we deduce effective operational insights.",1366-5545,Not found
The impact of integrated cluster-based storage allocation on parts-to-picker warehouse performance,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102207,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Order picking is one of the most demanding activities in many warehouses in terms of capital and labor. In parts-to-picker systems, automated vehicles or cranes bring the parts to a human picker. The storage assignment policy, the assignment of products to the storage locations, influences order picking efficiency. Commonly used storage assignment policies, such as full turnover-based and class-based storage, only consider the frequency at which each product has been requested but ignore information on the frequency at which products are ordered jointly, known as product affinity. Warehouses can use product affinity to make informed decisions and assign multiple correlated products to the same inventory “pod” to reduce retrieval time. Existing affinity-based assignments sequentially cluster products with high affinity and assign the clusters to storage locations. We propose an integrated cluster allocation (ICA) policy to minimize the retrieval time of parts-to-picker systems based on both product turnover and affinity obtained from historical customer orders. We formulate a mathematical model that can solve small instances and develop a greedy construction heuristic for solving large instances. The ICA storage policy can reduce total retrieval time by up to 40% compared to full turnover-based storage and class-based policies. The model is validated using a real warehouse dataset and tested against uncertainties in customer demand and for different travel time models.",1366-5545,Not found

This article proposes a new paradigm to deal with industrial and societal challenges, developing an auction-enabled collaborative routing mechanism for omnichannel on-demand logistics in a real-time transshipment network. We consider an online service platform for real-time management of on-demand pickup and delivery tasks, where multiple freight shippers can trade with multiple freight carriers. Freight shippers are retailers or individual customers, while freight carriers are a group of logistics service providers. The platform acts as the auctioneer. A two-stage combinational auction mechanism is designed for dynamic on-demand task (re)allocation. Tactical-level auctioning and operational-level routing decisions are optimized together. The transshipment-based task generation method is used to identify uneconomic paths from carrier’s real-time network for outsourcing. A transshipment-based routing algorithm is developed to enable each carrier to make decentralized decisions for network reconstruction and transportation bidding. Our model aims to improve the overall social welfare while bringing benefits to stakeholders involved. The computational results have shown positive society impacts. Specifically, shippers’ payments can be saved while carriers’ profits are increased compared with other operative models which have been investigated in previous research studies or industry. In addition, a substantial reduction in CO 2 emissions and vehicles required can be achieved. The main reason for the improvement in social welfare is due to the optimal network achieved through collaboration. We also numerically analyze the impacts of three key factors: growth in demand density, urgency of tasks and flexible auction interval.",1366-5545,Not found

However, freight destination behavior at a high resolution has received scant attention. In our study, we attempt to address the limited research on destination decision processes and develop a latent segmentation-based approach that accommodates mode and destination choices in a unified framework. The proposed approach postulates that these two choices are actually sequential in nature with an infinitesimally small time gap between them. However, the actual sequence (mode-destination or destination-mode) is unknown to us. Thus, a probabilistic model that can accommodate for the two choice sequences within a single framework is proposed. The latent segmentation framework probabilistically assigns the decision maker to the two sequences. In the Mode first – Destination second (MD) sequence, the destination choice model is calibrated with choice alternatives customized to the chosen mode. In the Destination first – Mode second (DM) sequence, the destination model is calibrated without any mode information as mode is unknown to the decision maker. In the study, we used 2012 US Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data. We found that the latent segmentation-based sequence model outperformed the independent sequence models (MD and DM). The validation exercise also confirmed the superiority of the proposed framework.

A peak-period taxi scheme design problem: Formulation and policy implications,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102148,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Taxis are one of the most important urban transportation modes which provide prompt and comfortable service to customers. It is commonly known that demand for and supply of taxis fluctuate at different times of a day, leading to peak periods when customer waiting time for taxis is longer and the quality of taxi service is lower than that of the off-peak periods. There have been real-world practices to mitigate the demand-supply imbalance and improve the service quality of taxis during peak periods. For example, a peak-period surcharge is imposed on taxi passengers in Singapore; the city of Perth in Australia introduces a fleet of peak-period taxis (PTs) which are allowed to operate within specific hours as the additional supply to the market. However, there lacks theoretical evidence to tell which means (or both) should be implemented and it is also unclear which factor(s) is determinant to the optimal surcharge and the optimal fleet size and shift of PTs. Moreover, there is no methodology to design the optimal shifts (the permitted operating hours) and fleet size of PTs and the optimal peak-period surcharge. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a peak-period taxi scheme design problem (PTSDP) that aims to determine the optimal fleet size/shifts of PTs and a peak-period taxi surcharge. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization model in which the upper level is the regulator (government) problem and the lower level stands for the taxi driver problem. The model is solved by a brute force method combined with the Hooke-Jeeves pattern search and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Numerical examples are given to give policy implications and managerial insights into the regulation of taxi markets.",1366-5545,Not found
Sustainable procurement drivers for extended multi-tier context: A multi-theoretical perspective in the Danish supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102092,146,2021-02-01,2021,2,"In light of the rising global importance of sustainable procurement (SP) implementation for contributing to sustainable development goals (SDGs), the main aim of this study is to perform an abductive research to analyse the drivers of SP under a Danish extended multi-tier supply chain context. Initially, the expansion of the traditional multi-tier theory to a novel extended multi-tier theory is accomplished by considering three factors: any number of upstream SC entities, the direct customer on the downstream entity, and the focal firm. This study has been done with the intention of implementing SP for the focal firm. Following that, the study develops a research framework to analyse the drivers of SP in an extended multi-tier environment by considering both upstream (1st tier and 2nd tier suppliers) and downstream (direct customer) supply chain entities together with the focal company using multiple theories such as extended multi-tier, triple bottom line (TBL), dynamic capability, institutional theory, and decision theory. Firstly, the relevant SP drivers are categorised (i.e., 7 categories of main drivers and 24 sub-drivers) based on the TBL, dynamic capability, and institutional theory. Secondly, applying the Best Worst Method (BWM), SP drivers were prioritized, and a comparative analysis was performed across the extended multi-tier context. The result shows that the top three priorities of the sub-drivers are “personal values,” “active top management support,” and “government regulation and legislation,” respectively for the focal company. Comparative analysis points to the fact that the sub-driver “government regulation and legislation” is considered important for all the SC entities; however, no mandatory government regulation currently exists to implement SP in the private sector context. On the other hand, the sub-driver “customer pressure / demand” for the sustainable products has been a low priority for the focal company and 2nd tier suppliers and it has not been considered relevant for the 1st tier supplier and direct customer. Thirdly, applying the Decision-Making Trial And Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), an interrelationship analysis was performed on the key SP drivers that exist from the focal company’s perspective. Finally, relevant managerial implications and conclusions were drawn for the focal case company based on the results of the prioritization and interrelationship analysis.",1366-5545,Not found

Performance evaluation of automated medicine delivery systems,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102242,147,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The daily medicine delivery is one of the most important activities in hospitals. The traditional medicine delivery, from hospital warehouses to the patients, typically involves a human delivery team supplying patients by handcarts. The multiple steps in the medicine delivery process impact the efficiency and increase the risk of contamination. Many hospitals are therefore on their way to automate this process. The Telelift-based automated medicine delivery system provides high health safety, low operational cost, and high system efficiency. This paper develops a stochastic model to evaluate and analyze the medicine delivery process by such an automated medicine delivery system. We adopt a two-moment approximation method and an aggregation approximation algorithm to solve the nested queuing model, considering regular and peak demand. We use simulation to validate the analytical model. The numerical experiments show that our analytical model is sufficiently accurate to evaluate the automated medicine delivery process. Our model can help decision makers of hospitals to reduce the patient waiting time and medicine response time. Our method can also be extended to other automated overhead material handling systems.",1366-5545,Not found

3PL firm's equity financing for technology innovation in a platform supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102239,147,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Technologies have been driving improvements in logistics and transportation. Focusing on a third-party logistics (3PL) firm’s technology innovations supported by external equity financing, we examine how the innovations can benefit the supply chain, and how the supply chain members should respond with coordinated operational decisions. More specifically, we consider a platform supply chain where a supplier sells a single product on an online platform provided by a retailer, and then hires a 3PL firm for transportation services. The 3PL firm may choose to raise capital through equity financing from external financial institutions, which can be used to support technology innovations to reduce the transportation cost. The financing decision of the 3PL interacts with operational decisions of the platform supply chain via possible cost savings. We start with investigating the supply chain coordination by characterizing the optimal operational decisions of the three firms under any given equity financing strategy. Acting non-cooperatively, the 3PL firm and the online retailer first determine the freight charge and revenue sharing respectively, in light of which the supplier’s decision on the retail price. We then move to the 3PL firm internally and derive the optimal equity financing strategy. Our analytical results show that the supply chain efficiency is dependent on the cost allocation between the retailer and the other two firms, but independent of the cost allocation between those two firms. It is also revealed that the original shareholders of the 3PL firm always have a chance to benefit from an appropriate financing strategy, and the optimal financing strategy may depend discontinuously on supply chain parameters. Finally, we check the robustness of our model and show that all key findings remain unchanged when relaxing the deterministic cost reduction to an uncertain one.",1366-5545,Not found
The container drayage problem for heterogeneous trucks with multiple loads: A revisit,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102241,147,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In this study, we revisit the container drayage problem for heterogeneous trucks with multiple loads in view of its practical significance.

These two relaxed models are proven to work as intended and provide optimal solutions under certain conditions.

Vehicle dispatching in modular transit networks: A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102240,147,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Modular vehicle (MV) technology offers the possibility of flexibly adjusting the vehicle capacity by docking/undocking modular pods into vehicles of different sizes en route to satisfy passenger demand. Based on the MV technology, a modular transit network system (MTNS) concept is proposed to overcome the mismatch between fixed vehicle capacity and spatially varying travel demand in traditional public transportation systems. To achieve the optimal MTNS design, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to balance the tradeoff between the vehicle operation cost and the passenger trip time cost. The nonlinear model is reformulated into a computationally tractable linear model. The linear model solves the lower and upper bounds of the original nonlinear model to produce a near-optimal solution to the MTNS design. This reformulated linear model can be solved with off-the-shelf commercial solvers (e.g., Gurobi). Two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and its effectiveness in reducing system costs.",1366-5545,Not found
Package routing problem with registered couriers and stochastic demand,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102248,147,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Providing the crowd-sourced delivery capacity and hence enabling the practice, occasional couriers (OC) are the most critical resource in crowd-shipping (CS). Therefore, as well as establishing and retaining a solid OC base, using the OC trips efficiently is of utmost importance for the viability of the CS applications. One auspicious idea to enhance the efficiency, i.e., cover a larger demand set with the available OC trips, is to use transshipments (deliver packages with a coordinated effort of OCs) and collect OC trip information in advance to efficiently coordinate them, which gives rise to the package routing problem with registered couriers (PRP-R) we introduce in this paper. In particular, we study a CS model in which the couriers register their trips in advance while the express shipping demands arrive through a stochastic process, and the network management needs to dynamically decide package-courier assignments to carry out deliveries in the most efficient way. We develop a novel rolling horizon algorithm to solve this challenging problem in real-time, which explicitly considers the limited OC capacities and use of a back-up delivery capacity (company-owned or third party provided) to ensure the service quality. Beyond the classical rolling horizon approaches, the suggested methodology uses a novel Monte Carlo procedure to take anticipated future system conditions into account, and thus can provide package-courier assignments that have almost the same cost with the optimal solution of the static version of the problem where all demand arrivals are known a-priory. The comprehensive numerical experiments attest to the efficacy of our methodology for the real-time management of the CS operations and provide significant managerial insights about the design of CS networks.",1366-5545,Not found
Government subsidies for preventing supply disruption when the supplier has an outside option under competition,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102218,147,2021-03-01,2021,3,"To prevent supply a disruption caused by capacity constraints and outside options, the government needs to offer subsidies. The following two types of subsidies are investigated: subsidies to the supplier (Mode S) and subsidies to the manufacturers (Mode M). Our analysis reveals that government subsidy strategies depend on the size of the external price and the capacity. Interestingly, Mode M (manufacturer subsidy) is superior to Mode S (supplier subsidy). Moreover, subsidizing both the supplier and manufacturers simultaneously is not superior to a single subsidy mode. Furthermore, the social welfare in the competitive case is not worse than that in the monopoly case under certain conditions. However, neither subsidy mode can prevent supply disruptions under scenarios of higher intensity of competition.",1366-5545,Not found

By solving a signaling game, we find that cost decline increases the possibility of order distortion. The obtained results also show that without encroachment, both supply chain members are better off from cost decline; with encroachment, cost decline always hurts the retailer and benefits the supplier only if the direct selling cost is not very high. In addition, encroachment benefits the supplier when the direct selling cost or the cost decline efficiency is relatively low, while benefits the retailer when the direct selling cost is sufficiently high. Finally, we discuss on different information structures and obtain some information management insights.",1366-5545,Not found
Urban rail service design for collaborative passenger and freight transport,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102205,147,2021-03-01,2021,3,This paper develops an operational strategy in which urban rail transit is used for freight transport. An environment-friendly urban freight transportation alternative is analyzed by employing optimization techniques to support the collaborative transportation of passengers and freight. Practical cases are investigated to test the technical feasibility of this transportation scheme. The paper formulates the train service design problem on a single urban rail line with passenger and freight. Passenger trains have a prescribed timetable which is allowed to be slightly modified to facilitate the freight service. Freight can be transported by inserting dedicated freight trains or utilizing the extra space inside the passenger train carriages. Station platforms are able to load and unload both goods and passengers. An optimization model for combined train service design is proposed to maximize profit resulting from the balance of revenues and costs brought by the freight service. The efficient schedules of trains and freight allocation plans are to be determined. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model. An iterative scheduling approach which includes a pre-processing method and two heuristic iterative algorithms is designed to solve the model. Two numerical examples are introduced to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and the iterative scheduling approach.,1366-5545,Not found

Air passengers’ willingness to pay for ancillary services on long-haul flights,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102234,147,2021-03-01,2021,3,"While ancillary services were initially provided by legacy carriers on short- and medium-haul flights, the emergence of long-haul low-cost carriers has contributed to the adoption of ancillary services on long-haul flights as well. Nevertheless, limited attention has been paid to the specifics of ancillary services on long-haul flights and to how much passengers are willing to pay for such services. In this research, we aim to assess the willingness of passengers to pay for various ancillary services on long-haul flights and show how these values differ depending on passenger characteristics. Based on a choice-based conjoint analysis, we first investigate the importance of five ancillary services (checked baggage, inflight meal, seat selection, priority boarding, and onboard Wi-Fi) in the flight ticket selection process. In addition, we measure passengers’ willingness to pay for the entire sample and for subsets of respondents based on trip motive and age. Regarding trip motive, we reveal that leisure passengers are willing to pay more for most ancillary services than are business passengers. By contrast, when distinguishing between millennial and nonmillennial respondents, neither subsample is globally willing to pay more for ancillary services, with differences for each service. Finally, we compare the estimated willingness to pay for short- and long-haul services and reveal that flight duration has a contrasting impact on the willingness to pay for ancillary services (with either a positive or null impact on willingness to pay). In addition, our comparison of the estimated willingness to pay with the actual fees charged by airlines allows us to draw conclusions on their attractiveness for passengers.",1366-5545,Not found

Can such commitments reduce uncertainty and are they profitable for firms? Do penalties impede opportunistic behavior? We answer these questions by investigating action-dependent commitment, defined here as when all commitments are made in a certain sequence, in the context of collaborative innovation in a supply chain. Modeling a multi-stage game among the members of an alliance, we analyze firms’ ex-ante commitments and ex-post opportunistic behavior in R&D and production. First, we find that an action-dependent commitment can reduce the negative effects of uncertainty because it enhances both members’ efforts and profits in the sense of expectations as well as supply chain performance. In particular, the supplier is more incentivized to invest in R&D. Second, opportunistic behavior may be restrained to a certain extent, but not absolutely. Third, keeping the supplier’s outside orders below a certain level can help firms maintain the stability of the alliance. In practice, managers could adopt to make an action-dependent commitment to encourage collaborative R&D efforts. Moreover, the existence of opportunism, even with a maximal punishment, implies that they must be prepared to exercise caution in certain extreme cases. Finally, managers must recognize who is the chain’s leader for only such leaders who act first will get more and are willing to invest more.",1366-5545,Not found

The approach then adds separation cuts to a relaxed version of the MIP formulation and updates the bounds until an optimal solution has been found. A real case and simulated realistic cases are used to compare the proposed model against the first-come first-serve (FCFS) policy that is traditionally used in vessel scheduling.

Model and algorithm of coordinated flow controlling with station-based constraints in a metro system,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102274,148,2021-04-01,2021,4,"With the growing urban population and its rapid growth of mobility needs, metro systems often suffer from congestion in peak hours in many mega-cities over the world. This incurs severe travel delays for commuters and safety risks for metro operators. Hence, passenger flow management and control becomes an essential way to reduce station congestion during high-peak hours. This paper investigates the passenger flow control problem with the objective of increasing the number of boarding passengers. Considering the scenario that the destination of each passenger entering the station is unknown, a flow control problem with dynamic and station-based constraints is proposed to dynamically determine the number of passengers boarding each train at each station. Compared with existing flow control strategies, this model can improve the equity for boarding passengers of different OD pairs. The station-based flow control problem is formulated as a complicated nonlinear nonconvex quadratic programming model. To solve the intractable nonlinear programming model, we reformulate it into the dynamic programming formation and develop two efficient heuristic algorithms to solve it. We carry out two sets of numerical experiments, including the small-scale case with synthetic data and the real-world case with the operation data of Beijing metro system, to evaluate the performance of our model and algorithms. Several performance indicators, e.g. average waiting time and Gini coefficient, are presented to verify the efficiency and fairness of proposed model.

Optimal remanufacturing decisions in supply chains considering consumers’ anticipated regret and power structures,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102267,148,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Empirical research indicates that consumers have uncertain valuations for remanufactured products.

Anticipated regret behaviour refers to consumers taking into account the potential impact of post-purchase regret when making current purchase decisions. This study concerns the effects of anticipated regret (AR) on decision making in closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). We examine how AR affects remanufacturing strategies for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and when it is profitable for an OEM to remind consumers to pay attention to AR. We further study pricing decisions between an OEM and a third-party remanufacturer (TPR) considering various power structures. Our findings show that: (i) The existence of AR will not always hurt the profits, and a higher anticipated regret sensitivity can partially ease competition between new products and remanufactured products; (ii) When the consumers’ valuation difference for remanufactured products is small, the monopolistic OEM can increase its profit by reminding consumers to consider AR; (iii) For the OEM, choosing a strong TPR to collaborate is the most advantageous when the TPR enters the market; (iv) The OEM and TPR need to pay attention to the second-mover advantages when the consumer valuation difference is low.

There are two service outsourcing modes: supplier-outsourcing and retailer-outsourcing. Supplier (retailer)-outsourcing represents that the supplier (retailer) outsources cold-chain service to the logistics provider. When the supplier is the leader, we find that: (i) under traditional quantity discount scheme, the retailer prefers retailer-outsourcing if both service cost and market size are low, or service cost is high. Otherwise, supplier-outsourcing is better if service cost is low and market size is high. How the supplier prefers outsourcing mode is similar to the retailer. Therefore, there may exist an outsourcing mode preferred by both the supplier and the retailer. (ii) Retailer-outsourcing is more profitable to the logistics provider than supplier-outsourcing. (iii) Service level-dependent quantity discount is an important factor determining which outsourcing mode is beneficial to the retailer and the logistics provider. Further, we consider an alternative case in which the retailer is the leader, and we uncover the conditions under which an outsourcing mode outperforms the other. Comparing the two cases, we find that the decision sequence between the supplier and the retailer is important for which outsourcing mode is beneficial to supply chain members.",1366-5545,Not found

Even though electric vans cannot match the performance of diesel vehicles using the same fleet size, our simulation experiments suggest that, by considering the quantity of orders and the geographical distribution of its customers, an operator can determine a suitable charging strategy that can minimise late delivery. Additionally, by employing a suitable charging strategy, an operator might avoid making unnecessary investments and reduce the barriers for electric vehicle adoption.",1366-5545,Not found
Dynamics of outward FDI and productivity spillovers in logistics services industry: Evidence from China,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102258,148,2021-04-01,2021,4,"China’s burgeoning connectivity and alignment with the international logistics system through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has powerful developmental implications for the domestic Logistics Services Industry (LSI). However, whether and to what extent the Outward FDI (OFDI) influences the domestic LSI remains an untapped research area. This study attempts to quantify the OFDI-induced productivity spillover effects in the context of China’s LSI by leveraging the most up-to-date data in conjunction with advanced econometric techniques. Our study reveals that the OFDI of logistics enterprises poses a distinctly positive impact on productivity growth in the logistics industry, and that this impact has been further strengthened since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative. We also demonstrate a long-term bidirectional causality between the logistics enterprises' OFDI and the growth of productivity in the domestic LSI. It implies that enhancing global connectivity and supply chain collaborations requires an effective and efficient logistics operation and management, which in turn provides more opportunities to accrue positive productivity spillovers. The results remain robust with various datasets, specifications, and estimators. The study provides novel insights into the improvement of logistics efficiency through OFDI-facilitated technological spillovers and resource acquisition. With a better understanding of the implications and effectiveness of the Go-Global strategies, the findings can be leveraged as guidelines to assist in making informed decisions for the further development of domestic logistics, as well as for cross-border investments.",1366-5545,Not found
How small-and-medium transportation companies handle asymmetric customer relationships under COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-method study,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102249,148,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The COVID-19 outbreak has created major challenges for transportation companies. Grounded in the dynamic capabilities view theory, this paper adopts a multi-methodological operations management approach to derive scientifically sound insights with regard to handling key customer relationships in the crisis. To be specific, first, qualitative interviews with representatives of small carriers and forwarders as well as an examination of their social media posting are conducted. The qualitative research reveals the customer relationships situation of transportation companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. What specific actions build relational capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic is uncovered. The research model is then tested based on the survey with one hundred Polish SME carriers. Several insights are generated. First, this study provides evidence that among various available networking routines, companies should concentrate on relationship monitoring, conflict handling, and selective relationship downsizing, while initiating new partnerships does not appear to be beneficial. Second, this study suggests that the positive influence of relational caps on company performance is moderated positively by contracts signed between partners and negatively by the financial debt of focal companies. Finally, this study discusses its results with regard to other studies on business relationships in dramatic environmental changes and highlights the corresponding implications.",1366-5545,Not found
Omni-channel strategies for fresh produce with extra losses in-store,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102243,148,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Omni-channel retailing has become increasingly popular among retailers. Thus, whether it is profitable to implement omni-channel operations is regarded as an important question for retailers. In this paper, omni-channel strategies for a fresh produce retailer is investigated in consideration of both fresh produce losses (natural losses and extra losses in-store) and customer types (traditional and online). We analyse the effectiveness of the omni-channel operation by comparing the equilibrium profits and consumer surpluses of three cases: store channel only, buy-online-deliver-to-home (BODH), and buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPS). The results show that omni-channel operation will be profitable and more effective when selling fresh produce with a higher loss rate. When the proportion of online customers is higher, omni-channel operation not only improves the retailer’s profits but also increases the consumer surplus. In addition, the BOPS mode can be more profitable than the BODH mode when the cost for home delivery is relatively high, and interestingly, the advantage of the BOPS mode will be smaller with a lower extra loss rate in-store.",1366-5545,Not found
Equilibrium analyses and operational designs of a coupled market with substitutive and complementary ride-sourcing services to public transits,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102236,148,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The emerging on-demand ride-sourcing programs provided by transportation network companies (TNCs) have been reshaping the transportation industry. Research efforts in this area have covered topics such as supply-demand equilibrium, pricing, matching, dispatching, but have not fully spread to the potential impacts of ride-sourcing on public transit in multi-modal transportation systems. On the one hand, ride-sourcing services act as convenient feeders to solve first-mile/last-mile problems for public transit riders. On the other hand, direct origin-to-destination ride-sourcing services may also absorb passengers from public transit. In this paper, we propose a user equilibrium based mathematical model to analyze complement and substitution of ride-sourcing to public transit. Through both analytical and numerical discussions, we find that the fleet size of ride-sourcing vehicles can critically affect the complementary and substitutive relationship between ride-sourcing and public transit, and ride-sourcing service fares affect the market share between first-mile/last-mile (i.e., from origin to the transportation hub or from the hub to destination) and direct (i.e., from origin to destination) ride-sourcing services. We also examine the optimal strategies to maximize the TNC’s profit and/or social welfare and find that the TNC can implement a Pareto-efficient strategy that makes both the two objectives better off.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimality study of China's crude oil imports through China Pakistan economic corridor using fuzzy TOPSIS and Cost-Benefit analysis,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102246,148,2021-04-01,2021,4,"With China's increasing role in the international political arena, it needs to focus on the diversification of its energy import routes. China is heavily reliant on importing fossil fuels for its industrial and domestic needs, and its traditional trade routes are vulnerable to political, logistical, and security disadvantages. China has been importing from American, African, and Middle Eastern countries through Myanmar's and Eastern China's seaports. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), if utilized for the crude oil imports, can become a viable alternative, and may result in the reduction of the vulnerabilities faced by existing routes. To assess this proposition, this study has focused on identifying China’s most optimal route for crude oil import through a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique; Fuzzy-TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). Furthermore, to confirm the economic viability of the CPEC route, its Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) has also been performed. Besides, Fuzzy TOPSIS has been used to identify the best transport mechanism from the CPEC’s seaports till Western China. MCDM criteria in both cases include time, economic costs, energy consumption, environmental emissions, and security risks. Results indicate that the maritime route, passing through Myanmar is the most optimal route, followed by the CPEC route. Both these routes are prioritised over the traditional route which passes through Eastern China seaports.",1366-5545,Not found
A hybrid variable neighborhood search approach for the multi-depot green vehicle routing problem,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102293,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The Multi-Depot Green Vehicle Routing Problem (MDGVRP) is an extension of the well-known Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP) where a fleet of alternative fuel-powered vehicles (AFVs) are used to serve the customers. GVRP consists of determining AFV tours such that the total distance travelled is minimum. The AFVs depart from the depot, serve a set of customers, and complete their tours at the depot without exceeding their driving range and the maximum tour duration. AFVs may refuel en-route at public refueling stations. In MDGVRP, the AFVs are dispatched from different depot locations and may refuel during the day at any depot or refueling station. We formulate MDGVRP as a mixed integer linear programming model and develop a hybrid General Variable Neighborhood Search and Tabu Search approach by proposing new problem-specific neighborhood structures to solve the problem effectively. We assess the performance of our method using the GVRP dataset from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method can provide high quality solutions in short computation times. Then, we extend these instances to the multi-depot case and compare our solutions for small-size instances with the optimal solutions. We also report our results for large-size problems and investigate the trade-offs associated with operating multiple depots and adopting different refueling policies to provide further insights for both academicians and practitioners.",1366-5545,Not found
Robust network design for sustainable-resilient reverse logistics network using big data: A case study of end-of-life vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102279,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"With new global regulations on supply chains (SCs), sustainable regulation mechanisms have become subject to controversy. The intention is to create and expand green and sustainable supply chains (SSC) to meet environmental and economic standards and to boost one’s position in competitive markets. This study examines the resilient sustainable reverse logistics network (RLN) process for end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) in Iran. We pursue both actual and uncertain situations that possess big data characteristics (3 V’s) in information between facilities of the proposed reverse logistics (RL), and we consider recycling technology due to its societal impacts. Due to unpredictable environmental and social factors, the various proposed network facilities may not utilize their full capacity, so we also consider situations in which the network facility capacity is disrupted. Our primary objective is to minimize the total cost of the resilient sustainable RLN. For most parameters, finding the best solution through traditional methods is time-consuming and costly. Hence, to enhance decision-making power, the value of model parameters in each scenario is considered. A Cross-Entropy (CE) algorithm with basic scenario concepts is used in robust model optimization. The results demonstrate that changing the scenario situation significantly impacts optimal environmental and social costs. In particular, when the situation is “pessimistic,” environmental impact costs are at their highest levels. Hence, scenario-based modeling of the network is a good approach to implement under uncertainty conditions. On the other hand, results show that cost savings for organizations are achieved through optimal planning of the centers' capacity to save cost, increase services, and ensure effective government response to cost-effective and instrumental market competition.",1366-5545,Not found
Improving flex-route transit services with modular autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102331,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"With the advent of modular autonomous vehicles (MAVs), this paper presents a novel operational design for flex-route transit services to reduce operation costs of vehicles and improve the service quality of customers. The regime allows the simultaneous dispatch of a certain amount of MAVs from a bus terminal at a departure time. Each MAV is allowed to visit customers freely outside of checkpoints. Self-adaptive capacity and flexible service mode adapt time- and space-dependent demand characteristics. The presented operational design is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that is NP-hard. A two-stage solution framework is developed to decompose the proposed mathematical programming cautiously. In the first stage, customized dynamic programming with valid cuts is designed to solve a bus scheduling problem efficiently. In the second stage, an effective and fast heuristic is proposed to solve a variant of the dial-a-ride problem and satisfy the technical requirements for developing on-line applications. Numerical examples and a case study show the effectiveness of the proposed design by comparing the flex-route transit services using traditional vehicles.",1366-5545,Not found
Electric vehicles and product–service platforms: Now and in future,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102300,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"This study combines the concepts of product–service system and platform operations involving network externality between consumers and charging stations in the electric vehicle (EV) context. We call this unique aspect of EVs the product-service platform (PSP). We identify four main players (manufacturer, charging service provider, government, and consumers) and propose three cases of EV PSPs: an integrated case (case IPS), a case where the service provider operates independently (case NES), and a case where the manufacturer and service provider form a partnership (case PES). The study investigates which EV PSP case yields superior performance under present and future situations involving different conditions. In the present, characterized by government subsidy and high service fee sensitivity, IPS does well by inducing the highest demand, number of charging stations, and government subsidy when both the network efficiency and consumer sensitivity to service fees are sufficiently high. In the future, however, with no government subsidy and low sensitivity to service fees, NES and PES induce larger demand and profit when the network efficiency is high and sensitivity to service fees is very low. Our study offers an important insight for companies using the integrated approach now (e.g., Tesla). Minimizing the service fee may be the right choice in the present. However, in the future, raising the service fee to the highest possible extent while minimizing the EV price would be the right decision.",1366-5545,Not found
Governance mechanisms and green customer integration in China: The joint effect of power and environmental uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102307,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Drawing on transaction cost economics and social exchange theory, we explore the impact of governance mechanisms on green customer integration and the moderating effects of power and environmental uncertainty. Using data from 206 Chinese manufacturers, we can show that both contractual control and relational norms facilitate green customer integration. Interestingly, the promotional effects of contractual control and relational norms are undermined if manufacturers exert mediated power. Furthermore, the weakened effect of mediated power on the relationship between contractual control and green customer integration is strengthened by demand uncertainty. Conversely, the strengthened impact of non-mediated power on the relational norms–green customer integration relationship is strengthened by demand uncertainty as well as technological uncertainty. This study extends current green supply chain research by revealing that governance mechanisms are antecedent to green customer integration in emerging markets, from the perspective of interfirm relationship management. This study also contributes to transaction cost economics and social exchange theory by revealing how the effectiveness of governance mechanisms on green customer integration varies under different types of power and environmental uncertainty.",1366-5545,Not found

We cast the problem as a two-stage distributionally robust mean-conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) optimization model, for which we derive computationally tractable counterparts under the box and polyhedral ambiguity sets. We further identify the relationship between the proposed distributionally robust model and the traditional two-stage stochastic programming model. We assess the performance of the proposed model by an illustrative small-sized example. From the out-of-sample analysis, we show the superiority of the distributionally robust model compared to the two-stage stochastic programming model in terms of stability. We also implement the proposed model in a realistic large-scale case study of hurricane threats in the southeastern US.

This paper examines freight rate return dependencies across six major clean product tanker shipping routes by the copula-GARCH model. Using information from marginal and copula models, extreme risk spillover effects between different routes are further examined by the conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) measure. Results reveal that the product tanker shipping market is regionalized and segmented by geographical locations. The dependency is high for different size ships operating in the same trade routes, while freight rates of ships having same sizes operating in adjacent regions have higher dependencies than operating in distant areas. Extreme co-movements exist in most return pairs with significant tail dependence. We further document significant extreme risk spillovers especially between adjacent or same trading routes and such spillover effects are found to be asymmetric in bearish and bullish markets.

Specifically, DID and pseudo-DID models were adopted and monthly panel data of 14 prefecture-level branches of Hunan Tobacco Company during 2016-2019 were used for regression.We find that the implementation of GIS/GPS network information systems increased the total distribution cost. However, the average distribution cost was significantly reduced at per household level as the customer base expanded. A series of robustness and sensitivity tests supported above results. Furthermore, the implementation of GIS/GPS network information system is beneficial to service quality and employee performance.

Sustainable supply chain management considering technology investments and government intervention,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102290,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"With the aggravation of the global environmental crisis, consumers are keen to use green products, and enterprises are more committed to technology investment and innovation to meet consumers’ green preferences. This study considers a supply chain system composed of one manufacturer and one retailer, where the manufacturer invests in green emission reduction technology (GERT) to reduce carbon emissions, and the retailer invests in information disclosure technology to transmit the higher greenness quality of products to consumers. We discuss the technology investment decisions and cooperation strategies between the manufacturer and the retailer, as well as the impacts of government regulations on supply chain members’ decisions. We consider three scenarios: decentralized, government intervention, and cost sharing and government intervention. We derive the optimal technology investment decisions of the manufacturer and retailer. In addition, we identify the conditions for the manufacturer to subsidize the retailer’s disclosure technology costs. The results show that a higher emission reduction subsidy encourages GERT investments and increases supply chain members’ profits. However, when the government sets a higher emission reduction standard, the subsidy neither increases the emission reduction nor benefits the retailer, and hurts the manufacturer’s profit. We also demonstrate that when there is cost sharing and government intervention, emission reduction and supply chain performance are always better than in the other scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found

Using continuous approximation equations, the operations costs as well as the externalities induced by a) GADDs in association with an urban consolidation center (UCC) and b) truck-launched UAVs are estimated. Then, the developed mathematical formulations are applied in two different use cases: a part of the Paris suburbs (France) and the historical center of Barcelona (Spain). In less dense and larger service regions such as the Paris suburbs, truck-launched delivery drones seem more suitable to reduce the carriers’ operations costs. In denser neighborhoods such as the Barcelona historical center, GADDs are expected to be more economically profitable. In both use cases, GADDs would generate less externalities.

Unmanned vehicle distribution capacity sharing with demand surge under option contracts,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102320,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Big promotions of online retailers in different shopping festivals often lead to an overwhelming demand surge in parcel delivery. Besides using its own distribution capacity, online retailers usually adopt capacity sharing to cope with the demand surge. Because of the low cost of unmanned distribution, online retailers can adopt unmanned vehicle distribution (UVD) capability sharing. We examine an online retailer’s UVD capacity sharing strategies with a logistics firm under demand surge. We develop sharing models under the unilateral and bidirectional option contracts, from which we derive the optimal ex-ante and ex-post sharing strategies and the corresponding initial, option, and total sharing quantities. We find that if the online retailer wants to secure more UVD capacity in advance, it should use the bidirectional option; otherwise, the unilateral option. Moreover, both the initial sharing and total sharing quantities under the unilateral option are greater than those under the bidirectional option, which however can increase the flexibility of the online retailer. We conduct numerical studies to ascertain the effects of the model parameters on the optimal outcomes. The numerical results show that the degree of demand fluctuation has a greater impact on the initial and total sharing quantities under the unilateral option, and has a greater impact on the option sharing quantity under the bidirectional option. Finally, comparing self-built UVD capacity and UVD capacity sharing, we generate insights to provide guidance for the operations of online retailers.",1366-5545,Not found

The MSP comprises equity crowdfunding, fixed-income funds, and low-rate lending facilities. We examine the sequential interactions between the host government (as the dominant legislator), a crowd of risk-averse small investors, and two competing SCs (local and foreign) that are engaged in Cournot competition. The players’ equilibrium strategies are characterized under two platform power structures, namely small investors-led and SC-led. The joint impact of government legislation and platform’s configuration on the performance of the proposed SCF mechanism is investigated. Results reveal that, while the regulated MSP outperforms a deregulated scenario, the profit-seeking behavior of the host government may intensify the power struggle between the local SC and small investors, and restrict the platform’s overall performance. To successfully practice smart protectionism, policy makers are urged to reframe existing SCF schemes by leveraging their moderating influence and prioritizing social welfare over their short-term economic goals. This not only abates the power imbalance in MSPs, but also enhances the players’ participation and enables host governments to further support their digital platform economy in the era of reglobalization.",1366-5545,Not found

A data fusion approach to predict shipping efficiency for bulk carriers,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102326,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Maritime waterways are critical transportation systems that connect economies and manufacturing centers. Growing demand for freight movement, along with industry commitment to minimize its environmental impact, has increased emphasis on port and vessel efficiency. Yet, few objective performance measures exist to inform decision making for system improvements. There is an existing gap in quantifiable and objective metrics for maritime transport systems which motivated this work to investigate waterway performance efficiencies through big data analytics. Availability of big data affords practitioners and researchers the opportunity to develop new performance-based metrics to improve maritime logistics. This study focused on short sea shipping logistics of iron ore in the Great Lakes and makes three fundamental contributions. Principally, we propose a maritime transport efficiency (MTE) metric attained through fusion of data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and navigation lock data that integrates travel time and vessel payload. We present a linear model to predict vessel capacity based on water surface elevation which will enable practitioners to better adapt to seasonal changes and dredging needs specific to the Great Lakes. Additionally, we present travel time statistics for bulk carriers on the waterway observed through historical AIS data which extends the body of knowledge from earlier works and establishes a reference for system performance. Techniques presented here are effective in capturing travel time statistics in a non-linear interconnected system. This data-driven approach offers new insights for logistics planning and optimization with direct applications to short sea shipping and inland waterways systems. These insights to port and fleet performance allow for querying and simulation of cost impact from investment strategies aimed to improve efficiency or maximize value for operational expenses.",1366-5545,Not found

To this effect, the research comprehensively characterizes service visits to commercial establishments—in terms of frequency, purpose, duration, time of day, and other characteristics—by industry sector for two metropolitan areas. In addition, the authors estimated econometric models that express the number of service trips to commercial establishments as a function of the economic characteristics of the establishment and assessed the geographic transferability of the models obtained. To gain insight into the overall magnitude of service-related traffic, the models were applied to publicly available data to estimate the service activity in American cities of various sizes.

A matching model is developed to assign crowd-shipping customers (i.e. senders) to couriers and to maximize the CS platform providers’ benefits. Four different schemes of pricing and compensation are developed and evaluated. CS firms are noticed to have the highest profits when apply the ‘individual’ pricing and compensation schemes. The platform provider’s profits are found more sensitive with the increase of willingness to pay (WTP) than the rise of expected to-be-paid (ETP). The insights are helpful for CS firms to attract and retain customers and couriers in the system, by setting up optimal prices and optimal compensations based on demand and supply levels as well as the firms’ expected profits and platform-users’ presuming surplus.",1366-5545,Not found

Can we trust the AIS destination port information for bulk ships?–Implications for shipping policy and practice,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102308,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a shipping database that includes the physical characteristics and real-time dynamics of ships. It has attracted great attention from academia recently and has been broadly applied in solving various problems in different fields. The voyage destination report is a piece of information recorded in AIS that indicates the heading port in a ship’s voyage. This information is widely referred to by port operators for traffic estimation, and by shipping traders for supply forecasting, etc. However, we find that a considerable proportion (nearly 40%) of this information has been erroneously entered, both intentionally and unintentionally. In this paper, we aim to propose targeted policies to correct the inaccurate reports based on assessing the probability of observing wrong destination port reports of ships in AIS. To this end, we first of all conduct extensive interviews with relevant shipping stakeholders to understand the reasons behind the wrong destination reports. Second, based on the interviews and relevant literature we propose the influence factors. Third, we generate a data sample set based on the voyages performed by Capesize and Panamax bulk ships around the globe in a year. To generate this sample set, we leverage data mining techniques to extract the information from an AIS database and other databases. Finally, a discrete choice model is built to achieve the proposed objective. The results demonstrate that our model has an 84.1% accuracy rate in ascertaining the correctness of destination reports observed in AIS. We also find that, for a voyage, the speed of the ship, the historical accuracy rate of destination reports made by the ship, and the distance between the recognized origin and the reported destination of the voyage, have the most significant impacts on the accuracy of the destination report.

Promoting electric vehicle adoption: Who should invest in charging infrastructure?,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102295,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Electric mobility has emerged as a key initiative for the policymakers and the governments to mitigate the carbon footprint of the transportation sector. However, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is slow, primarily due to the scarcity of adequate charging facilities. The intriguing factor in terms of developing charging infrastructure is related to which entity should invest in developing the same. Herein, we study a vehicle supply chain and formulated four different modes of developing charging infrastructures for EVs when: (a) EV manufacturer invests in setting up the charging infrastructure with a government subsidy to EV consumers, namely the Model M, (b) EV manufacturer invests in setting up the charging infrastructure, namely the Model R (c) Government invests in setting up charging infrastructure and also provides a subsidy to EV consumers, namely the Model MG, and (d) Government invests in setting up the charging infrastructure, namely the Model G. Our findings show that the Model MG and M are equally effective for generating the maximum EV demand and market share, thereby require maximum effort for developing the charging infrastructure. Further, social welfare is also maximum in these two cases, which is counterintuitive because government support is more in the Model MG as compared to the Model M. Hence, under a limited budget constraint, the government can provide direct subsidy to EV consumers and let EV manufacturer invests in charging infrastructure to maximize social welfare. Further, the Model MG and M have a lower overall environmental impact when GV's environmental impact is higher than a threshold. Additionally, we provide multifaceted policy recommendations for the government, along with manufacturer strategic choices under different scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found
Airline crew scheduling: Models and algorithms,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102304,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The airline crew scheduling problem has become a crucial but challenging task for commercial airlines for decades. Airlines are operating with two types of air crew: cockpit crew and cabin crew. Due to the unique operating characteristics, the scheduling problems for these two crew types are very different. Besides, according to the planning stage, the airline crew scheduling problem can be classified as tactical planning problems (traditional scheduling and robust scheduling, weeks or months before the actual operations) and operational planning problems (recovery, after disruptions have occurred during the operational stage). Realizing the significance of the airline crew scheduling problems and a lack of review on the modelling and algorithmic advancements in terms of each crew type and planning stage, we develop this paper to review the related literature from four aspects: the scheduling for cabin crew, the scheduling for both cabin crew and cockpit crew, the robust scheduling for cockpit crew, and the recovery for cockpit crew. For each stream, we examine a number of prior representative studies to review the advancements in model development and solution algorithm construction to generate insights. Finally, we conclude the review by proposing a future research agenda for the airline crew scheduling problem.",1366-5545,Not found
A Stackelberg game based two-stage framework to make decisions of freight rate for container shipping lines in the emerging blockchain-based market,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102303,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"To improve the operational efficiency, blockchain technology has been gradually applied into the container shipping industry. As an easier, faster, more efficient platform, blockchain can help to enhance efficiency through digitalizing and easing paperwork. That means, blockchain will make the container shipping market more transparent. Changes in market characteristics will bring a significant problem, how will container shipping lines make decisions in the emerging blockchain-based market? This paper developed a Stackelberg game based two-stage framework to solve the problems. The first stage describes the process of container shipping lines deciding whether to enter the blockchain or not. The second stage describes how container shipping lines decide freight rate in an emerging blockchain-based market. The Cournot game and Stackelberg game are used to solve the second stage model. Spread factor is introduced to reflect the influence of the initial strategy on blockchain strategy. The classical demand function is modified to distinguish the non-blockchain market with more gentle competition from the blockchain market with more intense competition. Numerical experiment is applied to testify this paper. Results show: (1) Entering into the emerging shipping blockchain can be both an opportunity and a challenge for container shipping lines. (2) The ability of filtering function in the low freight rate of shipping blockchain plays a key role in regulating the freight rate and preventing the price war. This paper can provide decision suggestions for shipping lines at the early stage of blockchain introduction.",1366-5545,Not found
What leads to value co-creation in reward-based crowdfunding? A person-environment fit perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102297,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"With the dramatic growth of internet and platform economics, reward-based crowdfunding (RBC) has become prevalent, providing unprecedented opportunities to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Nevertheless, crowdfunding projects can find it difficult to succeed. Fundraisers can hardly simultaneously obtain both financial and non-financial benefits. This paper aims to investigate value co-creation including investment and feedback in RBC. After using a focus group to explore the underlying mechanisms of value co-creation in RBC, this research draws from the person–environment fit (P–E fit) theory to develop the research model. We used an online scenario-based survey, 364 valid samples of which were collected. The empirical results show that attractiveness and the P–E fit, including need fulfillment (NF) and value congruence (VC), lead to backers’ intentions to co-create value. Moreover, attractiveness fully mediates the relationship between NF and feedback intention (FI).

Feature-based selection of carsharing relocation modes,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102270,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"One-way and free-floating carsharing systems must be rebalanced to achieve a high service level, and thus generate benefits for users and society. In practice, vehicles can be relocated with multiple different modes (e.g., by truck or by driving them), but a single mode is sufficient in many instances. Obviously, a single mode is preferred from a computational standpoint: The routing problems are less complex since less synchronization is necessary, and thus solve much faster. It remains an open question which features drive the decision on the best mode, and if operators can decide a priori whether hybridization of several modes is beneficial/necessary, and which modes one should hybridize among. We build a classifier based on linear regression which predicts the costs for all individual modes. The advantage of this approach is that cost estimates (i) can be used as a feature in other approaches, and (ii) allow operators to estimate the necessary budget upfront. However, cost estimates cannot be used directly to determine key drivers for modal choice. We, thus, use logistic regression and decision trees for determining the best mode. These approaches are better at determining relevant features that explain which mode is preferred in an instance. We find that the most important features to decide between modes are vehicle and truck costs per kilometer as well as their velocities, and the average number of vehicles that shall be relocated per day (that is, the imbalance of the system). In most instances, the decision is between driving vehicles to rebalance them and rebalance staff by biking, or loading vehicles onto a truck. Hybridization proves useful in ≈ 20% of all instances, and a simple rule-based classifier is able to predict correctly that hybridization is necessary in most instances.",1366-5545,Not found
Is dual sourcing a better choice?

In the absence of CM encroachment, the OEM prefers dual sourcing when the fixed ordering cost is small. In contrast, faced with CM encroachment, the OEM may switch its sourcing strategy from single sourcing to dual sourcing as the level of competition increases. Moreover, a higher reliability investment cost enhances the OEM’s propensity to choose dual sourcing strategy. Furthermore, the OEM is more likely to choose a single sourcing strategy when the initial yield rate is higher. Under certain specific conditions, both the competitive CM and the OEM are better off when the OEM chooses the single (dual) sourcing strategy, thereby establishing a win–win situation.",1366-5545,Not found

The objectives of this research are firstly, to map the milk supply chains to explore information flow among different members for higher traceability; secondly, to investigate the societal impacts of blockchain technology in a milk supply chain to build social sustainability. The systems theory in integration with system dynamics (SD) provides the necessary theoretical underpinning to this research. We collect data from an agricultural development cooperative founded to support dairy farmers in Turkey. This work evaluates the societal impacts of blockchain technology on farmers, the community and animals using parameters such as local embedding, rural development, decreasing food fraud, animal health and welfare, proximity to food markets, food security, educating and promoting people towards healthy eating, assisting food access and social acceptability for transparency. In the last 18 years, the cooperative has encouraged dairy farmers in the district to become partners with a resultant increase in milk production from 30 thousand tons in 2002 to 330 thousand tons in 2019. According to our findings, population growth of the country and adult population increases in the district, it is expected that by 2025 the number of partners will rise to approximately 2800. The increase in number of partners proves the network expansion. Furthermore, blockchain technology can be incorporated into the existing system so that transparent and end-to-end accurate tracking of the supply chain is made possible, while creating decentralized recording of transactions. Moreover, the critical traceability points of a milk supply chain are evaluated with the blockchain adoption.

If the supplier is moderately capital-constrained, however, the manufacturer’s preferred sourcing strategy depends on the type of the backup supplier, which leads to a horizontal competition or co-opetition structure.

The problem has been motivated by a case study of Lebanese experience in Syrian war refugee accommodation. We elaborate on the complexity and real-life constraints and, propose a compact formulation of a mathematical model of the problem. We then show that modeling the problem using a Benders paradigm drives O ( n 3 ) variables of the original compact model unnecessary in addition to the constraints that are being projected out in a typical Benders decomposition.

A multi-layer weighted betweenness metric is used to rank the centrality of the hubs in the network based on the connectivity, distance, and traffic between the airports. Using the centrality ranking of the airports to reflect the distribution of traffic demand in the BRI countries, a gravity model is then applied to quantify the centrality of the maritime and rail hubs. Mapping these hubs to their home cities, this paper assesses the current state of the multimodal transport hubs and recommends new hubs to increase the international trading reach of the BRI.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal strategy of a customer-to-customer sharing platform: Whether to launch its own sharing service?,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102288,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"As the sharing economy is increasingly growing, various sharing business models have been widely adopted in practice. Some sharing platform firms provide their self-owned products in the market operating in a B2C (business-to-customer) sharing model in addition to the original customer-to-customer (C2C) sharing model. In this study, we develop an analytical framework to examine whether a C2C sharing platform firm launches its own sharing service in both a monopoly market and a supply chain setting. Customers in the market are naturally grouped into product owners and renters. We show that the platform firm does not always choose to launch the B2C sharing service, which significantly depends on the proportion of product owners of the C2C sharing product, the consumer acceptance level of the platform firm’s sharing product and the corresponding marginal production cost. We also find that the introduction of the B2C sharing service will always increase total consumer surplus and social welfare. Furthermore, we further investigate whether the platform firm launches the sharing service by offering its own product or procuring it from an upstream supplier, and extend our analysis to a N-period framework and demonstrate that our results are robust.",1366-5545,Not found
Carrier-shipper risk management and coordination in the presence of spot freight market,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102287,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The spot freight market in the liner shipping industry has developed significantly in recent years and interplays with the long-term contract between carriers and shippers. Under this background, this paper presents a Stackelberg games model by taking into account both the carrier’s long-term decision (on freight rate) as well as the shipper’s long-term decision (on shipment capacity procurement amount) and spot market supplementary procurement decision. The shipper is risk-averse facing market uncertainty. Three basic shipping structures are considered: procuring only from carrier with long-term contract, only from spot market, and from both of these channels. We show that dual channels play different roles for the shipper. Although the spot market is not favourable for the carrier, it increases both the shipper’s utility and the carrier-shipper’s overall performance. Risk-aversion reduces the shipment capacity procurement amount, which protects the shipper but jeopardizes the carrier’s and the carrier-shipper’s overall performance. Fluctuations of market demand and spot freight rate have different (sometimes even opposite) impacts on the carrier and the shipper. Correlation of market demand and spot freight rate brings more uncertainty for the shipper but grants more leverage for the carrier. Coordination initiated by the carrier improves the carrier-shipper’s overall performance substantially, but full coordination is not feasible owing to the shipper’s aversion to risk.

Novel robotic job-shop scheduling models with deadlock and robot movement considerations,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102273,149,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The robotic job-shop scheduling problem (RJSP) has become increasingly important due to the wide application of robots for material delivery in modern logistics and supply chain systems. With the common assumptions of negligible material transportation procedures and infinite machine buffers, the traditional job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) models can lead to system failures due to the potential deadlock for a robot-driven production line. In this study, we propose two novel robotic job-shop scheduling models with deadlock and robot movement considerations (RJSPDT). The proposed novel models simultaneously consider the scheduling of job operations and the movement of the robot, with the objective of minimizing makespan. In order to avoid deadlock, the machine blocking strategy is applied and a set of tight deadlock-avoidance constraints is proposed. Two modelling approaches are applied: the traditional position-based approach and the novel network-based approach which is inspired by aviation scheduling studies. Through numerical examples, it is illustrated that our proposed models can completely avoid transportation conflicts by considering deadlock and robot movement. Besides, through computational experiments, the network-based RJSPDT shows higher solution efficiency owing to the smaller model size than the position-based RJSPDT (e.g., reducing the computational time by 96% for small-scale problems). Moreover, we explore the impacts of job settings (e.g., number of jobs, number of operations in a job) and job entrance strategies (i.e., fixed entrance and flexible entrance) on model performances. Results show that the number of jobs imposes greater impacts than the number of operations in a job, while the fixed entrance strategy can reduce the average computational time by 60% with little impact on the makespan.",1366-5545,Not found

To introduce a store brand or not: Roles of market information in supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102334,150,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Retailers in multiple market segments have opposing business practices regarding whether to introduce a store brand. Assuming that manufacturers and retailers have symmetric knowledge on market information, prior literature has shown that retailers have incentive to introduce a store brand in cases in which the store brand intensively competes with the national brand. Information asymmetry, however, is prevalent in supply chains. In the era of big data, the latest advances in technology intensify information asymmetry by allowing retailers to access market information with improved accuracy. To address such information asymmetry, some retailers share information with manufacturers, while others do not. The gap between prior studies and current industrial practices motivates us to explore the roles of market information in supply chains regarding store brand introduction. In this research, we consider a two-echelon supply chain in which the retailer has an advantage over the manufacturer in accessing market information. In the focal supply chain, four decision scenarios are present, each of which deviates from the others on the retailer’s decision on information sharing and store brand introduction. By evaluating and comparing supply chain performances in these decision scenarios, we demonstrate the influence of information accuracy on the incentive for the retailer to introduce a store brand and the mitigation effect of information sharing on such influence. In particular, we contribute to the literature by finding that, surprisingly, high information accuracy prevents store brand introduction even if brand competition is intensive. This research bridges the gap between prior research and industrial practices and is the first to consider information asymmetry and information sharing in the context of store brand introduction. Our findings contribute to theories of store brand introduction and provide information sharing for practitioners as a managerial tool to realize the full potential of store brands.",1366-5545,Not found

With airline delays a continuing problem around the world, such an undertaking is valuable, and its lessons extend to other passenger transportation sectors. One useful lesson from the theoretical analysis of a two-flight model is that the mitigation of delay propagation is done entirely by the ground buffer and the second flight’s buffer. The first flight’s buffer plays no role because the ground buffer is a perfect, while nondistorting, substitute. In addition, the apportionment of mitigation responsibility between the ground buffer and the second flight's buffer is shown to depend on the relationship between the costs of ground- and flight-buffer time.

For example, due to the cost structure, there is little impact on profitability with time varying speeds, but time windows play a significant role in the profitability of the system.

To minimize the systematic energy, this paper proposes an integrated energy-efficient train operation method in which the driving strategy and the train timetable are jointly optimized. Firstly, the models of calculating the traction energy and the reuse of the regenerate energy are introduced with the constraints of the train operation. Then, the systematical optimization model is formulated by taking the net energy (i.e., the difference between the traction energy and the reused regenerate energy) as the objective function. Based on the Space–-Time-Speed network methodology, the optimization model is transformed into a discrete decision problem. Next, two algorithms are used to solve the problem. The dynamic programming algorithm is used to obtain the global optimal solution, and the discrete differential dynamic programming algorithm is applied to get the approximate optimal solution to reduce the computing time. Finally, two numeral examples are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on energy saving. The method can reduce the net energy consumption by up to 25.0% compared to the result without optimization and by up to 8.7% compared to the result by using the two-stage method.",1366-5545,Not found

The greedy approach simply searches for a solution using currently updated static GDP information, and the other two approaches provide a solution by considering possible scenarios for changes of the GDP. Using real-world data in existing literature and some generated scenarios, we present extensive computational results to assess the performance of the approaches.

A modified artificial bee colony algorithm for the dynamic ride-hailing sharing problem,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102124,150,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Ride-hailing sharing involves grouping ride-hailing customers with similar trips and time schedules to share the same ride-hailing vehicle to reduce their total travel cost. With the current information and communication technology, ride-hailing customers and drivers can be matched in real-time via a ride-hailing platform. This paper formulates a dynamic ride-hailing sharing problem that simultaneously maximizes the number of served customers, minimizes the travel cost and travel time ratios, and considers the capacity, time window, and travel cost constraints. The travel cost ratio is the ratio of actual passengers’ fare to the passengers’ fare without ride-hailing sharing, whereas the travel time ratio is defined as the actual travel time (including waiting time) over the maximum allowable travel time. To solve the dynamic problem, it is divided into many small and continuous static subproblems with an equal time interval. Each subproblem is solved by a modified artificial bee colony (MABC) algorithm with path relinking, while the contraction hierarchies and vantage point tree are used to determine the shortest path and accelerate the algorithm, respectively. Problem properties and the performance of the proposed solution method are demonstrated using large-scale real-time data from Didi that is the largest ride-hailing company in China. The proposed method is shown to outperform the benchmark, i.e., greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with path relinking. The proposed method also performs better when the length of each time interval is longer, and the tolerance for the incremental travel time caused by detours is higher. We also demonstrate that (a) considering both travel cost and travel time ratios in the objective can achieve a better sharing percentage, and balance the increase in the travel time ratio and the decrease in the travel cost ratio compared with the objective that misses either travel time or the travel cost ratio; and (b) the passengers can gain a large out-of-pocket cost saving in the case of ride-hailing sharing while enduring a relatively small increase in travel time compared with the case without ride-hailing sharing.",1366-5545,Not found
The impact of inspection on the sustainable production strategy: Environmental violation and abatement in emerging markets,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102294,150,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Environmental inspections help regulators ensure manufacturers’ compliance with environmental regulations and reduce pollution. However, the intensive inspections to ensure compliance are costly. This is especially problematic for emerging countries with limited resources for law enforcement. The literature provides limited understandings for regulators to design a cost-effective inspection program. Our study enters this discourse by examining the relationship between governments’ environmental inspection frequency (effort) and manufacturers’ environmental performance (in terms of environmental incidents). First, by sampling Chinese-listed manufacturers, our empirical analysis reveals that higher inspection frequency improves a manufacturer’s environmental performance in the short but not the long term. We further develop a dynamic game model to explore the reasons behind this lack of effectiveness in the long term. The results show that effectiveness can be achieved through an integration between inspection frequency and penalties for noncompliance. Inspection leads to cosmetic improvements in a manufacturer; frequent inspections accompanied with increased penalties substantially enhance a manufacturer’s abatement efforts, which is the most effective enforcement policy. Our study suggests that penalty can be the boundary condition between rational choice and behavioral shock on environmental enforcement. It urges manufacturers to make reasonable abatement efforts to reduce environmental penalties and improve environmental performance. Our study has important implications for policymakers in that it provides them a basis on which to review the current environmental law and enforcement process.",1366-5545,Not found

The experiment results show that the proposed model obtains 8% higher accuracy at the total sales level and forecasts more accurately at the SKU sales level as well, which demonstrate its superiority.

Vehicle routing optimization for hazmat shipments considering catastrophe avoidance and failed edges,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102337,150,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This research is a bi-objective vehicle routing optimization for hazmat shipments considering catastrophe avoidance and failed edges. The risk is defined as load dependent incident consequence, and the maximum risk is minimized based on the principle of catastrophe avoidance. A 2-stage decision-making is proposed to deal with the failed edges after incidents, and two different strategies are discussed. In each strategy, a bi-objective vehicle routing model is developed to decide the initial vehicle routing plan in the first decision-making stage, and a path selection model is developed to decide the paths of substitute vehicles in order to complete the unfinished deliveries of incident vehicles in the second decision-making stage. The exact algorithms and approximation algorithms are developed for both strategies. Whereafter, the two strategies are compared by mathematical analysis. Finally, numerical results are reported and the sensitivity analysis provides several managerial insights.",1366-5545,Not found
A novel risk perspective on location-routing planning: An application in cash transportation,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102356,150,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The critical role of supply chain security for businesses and government agencies has resulted in significant efforts over the last two decades to reduce vulnerability or disruption in supply chains. This paper addresses the routing problem of security carriers for high-value shipment transportation by developing a rich variant of the vehicle routing problem. To secure the route plans, the predictability of vehicle paths beside the travel costs is minimized by proposing a new integrated dynamic risk index. We present a mixed integer linear programming formulation for this problem, called the secure pickup and delivery problem with time windows (S-PDPTW). Moreover, a meta-heuristic solution method based on the adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is developed to tackle the large-size instances. Extensive computational experiments for the target problem and the proposed algorithm demonstrate the efficiency of all developed procedures. Using the geographical information system, we provide some managerial insights based on a real case from the strategic and operational perspectives, whereby the applicability of the developed model is clearly shown in considerably reducing the risk value against a slight increase in classic objective value.",1366-5545,Not found

Our model indicates that air-HSR cooperation increases flight frequency, air traffic and the load factor of the airline on the long-haul route. For the short-haul route, the impact of air-HSR cooperation on the airline and the HSR operator critically depends on a number of relevant parameters, for example, the market size and the travel time of HSR. Air-HSR cooperation decreases the emissions per passenger on the long-haul route, however, on the short-haul route where the HSR operator interacts with the airline, the emissions per passenger do not necessarily decrease after the cooperation.",1366-5545,Not found
The multi-commodity network flow problem with soft transit time constraints: Application to liner shipping,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102342,150,2021-06-01,2021,6,"The multi-commodity network flow problem (MCNF) consists in routing a set of commodities through a capacitated network at minimum cost and is relevant for routing containers in liner shipping networks. As commodity transit times are often a critical factor, the literature has introduced hard limits on commodity transit times. In practical contexts, however, these hard limits may fail to provide sufficient flexibility since routes with even tiny delays would be discarded. Motivated by a major liner shipping operator, we study an MCNF generalization where transit time restrictions are modeled as soft constraints, in which delays are discouraged using penalty functions of transit time. Similarly, early commodity arrivals can receive a discount in cost. We derive properties that distinguish this model from other MCNF variants and adapt a column generation procedure to efficiently solve it. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on realistic liner shipping instances reveal that the explicit consideration of penalty functions can lead to significant cost reductions compared to hard transit time deadlines. Moreover, the penalties can be used to steer the flow towards slower or faster configurations, resulting in a potential increase in operational costs, which generates a trade-off that we quantify under varying penalty functions.",1366-5545,Not found

In the ride-hailing platform, dedicated drivers are assigned to serve a single request (one-to-one matching) or two requests (one-to-two matching). We aim to examine the en-route matching problem, i.e., an in-transit driver who is currently serving riders may be informed to pick up co-riders traveling in the same direction. We consider boundedly rational users who accept ride-shares at reasonable travel costs. To encourage riders to join one-to-two matching, we propose an incentive scheme under which riders who experience detour time in one-to-two matching will be charged at a discounted rate. To make en-route decisions quickly, we propose a rolling horizon approach. The flexible one-to-two matching problem is formulated as a multi-stage integer program with the objective of maximizing the system-wide profit. We derive the upper bound on detour time for riders, based on which we develop an efficient algorithm to determine cost-feasible ride-shares. We also develop a neighborhood searching method to identify the locations that are close to a driver. Exploiting the historical trip data of New York taxis, we investigate the matching patterns and provide strategies to benefit the users and the platform when the ride-hailing program is introduced into the existing road network. The numerical experiments reveal that our proposed incentive scheme for one-to-two matching problems can increase both ridership and profit. Furthermore, the productivity and the compensation of dedicated drivers are also improved.",1366-5545,Not found

Investment competition on dedicated terminals under demand ambiguity,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102306,150,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper establishes real option game models to investigate two competing shipping lines’ timing decisions on their respective dedicated terminal (DT) investments in the presence of demand ambiguity. In addition, we compare the shipping lines’ DT investment timing with the choice under the social optimum, and discuss the subsidy policies with which a government can regulate the shipping lines’ investment timing. The results indicate that (1) if the shipping lines are symmetric (i.e., have the same DT capacities, investment costs, and operation costs while having symmetric demands), their DT investment game could reach sequential investment equilibrium, where the leader makes a preemptive investment while the follower’s investment is delayed compared to the case without ambiguity; (2) when the government has complete information on the shipping lines’ ambiguity level, the regulation rule exhibits a stepwise structure where the social optimum (or the mixed timing between the social optimum and the shipping lines’ optimum, respectively) is implemented, if the social optimal timing is later (or earlier, respectively) than the shipping lines’ break-even timing; (3) when the government has incomplete information on the shipping lines’ ambiguity level, the stepwise structure still holds but the shipping lines can obtain extra subsidies due to their information advantages compared to the complete information case; and (4) compared to the complete information case, the incomplete information may promote (or delay, respectively) the regulated DT investment timing, if the increasing ambiguity has positive (or negative, respectively) effects on the shipping lines’ marginal option values.",1366-5545,Not found

This paper is the first attempt to explore the factors impacting Less-than-Truckload (LTL) freight load factors at a disaggregated level to the best of our knowledge. The paper analyzes the operation data provided by a leading LTL logistics company in China, using the beta regression finite mixture models. The results show that the under-loaded tours and over-loaded tours behave differently in terms of load factor determination. All variables' impacts vary across the different components, confirming the need to analyze these two scenarios separately using finite mixture models. For under-loaded tours, high shipping demand and the use of small vehicles are always positively and significantly associated with the load factor. For over-loaded LTL tours, the effects of transportation distance and leased vehicles are always positive and significant. Finally, implications for operations strategies and public policies are discussed based on the estimated results. These findings shed light on an in-depth understanding of LTL freight load factors and provide essential references for LTL logistics companies, transportation planners, policymakers, and researchers.",1366-5545,Not found
Exact and heuristic approaches to reschedule helicopter flights for personnel transportation in the oil industry,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102322,151,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper addresses a real-life short-term rescheduling problem of helicopter flights from one onshore airport to several maritime units in the context of the oil industry. This is a complex and challenging problem to solve because of the particular characteristics observed in practice, such as pending flights transferred from previous days with different recovering priorities, changes in flight timetables and helicopter assignments previously planned for the current day, time windows and minimum time intervals between take-offs from the airport and the maritime units, mandatory flight precedence, maximum flight delays, among many others. The problem consists of determining a daily flight reschedule that satisfies operational constraints and recovers all pending flights, while minimizing flight delays and costs related to helicopter usage and reassignments. We propose two mixed integer programming models to formulate the problem with all relevant characteristics, one based on the extension of traditional network flow models and other that relies on a novel event-based representation of the problem. Additionally, we develop an effective heuristic approach based on constructive and improvement heuristics, able to produce high-quality solutions within acceptable computational times.

Multi-modal morning commute with endogenous shared autonomous vehicle penetration considering parking space constraint,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102354,151,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Autonomous vehicles are poised to generate revolutionary impact on urban mobility and parking availability. This study aims to model the morning commute dynamics in a multi-modal transportation system and examine how to regulate the market in the presence of parking space constraint and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Other than the SAVs, commuters can also choose to take regular vehicles (RVs) or public transit (PT) to travel from home to workplace. SAVs will compete the bottleneck capacity with RVs. The dynamic departure patterns and endogenous penetration rate of SAVs are determined depending on parking supply and other related factors. The conditions for various portfolios of travel modes are derived in details. Analytical propositions, numerical examples, as well as policy implications are given with respect to different market factors such as the additional SAV cost, and parking supply. The results show that there are two possible system optimal solutions depending on the value of transit fare. When the transit fare is low, the system optimum occurs in Scenario CS II&III, wherein all three travel modes are used, the first SAV commuter arrives at the bottleneck just when the last RV commuter leaves, and the parking supply and the additional SAV cost should be controlled to a suitable value; when the transit fare is relatively high, the system optimum appears in Scenario IV, an extreme scenario wherein the parking supply is zero, and only the travel modes of PT and SAVs are used. This paper is helpful in quantifying the impacts of new vehicle technologies and shedding lights on future mobility and parking management.",1366-5545,Not found
Managing surges in online demand using bandwidth throttling: An optimal strategy amid the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102339,151,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Managing supply chains requires quick access to the enterprise– and customer–facing online network applications and transparency of data across supply chains. While it is challenging to meet the rapidly growing demand for bandwidth to support supply chain applications in the Blockchain era, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered bandwidth demand surges across all online services such as the internet, content delivery, e-platforms, and social media. A sudden demand surge may impel users to lose their access or have a poor online experience due to bandwidth throttling by their Online Service Providers (OSPs). Earlier work on optimal throttling mechanism under stochastic demand has overlooked such demand surges. In this paper, we recast the user demand to adequately capture the demand surges, such as home bandwidth demand surges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we model the user demand as a geometric Lévy (jump–diffusion) process. Within our general setting, we show that it is optimal for the OSP to follow a modified control-band policy that encompasses the existing results as a special case. Our numerical study not only enhances the current insights about the optimal throttling mechanism by including demand surges but also provides new insights concerning the nature of demand surges. For example, our study suggests that OSPs should initiate demand throttling at relatively lower usage levels if the likelihood of having demand surges is high; furthermore, we find that when OSPs are exposed to demand surges with higher intensities, it is optimal for them to wait until the usage level reaches a relatively high level before throttling it.",1366-5545,Not found

The locations occupied by items previously stored in the forward area are not available. The problem is formulated as an integer program and proved to be NP-hard. We propose a two-stage decomposition algorithm, showing that it provides high-quality solutions quickly. Compared with methods proposed in the literature and used in practice, the travel distance is substantially reduced. Also, our numerical study shows that considering the constraint that items have previously been stored, which has often been ignored in previous research, can improve the picking performance by more than 5 % .

Shipowners need to consider the economic cost, energy feasibility, and other relevant factors of different schemes before making decisions. This paper empirically explores the factors that affect shipowners' energy choices. Based on the new emerging individual ship dynamic data, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and other relevant databases, we apply various data mining methods and a threshold discrete choice model combined with an oversampling technique to conduct quantitative measurements and statistical analyses of factors for each ship type that affect the shipowners' choices. Three groups of indicators, including ship characteristics, shipowner characteristics, and market conditions, are considered in our analysis.

"Deploying, scheduling, and sequencing heterogeneous vessels in a liner container shipping route",10.1016/j.tre.2021.102365,151,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Previous studies on liner container shipping operations usually assume identical container ships deployed in the same shipping route. However, in real operations, this assumption does not always hold considering the distinct capacities, ages, fuel efficiencies, cost structures, etc. of these ships. These distinctions significantly influence the number of containers transported, the bunker fuel consumption, and the operating cost of a shipping route. In this regard, this paper considers the joint ship deployment, sequencing, and scheduling problem for a fleet of heterogeneous vessels in a shipping route. A mixed integer programming model is developed to select the optimal ships from a set of candidate ships together with their sequences, schedules, and sailing speeds in the shipping route to minimize the total cost. A tailored solution algorithm is subsequently developed to calculate the global optimal solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm significantly outperforms the classical branch-and-cut algorithm in solving the model. In addition, by applying our model in a real-case shipping route, we find that the model is able to reduce the total cost by 5% compared with that considering homogeneous vessels.

A stochastic optimization model for staged hospital evacuation during hurricanes,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102321,151,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Hurricanes result in large scale evacuations almost every year. Of particular concern and difficulty is the decision of whether or not to evacuate hospitals in these emergencies. During an emergency, a hospital is a source of refuge, and evacuating its patients is often viewed as a last resort since it is difficult to provide quality care while transporting them. At the same time, flooding and loss of power and communications put patients and caregivers at very high risk. Most emergency response plans do not have clear guidelines for evacuating or sheltering-in-place. Hurricanes are particularly complicated because there is often considerable uncertainty surrounding their eventual trajectory and intensity. These factors have contributed to, what is in hindsight, poor decisions that have cost lives. The current paper addresses this problem by developing a stochastic optimization formulation, taking into account evolving conditions and, therefore a hopefully robust collection of future flood, wind, and roadway traffic predictions. The model determines the order in which patients should be evacuated over time based on the evolution of the storm by trading off cost and risk. A holistic case study focused on North Carolina and the evolution of Hurricane Isabel is presented by fusing data and model outputs from different sources.

We analyze the strategic interaction between one entrant and three incumbent firms that include one major firm (or a firm offering a popular product) and two local firms (or firms offering niche products). We explore the impact of such asymmetric demand structures on the entrant’s partner selection. Our equilibrium analysis indicates that forming a partnership with a firm that currently has the largest market share because of its superior product is not necessarily optimal for the entrant. When the value offered by the entrant is significantly high, it is more beneficial for the entrant to ally with the major firm, even if that firm currently has a smaller market share than the local firms because of its inferior product. We also demonstrate that when the entrant can add technological superiority to the partner’s product, the entrant’s optimal partner selection may change non-monotonically in the degree of this superiority. Furthermore, in response to the entrant’s optimal partner selection, the relative profitability between incumbent firms can reverse discontinuously and drastically according to the degree of the value offered by the entrant.",1366-5545,Not found
Approximate dynamic programming for network recovery problems with stochastic demand,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102358,151,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Immediately after a disruption, in order to minimize the negative impact inflicted on the society, its imperative to re-establish the interdicted critical services enabled by the infrastructure networks. In this paper, we study the stochastic network recovery problem that tackles the planning of restoration activities (considering limited resources) on interdicted infrastructure network links so that the pre-disruption critical service flows can be re-established as quickly as possible. As an illustrative case study, we consider a disaster scenario on a road infrastructure network that obstructs the flow of relief-aid commodities and search-and-rescue teams between critical service providing facilities and locations in need of these critical services. As in the case of many realistic applications, we consider the amount of demand for critical services as stochastic. First, we present a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation for the stochastic road network recovery problem (SRNRP), then we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to heuristically solve SRNRP. We develop basis functions to capture the important complex network interactions that can be used to approximate cost-to-go values for the MDP states. We conduct computational experiments on a set of small-scale randomly generated instances and demonstrate that the ADP approach provides near-optimal results regardless of the demand distribution and network topology. In order to develop a practical approach suitable for solving real world sized instances, we propose a framework where we first develop an ADP model and derive a policy on a spatially aggregated network of large scale instance. Next, we show the performance of this policy through computational testing on the large scale disaggregated network. Moreover, we provide managerial insights by assessing the importance of each basis function in the ADP model contributing to the recovery policies. We test this approach on a case study based on the Boston road infrastructure network. We observe that, as the urgency of re-establishing services increases or the resources become more scarce, the information gained from the network characteristics and short-term decisions should be the main driving factors to derive recovery policies. The results of all experiments strongly evidence the significance of utilizing the inherent network interactions and attributes to generate basis function sets for ADP models that yield high-quality recovery policies.",1366-5545,Not found

Distribution channel and licensing strategy choice considering consumer online reviews in a closed-loop supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102338,151,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This research builds two-period game models to address the choice issues of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)’s licensing strategy and the Independent Remanufacturer (IR)’s distribution channel, considering consumer online reviews in a closed-loop supply chain.

In period 2, the OEM determines the licensing strategy (the fixed or royalty fee) to authourize the IR to remanufacture, and then the IR chooses the distribution channel (direct or indirect) for remanufactured products. Interestingly, our results show that the IR prefers the direct channel when the remanufacturing cost is smaller. And the obtained willingness-to-pay (WTP) from consumer online reviews has a positive impact on the threshold value of the remanufacturing cost. Moreover, we find that the OEM’s licensing strategy choice depends on the sizes of the fixed licensing fee and the obtained WTP. The OEM will choose the royalty licensing strategy to the IR who has chosen the direct channel, when the fixed fee and the obtained WTP are smaller.

Inter-platform competition in a regulated ride-hail market with pooling,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102327,151,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper studies an aggregate ride-hail market in which two platforms compete with each other, as well as with transit, under different supply and regulatory conditions. The duopoly is built on a general market equilibrium model that explicitly characterizes the physical matching process, including pairing two passengers for a pooling ride. Depending on whether drivers’ work affiliation with a platform is exclusive or not, the duopoly is said to have a single- or multi-homing supply mode. We describe the outcome of the duopoly pricing game as a Nash Equilibrium (NE) and solve it by transforming it into a variational inequality problem (VIP). When a regulatory constraint is imposed, the duopoly equilibrium becomes a generalized NE, which corresponds to a quasi VIP. We show that multi-homing may lead to disastrous outcomes in an unregulated duopoly and demonstrate it through numerical experiments constructed using data from Chicago. Specifically, passenger and driver surplus, as well as platform profits, are all significantly lower in a multi-homing duopoly than in a single-homing counterpart. This disaster arises because (i) the multi-homing duopoly is locked in a self-destructive pricing war analogous to the tragedy of the commons; and (ii) the competition among passengers limits economy of scale in trip production. We show that the negative consequences of this tragedy can be mitigated by (i) discouraging multi-homing behavior; (ii) imposing a minimum wage on both platforms; and (iii) encouraging the platforms to specialize in different services. The results also show the efficiency in matching passengers and drivers is a crucial asset for a platform’s competitiveness, more so in a multi-homing duopoly. In general, the platform with a higher matching efficiency ends up making more money and providing a better level of service.",1366-5545,Not found
Competition between the transportation network company and the government with subsidies to public transit riders,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102426,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The substitution and complement of ride-sourcing services and public transit services greatly affect the mobility and accessibility of a multi-modal transportation system. Since the transportation network company (TNC) (operator of ride-sourcing) concerns the profit and the government (operator of public transit) promotes social welfare, the two policy-makers will both cooperate and compete with each other to enhance their benefits. In this paper, we develop a bi-level game-theoretic approach to model the cooperative and competitive relationship between the TNC and the government. In the upper level, the two policy-makers design a cooperative plan such that the government provides subsidies to public transit riders who use ride-sourcing to solve first- or last-mile problems. In the lower level, they attempt to optimize operational strategies to compete with each other for achieving their objectives. The outcome of the bi-level game depends on passengers’ choices among alternative travel modes, which is characterized by an aggregate multi-modal market. Based on the proposed game-theoretic approach, we analytically and numerically examine the impact of the competition with passenger-side subsidies on the multi-modal system, and the existence of optimal strategies that lead to a win–win situation for both the policy-makers. We find that a socially-optimal subsidy level may exist. In areas with high public transit accessibility, a good-intentioned subsidy that boosts first- or last-mile ride-sourcing services can reduce the TNC’s profit. Our research highlights the value of a carefully designed subsidy structure that benefits both the TNC (profit) and the society (social welfare), especially in areas with low public transit accessibilities.",1366-5545,Not found

The first one is Scenario M, in which the manufacturer collects the used products from trade-in customers by herself; and the second one is Scenario R, in which the manufacturer outsources the trade-in service to the retailer and obtains the used products from the retailer at a buy-back price. Accordingly, the firm in charge of the service needs to determine a rebate rate. We show that both firms prefer to operate the trade-in service by themselves in most cases, and we derive the condition for each firm to prefer a scenario and also the condition under which the supply chain is better off from a scenario. Compared to Scenario M, trade-in customers can enjoy lower prices in two periods in Scenario R, although the second-period sales price for new customers is higher. We also perform a numerical study to investigate the impacts of major parameters on the optimal prices, rebate rate, profits, and the conditions for each firm’s and the supply chain’s scenario preferences. The difference between trade-in prices in the two scenarios is larger when trade-in customers are more sensitive to the price, whereas the difference becomes smaller when the manufacturer obtains a higher net gain from handling returned products.",1366-5545,Not found
Hub network design for hazardous-materials transportation under uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102424,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This paper considers a hazardous materials (hazmat) transportation network design problem based on hub location topology under uncertainty. The control variables include decisions regarding location of hubs and hazmat response teams, along with the routing schemes. The model aims to minimize the total risk in the network. The measure of risk incorporates average response time to hazmat incidents as well as waiting time at hubs. To tackle the uncertainty of the problem, an efficient interactive approach using mean-absolute deviation and possibilistic programming is developed. Two heuristic algorithms based on lower bound procedure and rolling horizon scheme are presented to solve the model in large scale instances. The advantages of the presented methodologies are demonstrated through numerical experiments based on transportation networks from Sioux Falls, SD, and Western New York.

An automated system of emissions permit trading for transportation firms,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102385,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"New technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) play important roles in transportation emissions trading platforms. Due to the complexity and stochastically changing prices of emissions, an effective algorithm is needed in these platforms to optimize the use of emissions. By setting an upper bound for buying and a lower bound for selling, such an algorithm can reduce trading risk and ensure the stability of trading platforms. In this study, we developed an automatic emissions permit trading system using a dynamic programming approach with selling and purchasing bounds for transportation firms with non-negligible fixed transaction setup costs. We partially characterize the optimal transportation and permit trading policies by exploiting a new mathematical property that is suitable for a two-dimensional control system. We attempt to elucidate the optimal coordination of permit trading and permit consumption for a transportation firm facing both the Markov price process and random demand during a multi-period planning horizon. We prescribe an optimal trading policy and propose a well-performed heuristic policy and a tight lower bound for the platform. We also show that the easily implemented heuristic policy would not significantly increase emissions.

Home health care routing and scheduling problem with the consideration of outpatient services,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102420,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In China, family doctor contract service can provide not only the home health care service for the elderly or patients with mobility difficulties at their homes but also the outpatient service mainly for ordinary patients in the community care center.

This also significantly influences the carrier’s pricing decisions because of tax policies in different countries/regions. In this paper, we consider customers’ preference for free shipping and investigate two competing retailers’ free shipping decisions when they rely on a common carrier for cross-border logistics services. We focus on the impact of retail price competition and the carrier’s tax cost, which shows uniqueness in the shipping industry. We derive the supply chain parties’ optimal decisions by the general equilibrium theory and analyze their free shipping incentives based on game-theoretical models. We find that, if the carrier is non-resident, given one retailer’s free shipping, the other one would follow the step when the retail price competition is mild and the carrier faces small tax disparity. Interestingly, the carrier will benefit from the two retailers’ free shipping when the retail price competition is fierce and the tax disparity is small. If the carrier is resident and both retailers offer free shipping, we find that all supply chain parties will be beneficial, resulting in a win–win–win situation.",1366-5545,Not found
Food retail supply chain resilience and the COVID-19 pandemic: A digital twin-based impact analysis and improvement directions,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102412,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In this study, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food retail supply chains (SCs) and their resilience. Based on real-life pandemic scenarios encountered in Germany, we develop and use a discrete-event simulation model to examine SC operations and performance dynamics with the help of anyLogistix digital SC twin. The computational results show that food retail SC resilience at the upheaval times is triangulated by the pandemic intensity and associated lockdown/shutdown governmental measures, inventory-ordering dynamics in the SC, and customer behaviours. We observe that surges in demand and supplier shutdowns have had the highest impact on SC operations and performance, whereas the impact of transportation disruptions was rather low. Transportation costs have spiked because of chaotic inventory-ordering dynamics leading to more frequent and irregular shipments. On bright side, we observe the demand growth and utilization of online sales channels yielding higher revenues. We propose several directions and practical implementation guidelines to improve the food retail SC resilience. We stress the importance of SC digital twins and end-to-end visibility along with resilient demand, inventory, and capacity management.

This model not only allocates multi-type platelets to patients according to ABO/Rh(d)-compatible blood substitutions but also considers a three-layer logistics network for platelets that accounts for the impact of the age of the platelets on the suitability for different types of injuries. To efficiently solve the model and generate a Pareto front for large-scale instances of the problem, and multiple scenarios, we employ Lagrangian relaxation and the augmented ε -constraint method.

Integrated student to school assignment and school bus routing problem for special needs students,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102416,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In this paper, we address the combined problem of assigning students to schools and generating school bus routes for special needs students. Special needs students typically require additional accommodations, both in terms of the services available at school and during pick-ups and drop-offs. This introduces additional complexities to the problems of assignment and routing for students. We develop a mathematical model that jointly addresses these problems, and incorporate multi-loads and heterogeneous bus fleet features. The model simultaneously assigns special needs students to schools based on their level of need and the availability of resources, and generates efficient routes to transport them to their designated schools. We propose a two-phase heuristic approach using the capacitated clustering problem, which is capable of generating high-quality solutions. We evaluate our proposed methodology using several randomly generated instances, and a real-world case study in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

Humanitarian relief network assessment using collaborative truck-and-drone system,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102417,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The increasing number and severity of natural and man-made disasters worldwide has led to calls for more precise and effective humanitarian responses, and the use of humanitarian relief network assessment to reduce disaster uncertainty can play a vital role in the delivery of precise humanitarian operations. In this study, a collaborative truck-and-drone system was developed as a post-disaster assessment tool for use by humanitarian relief networks. The proposed system comprises a drone equipped with a camera that can launch from a truck to collect information from both nodes and links of a post-disaster transportation network. Following drone operation, the truck is used to retrieve and recharge the drone’s battery. To optimize this collaborative truck-and-drone system, we focused on the routing problem with the objective of maximizing the value of information collected from nodes and links within a predefined time limit, a problem made challenging by the need to determine the routes of the truck and drone in an integrated manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to consider the problem of collaborative truck-and-drone routing optimization with the goal of profit maximization. After formulating the proposed problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, we decomposed the problem structure into a path-based master problem and two sub-problems to allow the use of a column generation (CG) framework to tackle the problem. Numerical experiments were conducted to examine the proposed model and algorithm at various instance sizes that were generated by modifying an existing benchmark, with the results indicating that the proposed algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions with optimality gaps of less than 10% for all terminated instances within predefined time limit.

To answer this research question, we develop four two-echelon supply chain models. The model consists of one supplier and two competing retailers. We consider the two dimensions of collusion mode and information sharing type and derive the optimal equilibrium solutions for each member. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the following results: (i) With explicit collusion, retailers are less willing to vertically share information with the supplier. (ii) Tacit collusion with low demand uncertainty motivates information sharing because the wholesale price can correctly convey the supplier’s information to retailers. (iii) Increasing the probability of high demand or reducing the buyback rate can benefit all members in the supply chain. (iv) Different from the wholesale price and revenue sharing contract, in the buyback contract, the whole supply chain sustains losses from vertical information sharing under the condition of collusion with high demand uncertainty. A numerical experiment shows interesting insights: Although explicit collusion generally brings profit improvement to retailers, they prefer to choose tacit collusion to effectively identify price signals when the demand uncertainty is lower. We check the robustness of results and find that the main results will not be changed in the extended model where the buyback price is lower than the wholesale price.",1366-5545,Not found

The base model considers a loss system over a finite time horizon, and we provide a model variant that considers an infinite time horizon and the average reward criterion. Structural properties of the optimal policies are derived. Computational experiments using a real-world EMS dataset show that the optimal policies inform how to dynamically dispatch ambulance types to patients. We propose and evaluate three classes of heuristics, including a static constant threshold heuristic, a greedy heuristic, and a dynamic greedy threshold heuristic.

With pessimistic assumptions on the reduced separation standards, the system-wide fuel savings within New York Oceanic are about (in million gallons) 2.25 in 2020 and 3.21 in 2025. After excluding additional variable cost, the monetary value of the fuel savings is about (in million 2018 US dollars) 3.65 and 6.38, respectively.

Incentive alignment for blockchain adoption in medicine supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102276,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In recent years, blockchain technology has been increasingly adopted in OTC medicine supply chains, enabling customers to track the entire process from raw material purchasing to finished medicine distribution. This improves the brand image and hence expands the market. With the use of blockchain, information transparency can be achieved because data are stored immutably and safely in a distributed database that is accessible by all supply chain members. However, will the incentives for supply chain members to participate in blockchain for larger-scale demand come at the cost of information disclosure? In this paper, to investigate the supply chain members’ incentive alignment opportunities towards the adoption of blockchain technology, we consider a two-stage supply chain comprising two medicine manufacturers and a common retailer that has more accurate demand information than the manufacturers have. We find that, interestingly, the retailer has incentives to participate in blockchain when the manufacturers’ competition is mild and the demand variance is low. We further investigate the impact of blockchain on total surplus and customer surplus and find that the adoption of blockchain always benefits customers and society; therefore, blockchain can be particularly useful for social goods such as OTC medicine.",1366-5545,Not found
An effective kernel search and dynamic programming hybrid heuristic for a multimodal transportation planning problem with order consolidation,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102408,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"We study a realistic capacitated multimodal transportation planning problem (CMTPP) faced by logistics companies when trying to obtain a cost advantage in a competitive market. This problem simultaneously considers limited vehicle numbers and order consolidation. Given a set of origin–destination transportation orders with a time window, solving the CMTPP involves determining the delivery paths of these orders on a capacitated network as well as selecting the transportation modes used on these paths. Without violating time windows and network capacity constraints, all customers’ requests must be satisfied exactly, with minimum overall logistics costs. The CMTPP is formulated as a mixed binary linear program based on which an effective kernel search and dynamic programming hybrid heuristic (HKSDP) is proposed, which repeatedly generates feasible solutions. A column generation approach is also proposed to provide a lower bound for the problem which is then used to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristics. Numerical experiments for various sizes of random instances (with at most 300 orders in a network and 20 nodes) are conducted. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of column generation in obtaining a tight lower bound as well as the efficiency of the HKSDP in achieving a high-quality near-optimal solution.

The problem is considered stochastic since the information of requests and travel times is not known with certainty.

A column generation based heuristic for the generalized vehicle routing problem with time windows,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102391,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The generalized vehicle routing problem with time windows (GVRPTW) is defined on a directed graph G = ( V , A ) where the vertex set V is partitioned into clusters. One cluster contains only the depot, where is located a homogeneous fleet of vehicles, each with a limited capacity. The other clusters represent customers. A demand is associated with each cluster. Inside a cluster, the vertices represent the possible locations of the customer. A time window is associated with each vertex, during which the visit must take place if the vertex is visited. The objective is to find a set of routes such that the total traveling cost is minimized, exactly one vertex per cluster is visited, and all the capacity and time constraints are respected.

A real-time dispatching strategy for shared automated electric vehicles with performance guarantees,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102392,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Car-sharing has emerged as a competitive technology for urban mobility. Combined with the upward trend in vehicle electrification and the promise of automation, it is expected that urban travel will change in fundamental ways in the near future. Indeed, breakthroughs in battery technology and the incentive programs offered by governments worldwide have resulted in a continued increase in the market share of electric vehicles. Automation frees passengers from having to drive and seek parking, it also offers increased flexibility when selecting pick up locations. These trends and incentives naturally suggest that shared automated electric vehicle (SAEV) systems will displace traditional gasoline-powered, human-driven car-sharing systems worldwide. Real-time vehicle dispatching operations in traditional car-sharing systems is an already computationally challenging scheduling problem. Electrification only exacerbates the computational difficulties as charge level constraints come into play. To overcome this complexity, we employ an online minimum drift plus penalty (MDPP) approach for SAEV systems that (i) does not require a priori knowledge of customer arrival rates to the different parts of the system (i.e. it is practical from a real-world deployment perspective), (ii) ensures the stability of customer waiting times, (iii) ensures that the deviation of dispatch costs from a desirable dispatch cost can be controlled, and (iv) has a computational time-complexity that allows for real-time implementation. Using an agent-based simulator developed for SAEV systems, we test the MDPP approach under two scenarios with real-world calibrated demand and charger distributions: 1) a low-demand scenario with long trips, and 2) a high-demand scenario with short trips. The comparisons with other algorithms under both scenarios show that the proposed online MDPP outperforms all other algorithms in terms of both reduced customer waiting times and vehicle dispatching costs.",1366-5545,Not found
A behaviorally-integrated individual-level state-transition model that can predict rapid changes in evacuation demand days earlier,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102381,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Timely and accurate forecast of evacuation demand is key for emergency responders to plan and organize effective evacuation efforts during a disaster. The state of the art in evacuation demand forecasting includes behavior-based models and dynamic flow-based models. Both lines of work have limitations: behavioral models are static, meaning that they cannot adjust model predictions by utilizing field observation in real time as the disaster unfolds; and the flow-based models often have relatively short prediction windows ranging from minutes to hours. Consequently, both types of models fall short of being able to predict sudden changes (e.g., a surge or an abrupt drop) of evacuation demand in advance. This paper develops a behaviorally-integrated individual-level state-transition model for online predictions of evacuation demand. On a daily basis, the model takes in observed evacuation data and updates its forecasted evacuation demand for the future. An individual-level survival model formulation is devised for the state-transition model to account for history-dependent transition probabilities and allow individual heterogeneity. A Bayesian updating approach is employed to assimilate observed evacuation data in real time. To enable a longer-term perspective on how evacuation demand may evolve over time so that rapid surges or drops in demand can be predicted days in advance, the model integrates insights from existing behavioral curves (either from past disasters or simply expert opinions). Using a likelihood-based approach, the state-transition model integrates the future trends of evacuation demand informed by the behavioral curve when updating its forecasts. The theoretical proof of the developed state-transition model shows that the likelihood function guarantees a unique global solution. The model is tested in six scenarios using mobile app-based data for Hurricane Harvey that hit the US in 2017. The results demonstrate its robustness: in all six scenarios, the model is able to predict accurately the occurrence of the rapid surges or drops in evacuation demand at least two days ahead. The current study contributes to the field of evacuation modeling by integrating the two lines of work (behavior-based and flow-based models) using mobile app-based data for Hurricane Harvey.",1366-5545,Not found

We study extensive SSP instances from a freeway network and an urban road network, which involve 10,512 and 37,500 spatially and temporally correlated speed variables, respectively.

An integrated model for vessel traffic and deballasting scheduling in coal export terminals,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102409,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Most bulk carriers arrive at coal export terminals (CETs) under empty or lightly loaded conditions. Ballast water, which is onboarded to maintain vessel stability during a voyage, must be pumped out as the cargo is loaded. As modern CETs are rapidly developing, vessels’ deballasting capability is being updated too slowly and far behind the CET loading efficiency improvement. Therefore, an increasing number of vessels fail to finish deballasting in a timely manner, which results in frequent operational interruptions at the terminal. The high loading efficiency of modern CETs is discounted by a ship’s deballasting capability. Conventionally, many CETs have allowed vessels to deballast in advance at anchorages or lay-by berths to avoid delays at the loading berth and wasted resources. In this sense, in addition to making a complex traffic-scheduling plan for vessels entering and leaving terminals, port managers must make proper deballasting plans for vessels and avoid excessive deballasting problems. However, research on vessel scheduling considering deballasting is limited to date. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an integrated scheduling model (ISM) that manages the scheduling process of vessel traffic and deballasting operations. Special considerations of vessel stability under deballasting and tidal influence are introduced. As a result, with the goal of minimizing the total weighted delay, the model can simultaneously optimize the vessel sequence, lay-by berth allocation, and deballasting plan. A series of comprehensive experiments was conducted based on practical data collected from a major CET in China. The performance of the proposed ISM was tested through comparisons of scheduling under common rule-based scheduling methods with varying traffic density and terminal efficiency properties. The results show that the ISM can avoid untimely deballasting, shorten the vessel port stay time, and directly contribute to a total weighted delay reduction of 20.84%.

Undoubtedly, installment helps attract customers by allowing them to “buy now and pay later”. However, firms have to undertake the cash opportunity cost because the actual payment is triggered some days/months later, without any interest in the grace period. In this paper, we build a chain-to-chain competition model comprising of a reselling platform (e.g., Amazon.com), an agent selling platform (e.g., Taobao.com) and their exclusive suppliers, to investigate whether the reselling platform and the supplier on the agent selling platform have incentives to provide installment services. Interestingly, we find that, when the incremental demand is in a moderate range, there exists an asymmetric equilibrium where the reselling platform provides installment services while the supplier on the agent selling platform does not. Regarding the wholesale price for the reselling platform, we find the supplier may determine a lower or higher wholesale price when the reselling platform provides installment services, depending on the volume of the incremental demand. We further study the impact of tariff cost, product substitutability, amount limitation, correlation between price and incremental demand and uncertainty of exchange rate for installment to verify the robustness of the main findings.",1366-5545,Not found
A column generation-based approach for integrated vehicle and crew scheduling on a single metro line with the fully automatic operation system by partial supervision,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102406,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"With the rapid development of fully automated urban metro lines, unattended train operation has become a reality, leading to significant gains in efficiency in comparison with traditional operation. To make better use of this technology and reduce operational costs, this study proposes a novel approach for collaboratively optimizing both vehicle and crew scheduling on metro lines. This approach is based on the assumption that unattended train movement without passengers is permitted, while the in-service train requires supervision by the crew. By considering the characteristics of urban metro lines, a mathematical model that considers both the meal activity and employee deadheading for the integrated vehicle and crew scheduling problem is first formulated. The model consists of a master problem for minimizing the total cost and subproblems for generating duties. The subproblem is constructed using a connection-based network and modeled as a special resource-constrained shortest path problem. To solve the model efficiently, a two-phase pricing procedure, which combines a piece generation phase and a duty generation phase, is developed to price out duties with negative reduced costs. Finally, numerical experiments based on actual conditions are conducted. The results indicate that our proposed model provides a significantly tight linear relaxation with negligible, typically zero, optimality gaps. Moreover, in comparison with the traditional integrated formulation, our proposed model and algorithm achieve improved performance in terms of solution quality and computing time.",1366-5545,Not found
Zonal-based flexible bus service under elastic stochastic demand,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102367,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This study investigates flexible bus that provides door-to-door service with multiple passengers sharing the vehicle, which reduces congestion on the urban network. The service area is divided into zones, and flexible buses are assigned to zonal routes based on the historical demand characteristics before demand realization. Passengers are served by either regular service or ad hoc service after the demand realization to minimize the sum of ad hoc service cost and detour time cost. The elastic and stochastic natures of demand are captured in the formulation by the volume stochasticity of demand, detour time stochasticity, and elasticity of demand with respect to the flexible bus service price and quality. The profit of the flexible bus service is maximized while accounting for the detour time cost. To effectively solve the problem, volume and detour time reliability measures are introduced to separate the problem into a vehicle-to-route assignment problem and a passenger-to-vehicle assignment problem. A gradient-based solution approach is devised to determine the flexible bus routing plans by optimizing the associated reliability measures. The solution approach is further improved by combining the gradient-based approach with a greedy search solution approach and relaxing the formulations. The formulation and solution approaches are implemented using real data in Chengdu, China, with promising results.",1366-5545,Not found
Impact of entry restriction policies on international air transport connectivity during COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102411,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted the air transport network (ATN) globally. Policies to restrict international passenger arrivals adopted by many countries are effective responses to control the spread of the virus. This paper studies the impact of two entry restriction policies implemented by some countries against international travelers during COVID-19, i.e., direct flight suspension and complete entry suspension, on the international connectivity (IC) of ATNs. Firstly, the concept of international air transport network (IATN) is defined, and a novel weighted IC index for ATNs is proposed considering flight frequency. Furthermore, to systematically analyze the difference between two policies, the hierarchical structure of the IATN is investigated, followed by studying the change of the IC index assuming different countries impose the two policies. Taking China as an example, this paper evaluates the influence of two policies based on real policy implementation of some countries against travelers from China. Besides, the critical countries affecting the IC are identified, and the network robustness is assessed. Implications for assessing and ranking the impact of different countries under different policies are provided and discussed. Lastly, two extensions are presented to discuss the impact of partial suspension and response actions such as air travel bubble. This work is one of the first to study the impact of country-to-country disconnection on air transport connectivity and deepens our understanding of the performance of ATNs during emergencies.",1366-5545,Not found
Two-stage robust railway line-planning approach with passenger demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102372,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"A railway line-planning problem is one of the fundamental problems in the strategic planning of railway operations. Operation zone, frequency, stop schedule, and passenger distribution for each train based on passenger demand are determined to minimize both the operation cost of the railway enterprise and the total travel cost to the passengers. However, passenger demand uncertainty makes balancing transport capacity and fluctuating demand challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage robust optimization model wherein the nominal line plan is determined in the first stage (i.e., the case in which passenger demand has no fluctuation) and the rescheduled line plan based on the nominal line plan is determined according to the demand realization in the second stage. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm and some strengthening techniques are designed. The model and algorithm are tested on real-world instances of the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway line under uncertain passenger demands. Computational results indicate that the proposed solution algorithm can yield a high-quality solution in 3600 s. In addition, the proposed two-stage robust solution can help minimize both operation and travel costs on average when compared with the nominal solution under uncertainty realization.",1366-5545,Not found
Designing corridor systems with modular autonomous vehicles enabling station-wise docking: Discrete modeling method,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102388,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Jointly designing vehicle dispatch headway and capacity is a relatively new solution to the demand–supply asymmetry in urban mass transportation studies. This paper studies a new problem of this kind where a transportation corridor operates with modular autonomous vehicles (MAV) enabling station-wise docking; i.e., vehicles can change their formations (or capacity) at any station along the corridor. We formulate the problem into a compact mixed integer linear programming model where the passenger boarding order is explicitly modeled. Due to the multiple station system structure and the station-wise docking operation, the solution space of the model increases rapidly with the instance size, making it very challenging to solve the model with existing commercial solvers. To improve the solution efficiency, we design a customized branch and bound (B&B) algorithm with theoretical properties of the investigated problem. These properties offer upper and lower bounds to the optimal vehicle formation, reveal the relationship between the passenger queue and vehicle dispatch headway, and identify a dominance rule between any two feasible solutions to the investigated problem. They greatly reduce the number of nodes in the B&B tree that would grow dramatically without these properties. Further, the lower and upper bounds to the objective value at each node of the B&B tree are computed analytically, allowing us to search through the solution space very quickly. Consequently, the computation speed of the B&B algorithm is greatly improved. With numerical experiments, we show that the customized B&B algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art commercial solver, Gurobi, and solves relatively large instances in real-world applications efficiently. The station-wise docking operation is shown to reduce system costs compared with existing fixed capacity operation. Further, its performance is affected by system parameters related to the vehicle operational cost and passenger waiting cost. Overall, this study contributes to the literature by extending the urban mass transportation design methodology from traditional fixed capacity design to the MAV-based station-wise docking design under various operational factors (e.g., minimum dispatch headway). The algorithm proposed can be used as a benchmark to verify the solution accuracy and computation performance for research efforts that aim to develop other solution algorithms for the investigated problem.",1366-5545,Not found
Urban freight logistics: What do citizens perceive?,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102390,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Urban freight logistics involve the movement and operations generated by freight activity in urban areas. As such, freight logistics impact multiple stakeholders. However, these stakeholders are mostly not taken into consideration when planners and decision makers look into potential solutions to the issues generated by freight operations. In this paper, results are shown from a survey conducted and analyzed unveiling citizens’ perceptions with respect to the urban freight system in a mid-size urban area. Four hypotheses are proposed and tested using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. Results show that, unlike what is generally believed, citizens are aware of the freight system and its impact on their daily activities. Moreover, citizens who perceive the infrastructure to be in poor condition also have a greater awareness of the negative externalities generated by freight operations. In addition, having a higher perception of freight’s negative externalities decreases citizens’ perception of the overall performance of freight logistics in the city. Furthermore, the results unveiled heterogeneity in citizens’ perceptions based on their socio-economic characteristics and based on their location. The results shed light on the perceptions citizens have towards urban freight logistics, and confirms the importance that decision makers should place on engaging the public early in the planning process. By raising awareness among planners in a proactive manner, these findings could be used to enhance the level of community engagement in freight planning, and by extension the level of citizen support for programs and initiatives aimed at addressing urban freight issues.",1366-5545,Not found

Specifically, we present a new variant of the bi-objective capacitated location routing problem (bi-objective CLRP), flow capturing location problem with fuel delivery (FCLP-FD), to simultaneously determine the location of hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) and routing decisions for hydrogen delivery trucks. The FCLP-FD is proposed to overcome barriers to the deployment of HFSs. The HFS network is determined while maximizing the fueling demand flow captured and minimizing the total daily cost. The metaheuristic algorithm of adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) was developed, and its performance on solving bi-objective optimization problems was tested and compared with the genetic algorithm (GA). The developed model and algorithms were applied to a case study in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, France. Results show that the model improved the understanding of decision-makers about various components within the HFS network and provides useful managerial insights regarding the role of fleet composition and physical forms of hydrogen. In terms of algorithm performance, the GA was faster than ALNS for all the tested instances; however, ALNS is characterized by a better average gap, which is the differences between the obtained Pareto front (generated by ALNS) and the optimal one (generated using IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio).",1366-5545,Not found
Risk of delay evaluation in real-time train scheduling with uncertain dwell times,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102366,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"While trains travel in a railway network, disturbances may arise and corrective decisions to minimize delay propagation may be necessary to solve conflicting track requests. This problem is known in the literature as the real-time Railway Traffic Management Problem (rtRTMP) and its solutions represent plans of operations that minimize delay propagation due to unexpected disturbances. However, uncertainty may still affect such plans and their expected quality in terms of level of service or risk containment. This article proposes a new approach for the assessment of the risk of onset or worsening of delays associated to an rtRTMP solution when dwell times are uncertain and only an interval representation of them is known to the scheduler. To this aim, the Conditional-Value-at-Risk of the maximum train delay is adopted as risk index. In this study we address both modeling and computational issues, developing and testing a graph-based model to use with an innovative numerical method to obtain a real-time risk evaluation for rtRTMP solutions. The proposed approach is applied on a real case study analyzing the effects of uncertainties of different severity. Promising computational results enable to use the methodology to deal with the rtRTMP taking into account the uncertainty on the involved activities and the risk attitude of the decision-makers at the operational level.",1366-5545,Not found

Manufacturer encroachment with equal pricing strategy,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102346,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This study investigates the interplay between manufacturer encroachment and the manufacturer’s equal pricig strategy. Encroachment happens when a manufacturer opens up a direct channel to compete with a retailer’s traditional channel. The equal pricing strategy is that the manufacturer commits to setting a direct channel retail price that equals the price determined by the retailer in the traditional channel. We first consider the setting where one exclusive retailer sells products from a manufacturer that does not have the option of selling only through its direct channel. Our results show that the availability of the equal pricing commitment enhances the manufacturer’s incentive to encroach when the channel competition is intense and the encroachment cost is medium. Interestingly, the manufacturer’s equal pricing commitment always hurts the retailer even though it eliminates the price competition between the two channels. This is because the availability of the equal pricing commitment could motivate the manufacturer’s encroachment. Our analysis shows that the manufacturer’s equal pricing commitment always improves consumer surplus and sometimes improves the supply chain performance. However, when the retailer also sells a substitutable product from a different manufacturer or the manufacturer has the option of only direct selling, the equal pricing commitment sometimes benefits the retailer and sometimes reduces the consumer surplus.",1366-5545,Not found
Leaving the tub: The nature and dynamics of hypercongestion in a bathtub model with a restricted downstream exit,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102389,152,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Hypercongestion is the situation where a certain traffic flow occurs at a combination of low speed and high density, while a more favorable combination of these could produce the same flow. The macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) can describe hypercongestion, but does not explicitly explain the dynamic process that leads to hypercongestion. Earlier studies of hypercongestion on single links have, however, confirmed that these processes are important to consider. The bathtub model is a model that can be used to investigate how hypercongestion can arise in urban areas, when drivers choose their departure times optimally. This paper investigates equilibrium outcomes and user costs under the realistic assumption that there is finite capacity to exit the bathtub, without which it would be hard to explain why hypercongestion would not dissolve through shockwaves originating from the bathtub exit. We find that when the exit capacity of the bathtub is lower than the attempted equilibrium exit flow from the bathtub, no additional inefficiencies arise due to hypercongestion in the bathtub. This is because the travel time losses incurred by travelers in the bathtub are exactly offset by the reductions in travel time losses in exit queues, and thus the capacity of the full system is not affected. In contrast, when the exit capacity is higher than the equilibrium exit flows from the bathtub in the central part of the peak period, hypercongestion in the bathtub produces the additional inefficiencies known from the conventional textbook description. Our results thus show that the mere observation of hypercongested speeds does not necessarily mean that there is an efficiency loss from capacity drop at the level of the full system.",1366-5545,Not found

We first formulate this problem into a trip-based set partitioning model, which has two sets of mutual exclusion constraints. To solve the model, we propose a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm (BPC), in which the linear relaxation of the model is solved by column generation, and moreover, the relaxation gap is tightened by incorporating rounded capacity inequalities. Particularly, the mutual exclusion constraints induce a new and challening pricing problem, and we design a novel label-setting algorithm with tailored label structure to solve it.

It damages the marine ecosystem, threatens human health, and also causes incalculable economic losses.Due to the impacts of ocean currents and winds, marine debris has been transported to different locations over time and time window cannot be ignored to navigate the locations of marine debris. To effectively mitigate the risk, we propose the vessel routing optimization with a time window to collect and remove marine debris. Ocean currents and winds also affect the velocity and direction of the collecting vessel. We first employ GNOME software to determine the debris trajectory and set a time window for each debris location. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model considering vessel velocity is proposed to minimize the total debris collection cost.

Moreover, the average computing time of the ALNS algorithm is roughly 24 and 17 times faster than that of the GUROBI and the B&C algorithm, respectively.

When the platform retailer is a reseller it offers a money-back guarantee (MBG) returns policy; when it is a marketplace, it requires that the supplier offer the MBG on sales through the marketplace. We identify the conditions under which the supplier should also offer an MBG in the direct channel. We identify the platform retailer’s optimal selling strategy (as marketplace or reseller) and the associated conditions.

We develop Stackelberg games under two PF schemes: fulfillment by platform (FBP) and by e-commerce retailer (FBR). We find that overconfidence influences participants’ decisions and performance. Slight overconfidence weakens the platform’s bargaining power since the e-tailer will make conservative order decision and the platform will cut the interest rate. Severe overconfidence may be exploited by the platform since the e-tailer performs insensitive to the interest rate.

Information acquisition with advertising threshold effect under manufacturer encroachment in a supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102439,153,2021-09-01,2021,9,"In this paper, we examine the interaction between a retailer’s information acquisition and a manufacturer’s advertising strategies by incorporating the advertising threshold effect under manufacturer encroachment. We elaborate on two acquisition timings, namely, ex ante acquisition and ex post acquisition, depending on whether the retailer makes the information acquisition decision before or after the manufacturer’s advertising decision. We demonstrate that under ex ante acquisition, the retailer’s acquisition incentive and the manufacturer’s optimal advertising level exhibit a non-monotonic relationship with the advertising threshold. Under ex post acquisition, given that the threshold is not too high, the retailer’s acquisition incentive weakly increases with the advertising threshold, and the optimal advertising level is always pushed up by the advertising threshold effect and the acquisition inducing effect. More importantly, the advertising threshold effect does not necessarily hurt (benefit) the manufacturer (retailer), as the information acquisition effect can conditionally alleviate the detrimental effect of the advertising threshold. Moreover, the retailer may prefer either ex ante acquisition or ex post acquisition, depending on the advertising level comparison. By contrast, the manufacturer prefers ex post acquisition only when the acquisition incentive under ex post acquisition is higher than that under ex ante acquisition; otherwise, the manufacturer always weakly prefers ex ante acquisition.",1366-5545,Not found
A new day-to-day dynamic network vulnerability analysis approach with Weibit-based route adjustment process,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102421,153,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The disruption of critical components in a transportation network can bring about severe network performance degradation and requires a relatively long period to recover, which would lead to commuters’ day-to-day route choice adjustment. Under disruptions, there would be greater travel time variability (objective uncertainty) and travelers’ perception error uncertainty (subjective uncertainty) in the transportation network. However, no vulnerability analysis method in the literature can consider the day-to-day network performance fluctuation under uncertainties. In this paper, we develop a new day-to-day dynamic network vulnerability analysis approach that allows the consideration of day-to-day network performance fluctuation based on a new day-to-day dynamic model considering both objective travel time uncertainty and subjective perception error uncertainty. Compared to most existing day-to-day models that either adopt User Equilibrium (UE) or Logit-based route choice criterion, the new day-to-day model has two advantages: (1) the Weibit model is used to capture travelers’ subjective perception error uncertainty, which does not have the perfect information assumption in the UE model, or the identically distributed perception error assumption in the Logit model; and (2) the mean-excess travel time (METT) concept is used to capture the objective travel time uncertainty, which handles the inconsideration of travel time variability in most day-to-day models while remaining computational tractability. Based on the proposed day-to-day dynamic model, we develop a new component importance metric for network vulnerability analysis. This new metric characterizes the post-disruption day-dependent consequences to alleviate the limitation of only assessing the final static equilibrium consequence as in the existing studies of vulnerability analysis. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the features of the proposed day-to-day dynamic model and the new component importance metric, as well as their applicability in identifying the critical bridges in the Winnipeg network. The proposed approach provides a new decision support tool for planners and managers in assessing the consequences of disruptions, identifying the critical components, and determining the recovery schedules after disruptions.",1366-5545,Not found
An improved learning-and-optimization train fare design method for addressing commuting congestion at CBD stations,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102427,153,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This study proposes an improved learning-and-optimization train fare design method to deal with the commuting congestion of train stations at the central business district (CBD). The conventional learning-and-optimization scheme needs accurate boarding/alighting demand to update the train fare in each trial. However, when congestion happens, the observed boarding/alighting demand will be larger than the actual boarding/alighting demand due to the delays and the longer dwelling time. Thus, the actual boarding/alighting demand is not available in practice. The improved algorithm deals with this issue by using inexact and less information to determine the new trial fare during the iteration. Namely, the improved method bypasses the conditions that may lead to biased results so as to significantly enhance the reliability of the learning-and-optimization method. The simplified algorithm also makes this method more practical. The convergence property of the proposed algorithm is rigorously proved and the convergence rate is demonstrated to be exponential. Numerical studies are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the improved learning-and-optimization method.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimizing driver menus under stochastic selection behavior for ridesharing and crowdsourced delivery,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102419,153,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Peer-to-peer logistics platforms coordinate independent drivers to fulfill requests for last mile delivery and ridesharing. To balance demand-side performance with driver autonomy, a new stochastic methodology provides drivers with a small but personalized menu of requests to choose from. This creates a Stackelberg game, in which the platform leads by deciding what menu of requests to send to drivers, and the drivers follow by selecting which request(s) they are willing to fulfill from their received menus. Determining optimal menus, menu size, and request overlaps in menus is complex as the platform has limited knowledge of drivers’ request preferences. Exploiting the problem structure when drivers signal willingness to participate, we reformulate our problem as an equivalent single-level Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and apply the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. Computational tests recommend a training sample size for inputted SAA scenarios and a test sample size for completing performance analysis. Our stochastic optimization approach performs better than current approaches, as well as deterministic optimization alternatives. A simplified formulation ignoring ‘unhappy drivers’ who accept requests but are not matched is shown to produce similar objective values with a fraction of the runtime. A ridesharing case study of the Chicago Regional transportation network provides insights for a platform wanting to provide driver autonomy via menu creation. The proposed methods achieved high demand performance as long as the drivers are well compensated (e.g., even when drivers are allowed to reject requests, on average over 90% of requests are fulfilled when 80% of the fare goes to drivers; this drops to below 60% when only 40% of the fare goes to drivers). Thus, neither the platform nor the drivers benefit from low driver compensation due to its resulting low driver participation and thus low request fulfillment. Finally, for the cases tested, a maximum menu size of 5 is recommended as it produces good quality platform solutions without requiring much driver selection time.",1366-5545,Not found
A framework to managing disruption risk in rail-truck intermodal transportation networks,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102340,153,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Rail-truck intermodal transportation plays a vital role in freight transportation in North America, and hence a crucial issue is to ensure continuity and minimize the adverse impacts from disruption. We propose a framework based on optimization and regression analysis for recovery from random disruptions of rail intermodal terminals. Two mixed-integer programming models are developed to simulate the normal and post-disruption operations, and the outputs are used in a predictive analytics model to identify the determinants of terminal criticality. The proposed framework is applied to a case study built using the realistic infrastructure of a rail-truck intermodal network in the United States. The resulting analyses underscore the importance of implementing the mitigation strategy at a marginal increase in pre-disruption cost, which in turn not only improves network resiliency but also results in significant cost savings by not using the more expensive recovery strategies. We further show that intermodal train service design resulting in a more balanced distribution of freight in the network could also help reduce terminal criticality, and that it makes sense to have backup rental capacities for some terminals.",1366-5545,Not found
Cooperate or not? Strategic analysis of platform interactions considering market power and precision marketing,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102479,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"In order to increase market share and enhance business competitiveness, comprehensive retail platforms (CRPs), such as Taobao.com and JD.com, are currently cooperating with social service platforms (SSPs), such as TikTok and Meiyou. Therefore, more research attention needs to be paid to such platform supply chains. To this end, this study develops stylized models to explore the impacts of the market power of an SSP and the precision marketing of a CRP on platform cooperation. Our major research findings include the following. First, we investigate the equilibrium strategy and find that if the CRP’s commission rate is low (high), cooperation becomes the equilibrium strategy when the SSP’s market power is low (high). Second, in most cases, market power will affect the equilibrium strategy with a change in the commission rate. However, in a certain range of commission rates, the equilibrium strategy remains unchanged. That is, market power has an “invalidation effect” on the equilibrium strategy. Finally, we find that as the commission rate increases, precision marketing reduces the willingness of supply chain members to implement platform cooperation. However, when the commission rate is low, precision marketing stimulates cooperation between platforms. The study results provide guidelines for improving the cooperation between CRPs and SSPs.",1366-5545,Not found
Simpler and better: Supply chain contracting in the presence of contract unobservability and upstream competition,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102478,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"A retail platform or intermediary can purchase products from multiple upstream manufacturers through different types of contracts. Traditional studies assume that the contracts and their terms are common knowledge; that is, each party of the supply chain can observe the contracts reached. In practice, however, this is not necessarily the case. Taking the result under contract observability as a benchmark, this paper investigates the contracting of the supply chain comprised of one retail platform and two upstream manufacturers when contracts are unobservable. Two representative contracts are considered: the traditional and succinct wholesale price contract and the nonlinear, more complicated, two-part tariff contract. We apply the framework of perfect Bayesian equilibrium and also use passive beliefs as an equilibrium refinement criterion to analyze the model. Our study shows that the classical result – that the more complicated contract can increase channel profitability – may no longer be valid when contracts are unobservable to competing manufacturers. On the contrary, the manufacturers and the whole supply chain can benefit from adopting wholesale price contracts rather than two-part tariff contracts. To examine the robustness of our findings, we consider a commission fee contract and another classic demand function in an extended analysis, and the results show that the main findings and key insights remain valid. The intuition behind these findings is that the unobservability of contracts affects the opportunistic behavior of competing manufacturers. The practical value of these findings is mainly reflected in the evidence that supply chain members must carefully consider the impact of contract (un)observability when agreeing on contracts.",1366-5545,Not found
Pareto-efficient solutions and regulations of congested ride-sourcing markets with heterogeneous demand and supply,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102483,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Ride-sourcing services have experienced dramatic growth over the past decade but aroused debates on whether and how the government should regulate the ride-sourcing platform. To tackle this critical issue, this paper investigates the regulatory outcomes of various representative government regulations, including price-cap regulation, vehicle fleet size control, wage (per-order) regulation, income (hourly earnings) regulation, car utilization rate regulation, commission charge regulation, etc. In particular, we try to answer two key questions: (1) whether a regulation leads to a Pareto-efficient outcome; (2) what are the impacts of the regulations on the platform’s decisions and the resulting realized passenger demand and driver supply. By conducting theoretical and numerical studies, we offer some interesting and useful managerial insights for the government in designing appropriate regulations. Notably, some prevailing regulations, such as fleet size control and wage regulation, fail to achieve a Pareto-efficient outcome, while the maximum commission regulation and minimum service level (demand) regulation can achieve Pareto-efficient outcomes in markets with homogeneous drivers and mild traffic congestion. In addition, drivers’ heterogeneity and traffic congestion substantially affect the regulatory outcomes of various regulations. For example, in markets with homogeneous drivers, the income regulation does not take effect, while in markets with heterogeneous drivers, the income regulation does influence the platform’s decisions but still cannot achieve a Pareto-efficient outcome. We also show that the government acts quite differently under mild or heavy traffic congestion: it tends to encourage more drivers to participate in the market by a minimum fleet size regulation when traffic congestion is light, but restrain the vehicle fleet size by a maximum fleet size regulation when traffic congestion is severe.",1366-5545,Not found
Hybrid artificial immune algorithm for optimizing a Van-Robot E-grocery delivery system,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102466,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Same-day delivery and on-demand delivery with driverless delivery robots (DDRs) are becoming new attractive options for more customers looking for grocery or medication delivery, as these delivery methods can customize time demand and meet consumers’ safety expectations. However, meeting these requirements for instant shipping necessarily increases the need for more vans and DDRs for last-mile delivery, thus increasing the economic and ecological costs. To optimize the economic costs and environmental effects of the delivery network, and also to meet customer satisfaction simultaneously, an effective model considering the new constraints of the van-DDR system and an efficient algorithm are needed to obtain the solutions. Therefore, the goals of this study are to establish a model and develop an algorithm for a multi-objective multi-depot two-tier location routing problem with parcel transshipment (MOMD-2T-LRP-PT), where vans and DDRs serve the two tiers, respectively. In this study, we split the MOMD-2T-LRP-PT model into two subproblems: the location-allocation problem and the vehicle routing problem. The two problems are solved sequentially and iteratively with a “k-prototype cluster” and a hybrid artificial immune algorithm (HAIA). We firstly illustrate the effectiveness of the MOMD-2T-LRP-PT model with the ∊-constraint method on a small-scale data set. Then the proposed HAIA algorithm is compared with a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) using different data sets including a real case test. Both the analytic results and the real case application show that the ∊-constraint method can produce the best solution with up to six customers, and the HAIA algorithm produces better-optimized results than NSGA-II in real-life applications. These results imply that the MOMD-2T-LRP-PT model and the proposed HAIA algorithm are promising and effective in optimizing practical E-grocery delivery that can achieve optimization and balance among economic costs, environmental effects, and customer satisfaction.",1366-5545,Not found
Planning for time-varying volunteer firefighter systems under probabilistic service disruptions,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102459,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Volunteer firefighters have been incorporated alongside career firefighters to supplement the overall performance and flexibility of fire emergency response systems in many countries. However, volunteer firefighters are more likely to suffer from sub-optimal health conditions during missions than are full-time career firefighters. Thus, they are less reliable in providing consistent emergency response services over time. This paper addresses the time-varying planning problem for volunteer firefighter shifts while considering firefighter service disruptions. We first present a single-period hypercube queuing model for the volunteer service problem under probabilistic disruptions. Then, we propose a two-level volunteer planning model for the multi-period problem by including payments’ budgetary constraints and volunteer health consumption’s effect on service reliability. We validate the hypercube-based optimization model by using the Arena software under various disruption scenarios. Finally, we apply the proposed model to the fire service system in Tangxian, Hebei, China.

Government penalty provision and contracting with asymmetric quality information in a bioenergy supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102481,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Bioenergy, which is viewed as a renewable and clean energy, has been receiving great attention in recent years. To protect the environment and raise the share of bioenergy, the government usually offers penalties to the power plant if the ratio of bioenergy in electricity is below a certain target level. This paper studies the government’s penalty provision in a bioenergy supply chain consisting of a power plant and farmers who privately know their quality information of the bioenergy. We consider two scenarios, i.e., symmetric information and asymmetric information, under which the power plant can offer a single wholesale price contract or a menu of quantity-payment contracts. We conduct some game-theoretical analysis and obtain the optimal decision of the government and the optimal contracts for the power plant under different scenarios. Some non-trivial results are obtained. When the target level is low, the social welfare is higher with symmetric information than that with asymmetric information. However, when the target level is high, the social welfare is hurt by the improvement of information transparency. Moreover, the government will set a higher target level under the wholesale price contract than that under the menu of quantity-bundle contracts. The profit for the power plant is higher with the menu of quantity-bundle contracts than that with the wholesale price contract. We also find that when the target level is either low or high, the farmers should make the bioenergy quality information transparent to maximize their own expected payoffs. However, when the target level is medium, the farmers should withhold the relevant information.",1366-5545,Not found
Short-term berth planning and ship scheduling for a busy seaport with channel restrictions,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102467,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper addresses the short-term berth planning and ship scheduling issues for a busy seaport with channel restrictions, in which the channel width of the port can accommodate one large-sized ship only or two small-sized ships in its two-way navigation (inbound and outbound). A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is presented, in which the inbound/outbound movements of ships between multiple anchorages and multiple basins, and the shifting movements of ships between or within the harbor basins are explicitly taken into account. In view that the MILP model is usually computationally low-efficient for practical large-sized problems, we reformulate the MILP into an equivalent set-partitioning model and develop a column generation (CG) algorithm to solve this model. Several efficient methods are also proposed to improve the performance of the CG algorithm. The computational experiments for a real Chinese port show that the proposed CG algorithm significantly outperforms some existing methods (e.g., branch-and-cut and truncated column generation) and the port scheduling schemes adopted in reality. It can solve the instances with up to 35 inbound ships, 35 outbound ships, 6 shifting ships, and 43 berths within ten minutes, with an average optimality gap of 0.32%.

Berth and quay crane allocation and scheduling with worker performance variability and yard truck deployment in container terminals,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102449,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"In a container terminal, the quay cranes (QCs) are the main equipment involved in the core activities. According to a bottleneck principle, the productivity rate of QCs is related to both worker productivity and deployed yard trucks.

In contrast, practitioners confirm their important impact on cranes productivity and efficiency. This paper proposes a new extension of the berth and quay cranes allocation and scheduling problems considering worker performance variability and yard truck deployment constraints. First, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program to minimize the vessels departure time under many practical regulations involving the work roster constraints specific to container terminals and the trucks utilization congestion targets. Additionally, the study provides a computationally efficient method to find a lower bound. We also show that integrative planning minimizes the vessels departure time compared to the separated decision-making process. Second, to build good solutions in a reasonable time, we propose a heuristic and a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) with a new architecture and settings designed to suit the novel issues of the tackled problem. The algorithm is tested on real time data sets and outperforms a commercial solver. This study originates from our experience with a multinational company managing a container terminal.

Operational benefits of autonomous vessels in logistics—A case of autonomous water-taxis in Bergen,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102456,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Although the technology of autonomous vessels has developed rapidly in the past decade, the literature on the effects of this new technology on logistics and transportation is limited. Particularly, the potential operational changes brought by the autonomy of vessels are not discussed. Besides savings on crew, other benefits of autonomy, especially from an operational perspective, remain unclear. On the other hand, countries like Norway are facing significant challenges in their urban and rural logistics. The land-based public transportation system cannot efficiently serve the demands, especially for areas isolated or separated by fjords or rivers. Water-based transportation systems are thus very attractive, and autonomy makes such systems economically more viable. In this paper we focus on a potential case of autonomous water-taxis in Bergen, Norway.

Then a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to tackle the facility location, fleet allocation and routing decisions in the daily operations of a water-taxi business. The model in this paper is used to analyse the problem, rather than designed for direct use during implementation. In the computational study, different cases with either conventional or autonomous water-taxis are tested.

However, less attention has been paid to developing analytical models to resolve challenges observed in organic supply chains. This study analytically explores competition- and coordination-based scenarios driving conventional and organic markets under contract farming mechanisms. Motivated by real-world practices, we investigate a three-party agricultural supply chain consisting of an agribusiness enterprise, an organic farmer, and a conventional farmer, where the farmers’ products are imperfect substitutes. First, we develop analytical models to derive closed-form optimal solutions under the traditional contract farming, where the agribusiness enterprise as the Stackelberg leader offers the guaranteed wholesale price and the farmers, as the followers, set their production quantity. We examine the problem by incorporating the specific features of organic farming, including organic price premium, crop yield gap, and organic cost factor into the model. We also conduct sensitivity analyses to explore the effects of competition and main characteristics of organic farming on the farmers’ and agribusiness enterprise’s optimal strategies. Meanwhile, we analytically compare and contrast the optimal traditional contract farming strategies with those under the centralized setting as a benchmark. Finally, we propose a coordinated version of contract farming named synergistic trilateral contract farming to convince the members to move towards centralization. The proposed contract not only benefits all the members by resolving both horizontal and vertical channel conflicts but also motivates the consumption of organic produce in the market. The societal measures in the investigated framework, including consumer surplus and social welfare, also improve when the supply chain members move towards coordination.

Flexibility in strategic flight planning,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102450,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"A deterministic model that indicates flexibility of flights at the strategic level (up to 6 months ahead) taking into account changing airspace configurations and capacity is formulated. Flexibility is quantified by means of time windows (TWs). Flights complying with TWs guarantee that they will not impact negatively any other flight. Three variants of the model and three types of TWs are tested on a large-size data instance (the European network for an entire day of traffic). The model output specifies the constrained flights (i.e., with TWs shorter than the maximum size allowed for their definition), the constraining sector-hours and provides a list of saturated sector-hours. The meaning of each of the results is explored, across the three TW model variants, as well as the capability of the model variants to assure that capacity limits will not be exceeded. The criticality index, a measure of the sector-hour saturation, is introduced. This index can be used to identify areas for potential improvements. Sharing the information obtained from the TW model results at a strategic level can help both airlines and air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to improve the network status: airlines can decide to re-route heavily constrained flights (e.g., with one minute wide TWs), whereas ANSPs could decide to re-organise the capacity provision of the saturated airspace portions. The TW model can be re-run with the proposed changes, with the goal to assess the impact on both the individual stakeholders and the network. Thus, the model offers the measure of flight flexibility, and can be used as a tool to assess the impact of changes, helping in decision-making processes of airlines and ANSPs.",1366-5545,Not found

These changes have induced local B&M retailers to start online retailing with home delivery as an added option. B&M retailers can choose to offer online retailing on their own (referred to as self-building mode) or via a third-party online-to-offline (O2O) platform (referred to as platform mode). This paper investigates how the interplay between capacity, pricing, and online retailing mode is affected by the absence/presence of the pandemic. We characterize the equilibrium between the B&M retailer and the O2O platform provider. We find that the impact of the “stay-at-home orders” on B&M retailers differs by the online retailing mode. Interestingly, we find that the “stay-at-home orders” does not necessarily lower the B&M retailer’s profit if they engage in online retailing. Under self-building mode, the stay-at-home order leaves the B&M retailer with just the online channel. We identify the threshold delivery cost above (below) which the B&M retailer’s profit is lower (higher) than before. Under the platform mode, the “stay-at-home order” alters the retailer’s sales channel from dual channel to single channel, which mitigates the competition between the retailer and the O2O platform. The retailer’s profit increases if it has sufficiently high capacity. Finally, we extend the model to examine the effect of a “reopening policy” with a government subsidy. We find that although the subsidy improves the B&M retailer’s profitability, it may hurt the consumer surplus under some conditions. We suggest that governments take the B&M retailer’s capacity and operations mode into account when designing subsidy policies.",1366-5545,Not found
Vulnerability of the worldwide air transportation network to global catastrophes such as COVID-19,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102469,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper studies the vulnerability of the worldwide air transportation network (WATN) during a global catastrophe such as COVID-19. Considering the WATN as a weighted network, many airport connections could be completely or partially disrupted during such extreme events. However, it is found that existing weighted metrics cannot reflect the impact of connection capacity reduction on network connectivity. Therein, this work proposes a novel network efficiency metric termed as layered weighted network efficiency (LWNE) metric to measure the connectivity of the air transportation networks (ATNs) and study their vulnerability in response to different levels of disruptions, including airport level, country level, and global level. The most critical airport connections and their impact on network connectivity are identified. It is found that the critical connections are mostly between so-called bridge airports but not core airports in the WATN. By examining the impact of partial link disruptions, it is found that some connections mainly serve local travel demand and are very robust to partial disruptions, while the others connecting global hubs are sensitive to partial disruptions. Further, the WATN is robust to the individual disconnection of most countries; however, it is vulnerable to the simultaneous disconnection of countries that serve international transfers. Interestingly, the WATN is insensitive to the disconnection between any two countries, even those with sizeable domestic ATNs. Concerning global disconnections, as long as all the international connections hold 10% of their original flights, the WATN can still expect 40% of its pre-disruption performance. This paper deepens the understanding of ATNs under extreme events and provides a method for studying transportation networks’ vulnerability facing global disruptions.",1366-5545,Not found
Core stable coalition selection in collaborative truckload transportation procurement,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102447,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"We study the problem of forming a core stable coalition that minimizes system-wide cost, given a set of candidate full truckload shipment lanes, which we model as players, and a characteristic function that corresponds to solving an NP-Hard cost minimizing lane covering problem. Since not every coalition has a non-empty core in this setting, we formulate a mixed integer linear program that can identify a core stable coalition with minimal system-wide cost along with a cost allocation in the core. We propose a solution method that embeds row generation, column generation, and an upper bounding heuristic into branch-and-bound, which can be considered as a form of branch-and-cut-and-price. We evaluate the performance of our solution method through extensive numerical experiments on randomly generated problem instances.",1366-5545,Not found
Gaining customer satisfaction through sustainable supplier development: The role of firm reputation and marketing communication,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102453,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Recent cases demonstrate that negative effects of sustainability-related scandals experienced by upstream suppliers can spill over to downstream firms. Thus, initiatives to help suppliers improve their sustainability performance are becoming increasingly essential for firms’ risk management in relation to supply chains. Thus far, the literature has yet to provide significant evidence on how firms can generate value from sustainable supplier development initiatives. In this study, we conduct dynamic panel data analysis of a dataset of 768 firm–year observations collected from four secondary sources, and find that sustainable supplier development initiatives can contribute to firms’ customer satisfaction, which further contributes to improved sales performance. Moreover, the relationship between sustainable supplier development initiatives and customer satisfaction is negatively moderated by firm reputation, yet positively moderated by the firm’s advertising intensity. These results provide robust evidence that customer satisfaction is a valid mechanism that links sustainable supplier development initiatives with improved sales performance.",1366-5545,Not found
Stochasticity and environmental cost inclusion for electric vehicles fast-charging facility deployment,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102460,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This study aims to seek the optimal deployment of fast-charging stations concerning the traffic flow equilibrium and various realistic considerations to promote Electric Vehicles (EVs) widespread adoption. A bi-level optimization framework has been developed in which the upper level aims to minimize the total system cost (i.e., capital cost, travel cost, and environmental cost). Meanwhile, the lower level captures travellers’ routing behaviours with stochastic demands and driving range limitation. A meta-heuristic approach has been proposed, combining the Cross-Entropy Method and the Method of Successive Average to solve the problem. Finally, numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the proposed framework’s performance and provide insights into the impact of uncertain driving range and charging congestion on the planning decision and the system performance. Generally, both on-route congestion and charging congestion tend to be more serious when there are more EVs in the network; however, the system performance can be improved by increasing EVs’ driving range limitation and providing appropriate charging infrastructure.",1366-5545,Not found
A multi-period multi-modal stochastic supply chain model under COVID pandemic: A poultry industry case study in Mississippi,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102463,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The poultry industry is one of the most important agricultural sectors, which constitutes a significant part of the per capita consumption of protein and meat. Integrating operations of poultry industry sections including production, distribution and consumption becomes vital. Although the proper poultry supply chain has been established and made plenty of benefits for a long time, the global outbreak of COVID-19 shows that operations under pandemic are still challenge for the poultry industry. In this paper, the impacts of pandemic on poultry industry is investigated by developing a multi-period multi-modal stochastic poultry supply chain. Two models are developed aiming to mitigate the negative effects of pandemic occurrence through product stocking policy. In the first model, distribution system is in accordance with a multi-component structure, while the second model allows direct connections between suppliers (farmers) and demanders (customers). In both models, poultry productions are negatively affected by COVID 19. Due to the complexity of the model, a hybrid solution approach based on Branch and Cut and Dynamic Programming is developed. To validate the performance of the proposed model and solution procedure, a case study on the broiler industry in the state of Mississippi is performed. The results show that storing poultry products in the pre-pandemic along with direct logistics during pandemic period can save the broiler supply chain cost up to 30%.",1366-5545,Not found
Cargo port choice equilibrium: A multi-perspective look at shippers’ port choice,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102454,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Traditionally, cargo port choice has been investigated from the perspective of port users. More recently, studies on cargo port choice from the perspective of the port service providers have appeared. Irrespective of the perspective taken, the common element in these studies is that they focus on one perspective at a time. In this paper, it is postulated that cargo port choice should really be examined from both perspectives, simultaneously, as cargo port choice is made by both users and providers of cargo port services. The port users we will focus on in this paper are the shippers. To model this simultaneous choice, a new modeling framework is proposed, i.e. cargo port choice equilibrium. This new framework enables policy makers and other maritime industry stakeholders to evaluate the network-wide impact (i.e. across all cargo ports) of a range of policy measures while considering the choices by both shippers and port service providers. One key consequence of our equilibrium model is that prior findings in the port choice literature might no longer be valid without further qualifications. Overall, this paper generalizes, unifies and extends a segment of the port choice literature.",1366-5545,Not found
Enhancing network resilience by adding redundancy to road networks,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102448,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"In this paper, we develop a new tool to enhance the resilience of transportation networks by optimizing route diversity redundancy from travelers’ perspective. The decision of where to add new links is made to generate as many origin–destination (O-D) pairs with alternative distinct routes as possible to potentially alleviate the impact of disruptions. Mathematically, we formulate the problem as a binary integer bi-level program (BLP), where the upper-level subprogram maximizes the total number of O-D pairs with alternative distinct routes subject to a budgetary constraint, and the lower-level subprogram counts the maximum number of distinct routes between each O-D pair under a given design scheme. Computationally, the BLP model can be equivalently reformulated as a single-level mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by using the equivalent continuous relaxation and optimality conditions of the lower-level subprogram and linearization techniques for the complementarity conditions. The globally optimum solution of the MILP structure of the reformulated model can be obtained using existing algorithms in commercial software packages. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity, features, and flexibility of the proposed route diversity-oriented network design model in terms of optimizing the network redundancy. The proposed route diversity redundant network design contributes toward enhancing network resilience against disruptions in the pre-disaster stage of transportation network planning and assists in redundancy-oriented time-dependent network growth. It can also serve as an upper-bound solution for the long-term network design problem when travelers’ route choice behaviors and travel demands are considered in the design process.",1366-5545,Not found
Medical supplies scheduling in major public health emergencies,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102464,154,2021-10-01,2021,10,"In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, there was an unreasonable allocation between hospitals and a lack of timely transportation of medical supplies, which reduced the cure rate of infected cases. To solve the problem, this research proposes a method for scheduling medical supplies in major public health emergencies to develop a rapid and accurate supply scheme for medical materials, including the allocation of medical materials per vehicle to each hospital and the supply sequence per vehicle to each hospital. Specifically, this paper solves the following two sub-problems: (1) calculating the shortest transportation times and the corresponding routes from any distributing center(s) to any hospital(s); (2) calculating the medical supplies per vehicle transporting to each hospital. The method of solving sub-problem 1 is performed by multiple iterations, each of which calculates the shortest route from a distributing center, through one or more hospitals, and back to the distributing center. According to sub-problem 2, this research proposes a distribution model of medical supplies in major public health emergencies. A multiple dynamic programming algorithm which is a combination of some separated dynamic programming operations is proposed to solve this model. This algorithm also realizes the rapid updating of the scheme in the context of the changing number of vehicles. The first sub-problem can be solved in normal times, while the second one should be solved on the premise of obtaining the corresponding data after the occurrence of a major public health emergency. In the case study section, the whole method proposed in this research is employed in the medical supplies scheduling in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, which proves the availability of the method. The main innovation of the method proposed in this research is that the problems can obtain the optimal solution while the time complexity is within an acceptable range.",1366-5545,Not found
Retrieval-oriented storage relocation optimization of an automated storage and retrieval system,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102508,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Business-to-consumer platforms (e.g., Tmall.com and JD.com) demand the efficient retrieval handling of storage systems. The amount of a certain item to be retrieved is often less than a pallet load; thus, dynamically re-assigning the storage locations of nonempty pallets after each retrieval may improve retrieval operational efficiency. We call such a dynamic decision on the location for the returned pallets relocation. We treat the relocation of each non-empty pallet as an operational decision rather than a tactical decision. Due to its dynamic nature, we formulate relocation as a dynamic program that minimizes the total crane travel time. To overcome the computational curse of dimensionality, we propose several heuristic relocation policies that are inspired by conventional storage location assignment policies. Based on the findings from preliminary numerical experiments, we design an approximate dynamic programming-based relocation policy that achieves a greater operational efficiency improvement than the aforementioned heuristics. Through a more extensive set of numerical experiments, we find that random relocation is generally no better than no relocation, and that closest-open relocation is effective across different rack shapes, crane velocity configurations, and retrieval characteristics. Our experiments also show that the approximate dynamic programming-based relocation policy consistently yields further improvement over closest-open relocation, at the expense of higher (but still affordable) computational complexity.",1366-5545,Not found
Decision support for wildfire asset protection: A two-stage stochastic programming approach,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102520,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"During uncontrollable wildfires, decision-makers dispatch vehicles for tasks aimed at reducing the hazard to key assets. The decision-making process is complicated by the need for vehicle capabilities to match asset requirements within time windows determined by the progression of the fire. This is often further complicated by a wind change that is expected but with uncertainty in the timing. This paper aims to provide a decision support approach for determining plans for the deployment of resources under various scenarios. To this end, we solve the Asset Protection Problem (APP) in the context of Australia’s Black Saturday bushfires by developing a two-stage stochastic model. In this problem, we consider uncertainties in the timing of a change in wind velocity in defining various scenarios. We present a dynamic rerouting model and an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm to solve the model in a time efficient manner for decision-makers. A new set of instances were generated using realistic parameters. Thereafter, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches through extensive computational experiments. We solve both the two-stage stochastic program and the more limited dynamic rerouting model exactly for small instances. We observe that the restrictions of the dynamic rerouting model yields solutions within a few percent of the two-stage stochastic program. Moreover, the ALNS solution is a good approximation to its exact equivalent but with faster solution times. After further tests, it became apparent that with larger asset numbers the ALNS is the more practical method for operational purposes.",1366-5545,Not found

However, the literature lacks evidence on supplier capabilities as a responsible governance mechanism pathway for buyer firms to improve their circular economy practices. Drawing on the natural resource-based view, and the dynamic capabilities perspective, this study examines suppliers’ supply chain ambidexterity and big data predictive analytics capabilities as enabling factors in support of buyer firms’ responsible governance mechanism for circular economy practices improvements. Using data from surveys conducted among 404 firms (202 focal firm-supplier dyads), the results suggest that the focal firm’s supplier-selection mechanism significantly and positively influences its circular economy practices while the supplier-development mechanism has no such effect. We find further that the governance mechanisms vary in their effects on suppliers’ supply chain ambidexterity and subsequent big data analytics capabilities and circular economy practices improvements outcomes. In sum, our findings provide unique insights into the role of suppliers’ capabilities for responsible governance mechanisms to circular economy practices improvements from the perspective of the dyad.",1366-5545,Not found
Information strategy in a supply chain under asymmetric customer returns information,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102511,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"We develop a model for a supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer facing customer returns, in which information about the rate of customer returns is obtained and held asymmetrically. The retailer implements a full refund policy and accepts returns, collecting and retaining data on the rate of returns. The manufacturer is uninformed about the returns rate. The manufacturer has four strategies as to returns rate information: not acquiring the information, acquiring the information through a side payment contract, offering a buyback policy in order to participate in the returns process, or encroaching with a direct channel. We identify the manufacturer’s optimal information strategy and discuss the retailer’s preferences. We also identify win–win outcomes for the manufacturer and the retailer. We find that a buyback policy helps the manufacturer to obtain returns rate information for free when the salvage value is the same for the manufacturer and the retailer. When the manufacturer’s salvage value is relatively low, there always exists a region where the manufacturer does not try to acquire the information. The retailer may benefit from the cases in which the manufacturer does not acquire the information, adopts a side payment contract, or institutes a buyback policy, but the retailer is always worse off from the manufacturer’s channel encroachment strategy. Both the manufacturer and the retailer may have consistent preferences as to the manufacturer’s strategy.",1366-5545,Not found

High-speed rail pricing: Implications for social welfare,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102484,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This paper studies the competition between air transport and high-speed rail (HSR) when HSR adopts fixed pricing, and investigates the welfare effect of a reform to change HSR price from fixed to variable. We find that, first, due to the demand-side network effect, HSR traffic may increase with the fixed price. Furthermore, when the HSR operator is a social welfare maximizing monopoly, consistent with general industrial organization theory, social welfare will always increase if HSR moves from fixed price to variable price. However, when the HSR operator maximizes its profit or a weighted sum of profit and social welfare, or when the HSR operator and the airline compete, because of the interaction between the air and HSR services and the horizontal product differentiation of HSR services, social welfare may be greater under the fixed price if that fixed price is sufficiently low.",1366-5545,Not found
Resilient NdFeB magnet recycling under the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic: Stochastic programming and Benders decomposition,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102505,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets are the most powerful magnets per unit volume sold in the commercial market. Despite the increasing demand for clean energy applications such as electric vehicles and wind turbines, disruptive events including the COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant uncertainties in the supply and demand for NdFeB magnets. Therefore, this study aims to alleviate the risk of supply shortage for NdFeB magnets and the containing critical materials, rare-earth elements (REEs), through the development of a resilient reverse supply chain and logistics network design. We develop scenarios to model the unique impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the proposed business, incorporating both disruption intensity and recovery rate. We formulate a chance-constrained two-stage stochastic programming model to maximize the profit while guaranteeing the network resiliency against disruption risks. To solve the problem in large-scale instances, we develop an efficient Benders decomposition algorithm that reduces the computational time by 98.5% on average compared to the default CPLEX algorithm. When applied to the United States, the model suggests the optimal facility locations, processing capacities, inventory levels, and material flows for NdFeB magnet recyclers that could meet 99.7% of the demand. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to incorporate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to design a resilient NdFeB magnet recycling supply chain and logistics network, leveraging risk-averse stochastic programming.",1366-5545,Not found
Seaport adaptation to climate change disasters: Subsidy policy vs. adaptation sharing under minimum requirement,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102488,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Many seaports around the world face serious threat of natural disasters related to climate change. They have been investing in adaptation measures to mitigate potential disaster damages. This paper proposes an economic model to examine the inter-port competition in adaptation investments when ports face asymmetric disaster losses. Specifically, we model the trading mechanism of the adaptation resources among different ports, and benchmark the outcomes with the widely used adaptation subsidy policies. Our analytical results suggest that with adaptation trading under the minimum requirement policy, the port facing the low disaster loss sells adaptation resources to the port facing the high disaster loss, allowing the latter to cover all its disaster loss. Subsidy policy is pro-competitive and intensifies inter-port competition in adaptation investment and output. In comparison, adaptation trading facilitates inter-port coordination, possibly leading to port collusion. When the magnitudes of disaster damages are low, adaptation trading brings higher social welfare than the subsidy policy despite possible port collusion, leading to a Pareto improvement. When the magnitudes of disaster damages are high, the subsidy policy is preferred in terms of social welfare and port adaptation. Our model results reveal the strengths of alternative adaptation policies, and call for evaluation beyond competition effects when examining port coordination in adaptation.",1366-5545,Not found
Financing models for an online seller with performance risk in an E-commerce marketplace,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102468,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Third-party sellers on e-commerce marketplaces (e.g., Amazon and Alibaba) have been primarily dependent on conventional financing modes such as bank credit financing (BCF) to meet their working capital requirements. Many of these platforms have recently started novel financing programs (platform credit financing, PCF) for the sellers under the umbrella of Supply Chain Finance. For example, Amazon provides unsecured loans to third-party sellers on its platform under the Amazon lending program. These loans are risky for the platform. If the seller is unable to fulfill customer’s orders because of some internal inefficiencies (performance risk), the platform loses the loan amount and incurs a goodwill cost among its customer base. In this paper, we develop a series of game-theoretic models to analyze and compare BCF and PCF for a cash-constrained third-party seller on an e-commerce marketplace. We derive optimal interest rates that the platform may charge the seller depending on its performance risk. We derive conditions under which either BCF or PCF could be more profitable for the seller. We introduce innovative contracts (Guaranteed Demand Increment Contract and Lending Rate Matching Contract initiated by the platform and Lumpsum Transfer Contract initiated by the seller) that incentivize the seller or platform to act in a mutually beneficial way.

The impact of supply chain competition on the introduction of clean development mechanisms,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102506,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"An increasing number of manufacturers are introducing voluntary carbon emission reduction (VCER) mechanisms, such as clean development mechanisms (CDMs), to reduce environmental pollution and fulfill their social responsibility goals.

The results show that in the OT model, it is optimal for the manufacturer to introduce a CDM. However, in the TT model, the manufacturers’ optimal decisions on introducing CDMs are dependent on the trading price of the certified emission reductions (CERs). In particular, manufacturers should introduce CDMs if the CER trading price is low. Otherwise, they should not introduce CDMs. In addition, we study the impacts of the degree of retailer competition on the CDM introduction strategies of manufacturers and the impacts of the CER trading price on all partners’ operational decisions, profits, and environmental performance.

Data analytics for fuel consumption management in maritime transportation: Status and perspectives,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102489,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The shipping industry is associated with approximately three quarters of all world trade. In recent years, the sustainability of shipping has become a public concern, and various emissions control regulations to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships have been proposed and implemented globally. These regulations aim to drive the shipping industry in a low-carbon and low-pollutant direction by motivating it to switch to more efficient fuel types and reduce energy consumption. At the same time, the cyclical downturn of the world economy and high bunker prices make it necessary and urgent for the shipping industry to operate in a more cost-effective way while still satisfying global trade demand. As bunker fuel bunker (e.g., heavy fuel oil [HFO], liquified natural gas [LNG]) consumption is the main source of emissions and bunker fuel costs account for a large proportion of operating costs, shipping companies are making unprecedented efforts to optimize ship energy efficiency. It is widely accepted that the key to improving the energy efficiency of ships is the development of accurate models to predict ship fuel consumption rates under different scenarios. In this study, ship fuel consumption prediction models presented in the literature (including the academic literature and technical reports as a typical type of “grey literature”) are reviewed and compared, and models that optimize ship operations based on fuel consumption prediction results are also presented and discussed.

I develop a new method, based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, that can a) identify tanker vessels used as bunkering tankers, b) detect stationary ocean-going vessels at anchorage or alongside terminals and c) automatically recognize bunkering operations as a rendezvous between an ocean-going vessel and a bunkering barge. I find that the high time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm in this setting can be compensated by adjusting the algorithm to distributed computer settings.

The market includes information-sensitive and information-insensitive consumers, and the use of blockchain technology is examined. We analytically find that an increase of the cross-channel effect and platform power can benefit the manufacturer and online platform. The optimal production quantities with the agency mode are increasing in the commission rate when the cross-channel effect is high. Choosing the agency mode (reselling mode) can benefit the manufacturer when the commission rate is low (high). Whether blockchain technology can enhance profitability of the manufacturer’s offline channel depends on the cross-channel effect. Blockchain can generate more (less) consumer surplus when the cross-channel effect is low (high). With the agency mode, blockchain technology can always increase the online platform’s profit, while it may reduce its profit with reselling mode.

Shipping sentiment and the dry bulk shipping freight market: New evidence from newspaper coverage,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102490,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"In this paper, a shipping sentiment index in the dry bulk market is constructed using computational text analysis from shipping news archives. Our news corpus consists of 11,296 dry bulk news headlines from two major shipping news websites from January 2014 to November 2020. The constructed monthly index does track closely with major dry bulk freight indices. Then, we investigate how the freight market responds, if at all, to sentiment shock and whether news sentiment helps predict freight rates. Specifically, impulse response analyses using vector autoregression (VAR) models are employed to examine the effect of sentiment shocks on freight indices. The predictive power of the constructed shipping sentiment index for future dry bulk freight rates is further investigated using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) regression. To examine potential asymmetric relationship between dry bulk freight rates and news sentiment, copula models are then utilized. Results show that the constructed news sentiment index is a significant predictor for the future freight rates, especially in the Capesize market. The effect of sentiment shocks is relatively transitory and varies across different dry bulk sub-segments. Last but not least, the impact of news sentiment on the dry bulk freight rates is asymmetric and tends to be higher when the sentiment is extremely positive, and such tail dependence is more obvious for the larger Capesize segment.

The role of consumer behavior and power structures in coping with shoddy goods,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102482,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This paper aims to understand the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of shoddy goods and help honest firms better cope with the unfair competition posed by shoddy goods producers. We develop a game-theoretic model to examine the interaction between an honest manufacturer of quality goods (the truth-teller) and an unscrupulous producer of shoddy goods (the deceiver). Three power structures are considered: with the truth-teller as leader, with the deceiver as leader, and with equal-power players. Our equilibrium analysis suggests that when consumers make only one-time purchase, the truth-teller is prone to suffer profit loss. Yet some power structures may help the truth-teller mitigate the risk of losing profit. Specifically, when the announced quality of the deceiver is low enough, the truth-teller-as-leader power structure reduces the truth-teller’s risk of profit loss; in contrast, when the announced quality of the deceiver is not low enough, the deceiver-as-leader power structure has a better mitigating effect; and the equal-power-player power structure always works worst. We also investigate the role of consumer repurchase behavior in fighting shoddy goods by extending the model to incorporate consumer dissatisfaction and repurchase frequency. A numerical study indicates that consumers’ quality expectation disconfirmation sensitivity can deter the deceiver from exaggerating its product quality – either when consumers’ repurchase frequency is high or when consumers repurchase at a medium frequency in a market led by the truth-teller. Our findings yield new theoretical insights for firms and industries seeking to combat shoddy goods.",1366-5545,Not found

We first analyze the role of the private brand and the investment effect on the manufacturer under the reselling mode and the agency mode, respectively. We then examine how the private brand introduction and the investment effect impact the manufacturer’s optimal selling mode choice. The introduction of a private brand is believed to threaten manufacturers that sell goods through the platform. However, we find that, in the reselling mode, a manufacturer can benefit from private-brand introduction through the increased demand and wholesale price generated by the platform’s increased marketing investment, as long as the competition intensity remains relatively low. In the agency mode, the manufacturer benefits more with a higher proportional fee after private-brand introduction. Further, the investment effect can act as a buffer, making the manufacturer more robust when facing threats. Also, after private-brand introduction, the manufacturer prefers the agency mode, but when it comes to investment and high investment efficiency, it is wiser for the manufacturer to keep reselling when facing private-brand introduction.",1366-5545,Not found
The supply chain integration – Supply chain sustainability relationship in the UK and Ghana pharmaceutical industry: A stakeholder and contingency perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102477,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"In this research, the objective is to develop and test a model which provides understanding into the supply chain integration (SCI)-supply chain sustainability (SCS) relationship. The paper also explores how the SCI-SCS relationship is mediated by customer satisfaction and moderated by external uncertainty (EU) through the lenses of stakeholder and contingency theory by considering the pharmaceutical industry in Ghana and the UK. Empirical survey data were gathered from 231 pharmaceutical firms in Ghana and UK. We used structural equation modelling, multi-group analysis, and hierarchical regression to analyse the SCI-SCS relationship. We argue that through SCI, the economic, social and environmental performances can be simultaneously improved. However, the SCI-SCS relationship differs among the UK and Ghana context. Testing for mediation found that by increasing levels of customer satisfaction through customer integration (UK) and internal integration (Ghana), pharmaceutical companies can improve their SCS performances. However, testing moderation showed that the mediating effect is affected in both high and low EU.

Travel time models for tier-to-tier SBS/RS with different storage assignment policies and shuttle dispatching rules,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102485,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This paper explores both random and class-based storage policies and three shuttle dispatching rules, random, distance-based, and demand-rate based, for a tier-to-tier shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS). Modeling the system as a discrete-time Markov Chain, this study derived the shuttle distribution under each policy combination, and further developed the expected travel time models for both single-command (SC) and dual-command (DC) operations. The developed models can help a warehouse designer or manager to comprehensively make four decisions for SBS/RS, whether SC or DC operations should be adopted, the most appropriate storage policy, the best shuttle dispatching rule, and the number of shuttles. The travel time models can evaluate each possible policy combination quickly through multiple criteria, such as the capacity, customer responsiveness, and costs of shuttles. Numerical experiments showed significant impacts of the policy combination on the expected travel time. Class-based storage, if implementable, is always better than random storage under each combination of shuttle dispatching rule and operational mode (i.e., SC or DC). Under random storage and SC operations, the distance-based shuttle dispatching rule is always better than the random rule, and their difference is concave in the number of shuttles. When classed-based storage is adopted and the number of shuttles is small, the demand-rate-based rule is the best under SC operations. Its benefit becomes more obvious when demand rates become more heterogeneous until some point but decreases as the system has more shuttles. Under DC Operations, depending on equipment speeds, the distance-based shuttle dispatching rule can be worse than the random rule under random storage. Under class-based storage and DC operations, the demand-rate-based rule is still the best when demand rates are heterogeneous. The differences between SC and DC operations are more significant when demand rates are more homogenous. When a system wants to be more responsive to customers, it should be run under SC operations. If the overall capacity is of interest, DC operations are much better.",1366-5545,Not found
The interplay between blockchain adoption and channel selection in combating counterfeits,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102451,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This study explores the interplay between blockchain technology (BCT) adoption and channel selection in combating counterfeits and examines the impact of this interaction on consumer surplus (CS) and social welfare (SW). Firstly, analytical models are developed to examine four scenarios (with and without BCT adoption and two channel scenarios). Secondly, the impacts of BCT adoption and channel selection decisions on CS and SW are analyzed. Finally, we relax our assumptions to consider the presence of the dual-channel sales model, risk-averse consumers, and expert consumers. The main findings are as follows: (1) Genuine companies should sometimes sell through dual sales channels before adopting BCT; however, they should always sell through a single sales channel after adopting BCT. Furthermore, BCT changes the optimal single sales channel from the retailer channel to the direct sales channel when the proportion of deceptive counterfeits in the direct sales channel is relatively high. (2) Both consumers and the whole society will benefit from the deployment of BCT when all sales channels of a company are either less reliable or highly unreliable. (3) BCT is valuable in combating counterfeits, especially when the risk aversion level of consumers is not sufficiently low or the proportion of expert consumers is sufficiently low.",1366-5545,Not found
The effects of supply chain diversification during the COVID-19 crisis: Evidence from Chinese manufacturers,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102493,155,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Resilience amidst a crisis is vital to survival in the turbulent contemporary business environment.

However, there is insufficient empirical evidence demonstrating the merits of supply chain diversification during a crisis. Sampling 1434 Chinese manufacturing firms amidst the COVID-19 crisis, our two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression analyses show that firms with a diversified supply base are associated with a larger supply stream (increased abnormal inventory) and increased profitability during the COVID-19 crisis, including both the disruption and recovery periods. In addition, firms with a diversified customer base are associated with a larger demand stream (reduced abnormal inventory) during the COVID-19 crisis (both disruption and recovery periods) but show increased profitability only during the recovery period. Our study contributes to the literature on supply chain risk, disruption, diversification, and inventory management.

A branch-and-price algorithm for a green location routing problem with multi-type charging infrastructure,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102529,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"In this paper, we present a green location routing problem with multi-type charging infrastructure (GLRP-CI), which aims to determine simultaneous decisions on locating depots, reinforcing them with battery swapping infrastructure (BSI) or recharging infrastructure (FCI), and routing electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution system. The problem is formulated as an arc-based formulation, and the objective is to minimize the total cost, including the daily fixed costs of depots equipped with BSI or FCI, the travel cost of EVs, the holding cost of batteries, and the electricity cost for charging, with the potential profit of sending energy back into the electric grid subtracted from the objective function. Some analytical properties of special cases of the problem are also investigated.

The proposed B&P algorithm is validated by extensive computational experiments, and it performs well compared with commercial branch-and-bound/cut solvers such as CPLEX in terms of computational speed and solution quality.

A distributed algorithm for operating large-scale ridesourcing systems,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102487,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"With ridesourcing services gaining popularity in the past few years, there has been growing interest in algorithms that could enable real-time operation of these systems. As ridesourcing systems rely on independent entities to build the supply and demand sides of the market, they have been shown to operate more successfully in metropolitan areas where there is a high level of demand for rides as well as a high number of drivers, and a large volume of trips occurring within a geographically constrained region. Despite the suitable ecosystem that metropolitan areas offer for ridesourcing operations, there is a lack of methods that can provide high-quality matching solutions in real-time. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a framework that allows for solving the large-scale matching problems by means of solving smaller problems in a distributed fashion. The proposed methodology is based on constructing approximately-uniform clusters of trip requests, where vehicle tours form cluster centers. Using the New York Taxi dataset, we compare the performance of the proposed methodology against three benchmark methods to showcase its advantages in terms of solution quality and solution time.",1366-5545,Not found
Strategic planning of inland river ports under different market structures: Coordinated vs. independent operating regime,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102547,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This paper addresses the strategic planning issue of ports in an inland river corridor with location-dependent waterway depths, which determine the maximum navigable ship sizes deployed in ports. A vertical-structure model is proposed to capture the interrelationships among port operators, carriers, and shippers. The shippers, who are assumed to be continuously distributed along the inland river corridor, choose transshipment ports to minimize their own full transport cost from origin to destination. The carriers aim to maximize their own profit by determining waterway freight rates and ship fleet (in terms of ship size and number of ships). The port operators determine port capacity and port service charge to achieve their own objective, depending on the port market structures adopted, i.e., coordinated vs. independent regime. Under the coordinated regime, the central government aims to maximize total social welfare of the entire inland river system. Under the independent regime, each local government along the inland river corridor maximizes the local social welfare of individual port inside its jurisdiction. The properties of the models with different regimes are analytically explored. Our study develops a comprehensive model that can be used to analyze the investment and regulatory decisions for an inland river shipping corridor composed of multiple heterogeneous ports. The modelling results suggest that local governments have a tendency to overinvest port capacity beyond system optimum. Therefore, in the choice of regulatory regimes, one needs to balance the costs of regulation vs. the avoidance of excessive investments under central government intervention. Findings specific to the Yangtze River inland shipping corridor are also provided.",1366-5545,Not found
Designing integrated urban delivery systems using public transport,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102525,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The growth of online retail leads to increasing last-mile delivery operations that contribute to various negative externalities, such as traffic congestion and air pollution, especially in urban areas. One way to improve urban delivery operations is to use public transport capacity to move goods to intermediate transfer locations from which they can be delivered by (small) vehicles to the final customers. We study the distance savings that can be achieved by such a two-tier urban delivery system. In particular, we focus on determining which transit stop is best located to be used as a transfer location. We present several special cases to get insights into the transfer location decisions. Moreover, we present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation and a heuristic to solve it. To evaluate the different approaches, we run several computational studies. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of different system parameters on the location decisions and system performance. For very conservative benchmarks, the results show that savings up to 7.1 percent are possible from using public transport capacity to support urban delivery. The savings increase with the distance to the depot, tighter deadlines and customers that are clustered around the transit line.",1366-5545,Not found
An exact solution approach for an electric bus dispatch problem,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102528,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"We study how to efficiently plan a bus dispatch operation within a public transport terminal working with a mixed fleet of electric and diesel buses and a restricted number of chargers. To meet the daily trip demand, the terminal dispatcher has to assign a trip schedule and a battery charge plan to each bus and also feasibly sequence charging tasks at each charger. We model this problem as an extension of the Vehicle Scheduling Problem, which we later reformulate via a Benders’ type decomposition approach into two sub-problems; (1) a master problem assigning bus trip schedules and (2) a satellite problem sequencing charging tasks for a given set of bus trip schedules. Our exact decomposition approach dynamically injects feasibility cuts into the branch-and-bound tree to remove bus trip schedules leading to an infeasible bus charging operation. We assess the effectiveness of our approach and its advantage over a single-stage model in computational experiments inspired by a bus operator from Santiago, Chile. Finally, we provide several managerial insights for planners such as the marginal benefit per additional charger or electric bus and the value added by a mixed fleet compared to a pure electric one.",1366-5545,Not found
Joint optimisation of transfer location and capacity for a capacitated multimodal transport network with elastic demand: a bi-level programming model and paradoxes,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102540,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"With the growing attention toward developing a multimodal transport system to enhance urban mobility, there is an increasing need to construct new infrastructures, rebuild or expand the existing ones, to accommodate the current and newly generated travel demand. Therefore, this study develops a bi-level model that simultaneously determines the location and capacity of the transfer infrastructure to be built considering the elastic demand in a multimodal transport network. The upper-level problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, whereas the lower-level problem is a combined trip distribution/modal split/assignment model that depicts both the destination and route choices of travellers via a multinomial logit model. Numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the occurrence of two Braess-like paradox phenomena in a multimodal transport network. The first one states that under fixed demand, constructing new parking spaces to provide the usage of park-and-ride services could deteriorate the system performance measured by the total passengers’ travel time, while the second one reveals that under elastic demand, increasing the parking capacity for park-and-ride services to promote its usage may fail, which would be represented by the decline in their modal share. Meanwhile, a numerical example also suggests that constructing transfer infrastructures at distributed stations outperforms building a large transfer centre in terms of attracting travellers using sustainable transit modes.",1366-5545,Not found
Pareto routing and scheduling of dynamic urban rail transit services with multi-objective cross entropy method,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102544,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This paper presents a Pareto optimization framework for routing and scheduling dynamic rail transit network services. We first develop an event-based dynamic transit network model that can capture the evolution of passenger demand and service operations with incorporation of passengers’ transfers and recirculation of limited number of train vehicles over different service lines. A multi-objective optimizer is then built upon the transit model which seeks jointly the settings of service lines and schedules that could minimize passengers’ journey times, transfer rates, and operator’s cost. The problem is solved by a cross-entropy method (CEM) which samples potential solutions from statistically tractable distribution models with iterative updates via maximum likelihood. The operational constraints are explicitly incorporated in the solution process which enhances the feasibility of the sampled solutions and hence effectiveness of the computational process compared with other metaheuristics used in the literature. A CEM-based ranking algorithm is further developed for deriving the Pareto-frontiers for the multi-objective transit network routing and scheduling. The proposed framework is applied and tested on the Hong Kong Light Rail Transit (LRT) network using real world scenario data. The results reveal new insights on how the existing operational settings could be improved.

Convalescent plasma bank facility location-allocation problem for COVID-19,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102517,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"With convalescent plasma being recognized as an eminent treatment option for COVID-19, this paper addresses the location-allocation problem for convalescent plasma bank facilities. This is a critical topic, since limited supply and overtly increasing cases demand a well-established supply chain. We present a novel plasma supply chain model considering stochastic parameters affecting plasma demand and the unique features of the plasma supply chain. The primary objective is to first determine the optimal location of the plasma banks and to then allocate the plasma collection facilities so as to maintain proper plasma flow within the network. In addition, recognizing the perishable nature of plasma, we integrate a deteriorating rate with the objective that as little plasma as possible is lost. We formulate a robust mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model by considering two conflicting objective functions, namely the minimization of overall plasma transportation time and total plasma supply chain network cost, with the latter also capturing inventory costs to reduce wastage. We then propose a CPLEX-based optimization approach for solving the MILP functions. The feasibility of our results is validated by a comparison study using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and a proposed modified NSGA-III. The application of the proposed model is evaluated by implementing it in a real-world case study within the context of India.

Matching and routing for shared autonomous vehicles in congestible network,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102513,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The dispatch and routing problems of shared autonomous vehicle (DR-SAV) have been widely studied, and one of the key challenges is the modeling complexity and computational burden associated with network congestion. Existing studies on DR-SAV are limited in the sense that traffic congestion and demand–supply interaction, resulting from dispatch and routing decisions, are not fully integrated into the optimization framework. In this work, we explicitly consider the congestion effect of SAV operations in a mixed traffic environment, consisting of SAVs and conventional vehicles (CVs), by proposing a computationally tractable traffic assignment framework for optimal matching and routing of SAV trips, while allowing the sharing of vehicle by up to two trips simultaneously. This problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game where the upper level is inherently a matching and routing problem for SAVs, and the lower level involves a user equilibrium among CVs. Two strategies are proposed to improve the tractability of the proposed problem: (1) a novel convex programming formulation of the joint SAV matching–routing problem based on the system optimal traffic assignment principle, and (2) the invocation of shareability network to facilitate path set generation. Numerical experiments of the proposed method show that the proposed SAV matching and routing scheme could lead to significant reduction in total travel cost.",1366-5545,Not found

With virtually every individual worldwide being impacted, strategies are needed to devise best vaccine distribution scenarios, ensuring proper storage, transportation and cost considerations. Current models do not consider the magnitude of distribution efforts needed in our current pandemic, in particular the objective that entire populations need to be vaccinated. We expand on existing models and devise an approach that considers the needed extensive distribution capabilities and special storage requirements of vaccines, while at the same time being cognizant of costs. As such, we provide decision support on how to distribute the vaccine to an entire population based on priority. We do so by conducting predictive analysis for three different scenarios and dividing the distribution chain into three phases. As the available vaccine doses are limited in quantity at first, we apply decision tree analysis to find the best vaccination scenario, followed by a synthetic control analysis to predict the impact of the vaccination programme to forecast future vaccine production. We then formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for locating and allocating cold storage facilities for bulk vaccine production, followed by the proposition of a heuristic algorithm to solve the associated objective functions. The application of the proposed model is evaluated by implementing it in a real-world case study.

Efficiency, effectiveness and equity metrics, which can be explicitly demonstrated as operational costs, service quality and the coverage rate, are incorporated to quantitatively measure system performance under disaster situations. As chance constraints are intractable, we correspondingly propose conic and linear approximations.

Vehicle scheduling for rental-with-driver services,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102530,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"In this paper, we introduce a new vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) with driver consistency faced by rental-with-driver companies. A weekly time-horizon is considered and a set of potential customers, each one associated with a list of required tasks, is assumed. The company can choose to accept or reject a customer, but if accepted, all required tasks must be performed by the same driver. A profit is associated with each customer. The goal is to maximize the company’s total profit, by respecting a list of daily and the weekly drivers’ workload limitations imposed by drivers’ contracts. We propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and design an exact solution method based on the combinatorial Benders cuts approach. A computational study based on several sets of instances reveals that the proposed solution method strongly outperforms the straightforward MIP approach. A deep analysis of the impact of different parameters is presented. Finally, we provide a measure of the cost of consistency, expressed as the loss of profit necessary to guarantee driver consistency. Results indicate that, for instance, if task durations are long, consistency can be achieved for almost no cost. However, if task durations are short, the loss of profit is below 6%.

In the process, we use analytical, numerical, and graphical methods to understand how the contract parameters affect the channel partner’s performance under two-periodic setting. The results show that although the wholesale price contract fails to solve double marginalization, interestingly, the combination of the wholesale price and revenue sharing contracts can coordinate a two-period socially responsible supply chain, but fails to resolve the channel conflict.

Dynamic pricing and cross-channel fulfillment for omnichannel retailing industry: An approximation policy and implications,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102524,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Emerging to satisfy the needs of consumers in the e-commerce era, omni-channel retailing is the integration of the online channel and the offline store network with the key features of channel integration and inventory sharing. As such, the omni-channel retailer faces more challenging problems of pricing and order fulfillment compared with the pure e-commence retailer. With the omni-channel features, we study the joint dynamic pricing and (cross-channel) order fulfillment problem of an omni-channel retailer with a network of physical stores and fulfillment centers facing limited initial inventory and no replenishment opportunity in a finite selling season. The classical multinomial logit (MNL) choice model is used to characterize the customer demand with the above omni-channel features. Then, the omni-channel joint dynamic pricing and order fulfillment policy (OPFP) is identified based on the optimal solution of the deterministic relaxation to the stochastic control formulation of the original problem. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the proposed approximation policy is asymptotically optimal. We examine some variants of this OPFP to address the problem under various practical constraints and show that they maintain sufficiently good performance. In addition, we show that the proposed OPFP can yield a lower average order fulfillment cost than the heuristic order fulfillment policy that chooses the bricks-and-mortar store with the lowest fulfillment cost. We also find that the improved performance of the re-optimization policy can be offset by the loss of sales volume transfer between channels for large-scale problems.",1366-5545,Not found

To encourage ships to comply with standards during subsequent inspections and improve new inspection regimes, we develop a game model analysing the strategies of port states, flag states, and shipowners. We then confirm the Nash equilibrium of the pure and mixed strategies. Subsequently, we investigate the influence of different reward and punishment conditions on flag states and shipowners and generate the following three results: first, differentiating flag state performance is crucial for port states to provide appropriate punishments or rewards to improve ship safety; second, reputation rewards have stronger impacts than reputation punishments for flag states; and third, reputation rewards or punishments from port states have little influence on shipowners’ strategies, since shipowners are much more concerned about their profits.",1366-5545,Not found
Container shipping line port choice patterns in East Asia the effects of port affiliation and spatial dependence,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102527,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"In the container shipping sector, many shipping lines are investing in ports and terminals. Although the literature generally agrees that shipping lines can benefit financially from such vertical investments, there are conflicting views on the impacts on different stakeholders, with limited empirical evidence nor solid data analysis. In addition to being an important managerial decision for shipping lines and their affiliated ports, this may become a policy issue because public infrastructure is expected to provide equal and fair access to all consumers. This study aims to enhance the understanding of the implications of shipping line-port integration by investigating its effects on the port call choices of shipping lines at the route level. Using data from East Asia, our correlation matrix of port-calls reveals significant spatial dependence in the port call patterns of shipping lines, and complex relationships between ports in a region, which can be substitutable, complementary or no significant relationship. Our spatial probit model estimation further suggests that carriers, whether based in East Asia or elsewhere, prefer to call at affiliated ports that they own either directly or indirectly via their alliance partners. Carriers tend to avoid calling at some ports with significantly overlapping roles on the same route but are likely to call at multiple ports that are less than 1200 km apart. Our findings also indicate that shipping lines prefer ports with adequate infrastructure and that the number of ports called on one route is constrained by the total transport time. We recommend that port authorities and local governments evaluate vertical integration on a case-by-case basis, because vertical integration could help secure some port throughput but nevertheless limit competition. Further studies on the shipping line-port integration’s impacts on port handling efficiency and service quality would help policy formation on vertical integration in the maritime sector.",1366-5545,Not found

This study characterizes the uncertain residual capacity based on the battery capacity level required for remanufacturing, and first formulates two base models of supplier recovery and manufacturer recovery in a supplier-dominated closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). Our results show that the impact of uncertain residual capacity on the operational decisions and economic performance of the CLSC is related to the recovery model, remanufacturing strategy, maximal unit remanufacturing cost of UBs, and the substitution degree of low-speed EVs for regular EVs. Compared with the supplier-recovery model, the manufacturer-recovery model brings a higher profit to the EV manufacturer and CLSC when no or partial UBs are remanufactured, but a lower profit for the battery supplier, and places a greater burden on the environment. Furthermore, we extend the base models to the manufacturer-dominated CLSC and a CLSC with two competing suppliers to investigate the rationality of the above results.",1366-5545,Not found

Counter intuitively, we find that it is optimal for the hinterland container operator to charge the barge service higher than the trucking service when the sea terminal’s free storage time is short. High barge service price could still attract consignees because long transportation time by barge benefits consignees by reducing their storage costs at the inland terminal.

This paper proposes an evolutionary game theoretic approach to identify the best bike-sharing sourcing strategies, including self-operation, joint venture, and outsourcing. We show that the self-operation mode is an evolutionary stable strategy to rebalance Mobike. However, if bike-sharing firms cannot achieve economies of scale and significantly reduce the variable costs of the self-operation mode, the outsourcing mode will become the optimal choice. From a long-term perspective, the joint venture mode is never an attractive strategy for the bike-sharing firms under study.

Carbon cap-and-trade schemes in closed-loop supply chains: Why firms do not comply?,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102486,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"In a cap-and-trade scheme, firms with low carbon emissions can trade their excess emission credits with other firms who generate more emissions than their allocated allowance. However, some firms do not fully comply with the imposed carbon policy and even exceed their overall emission capacity, including their dedicated credits as well as the credits purchased in the carbon market. The noncompliance behavior of these firms is often penalised by monetary fines. We are interested in a quantitative study to understand the characteristics of this noncompliance penalty. We present game theoretic models to investigate the network impact of compliance and noncompliance behavior of the players in a closed-loop supply chain operating under a carbon cap-and-trade scheme. The network equilibrium models are utilized to study the interactive behavior of the supply chain players. Extensive numerical analysis is completed to examine the effect of noncompliance penalties, remanufacturing ratios, and production emissions on the equilibrium results. The analysis arrives at important managerial and regulatory insights.",1366-5545,Not found
The vehicle deployment and relocation problem for electric vehicle sharing systems considering demand and parking space stochasticity,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102514,156,2021-12-01,2021,12,"One-way electric vehicle (EV) sharing systems have received increasing attention because of their environmental, mobility, and societal benefits. In this research, we investigate the vehicle deployment and relocation problem for hybrid one-way station-based and free-floating electric vehicle sharing systems considering demand and parking space stochasticity. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. In the first stage, the EVs are deployed into a sharing system based on historical customer data to maximize the resulting profit. The second stage maximizes the expected profit by relocating the EVs in the system using relocation staff in response to an uncertain demand. To solve the resulting complicated problem, an integer L-shaped method is proposed so that the cuts can efficiently fathom the solution space and identify solutions with a reasonable optimality gap. The proposed solution framework is empirically applied to cases of various sizes. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution scheme.",1366-5545,Not found
Energy-efficient high-speed train rescheduling during a major disruption,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102492,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Disruptions are inevitable in daily train operations, and can cause high-speed trains to deviate from their official schedules. Therefore, the efficient rescheduling of disrupted trains is critical for ensuring smooth daily operations. We sought to determine the appropriate arrival and departure times and orders of trains at each station during a disruption, and the speed profile of each train, to reduce the delay costs and energy consumption. To embed the train speed profile corresponding to energy saving into the train rescheduling problem, a space–time–speed network is applied for problem formulation. Thus, the energy-efficient train speed profile is embedded in the speed dimension in the space–time–speed hypernetwork. The detailed train speed profile between two stations is formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control model, which is solved using a pseudospectral method. Then, an integer linear programming model based on multicommodity flow is built to solve the train rescheduling problem. We decompose it via the alternating direction method of multipliers into a series of easy-to-solve shortest path subproblems. Each subproblem is then efficiently solved using a dynamic programming algorithm. Finally, the Xi’an–Chengdu high-speed railway line is used to test our model and algorithms, thereby demonstrating the trade-off between passenger-service quality and energy efficiency.",1366-5545,Not found
Overcoming barriers to cross-sector collaboration in circular supply chain management: a multi-method approach,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102582,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Economies are transitioning from a linear to a circular model to address global issues such as resource extraction, environmental degradation and waste generation. Cross-Sector Collaboration (C-SC) is an effective means to use resources in a way that is mutually beneficial and integrates sustainable practices into the value chain. The zero-waste aspiration of companies can be achieved through Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM). Existing literature supports research initiatives in CSCM, but how C-SC influences CSCM is still unexplored. Moreover, the barriers to C-SC for CSCM are untouched and the strategies to overcome these barriers are unmapped. This study fills this gap, assesses the barriers to C-SC for CSCM and suggests a strategic roadmap to overcome these barriers. The study was conducted in three different phases employing a multi-method approach of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), Fuzzy Delphi and Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL). The results reveal that governance barriers and contextual barriers are causal and influence the other barriers. There is a need to enhance the capacity and optimum resource utilisation for developing circular supply chains; it is possible to facilitate CSCM practices only through collaborative efforts across sectors. The study also highlights that government policymaking and regulation, collaborative value capture model and Industry 4.0 technologies are the most effective strategies for managing C-SC for CSCM. This study contributes to stakeholder theory and resource-based view theory by explicating collaboration among cross-sector stakeholders and highlighting the significance of resource optimisation through waste management.",1366-5545,Not found
Manufacturer- versus retailer-initiated bundling: Implications for the supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102552,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This paper studies bundling in a two-level supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. Past literature offers deep insights into product bundling but overlooks the implications of bundling at different supply chain levels, i.e., downstream and upstream, which has been widely observed in practice. In this paper, we allow either the manufacturer or the retailer to initiate bundling. We find that production costs drive the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s bundling decisions differently. In particular, the manufacturer adopts bundling when costs are not too high or low, while the retailer executes bundling when costs are medium or moderately low. We also characterize the conditions under which bundling benefits the firms. Our analysis reveals that while the manufacturer always benefits from initiating bundling, this is not necessarily the case for the retailer. Interestingly, when costs are moderately high, the retailer benefits from manufacturer-initiated bundling but is hurt by retailer-initiated bundling. Furthermore, whether initiated by the manufacturer or the retailer, bundling can lead to higher supply chain profit, consumer surplus as well as social welfare. Our results help clarify the impact of upstream and downstream bundling decisions on supply chain dynamics.",1366-5545,Not found

This paper presents a novel scenario-based robust bi-objective optimization model that integrates medical facility location, casualty transportation, and relief commodity allocation considering triage. The proposed model aims to minimize the total deprivation cost of casualties due to the delayed access to medical services and the total operation cost. Following a set of disruption scenarios, the scenario-based robust approach is applied to protect solutions against the risk of disruptions in temporary medical centers. Considering the uncertain number of casualties under each scenario, the robust method which denotes the uncertainty as interval data is adopted. We utilize the ε-constraint method to deal with the bi-objective model. Additionally, we consider real case studies of the Wenchuan Earthquake to validate the proposed model.

Detecting delay propagation in regional air transport systems using convergent cross mapping and complex network theory,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102585,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"It has been widely recognized that delay propagation is a widespread phenomenon in air transport systems. Regional air transport systems are vulnerable to severe systemic delay propagation because of connected resources and shared airspace. This study presents a two-stage analytical framework to detect delay propagation in regional air transport systems, which is critical to support industrial applications in air transport operations. In the first stage, we propose a delay causality without the strong and independent causality (SIC) assumption to represent the delay propagation effect. A convergent cross mapping method is employed to obtain the delay causality. In the second stage, we build a delay causality graph based on the none SIC assumption (DCG-non-SIC). A complex network analysis of DCG-non-SIC is presented to enhance the understanding of delay propagation patterns. This study carries out a real-world case study and provides some interesting results. Robustness checks are conducted, which verifies that the results derived in the analytical framework are solid. The results show that there is extensive delay causality between airport pairs, and a transitive trait of delay causality is observed in regional air transport systems.

Lateral collaboration with cost-sharing in sustainable supply chain optimisation: A combinatorial framework,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102593,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The growing importance of collaboration to achieve sustainability-related advantages for companies is widely acknowledged. However, the existing research lacks a framework determining how supply chains can strategically collaborate to achieve triple-bottom-line (3BL) sustainability-related objectives. In this research, we develop a framework based on scenarios designed for collaborative supply chains and then suggest novel models of lateral collaboration to optimise 3BL sustainability-related objectives. We propose a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming model and investigate two collaboration scenarios and four cost-sharing strategies with which such collaboration would be likely to succeed. The proposed framework allows for optimal decision-making in multiple sustainable supply chains, simultaneously minimising total costs and environmental impacts as well as maximising social responsibility. Our research provides evidence that lateral collaboration enables optimal decisions and shows how the total cost is shared among network members to obtain profitable and sustainable solutions.

Identifying intercity freight trip ends of heavy trucks from GPS data,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102590,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The intercity freight trips of heavy trucks are basic data for transportation system planning and management. In recent decades, extracting intercity freight trips from GPS data has gradually become the main alternative to traditional surveys. Identifying freight trip ends (origin and destination) is the first task in trip extraction. Although many trip end identification methods have been proposed in previous studies, most of these studies subjectively determined key parameters and ignored the complex characteristics of truck trajectory and freight activities. In this paper, we propose a data-driven trip end identification method based on massive GPS data of heavy trucks in China. First, we capture heavy truck trajectory characteristics under the influence of GPS drift to identify truck stops from GPS data. Second, we analyze the temporal characteristics of truck activities and use freight-related point-of-interest (POI) data and highway network GIS data to identify valid trip ends from truck stops. The results of method validation suggest that the accuracy of our proposed method is significantly improved in comparison with the benchmark methods. We further extract intercity freight trips from the identified trip ends and analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of intercity freight trips in China.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal pricing and seat allocation schemes in passenger railway systems,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102580,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This paper examines optimal pricing and seat allocation schemes in passenger railway systems, where ticket pricing and seat allocation (or capacity allocation) are both Origin-Destination specific. We consider that the demand is sensitive to the ticket price, and a non-concave and non-linear mixed integer optimization model is then formulated for the ticket pricing and seat allocation problem to maximize the railway ticket revenue. To find the optimal solution of the ticket revenue maximization problem effectively, the proposed non-concave and non-linear model is reformulated such that the objective function and constraints are linear with respect to the decision variables or the logarithms of the decision variables. The linearized model is then further relaxed as a mixed-integer programing problem (MILP).

Circular supply chain management: Performance outcomes and the role of eco-industrial parks in China,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102596,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"A circular economy (CE) is increasingly recognized as a more environmentally sustainable alternative to the dominant linear take-make-dispose economic model. We empirically investigate the effect of circular supply chain management (CSCM) on cost and financial performance in China, which has established the world’s largest system of eco-industrial parks (EIPs) to promote CE over the last decade. We combine the Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV), Contingent NRBV and the literature on CSCM to develop a conceptual model and test it using survey data collected from 255 Chinese manufacturing firms. The results show that CSCM, when exercised as a unified strategy, has a significant positive effect on cost and financial performance. Firms located within EIPs adopt CSCM at higher levels as compared to firms located outside EIPs. Nevertheless, the contextual factor of being located within an EIP does not moderate the CSCM practice-performance relationship, suggesting that performance is driven by practices rather than firms’ locations. These results were affirmed by post-survey participant validation in three focus group meetings and six face-to-face interviews. Our findings contribute to sustainability literature by offering a new construct and measurement items relevant to CSCM and provide practical insights to guide a transition to a CE.",1366-5545,Not found
A freight origin-destination synthesis model with mode choice,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102595,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This paper develops a novel procedure to conduct a Freight Origin-Destination Synthesis (FODS) that jointly estimates the trip distribution, mode choice, and the empty trips by truck and rail that provide the best match to the observed freight traffic counts. Four models are integrated: (1) a gravity model for trip distribution, (2) a binary logit model for mode choice, (3) a Noortman and Van Es’ model for truck, and (4) a Noortman and Van Es’ model for rail empty trips. The estimation process entails an iterative minimization of a nonconvex objective function, the summation of squared errors of the estimated truck and rail traffic counts with respect to the five model parameters. Of the two methods tested to address the nonconvexity, an interior point method with a set of random starting points (Multi-Start algorithm) outperformed the Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) inference technique. The potential of this methodology is examined using a hypothetical example of developing a nationwide freight demand model for Bangladesh. This research improves the existing FODS techniques that use readily available secondary data such as traffic counts and link costs, allowing transportation planners to evaluate policy outcomes without needing expensive freight data collection.

Routing optimization of shared autonomous electric vehicles under uncertain travel time and uncertain service time,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102548,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The emerging autonomous electric vehicles have facilitated the implementation of the shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) service. In real-life applications, the operations of SAEVs may be affected by various uncertain factors, such as uncertain travel time caused by traffic congestion and uncertain service time caused by unpredictable customer delay. It is essential to consider uncertain factors to design conservative and robust routes for SAEVs. In this paper, we study a routing optimization problem of SAEVs, where the charging schedules, uncertain travel time, and uncertain service time are considered. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total operational cost that consists of fixed cost and travel cost of SAEVs. A branch-and-price algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Specifically, a tailored label setting algorithm is introduced to identify the robust feasible routes with accessible charging schedules for the pricing subproblem. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of generated instances. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the commercial solver CPLEX in terms of both solution quality and computational time. Besides, based on the sensitivity analyses, we show the impact of the budgets of uncertainty, maximum deviations of uncertain parameters, battery capacity, fixed cost, and charging speed on the SAEV service.

Two types of fleets (i.e., dedicated vehicles and occasional drivers) are available to serve three types of customers. Type 1 customers require a home delivery. The parcel of type 2 customers must be sent to the selected alternative delivery point (ADP). Type 3 customers have the flexibility to either receive their parcel at home or at the selected ADP. Dedicated vehicles are able to serve all types of customers, whereas occasional drivers only make home deliveries. The objective of CSPTW-TN-DO is to minimize the total distribution cost of employing both fleets. We formulate a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model for the problem and solve the model by the commercial solver CPLEX after applying a linearization process. We also propose an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) to solve a set of newly generated CSPTW-TN-DO instances. The computational results indicate that the proposed ALNS provides high-quality solutions. In addition, we show that the VRPTW with a primary objective of minimizing the total distribution cost is a special case of CSPTW-TN-DO, and that the proposed ALNS achieves comparative performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms for VRPTW.

Moreover, we build on the resource dependence theory to explore the CE’s potential to reduce dependencies in supply chain (SC) networks. Based on current literature, the CE practices of the 4R framework (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover), and a series of workshops, we formulated 11 future-oriented projections. In two subsequent Delphi rounds, 78 international CE and SC management experts quantitatively assessed the projections regarding their probability of occurrence in 2030, their potential to reduce SC dependencies, and their desirability. A fuzzy c-means algorithm was applied to cluster the projections based on the expert assessments. We found that the implementation likelihood of CE practices in 2030 is not congruent with the value retention hierarchy advocated by the 4R framework. Qualitative analyses of the panelists’ written statements revealed that regulation, financial attractiveness, customer demand, technological innovation, and product design are the most prominent influencing factors for the future implementation of various CE practices. Moreover, different practices revealed a varying capacity to reduce SC dependencies. More precisely, we found that diversifying a company’s supply base through recycled materials and components has the highest potential.

The role of government regulatory policies in financing capital-constrained retailers under competition,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102572,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Governments in many different countries have implemented regulatory policies (such as tax reduction and subsidy provision) to support the development and operation of capital-constrained small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that may compete each other in practice. To better understand the impacts of government regulatory policies on capital-constrained SMEs, bank, consumers and social welfare, this paper develops a Cournot competition model consisting of two competing and capital-constrained retailers in a market with demand uncertainty. We obtain the optimal procurement decisions of two retailers and the optimal loan interest decision of the bank completely, and compare the effects of two government supporting policies (i.e., tax reduction and subsidy provision) in a Nash game of the two retailers. We show that the difference of the two retailers’ procurement costs closely affects the procurement decision of the retailer who possesses the cost advantage, and that this retailer orders more under government regulatory policies than without government regulation, if the procurement costs of two retailers are relatively balanced. In addition, tax reduction can improve the profits of the retailers engaged in the competitive market when the gap of their procurement costs is small relatively, whereas the subsidy provision can always improve the profit of the retailer who does not possess a procurement cost advantage. The bank is incentivized to lower its interest rate to both retailers under tax reduction; under the subsidy provision, the opposite result is true. Our finding can demonstrate that there exists a win–win–win situation for the two retailers, the consumers as well as for the society in the case of bank financing with government tax reduction/subsidy provision. The numerical studies show that the improvement of social welfare is more significant in the case of subsidy provision than that in the case of tax reduction.",1366-5545,Not found

Optimal subsidy scheme design for promoting intermodal freight transport,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102561,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Waterborne transport is known to have low environmental impacts compared to other modes. This paper investigates the optimal container subsidies for shippers to promote intermodal shipping involving waterways in a regional transportation network. We consider a linear subsidy scheme consisting of a fixed-rate component and a variable component proportional to the sailing distance. The optimal subsidy design problem is formulated as a bilevel program to maximize the intermodal transport split of demand and minimize the subsidy expenditure. Faster methods are developed to solve the optimization problems of two special subsidy forms, i.e., fixed-rate and distance-based schemes. A case study of the Pearl River Delta region in China suggests that an optimally designed subsidy scheme can increase the intermodal split of container transport by 16%. Many insights are unveiled from the case study regarding the performance comparison between different subsidy schemes, the optimal schemes’ environmental impacts, and their effects on individual shippers and feeder ports. For example, the subsidy is less effective for shippers originating too far from or too close to the hub port and for highly time-sensitive or time-insensitive goods. Moreover, two commonly-used objectives, maximizing the intermodal split and minimizing the CO2 emissions, are well aligned as they yield similar solutions. These insights can assist the local governments in determining the appropriate subsidy schemes and better understanding their overall effects.",1366-5545,Not found

The pickup and delivery problem with synchronized en-route transfers for microtransit planning,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102562,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Microtransit and other flexible transit fleet services can reduce costs by incorporating transfers. However, transfers are costly to users if they must get off a vehicle and wait at a stop for another pickup. A mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is proposed to solve pickup and delivery problems with vehicle-synchronized en-route transfers (PDPSET). The transfer location is determined by the model and can be located at any candidate node in the network rather than a static facility defined in advance. The transfer operation is strictly synchronized between vehicles within a hard time window. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem with an acceptable solution in a much shorter computation time than commercial software. Two sets of synthetic numerical experiments are tested: small-scale instances based on a 5x5 grid network, and large-scale instances of varying network sizes up to 250x250 grids to test scalability. The results show that adding synchronized en-route transfers in microtransit can further reduce the total cost by 10% on average and maximum savings can reach up to 19.6% in our small-scale test instances. The heuristic on average has an optimality gap less than 1.5% while having a fraction of the run time and can scale up to 250x250 grids with run times within 1 min. Two large-scale examples demonstrate that over 50% of vehicle routes can be further improved by synchronized en-route transfers and the maximum savings in vehicle travel distance that can reach up to 20.37% for the instance with 100 vehicles and 300 requests on a 200x200 network.",1366-5545,Not found

We study omnichannel retail operations with the implementation of ship-from-store to minimize the o-tailer’s expected total cost. At the start of each period, the o-tailer determines how much to replenish each product for each distribution center (DC), and how to allocate its inventory from DCs to different stores.

Profit-maximizing parcel locker location problem under threshold Luce model,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102541,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The growth of e-commerce has created increasing complexity in logistics services. To remain competitive, logistics and e-commerce companies are exploring new modes as supplements to traditional home delivery, one of which is the self-service parcel locker. This paper studies a parcel locker location problem where a company plans to introduce the locker service by locating locker facilities to attract customers. The objective is to maximize the profit, accounting for the revenue and the cost of facilities, under the competition of other delivery modes. To estimate the revenue, we use the threshold Luce model (TLM) to predict customers’ likelihood of using the locker service. We then propose a combinatorial optimization model and develop exact solution methodologies that are practically implementable according to our extensive computational experiments. In effect, our modeling framework generalizes the traditional facility location problems based on the binomial logit model (BNL) and the multinomial logit model (MNL), both of which impose strong and strict assumptions on the customer’s choice sets. That is, they assume that the choice set will either contain only one facility or all facilities. In our numerical experiment, we demonstrate that using the BNL and the MNL could lead to, respectively, pessimistic and optimistic revenue estimation. Consequently, the suggested location decisions will be either conservative or aggressive. Our proposed model, by contrast, can effectively relax these assumptions. Our results also reveal that the aggressive decision due to the use of the MNL will incur an unnecessarily high facility cost that cannot be compensated by the additional revenue, leading to profit loss that could be significant in various scenarios. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis to shed light on how the relative attraction of locker services (compared to other delivery options) affects the location decisions and highlight the importance of calibrating the input parameters in TLM.",1366-5545,Not found
Financing equilibrium in a capital constrained supply Chain: The impact of credit rating,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102559,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"In this study, we investigate a supply chain comprising one well-funded supplier and one small-sized retailer with capital constraints. The supplier acts as a leader to distribute one newsvendor-type product via the retailer in the uncertain market demand. In the presence of capital shortages, the retailer has two different financing alternatives: bank financing and trade credit. Moreover, the small-sized retailer has an imperfect credit rating, which reflects the exogenous credit risk beyond the current supply chain transaction. By capturing both the demand risk and credit risk, we model each financing strategy and derive the optimal solutions. When both financing strategies are feasible, we prove that the retailer always benefits from bank financing, while the supplier’s preferences are determined by two critical factors (i.e., the retailer’s credit rating and the production cost). Considering that the supplier’s preferences are not always aligned with the retailer’s, we characterize a wholesale price Pareto zone, in which trade credit is the unique equilibrium. We further generalize our model to consider that the retailer with a positive initial budget, finding that the feasible regions of two financing formats shrink as the initial budget builds up. Interestingly, when the initial capital of the retailer is moderate (still capital shortages), we observe that trade credit is more likely to be the financing equilibrium if the retailer’s credit rating is low. These findings enrich our understanding of the impact of credit rating on financially constrained supply chain operational and financial decisions.",1366-5545,Not found
Does service quality influence operational and financial performance of third party logistics service providers? A mixed multi criteria decision making -text mining-based investigation,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102558,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Since its inception, the third party logistics (3PL) industry has remained an area of interest for academicians and practitioners. The existing literature mostly focuses on single multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method-based holistic performance evaluations of 3PL service providers, whereas distinct operational and financial performance measurements have not received enough attention. Several real-life examples of organizations, such as Hub Group and DSV, indicate that the reliance on financial performance improvement solely does not ensure better operational performance and integrated performance, and vice versa. Additionally, there is an absence of works that focus on designing an integrated MCDM methodology that applies multiple MCDM methods to increase the robustness of the methodology and consider distinct operational, financial, and integrated performance measurements of the 3PL service providers. Additionally, the application of emerging ratio analysis-based MCDM methods such as multi objective optimization based on ratio analysis (MOORA) and complex proportional assessment (COPRA) for performance evaluation has been ignored. Furthermore, the assessment of the service quality of 3PL service providers through their customers’ feedback and the association of this service quality with the abovementioned performance measures have not received enough attention. This motivates us to design a criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) weighting-based integrated MOORA-COPRA MCDM methodology for the performance evaluation of 3PL service providers. We apply our proposed methodology to evaluate the performance of 21 leading 3PL service providers in North America. Additionally, we incorporate text mining methods such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to analyze the effect of these service providers’ service quality captured through their customers’ reviews on distinct operational, financial, and integrated performance. The insights obtained from the study indicate that service quality (as captured from the consumer reviews) has a positive association with the operational and financial performance of 3PL service providers.",1366-5545,Not found

To this end, a mix-integer model and the customized DP-based heuristic are proposed to determine eco-oriented DRT routes and schedules. A series of numerical cases based on realistic road networks are designed to unfold the comparison of the performance of eco-oriented DRT against the traditional one.

Cost-reducing strategy or emission-reducing strategy? The choice of low-carbon decisions under price threshold subsidy,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102560,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Different from the traditional subsidy scheme previously studied, we explore the incentive of price threshold subsidy scheme (PTS) for the sustainable operation of automobile enterprises. A product differential model on gasoline vehicles (GVs) and battery energy vehicles (BEVs) is analyzed within a PTS mechanism. We examine and compare the economic and environmental effectiveness of two low-carbon strategies: BEV cost reduction (BCR) strategy and GV emission reduction (GER) strategy. The results indicate that the PTS forces the manufacturer to deploy three different pricing decisions based on BEV production costs. Raising the price threshold is a positive sign for the manufacturer. However, when the government implements the PTS policy mainly to increase BEV sales, blindly raising the price threshold under the medium-cost case will be counterproductive. Besides, the active BCR strategy can bring significant economic and environmental benefits compared to the strategy without cost investment. We unexpectedly find that high consumer environmental concerns trigger BCR strategy to generate greater cost advantages. But the BCR strategy is not always the optimal choice. When the initial carbon emissions of GV are low and the emission reduction efficiency is high enough, the GER strategy is more effective than the BCR strategy in terms of profit and total carbon emissions. And this advantage expands with the increase in BEV cost and emission-reducing subsidy.",1366-5545,Not found
Dynamic stochastic electric vehicle routing with safe reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102496,157,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Dynamic routing of electric commercial vehicles can be a challenging problem since besides the uncertainty of energy consumption there are also random customer requests. This paper introduces the Dynamic Stochastic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (DS-EVRP). A Safe Reinforcement Learning method is proposed for solving the problem. The objective is to minimize expected energy consumption in a safe way, which means also minimizing the risk of battery depletion while en route by planning charging whenever necessary. The key idea is to learn offline about the stochastic customer requests and energy consumption using Monte Carlo simulations, to be able to plan the route predictively and safely online. The method is evaluated using simulations based on energy consumption data from a realistic traffic model for the city of Luxembourg and a high-fidelity vehicle model. The results indicate that it is possible to save energy at the same time maintaining reliability by planning the routes and charging in an anticipative way.

Credit risk prediction of SMEs in supply chain finance by fusing demographic and behavioral data,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102611,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"The credit risk of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in supply chain finance (SCF) is defined as the probability that the SME would default on loans derived from financing for the SCF platform. Traditional models make use of merely the static data of SMEs, such as enterprise demographic data and financial statement data, to predict the credit risk of SMEs in SCF. Nevertheless, behavioral data, which reflect the dynamic financing behavior of SMEs in SCF, are overlooked by these models, which limits the performance of credit risk prediction. To address this problem, a novel approach is proposed called DeepRisk to fuse enterprise demographic data and financing behavioral data to predict the credit risk of SMEs in SCF. We adopt the multi-modal learning strategy to fuse the two different sources of data. The concatenated vectors derived from data fusion are then used as the input of the feed forward neural network to predict the credit risk of SMEs. Experiments on a real SCF dataset demonstrate that the proposed DeepRisk approach outperforms the baseline methods in credit risk prediction in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, area under curve (AUC), and economic loss. The fusion of the two different sources of data is superior to the existing approaches to the credit risk prediction of SMEs in SCF. Both the static enterprise demographic data and the dynamic financing behavioral data are crucial to improve the credit risk prediction of SMEs. Nevertheless, the variables derived from the financing behavioral data have a better predictability than those from the enterprise demographic data. Managerial implications have been identified for decision makers involved in SCF in utilizing the benefits of SCF and in managing their credit risks.",1366-5545,Not found

Unfolding the state of the adoption of connected autonomous trucks by the commercial fleet owner industry,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102616,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"This paper attempts to address two particular questions about the adoption of connected autonomous trucks (CATs) by trucking companies: (i) what are the factors affecting the decisions to adopt different levels of autonomous trucks? and (ii) how many with what sizes are the groups of CAT adopters? We employ choice modeling and latent-class cluster analysis (LCCA) to address the two questions. US companies working in the freight industry are contacted and 400 full responses are collected. The data is analyzed descriptively and detailed results of modeling efforts are presented and discussed. Focusing on the first question, companies view automation Level 2 not significantly different than Regular trucks. We observe that small-sized companies are more likely to adopt the higher levels of automation, and large companies may be willing to adopt only when the technology become more affordable. Cargo type is found to have some impact on the adoption: for example, companies carrying foodstuff are more likely to adopt higher levels of automation. Having promoters of new technologies in the company increases the likelihood of adoption and the impact is more visible for the higher levels of automation. Turning to the second question, our results indicate that there could be five categories of CAT adopters which is consistent with what the Theory of diffusion of Innovations (DOI) suggests. However, the sizes of the Innovators and Early Majority classes would respectively be four and two times of DOI’s general suggestion. Overall, it is speculated that the CAT adopter distribution may not be a bell-shaped curve but more of a right-skewed figure. This can be contributed to explicit financial benefits of CATs which could incentivize companies to adopt earlier.",1366-5545,Not found

We consider utility-maximising users and propose a mixed-integer programming formulation for a Chance Constrained DARP (CC-DARP), that captures users’ preferences via a Logit model.

Computational experiments performed on 105 benchmarking instances with up to 96 nodes yield average profit gaps of 2.59% and 0.17% using the proposed local search heuristic and matheuristic, respectively.

Scheduling on-site service deliveries to minimise the risk of missing appointment times,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102577,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"This paper studies the stochastic service task scheduling and vehicle routing problem for a telecommunication provider where each vehicle is driven by an engineer who performs service tasks at customer premises. There is an agreed time window for starting each service task. The service times and travel times are subject to uncertainties, e.g., task taking longer or shorter than expected, traffic situation causing delays. The problem is to schedule the tasks and route the vehicles to minimise the risks of missing appointment times. Models are presented to express the risks and describe the problem. Simulated annealing and tabu search are applied for generating an initial schedule of the day and for re-optimisation during the day based on real-time information updates. The study reported is based on the work in an industrial case. The stochastic nature of the travel times and durations of different task types as well as their distribution parameters have been obtained by applying data analytics on large sets of operations data. These are used in calculating the risks and in making scheduling and routing decisions. Real-time data updates sent back from the engineers are used for re-optimisation to adjust the schedule and routes so that the risks are kept at a lower level. Simulation results show that using risk minimisation as objective and re-optimisation during the day help enhance the on-time start of tasks.

The manufacturer decides the wholesale prices while the retailers decide the retail prices and their service effort levels. Considering three different timing scheme strategies based on the timing of firms’ pricing and service effort decisions, we show that the wholesale price-led timing scheme strategy—where the manufacturer takes the wholesale pricing decisions before the retailers announce their service effort levels and prices—produces a Pareto zone, in which all parties in the supply chain including the manufacturer, retailers, and consumers are better off. Moreover, we numerically validate the robustness of this result when there exists an asymmetric cross-effect of the service effort where the service efforts made by one retailer could influence the demand of the other retailer in an asymmetrical way.",1366-5545,Not found
Conflict-free scheduling of large-scale multi-load AGVs in material transportation network,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102623,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"The process of scheduling an automated guided vehicle (AGV) includes task scheduling, path planning, and traffic control management. The conflict-free scheduling of large-scale multi-load AGVs is a challenging problem in manufacturing logistics and transportation. To solve the problem of scheduling such AGVs in a network logistics system, this study proposes a method of task allocation based on adjacency combination and the shortest path principle. Three priority rules for the mobility of AGVs between nodes are designed, and a transportation strategy that combines single and two-way paths is proposed to reduce computational complexity. By combining with Dijkstra’s method, the authors develop a method to prevent deadlocks and collisions between multiple AGVs based on a timetable of reservations that hierarchically handles conflicts among nodes in multiple stages. Such constraints as AGV congestion or deadlock weaken the effectiveness of the shortest distance rule-based solution. Based on the above, a heuristic search method based on variable neighborhood search is further proposed to optimize the problem of multi-AGV task assignment, and a corresponding theorem is given to avoid the generation of unfeasible solutions by the neighborhood operators and improve the efficiency of the solution. The results of experiments show that the proposed method can adequately solve the problem of scheduling multiple AGVs in a large and dense network.",1366-5545,Not found

At the operational level, a new model for vehicle power consumption is suggested. In addition to mechanical power consumption, this model accounts for cabin climate control power, which is dependent on ambient temperature, and auxiliary power, which accounts for energy drawn by external devices. We formulate the problem of stochastic fleet size and mix optimization as a two-stage stochastic program and propose a sample average approximation based heuristic method to solve it. An adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is used for each operational period to determine the operational decisions and associated costs.

Consumer-to-consumer product exchanges for original fashion brands in the sharing economy: Good or bad for fashion knockoffs?,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102599,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"It is widely considered that the popularity of consumer-to-consumer product exchange (C2C-PE) can reduce customer’s demand for new products, which hurts original fashion brand’s sales and profit.

Taking a fresh perspective, we argue that C2C-PE can encourage knockoff customers to purchase original products because of the additional product exchange value. To validate this argument, we construct analytical models to explore the impacts of C2C-PE on the members of the fashion supply chain and the consumers. By comparing between the cases with C2C-PE and without C2C-PE, we theoretically find that the presence of C2C-PE benefits the original supply chain, its members and the consumers, while harms the knockoff supply chain, its members and the consumers.

A combined forecasting and packing model for air cargo loading: A risk-averse framework,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102579,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"In this paper, we present a combined forecasting and optimization decision-support tool to assist air cargo revenue management departments in the acceptance/rejection process of incoming cargo bookings. We consider the case of a combination airline and focus on the passenger aircraft belly capacity. The process is dynamic (bookings are received in a discrete fashion during the booking horizon) and uncertain (for some bookings the three dimensions are not provided, while the actual belly space available for cargo is only revealed a few hours before departure). Hence, analysts base decisions on historical data or human experience, which might yield sub-optimal or infeasible solutions due to the aforementioned uncertainties. We tackle them by proposing data-driven algorithms to predict available cargo space and shipment dimensions. A packing problem is solved sequentially once a new booking request is received, predicting shipment dimensions, if necessary, and considering the uncertainty of such prediction. The booking is accepted if it results in a feasible loading configuration where no previously accepted booking is offloaded. When applied in a deterministic context, our packing method outperformed the one used by the partner airline, increasing the loaded volume up to 20%. The framework was also tested assuming unknown shipment dimensions, comparing a risk-prone and a risk-averse strategy, with the latter accounting for uncertainty in dimension predictions and the former using mean values. While the average loaded volume decreases in the risk-averse case, the number of unplanned offloadings due to under-predicted dimensions decreases from 54% to 12% of the simulated cases, hence yielding a more robust acceptance strategy.",1366-5545,Not found
Locating park-and-ride facilities for resilient on-demand urban mobility,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102557,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Urban transport networks, yet essential, are frequently impacted by recurrent disruptions such as public transport failures, adverse weather or strikes. Flexible transit systems can be used to limit the impacts of recurrent disruptions on urban mobility. In this study, we examine the potential of on-demand park-and-ride systems to complement an existing transport infrastructure and improve network resilience. We formulate a stochastic park-and-ride facility location problem which captures the entire user trip chain from the origin to the destination via pick up and drop off nodes in a mobility network. We use a Logit model to capture users’ mode choice between paths in the park-and-ride system and a reserve travel option. Stochastic scenarios are used to represent varying traffic conditions to recurrent disruptions. The goal is to maximize the expected ridership in the park-and-ride system by identifying the optimal location of pick up and drop off facilities and accounting for users’ mode choice.

Inter-competitor outsourcing: On the advantages of profit and product launching time,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102581,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Currently, an increasing number of firms have begun to outsource production to/from firms that compete in common markets. This work shows the dual roles of inter-competitor outsourcing: it can improve both firms’ profits and alleviate conflicts between them in product launching time. Specifically, we establish an analytical model in which an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a contract manufacturer (CM) launch their respective products simultaneously or sequentially in the absence or presence of outsourcing. We incorporate the demand uncertainty of products and the demand information asymmetry between the firms, which may incentivize the less-informed firm to launch later to observe the other’s production quantity and speculate the true demand. We employ a multistage Bayesian game to analyze the issue and obtain managerial insights. First, we find that the OEM’s and CM’s timing preferences both qualitatively change once outsourcing is introduced and that outsourcing renders firms more likely to achieve a consensus on launching time while they never do this under no outsourcing. This is because outsourcing not only alleviates fierce quantity competition, which leads to a lower total output and a better equilibrium price under a duopoly, but also suppresses the less-informed firm’s benefit from the information acquired and the more-informed firm’s loss from information leakage, which makes both parties amenable to the outcome. Moreover, in terms of profitability, we find that both firms can benefit from outsourcing compared with no outsourcing and the benefit that each firm earns increases as it delays the launch of its product.",1366-5545,Not found

Pollution abatement using cap-and-trade in a dynamic supply chain and its coordination,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102592,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"We study a two-period supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, who participates in a cap-and-trade scheme and faces an uncertain emission permit price, and a retailer, who sells the product from the manufacturer to consumer and faces a price-sensitive demand. In the face of uncertain future permit prices, the manufacturer determines the wholesale price and pollution abatement in each period that reduces pollutants per unit of output one period later. We model the problem as a two-period Stackelberg game, obtain a feedback Stackelberg equilibrium, and investigate the effects of emissions trading on the manufacturer’s abatement investment, supply chain performance, and social welfare. We obtain a revenue-and-cost-sharing contract that coordinates the dynamic stochastic supply chain. We show that the abatement level increases in the permit price and decreases in its uncertainty. Moreover, the dirtier the supply chain is, the less is the effect of permit price and the more is the effect of its uncertainty. Both the manufacturer and the channel may benefit from the permit price uncertainty. For a dirty supply chain, a lower price and higher uncertainty intensify the double marginalization effect.

Finally, when the toxicity of pollutants is relatively low (high), the effect of emissions trading on social welfare might be stronger in a cleaner (dirtier) supply chain.",1366-5545,Not found
"Advance booking discount strategies: Competition, information transparency and spot market",10.1016/j.tre.2021.102589,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"We consider two competing risk-neutral firms (A and B) that can procure raw materials via a forward contract and in a volatile spot market. They produce seasonable products using perishable raw materials. The raw material spot price is affected by their trading behavior depending on the extent of the firms’ market powers. To attract consumers ordering products at a discount price in an advance selling period, Firm A offers an advance booking discount (ABD) strategy and updates the demand and spot price information from the pre-orders. The rival Firm B can either not obtain, partially obtain, or completely obtain pre-order information from Firm A, thereby resulting in information non-transparency, partial transparency, or full transparency, respectively. We initially examine the base case in which Firm A does not offer ABD. We then derive equilibrium solutions under the three cases of information transparency. We find that when the profit margin is high and firms have medium market powers, then Firm A should not offer ABD; otherwise, it should. With ABD, less transparency enables Firm A to set a higher price. Interestingly, the expected profit of Firm B, under certain circumstances, can be higher than in the base case even when Firm B cannot get any pre-order information. On the other hand, when firms have low market powers, partial transparency is profitable for Firm B; otherwise, full transparency is profitable.",1366-5545,Not found
The healthcare supply location-inventory-routing problem: A robust approach,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102588,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Motivated by a real-world healthcare supply case of a medical implant company, this paper studies a supply network configuration problem that integrates warehouse selections for vendor managed inventory (VMI), inventory policy, and delivery routing optimization together. The problem is a variant of the classic location-inventory-routing problem (LIRP) with both deterministic demand and uncertain demand, where multi-product, multi-period, multi-type delivery, delivery time limit and VMI are considered. Two types of delivery are used: one is the scheduled bulk delivery to the VMI warehouses and the other is direct shipping for hospitals. To address the problem, first, a deterministic MILP model is presented for the integrated LIRP. Then, to deal with the uncertainty in demand, we propose a robust optimization model and transform it into a tractable linear equivalent formulation. Further, considering the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the demand and delivery time, a new robust model is proposed to account for this special situation. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the advantage of the proposed robust optimization models. The sensitivity analysis provides some interesting managerial insights, and a real-world case of medical implant supply configuration with 78 hospitals is solved.",1366-5545,Not found
The effects of leadership in Clean Development Mechanism low-carbon operations,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102575,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is an international carbon trading mechanism linking Annex I (industrialized) countries to non-Annex I (developing) countries. This paper conducts a research that an investor from an Annex I country provides a clean technology to a host firm in a non-Annex I country to achieve carbon permits which are sold back to the Annex I countries. By developing an investor-as-leader model and a host-as-leader model, this paper investigates how investment levels, prices, and profits are influenced by different leaderships. It is found that although an investor can drive the carbon reduction project and benefit from its power in CDM, the host firm always prefers to be the leader while the investor may prefer to be the follower if the customers are sufficiently green-sensitive. A high green sensitivity improves the cooperation level and helps the two parties reach an agreement in terms of leadership. Also, the designed coordination mechanisms can effectively improve the system’s performance. Further, over intervention by the host government would result in adverse effects on the CDM technology investment and profits.",1366-5545,Not found
Analyzing product greening spillovers in multi-product markets,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102586,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Documented cases of sustainable initiatives of firms show that green efforts in one market often have spillover effects on other markets. The critical question is, how do firms harness and respond to such market spillovers. To answer this, the paper examines two settings where, a firm operates in two different markets with spillovers and secondly, where it faces marketplace competition. Spillovers can be positive or negative. Using an analytical approach, the paper examines pricing and greening strategies of a firm in these scenarios, conducts market comparisons, and examines specific conditions where the firm may not invest in greening. The findings show that under the threat of spillovers from competitor’s green efforts, a focal firm increases its greening efforts and prices. Further, the absence of consumer green sensitivity in the primary market does not deter a firm from greening, if spillovers exist. Under negative spillovers, a firm can still invest in positive green efforts if the negative spillover effect is below a threshold. However, under competitive threat, a firm may lose competitive advantage as its competitor (with positive green spillovers), increases its greening efforts to compete in both the markets.",1366-5545,Not found
An updated review on blood supply chain quantitative models: A disaster perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102583,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"After the occurrence of a disaster, relief operations are needed to help survivors and injured people. Among the relief commodities required for affected areas, blood products are critically important because a shortage can threaten the lives of injured people. Accordingly, the blood supply chain (BSC) in disaster situations has been a growing area of research focus in recent years. Indeed, there has been an increase in the number of papers published on BSCs since 2018, and most of these papers relate to disaster situations. Meanwhile, the most recent review paper on BSCs explicitly excluded disaster situations. Consequently, in the current paper we present a state-of-the-art review of quantitative models for BSCs whose main theme is disaster situations. Our review design is based on a taxonomy from a 2015 review paper. A detailed analysis on solution methods is also presented. In addition, we highlight both the academic research gap as well as the requirements of health system and relief organizations to provide practical directions for future research. Naturally, although we designed a comprehensive procedure for exploring papers, it is possible that some papers have been missed due to our search strategy and this should be considered as a limitation of the current research.",1366-5545,Not found
The developer's sourcing strategy in the presence of a competing manufacturer and consumers’ two-dimensional differentiated preferences,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102594,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Integrating a technology platform into a hardware device creates a new platform hardware business model. This study presents a model for the exploration of the technology platform developer’s sourcing strategy and the response of a competing manufacturer who produces hardware devices when facing consumers’ differentiated preferences for the product across two dimensions: the hardware device and the operating system (OS, a typical technology platform). The developer possesses three types of sourcing strategies: producing in-house, outsourcing to a competing manufacturer (CM), and outsourcing to a non-competing manufacturer (NM). We find that the level of OS quality plays a critical role for the developer in determining which sourcing strategy to choose. Specifically, the developer chooses to produce in-house when the OS quality is high and outsource to the NM when this quality is low. The prerequisite for outsourcing to the CM is moderate OS quality and low preference differences between the devices. The CM cannot benefit from outsourcing to the NM, but may benefit from the developer’s in-house production, which is dependent on the OS quality. The Pareto zone occurs only when the developer outsources to the CM for a moderate OS quality. For an endogenous OS quality, it is never optimal for the developer to outsource to the CM when consumers have a moderate differential preference for the device. Interestingly, the developer’s in-house production may bring a higher profit for the CM when consumers’ differential preference for OS quality is low and the unit production cost is high. A low unit production cost is a prerequisite for the two parties achieving a win–win situation. Several extensions further strengthen the robustness of the basic model. Finally, we discuss the implications of the sourcing strategies for managers.",1366-5545,Not found
Managing bottleneck congestion with tradable credits under asymmetric transaction cost,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102600,158,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Tradable credit schemes (TCS) have been promoted as an alternative to congestion pricing in recent years. Most existing TCS studies assume a frictionless trading market that incurs zero transaction cost. In this study, we propose to examine how transaction cost, taking the form of brokerage fee charged by a TCS operator for the deal-matching service, impacts the performance of TCS in the context of morning commute. Unlike the existing studies, the brokerage fee is assumed to be proportional to the transaction value and asymmetrically split between buyers and sellers. Using the bottleneck model, the optimal TCS design is first obtained for the case of homogeneous commuters and asymmetric transaction cost. We also derive the conditions that ensure Pareto-improving for commuters and financial self-sufficiency for the operator. The latter means the brokerage fee can cover the operator’s cost. These analytical results are then extended to cases considering user heterogeneity—which allows commuters to have different values of times (VOT) and desired arrival times at the workplace—and coarse charging design. Among other things, we find that an asymmetric fee structure is better for system performance when buyers bear a higher share of the transaction cost.",1366-5545,Not found
In pursuit of supplier resilience: The explanatory role of customer leadership style,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102626,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Supply chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Given that most supply chain disruptions occur because of first-tier suppliers, the need to examine supplier resilience in supply chain relationships cannot be overstated. However, our understanding of how customers can engage with their suppliers and facilitate supplier resilience in their relationships is rather curbed. We examine the role of customer leadership styles in inciting supplier extra-role behaviors, such as relational flexibility and relationship-specific investments, by fostering supplier trust, which can then abet supplier resilience. We test our hypotheses using survey data collected from 207 U.S. firms while ensuring our model and findings are relevant to practice through interviews with high-level executives at several Fortune-1000 firms. We find that a customer’s leadership style enhances a supplier’s trust in the customer. Subsequently, the supplier might demonstrate relational flexibility and relationship-specific investments. While relational flexibility enhances supplier resilience, relationship-specific investments might limit the supplier’s alternatives to remedy a disruptive situation and impede its resilience towards its customer. Our study contributes to academic research and practice by showing that a customer can utilize its leadership style to enhance supplier resilience within the specific customer–supplier relationship. Nevertheless, if the mechanism to promote supplier resilience is not clearly understood, a customer’s leadership style might backfire.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal dual cycling operations in roll-on roll-off terminals,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102646,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Roll-on roll-off (RoRo) shipping plays an important role in freight transport on the European continent, and is faced with the challenge of reducing its CO 2 emissions while increasing its efficiency. Dual cycling, in which loading and discharging processes are carried out simultaneously, achieves this goal by reducing the turnaround time of vessels in port and thus the CO 2 output of handling equipment in port and fuel consumption through slow steaming at sea. Optimizing the dual cycling operations on RoRo vessels has not yet been investigated in the literature. This paper presents the novel RoRo dual cycling problem (RRDCP), and formulates it using integer programming (IP) with the objective to minimize the total makespan of discharging and loading operations. We further prove that the RRDCP is NP-complete by a reduction from a general machine scheduling problem, and introduce a novel heuristic to solve the problem called a generalized random key algorithm (GRKA). We evaluate the IP model and GRKA approach on both generated and industrial instances, showing that the GRKA heuristic finds optimal or near-optimal solutions to real-world problems in just seconds. We provide managerial insights on industrial instances, which indicate that our approach leads to a reduction in fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions of up to 25% for RoRo operations.",1366-5545,Not found
The ground handler dock capacitated pickup and delivery problem with time windows: A collaborative framework for air cargo operations,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102603,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"We study a typical problem within the air cargo supply chain, concerning the transportation of standard Unit Load Devices (ULDs) from freight forwarders’ to ground handlers’ warehouses. First, ULDs are picked up by a set of available trucks at the freight forwarders’ premises within a time window. Next, they are delivered to the ground handlers, also within a time window, and discharged according to a Last In First Out (LIFO) policy. Due to space constraints, ground handlers have limited capacity to serve the trucks and waiting times may arise, especially in case freight forwarders do not coordinate their operations. Therefore, in this paper we consider a cooperative framework where this transportation is coordinated by a central planner. The goal of the planner is to find a proper routing and scheduling that minimizes the sum of the transportation and waiting times at the ground handlers’ warehouses, while satisfying the capacity of the trucks. We propose two mathematical formulations, one based on the routing and the other based on the packing aspect of the problem. To solve large instances of the problem, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm is also developed. With numerical experiments, we compare the performances of the two models and the metaheuristic, and we quantify the benefits of the proposed framework to reduce waiting times.",1366-5545,Not found
Joint initial dispatching of official responders and registered volunteers during catastrophic mass-casualty incidents,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102648,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"A catastrophic mass-casualty incident results in a high number of casualties and demands the sudden mobilization of emergency medical services in a short while. It typically overwhelms the capacity of official first responders from the local emergency response system. With the advancement of GPS technology to map real-time positions, registered volunteers in the community could be a valuable addition to complement the official resources. In this paper, we propose an optimization model to aid in the initial dispatch of official responders and registered volunteers. We discuss how this model can be integrated with the existing registered volunteer management tools (e.g., databases and smart phone applications) to generate an upgraded emergency responder dispatching workflow for field practices. We model uncertainty in model parameters through different scenarios. Our objective is to maximize both the expected number of served victims across all scenarios and the minimum (worst-case) percentage of served victims among all scenarios.

A decision support system for prioritised COVID-19 two-dosage vaccination allocation and distribution,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102598,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This study proposes a decision support system (DSS) that integrates GIS, analytics, and simulation methods to help develop a priority-based distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in a large urban setting. The methodology applies novel hierarchical heuristic-simulation procedures to create a holistic algorithm for prioritising the process of demand allocation and optimising vaccine distribution. The Melbourne metropolitan area in Australia with a population of over five million is used as a case study. Three vaccine supply scenarios, namely limited, excessive, and disruption, were formulated to operationalise a two-dose vaccination program. Vaccine distribution with hard constraints were simulated and then further validated with sensitivity analyses. The results show that vaccines can be prioritised to society’s most vulnerable segments and distributed using the current logistics network with 10 vehicles. Compared with other vaccine distribution plans with no prioritisation, such as equal allocation of vaccines to local government areas based on population size or one on a first-come-first-serve basis, the plans generated by the proposed DSS ensure prioritised vaccination of the most needed and vulnerable population. The aim is to curb the spread of the infection and reduce mortality rate more effectively. They also achieve vaccination of the entire population with less logistical resources required. As such, this study contributes to knowledge and practice in pandemic vaccine distribution and enables governments to make real-time decisions and adjustments in daily distribution plans.

A simulation–optimization framework for a dynamic electric ride-hailing sharing problem with a novel charging strategy,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102615,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are more environmentally friendly than gasoline vehicles (GVs). To reduce environmental pollution caused by ride-hailing gasoline vehicles (RGVs), they have been gradually replaced with ride-hailing electric vehicles (REVs). Like RGVs, REVs can allow passengers to share trips with others. However, REVs are plagued by charging needs in daily operations. This study develops a simulation–optimization framework for the dynamic electric ride-hailing sharing problem. This problem integrates a dynamic electric ride-hailing matching problem (with sharing) and a dynamic REV charging problem, both of which aim to match REVs to passengers willing to share their trips with others and schedule the charging events of REVs on temporal and spatial scales, respectively. The dynamic electric ride-hailing matching problem is divided into a set of electric ride-hailing matching subproblems by a rolling horizon approach without a look-ahead period, while the dynamic REV charging problem is divided into a set of REV charging subproblems by a rolling horizon approach with look-ahead periods. Each REV charging subproblem incorporates a novel charging strategy to determine the charging schedules of REVs and relieve the charging anxiety by considering the information of requests, REVs, and charging stations. Each REV charging subproblem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), whereas each electric ride-hailing matching subproblem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). The MINLP and MILP are solved by the artificial bee colony algorithm and CPLEX, respectively. The proposed simulation–optimization framework includes a simulation model which is used to mimic the operations of REVs and update and track the state of passengers and the charging processes at charging stations over time using the outputs of each MILP and MINLP. The results show that the proposed charging strategy outperforms the benchmarks with a shorter waiting time for charging and a higher matching percentage in the dynamic ride-hailing matching problem. The robustness of the proposed charging strategy is tested under different scenarios with changing the initial state of charge (SOC), the number of REVs, the number of charging piles at each charging station, the time to fully charge, and the distribution of charging piles. The results show that REV drivers can charge their vehicles more flexibly without waiting too long and then pick up more passengers under all test scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found
By-state fairness in selling to the newsvendor,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102634,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Previous studies assume that the decision makers under supply chain contracting built on the newsvendor problem have by-expectation fairness concerns, that is, an aversion to the inequality of expected profits. However, recent experimental data show that they are actually averse to the inequality of profits at each demand realization, which is referred to as by-state fairness concerns. This paper examines how by-state fairness concerns (only disadvantageous inequality aversion) influence the equilibrium outcomes under a selling-to-the-newsvendor model. Compared with the fairness-neutral case, while the retailer’s concern for by-expectation fairness (only disadvantageous inequality aversion) can improve supply chain performance, his strong concern for by-state fairness can worsen it. In particular, when demand variance is large, the retailer can earn less for by-state fairness concerns. Similar to by-expectation fairness, the supplier’s by-state fairness concerns can hurt both her and the retailer. The supplier’s profit decreases with demand variance, whereas the retailer’s expected profit is nonmonotone with it. When both supply chain agents care about by-state fairness, compared with the fairness-neutral case, the supplier’s profit decreases, whereas the retailer’s expected profit can either increase or decrease. The region where the retailer earns more will shrink in either the supplier’s disadvantageous inequality parameter or demand variance.",1366-5545,Not found
Strategic inventory in the presence of socially responsible dual distribution channels,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102604,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper examines how strategic inventory affects pricing decisions and contractual outcomes of a dual-channel supply chain with the consideration of corporate social responsibility. To highlight the role of CSR, we first extend the existing understanding of dual-channel supply chain dynamics to a for-profit dynamic setting. Thereafter, we analyze two cases where either the retailer or the supplier may be socially responsible. We find that although the presence of dual distribution arrangements can suppress retailer strategic inventory buildup, it may also lead to the retailer preferring the dynamic contract even for a sufficiently high holding cost, which is not the case in the single channel. We further show that the retailer’s strategic inventory decision is influenced by the level of social concern, supplier’s direct selling efficiency, and inventory holding cost. The retailer’s (supplier’s) social concern increases (decreases) the strategic inventory quantity, which significantly alters the contractual outcomes of the dual-channel supply chain. Interestingly, we find that although either channel member’s social concern or strategic inventory can alleviate double-marginalization effect, their interference may result in lower firm profit and supply chain inefficiency.",1366-5545,Not found
Inferring passenger responses to urban rail disruptions using smart card data: A probabilistic framework,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102628,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This study proposes a probabilistic framework to infer passengers’ responses to unplanned urban rail service disruptions using smart card data in tap-in-only public transit systems. We first identify 19 possible response behaviors that passengers may have based on their decision-making times and locations (i.e, the stage of their trips when an incident happened), including transferring to a bus line, canceling trips, waiting, delaying departure time, etc. A probabilistic model is proposed to estimate the mean and variance of the number of passengers in each of the 19 behavior groups using passengers’ smart card transactions. The 19 behavioral responses can be categorized from two aspects. From the behavioral aspect, they can be grouped into 5 aggregated response behaviors including using bus, using rail (changing or not changing route), not using public transit, and not being affected. The inference of the 19 behaviors can be classified into four cases based on the information used (historical trips vs. subsequent trips) and the context of the observed transactions (direct incident-related vs. indirect incident-related). The public transit system (bus and urban rail) of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) is used as a case study based on a real-world rail disruption incident. The model is applied with both synthetic data and real-world data. Results with synthetic data show that the proposed approach can estimate passengers’ behavior well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the estimated expected number of passengers in each behavior group is 20.5%, which outperforms the rule-based benchmark method (60.3%). The estimation results with real-world data are consistent with the incident’s context.

Estimation of truck origin-destination flows using GPS data,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102621,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Large trucking vehicles have a comparatively more significant impact on safety, traffic congestion, pollution, and pavement wear than passenger vehicles. Appropriate planning and operation of truck movement are necessary to reduce these impacts. While heavy truck movement has traditionally been measured through surveys, these remain limited because they are costly and time-consuming. In this study, we propose the use of large streams of GPS data to estimate truck origin–destination flows. Large streams of GPS data have typically been difficult to use as they lack descriptors for key events during a trip unless the data is accompanied by travel diaries. We address this problem by developing a heuristic-based approach to identify the key events, such as truck stops, trips, and other trucking activities. Then, a Pearson correlation coefficient and an entropy measure are applied to compare trucks’ mobility patterns and to determine whether changes in trucks travel patterns have occurred over one year. Finally, we use a multinomial logit structure to estimate destination choice models for five time periods. This research provides a strong case study of how GPS data can be used along with outputs of existing travel demand model (a model created with data collected using traditional techniques) to estimate origin–destination and destination choice models of truck movement in a provincial model setting.",1366-5545,Not found

Maintenance of the maritime infrastructure is vital to the operations of the transportation system. This paper studies a strategic-level maritime infrastructure asset management problem: multi-year planning of navigation channel maintenance dredging and dredged material management. A mathematical model called dredging planning optimization model (DPOM) is developed to optimize channel dredging planning and dredged material management in confined disposal facilities (CDFs), accounting for practical constraints and considerations, including channel linkage and dependency, channel bundling, CDF accessibility and capacity, shoaling and navigability deterioration over time, reimbursable costs, channel economic values, etc. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, with the objective of maximizing the total economic-value-weighted average navigability under fixed budget. The model can be reformulated as an equivalent mixed integer programming (MIP) model, which can be solved by the CPLEX solver, using the branch and bound algorithm. A heuristic algorithm called the dynamic planning prioritization (DPP) algorithm, is proposed in order to solve large-scale problems due to the computational complexity. DPP incorporates a dynamic ranking criterion to overcome the challenge of simultaneously handling all of the practical constraints and considerations, as well as the impact of channel prioritization on future year decisions. Finally, a real-world case study is proposed to illustrate the model results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MIP model and the DPP algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found

Pricing strategy of ride-sourcing services under travel time variability,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102631,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Ride-sourcing services are burgeoning urban mobility services provided by transportation network companies (TNCs), consisting of non-pooling service and ride-pooling service. By receiving online orders and offering efficient door-to-door services, ride-sourcing services are becoming popular alternatives to public transit. Meanwhile, unignorable travel time variability influences passengers’ travel behavior and TNC’s pricing strategy. To investigate the effect of travel time variability, this paper proposes a bi-level framework. The mode choice of passengers, zone choice of searching drivers and the subsequent route choice traffic equilibrium in a transportation network is formulated as the lower level. And the upper level investigates the optimal pricing strategy. In the network formulation, passengers encounter variability of waiting time, detour time and highway travel time. Two pricing strategies are proposed to accommodate the risk of unsuccessful pairing. Pricing strategy 1 charges a fixed price even when a ride-pooling request becomes a non-pooling service due to unsuccessful pairing; whereas pricing strategy 2 increases the price of a ride-pooling request to that of non-pooling service if pairing is unsuccessful. The results show that pricing strategy 1 produces more profit and induces more ride-pooling demand. In addition, under more reliable traffic conditions, the optimal prices for ride-sourcing services are higher and the network travel time decreases. The results illustrate the influence of travel time variability on the ride-sourcing market and provide guidance on the company’s pricing strategy regarding a network under travel time variability.",1366-5545,Not found
Departure time choice equilibrium and tolling strategies for a bottleneck with continuous scheduling preference,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102644,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper develops a bottleneck model with continuous scheduling preference (CSP), which assumes that the unit cost of schedule delay penalty functions have continuously linear forms. In particular, the unit cost of schedule delay early is non-increasing with respect to arrival time, while the unit cost of schedule delay late is non-decreasing with respect to arrival time. We analyze the departure time choice equilibrium of commuters and find that the proposed bottleneck model with CSP is capable of eliminating the discontinuity of the departure rate curve, which occurs in the bottleneck model with discontinuous scheduling preference (DSP). In addition, the first-best and second-best congestion tolling strategies are designed in the bottleneck model with CSP. The analytical closed-form solutions of the bottleneck model with CSP under the time-varying toll, single-step coarse toll and multi-step toll are obtained and their effects on system performance are investigated. Finally, numerical examples are developed to illustrate the properties of the proposed models. Results shed light into the necessity of considering CSP in travel behavior analysis and congestion management. The ignorance of CSP can lead to overestimate of commuters’ bottleneck queuing time and the total system travel cost (TSTC), which finally reduces the efficiency of congestion tolling strategies.",1366-5545,Not found
Train platforming and rescheduling with flexible interlocking mechanisms: An aggregate approach,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102622,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper proposes a route-based model for the Train Platforming and Rescheduling Problem (TPRP). Built on the concept of Degree of Conflict (DOC), the proposed model can accommodate various interlocking mechanisms with an aggregate railway yard representation. Thanks to the topology of a typical yard, such an aggregate representation promises to reduce the size of the optimization problems concerning yard operations. The TPRP model is formulated as a mixed integer linear program, and solved using both a commercial solver and two heuristic algorithms developed based on the idea of rolling horizon. The proposed model and algorithms are validated using several case studies constructed using data collected at a large high-speed railway station in China. We find the proposed TPRP model can produce, with reasonable computation resources, high quality platform/schedule decisions for real-world applications. In addition, the heuristic algorithms consistently offer high quality approximate solutions at a computational cost considerably lower than what is demanded by a benchmark commercial solver. The results from a simulation model show the differences between various interlocking mechanisms are well captured using a unified aggregate yard representation based on DOC. As expected, more flexible interlocking mechanisms can achieve greater operational efficiency at the expense of looser safety standards.",1366-5545,Not found
Transport service selection and routing with carbon emissions and inventory costs consideration in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102630,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) entails investments to improve overland (rail) transport between Europe and China. This paper introduces a microscopic Multi-Commodity Flow Service Selection Problem for freight transport under the BRI and provides a decision tool for shippers to make door-to-door service plans. The minimizing objective function considers transportation costs, in-transit inventory costs, and carbon emissions. A series of sampled data of each provincial region of China are collected from Chinese multimodal transport operators. Results show that inland regions are strongly attracted to the rail mode for shipments to Europe. However, the “last mile” (including “first mile”) transport from the shipper to the long-haul transport terminal strongly influences this choice, and carbon emissions are strongly influenced by the available last mile transport links. Under the dual impact of in-transit inventory and carbon emission costs, regions that prefer rail to maritime are much further east than suggested by previous literature.",1366-5545,Not found
Rest break policy comparison for heavy vehicle drivers in Australia,10.1016/j.tre.2021.102518,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Carriers and postal companies are under increasing pressure to reduce their operating costs and increase efficiency. One way to reduce costs is to improve the utilisation of drivers’ working hours by employing more efficient rest break policies. A rest break policy is a restrictive set of rules consistent with national regulations for hours of service. We develop and validate a novel framework to model and analyse a class of these policies that concern the location of the rest breaks. In particular, we compare two representative rest break policies using data from a major Australian postal carrier. The first policy imposes no restriction on the location of a rest break. The second policy requires the driver to return to a depot for rest taking allowing time for socialising and making use of full amenities. Using postal transport data from Sydney metropolitan area, we find that the difference between the two policies in terms of tour length is only over 1%. We further apply the proposed framework to assess the impact of increasing the minimum break time on the two representative policies.",1366-5545,Not found
Asymmetric retailers’ sales effort competition in the presence of a manufacturer's help,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102625,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"In this study, we build a game theory model to examine whether two asymmetric retailers exert sales effort in the face of a manufacturer’s help with cost-sharing and direct investment strategies and examine the effects of sales effort competition and help strategy on operational decisions and channel member profits. The retailers make sales effort decisions based on the manufacturer’s choice of assisting one or both asymmetric retailers. We discover that helping both parties induces the weak retailer to exert a high level of effort, whereas helping neither results in a low level of effort. The dominant retailer experiences the opposite outcome. When the dominant retailer does not exert sales effort, the weak retailer will set a high retail price. Furthermore, the manufacturer’s assistance may reduce the incentive of the retailers to exert sales effort and investment in sales effort is determined by their cost differences and the efficiency of the manufacturer’s assistance. Moreover, when no retailer exerts sales effort, the manufacturer will only assist the weak retailer in achieving a higher profit margin. When at least one retailer exerts sales effort, the manufacturer can always benefit from assisting the retailers. However, even if the dominant retailer has more channel power, it may not be optimal for the manufacturer to assist the dominant retailer.",1366-5545,Not found

This paper addresses past research gap by treating FTG as a joint package decision and proposing a multivariate ordered response system that allows error correlations capturing the underlying interdependencies. Study findings reveal the presence of complementary and substitution effects between freight trip decisions, and the additional computation burden resulting from the simultaneous model estimation appears to be justified for improving the logistical foundations of FTG models.",1366-5545,Not found
One-way carsharing service design under demand uncertainty: A service reliability-based two-stage stochastic program approach,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102624,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This study proposes a two-stage stochastic program approach to jointly optimize the planning and operational decisions for one-way carsharing systems accounting for demand uncertainty. The two-stage stochastic model is constructed in the way that stage-one determines the strategic deployments, including the number of vehicles, personnel and parking lots at each carsharing station, which is referred to as the regular service. Upon the realization of the random demand, stage-two solves the ad hoc service and optimizes vehicle relocation and personnel assignment at the operational level. The ad hoc service is integrated into the model, which serves the excess demand that cannot be covered by the regular service. For computational efficiency, we introduce the concept of service reliability (SR) to decompose the original two-stage stochastic formulation into separable sub-problems. A SR-based gradient solution procedure is then applied to efficiently solve the problem. The performance of the proposed model and algorithm is demonstrated with numerical experiments on a toy and a realistic network. Sensitivity analysis on demand variations and ad hoc service costs is further conducted to evaluate impacts of these key factors on the system performance. Results show that up to 20.49% improvement in the profit can be achieved by the proposed stochastic approach compared to the solution obtained from the historical average model.",1366-5545,Not found
Coordination of a supply chain with Nash bargaining fairness concerns,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102627,159,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This study incorporates fairness concerns in a dual-channel supply chain where a single manufacturer sells its product to consumers through a single retailer. The objective is to investigate the implication of fairness in conjunction with channel coordination and contracting mechanisms. To this end, we develop a game-theoretic utility model where the Nash bargaining fairness reference is leveraged to capture the impact of fairness preference on three widely used contracting mechanisms—wholesale price, buy-back, and revenue-sharing. First, we derive the optimal order quantity for both centralized and decentralized channels, and show that channel coordination is easier than that under a conventional channel when the retailer is more concerned about fairness, and his bargaining power is not strong. Second, for buy-back and revenue-sharing contracts, we acquire the equilibrium wholesale price to achieve supply chain coordination. Our analysis shows that the implication of fairness-concerns of channel members can enhance the whole supply chain performance to some extent, especially, when the manufacturer is more concerned about fairness and the bargaining power is sufficiently strong, or the retailer is more concerned with fairness and the bargaining power is relatively weak. Finally, numerical studies are conducted to quantify the impact of the fairness concerns and retailer’s bargaining power on the coordination performance, the equilibrium wholesale price, and the channel efficiency. Some useful managerial insights are provided. For example, when the buy-back and revenue-sharing coordination contracts are employed, the fairness concerns could improve the channel performance under certain conditions.",1366-5545,Not found
Multi-rhythm control for heterogeneous traffic and road networks in CAV environments,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102672,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Heterogeneity is widely observed in various aspects of urban transport, such as road types, vehicle dynamics, and demand patterns, which greatly complexifies transport systems and hinders the successful control and management of traffic. On one hand, intelligent strategies are required to relieve the loss of efficiency caused by the mixed traffic flow composed of vehicles with different speeds; on the other hand, the spatial heterogeneity of travel demand distribution requires pertinent control schemes to improve the network-level mobility and the phenomenon of oversaturation under heavy traffic also demands an appropriate way to resolve. Leveraging the advantages of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology, this study proposes a multi-rhythm control (MRC) scheme to accommodate heterogeneous network traffic in a CAV environment with 100% penetration rate. While the rhythmic control (RC) proposed by (Lin et al., 2021) could organize traffic efficiently and in an orderly manner, the multi-rhythm strategy has greater potential to not only improve the efficiency of heterogeneous traffic by the design of different virtual platoons (VPs) catering to different vehicle types, but also address the spatial heterogeneity of network traffic by implementing differentiated cycle lengths among the road network. For the optimal design of the MRC scheme, a two-step model is developed to minimize the total travel cost, where the first step focuses on the mesoscopic level to jointly optimize the multi-rhythm scheme, VP design and lane configuration for both undersaturated and oversaturated cases, while the second step focuses on the microscopic design to optimize the space–time trajectories of VPs under the premise of collision free. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are conducted to test the performances of the MRC scheme compared to a naive version of RC with a homogeneous rhythm and a traffic signal control (TSC) strategy. The results show that among all control strategies, the MRC scheme has the best performance under all kinds of demand patterns, which is reflected in both the lowest travel cost and the highest network throughput.",1366-5545,Not found
Data-driven robust dual-sourcing inventory management under purchase price and demand uncertainties,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102671,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"We develop an actionable data-driven approach to a periodic-review dual sourcing inventory management system in the presence of purchase price and demand uncertainties. The two supply sources differ in their lead times and prices due to, e.g., different transportation modes. We adopt robust optimization because the limited historical data is insufficient to construct meaningful distributions to characterize purchase price and demand fluctuations. Specifically, we build a robust rolling-horizon model and, in particular, construct the uncertainty sets from data and business insights. Using a real four-year data set, we show that our approach can yield significant cost savings compared to the other popular methods. Our experiments echo the earlier theoretical finding that a firm may incur a lower cost under a more volatile purchase price process. However, we find that under data-driven decision-making, in comparison with the theoretical results that assume complete distributional information, some interesting results arise. For example, first, considering a longer planning horizon may backfire. Second, some feasible region-reducing business constraints such as limited inventory capacity may lead to unintended benefits. These are consequences of protecting model performance from sampling error and our practically limited forecast ability, as almost always, to characterize uncertainties. Our research therefore calls for prudence in extending theoretical insights to data-driven decision-making scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found
Channel competition and collaboration in the presence of hybrid retailing,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102658,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"This paper studies the channel choice problem in an e-retailing market when a reseller and an agency seller are experimenting with a new format, i.e., a hybrid retailing strategy. Under this strategy, the reseller not only sells products to consumers directly, but also expands the market in collaboration with the agency seller who operates a platform. However, the motivation and effectiveness of this strategy are not clear. Therefore, we develop game-theoretic models to investigate retail and wholesale prices, and the equilibrium channel choice. First, we find that the hybrid retailing strategy results in a higher retail price for the reseller; in contrast, the agency seller prefers to reduce the retail price when the fraction of market demand through the hybrid retailing channel is large. Second, we find that the hybrid retailing strategy can benefit all stakeholders when the fraction of market demand through the hybrid retailing channel is small. Third, under a dual retailing channel with price competition, a reseller and an agency seller are still willing to collaborate through a hybrid retailing strategy, because the cost of market expansion caused by this strategy is partly transferred to the manufacturer. Our results can provide meaningful decision support and operational rules for stakeholders to make strategic retail decisions.",1366-5545,Not found

We find that a less risk-averse creator should choose a high-price high-financing-target strategy when backer warm-glow effect is strong, or vice versa. The creator should only target at backers who have high project valuation when there is a large variation among backer valuation, and should target at all potential backers when the variation is small. In addition, we also explore the impacts of backer risk aversion. We reveal that the creator can only select a low-price low-financing-target strategy when the overall backer risk-aversion is high. However, the creator is not restricted to the low-price low-financing-target strategy when the overall risk-aversion is low. Last, by formulating the problem as a Stackelberg game with the platform acting as the game leader and the creator as the follower, the platform’s optimal cultivation level is derived.

Service trip generation modeling in urban areas,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102649,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Using modeling techniques as Ordinary Least Squares-OLS, this paper studies the main variables that affect service trip generation (STG) (production and attraction) by the service sector (e.g., maintenance, repairs) in commercial establishments located in urban areas of developing countries. Data obtained from Medellin Metropolitan Area (Colombia) origin–destination freight surveys conducted in 2017–2018 were used to analyze service trips for the first time in the region. This helped determine the number of produced and attracted service trips, average duration per service, most used modes of transport in service trips, and other characteristics that improve the understanding of how service trips work in urban areas This information might help in analyses of variables that mainly influence STG. To this effect, the authors estimated more than 30 service trip production and attraction models for establishments; these models depend on independent variables, such as employment, and establishment’s area.

"Optimal decisions of modularity, prices and return policy in a dual-channel supply chain under mass customization",10.1016/j.tre.2022.102675,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Online customization is very popular among consumers in current e-commerce because of its flexible customization time and diverse product attributes. This paper establishes a dual-channel supply chain composed of one manufacturer and one retailer under mass customization. The manufacturer sells standard products offline via the retailer when providing modular customized products online. Two online distribution strategies of the manufacturer are considered: The manufacturer can choose direct or agency sales through the retailer’s online channel. Additionally, the return policy of modular customized products available online is explored. A Stackelberg game model is proposed under each return scenario (with and without online consumer returns) to derive the optimal solutions for different channel strategies. Then, the influence of different parameters on the optimal modularity level and product prices is investigated under each model. Through sensitivity analysis, we found that the cross-price sensitivity coefficient of dual channels has a considerably positive impact on optimal decisions. Furthermore, the manufacturer’s channel strategy and return policy decisions are examined. The result indicates that direct sales should be chosen if manufacturers’ online channel operating costs are lower than a certain threshold that increases with the revenue allocation ratio under agency sales. When the market demand of the product that is allowed to be returned is much more sensitive to the refund than its return quantity, a full refund policy should be offered for online customized products. These conclusions also apply to the return scenario where full refunds are provided for both standard and customized products.",1366-5545,Not found

The performance of the approach is compared to existing practices of the online container relocation using a case study involving an operational Japanese container terminal. A rule-based heuristic for the online container relocation problem is formulated and compared to our proposed optimization approach. Taking into account a number of essential practical aspects, including trucking company preferences, container delivery schedules, yard capacity, and appointment levels, our proposed optimization approach has the potential to significantly reduce the number of relocations in the yard while making minimal shifts in the preferred container pickup times.",1366-5545,Not found

Modelling carrier type and vehicle type choice of small and medium size firms,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102655,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"The objective of this paper is to study freight transportation outsourcing and vehicle type choice decisions made by small and medium size firms. Carrier type and vehicle type choices are modelled independently using multinomial logit models and jointly using nested logit models. Mixed logit models are also developed for the defined structures to study the choice correlation among the choices made by the same firm, resulting in development of six different models. A commercial travel survey for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area is used to estimate the models. The models consider characteristics of the firm (employment, industry classification) and shipment (location, type). The results show significant improvement for the carrier type choice model using a mixing distribution while the vehicle type model performs slightly better using mixed logit model than using multinomial logit model structure. The nested logit model results show that firms are more likely to substitute vehicle type choices before substituting carrier type choices. The correlation of vehicle type choices is found to be highest (96%) among own-account carriers and driver-own carriers (90%) and least for the vehicles owned by a for-hire company (82%). Similar to the mixed vehicle type choice model, the mixed nested logit model also shows a slight improvement in model performance.

Collaboration of vessel speed optimization with berth allocation and quay crane assignment considering vessel service differentiation,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102651,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Green shipping and efficient information sharing deepen the collaboration between shipping companies and ports, enabling vessel speed optimization (VSO) to be integrated with the berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem (BACAP). However, the literature presented to date usually considers all vessels as a whole and only addresses the vertical conflict between the two levels of the BACAP and the VSO but neglects the horizontal conflict among vessels in each level of the collaborative planning. To describe and address the conflicts within and between levels, we consider the vessel service differentiation (VSD) and propose a BACAP-VSO with VSD (BACAP-VSO-w/-VSD) collaboration mode. To this end, we set up a bi-level multi-objective optimization model. In the upper-level BACAP model, the VSD is implemented by separating vessels into different preferential groups. Multi-objectives are formulated to minimize the service delays of vessels in preferential groups and all vessels. In the lower-level VSO model, the VSD is realized by grouping vessels based on their shipping companies. Multi-objectives are solved to minimize the fuel consumption costs of each shipping company. We develop a nested genetic algorithm incorporated with an inheritance factor and jumping operations for the solution approach. Experimental results show that the proposed collaboration mode can analyze trade-offs among multiple conflicting objectives in any and between both planning levels. Compared to the existing collaboration mode, the proposed collaboration mode further reduces service delays of vessels and fuel consumption costs of shipping companies, improves customer satisfaction, and effectively reduces vessel emissions.",1366-5545,Not found

Impact of power structure on decarbonizing investment with uncertain innovation: A triple bottom line perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102654,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Investing in decarbonizing innovation allows a manufacturer to fulfill social responsibilities and maintain competitive advantages, but the stochastic nature of innovation may deter it from doing so. Apart from this intrinsic factor, power as an extrinsic element correlates with a manufacturer’s profit and therefore reshapes its innovation initiative. In this paper, we develop models with power in a dyadic supply chain to investigate the issues of whether a manufacturer should invest in uncertain decarbonizing innovation and how would power affect the investment incentive, firm profitability, consumer surplus, and system performance. First, we derive the conditions under which the manufacturer is profitable to invest under different power structures. Analysis of those conditions indicates that increasing the retailer’s power weakens the manufacturer’s incentive to invest. Second, we find that power benefits the manufacturer, but it may be detrimental to the retailer when investment happens. Moreover, a powerful manufacturer always harms customers, whereas a dominant retailer may not necessarily do. Third, we reveal that when the two firms have a balanced power, the economic performance of the system is higher than when either party dominates; however, this puts an acute strain on the environment due to the most carbon footprint. Finally, our triple bottom line analysis shows that, in equilibrium, the investment may result in a win–win–win or win–win–lose outcome for the firms (profits), consumers (people), and the environment (planet). In addition, these outcomes are more likely to arise as the manufacturer becomes powerful.",1366-5545,Not found

Dynamic demand-driven bike station clustering,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102656,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"As an eco-friendly transportation option, bike-sharing systems have become increasingly popular because of their low costs and contributions to reducing traffic congestion and emissions generated by vehicles. Due to the availability of bikes and the geographically varied bike flows, shared-bike operators have to reposition bikes throughout the day in a large and dynamic shared-bike network. Most of the existing studies cluster bike stations by their geographical locations to form smaller sub-networks for more efficient optimization of bike-repositioning operations. This study develops a new methodological framework with a demand-driven approach to clustering bike stations in bike-sharing systems. Our approach captures spatiotemporal patterns of user demands and can enhance the efficiency of bike-repositioning operations. A directed graph is constructed to represent the bike-sharing system, whose vertices are bike stations and arcs represent bike flows, weighted by the number of trips between the bike stations. A novel demand-driven algorithm based on community detection is developed to solve the clustering problem. Numerical experiments are conducted with the data captured from the world’s largest bike-sharing system, consisting of nearly 3000 stations. The results show that, with CPLEX solutions as the benchmark, the proposed methodology provides high-quality solutions with shorter computing times. The clusters identified by our methodology are effective for bike repositioning, demonstrated by the balance of bike flows among clusters and geographic proximity of bike stations in each cluster The comparison between clusters found in different hours indicates that bike sharing is a short-distance transportation mode. One of the key conclusions from the computational study is that clustering bike stations by bike flow in the network not only enhances the efficiency of bike-repositioning operations but also preserves the geographic characteristics of clusters.",1366-5545,Not found

The impact of changes in port numbers and density on port competition intensity (hereinafter given as PCI) is analyzed, and PCI’s spatial distributions under OCOP mode and OPOP mode are compared in order to clarify the effect of port governance reform.

The parallel mobile charging service for free-floating shared electric vehicle clusters,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102652,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Due to the simple rental procedures and unrestricted parking spots, free-floating shared electric vehicles (SEVs) are widely selected by travelers. A large number of SEVs gather together and even form SEV clusters at popular destinations. In most studies, the low-charge SEVs are usually relocated to charging stations to recharge their batteries. This paper proposes the parallel mobile charging service to route mobile charging vehicles (MCVs) to charge SEVs at their parking spots. The MCV routes are optimized through a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model where MCVs with limited battery capacity could recharge their batteries at available charging stations and sequentially or simultaneously charge the filtered SEVs at the same SEV cluster node. The parallel mobile charging service proposed without relocating SEVs fully takes advantage of SEV clusters (i.e., cluster-based overlapping idle time windows and small inter-vehicle distance) and MCVs (i.e., charging multiple SEVs simultaneously). An adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is developed to solve large-scale instances where a generalized cost function is constructed to balance the effects of battery capacity violations and time window violations on solutions. Comparing with the optimization solver CPLEX, the adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm developed demonstrates high performance. In addition, the cluster-based parallel acceleration time ratio is introduced to demonstrate the advantages of parallel services in utilizing the cluster-based overlapping time windows.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal E-tailing channel structure and service contracting in the platform era,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102614,160,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Today, many e-tailers sell through e-platforms. Some of them sell products through both their own direct-online (DO) sales channel and e-platforms, while some give up their own DO sales channel and sell solely through e-platforms. Motivated by the popularity of e-platforms, we explore in this paper the optimal channel selection and e-platform service contracting problem. We build analytical models to explore “when” an e-tailer should choose “which” channel structure. Based on the commonly-observed industrial practices, in the basic models, we derive the optimal e-platform service contract which is a revenue-sharing plus fixed fee (RSF) service contract. We establish the conditions under which the e-tailer’s optimal channel selection choice will also be optimal for the e-platform systems. To test robustness of the research findings, three extensions are examined. For the extended model with a separate manufacturer, as well as the extended analysis with a social welfare optimization objective, we reveal that all the findings in the basic models remain valid. However, when the e-tailer decides both product pricing and quality, we uncover that the RSF service contract fails to achieve robust systems optimization. We hence show how the use of a cost-sharing RSF service contract can help.",1366-5545,Not found
Adopting blockchain technology to block less sustainable products’ entry in global trade,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102695,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"In this study, we examine how the use of blockchain technology deters less sustainable products’ entry (LSPE) in the cross-border supply chains in which the entrant produces less sustainable products and enters into the incumbent’s market. We identify that when the blockchain adoption cost exceeds a threshold, the entry can be blocked by mandatory blockchain adoption and the incumbent enjoys the monopoly position; when the blockchain adoption cost falls into an intermediate range, deterrence needs not only the use of blockchain technology but also price distortion by the incumbent; when the blockchain adoption cost is sufficiently low, the incumbent must compete with the entrant because blockchain technology is no longer effective for deterrence. Moreover, we examine how government intervention (tariff or subsidy) affects LSPE and find that both tariff and subsidy schemes can enhance the value of adopting blockchain technology to prevent LSPE. If the blockchain adoption cost is moderate, then levying tariffs on LSPE can achieve an economic and environment-dominating outcome, but the subsidy scheme cannot. Our findings provide managerial insights for cross-border supply chain managers and offer guidance to policy makers who design trade policies.",1366-5545,Not found
A linear-time crystal-growth algorithm for discretization of continuum approximation,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102715,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Continuous approximation is regarded as a scalable and insightful method for acquiring near-optimum solutions to various location problems. A continuous approximation solution is nonetheless only a continuous density function and a further discretization procedure is needed to obtain a discrete location solution for engineering practice. Inspired by the process of “crystal growth”, this paper proposes a constructive heuristic algorithm as an alternative to the classic meta-heuristic disk algorithm (Ouyang and Daganzo, 2006) in discretizing a continuous solution from a continuum approximation location model. The main idea of this algorithm is to rasterize the space into a set of small cells (either regular triangles or squares) and repeatedly grow a core cell into a full-service area according to a certain visiting sequence. Thus, it has only linear time complexity proportional to the number of cells in the space. Numerical examples are conducted to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that this algorithm can solve discrete facility locations more efficiently and exhibits robust performance compared with the disk algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found
Design and selection of government policies for electric vehicles adoption: A global perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102726,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Regardless of increased attention in electric vehicles (EV) market expansion, the actual penetration of EVs remains low globally. Almost all major OEMs have announced investment plans to ensure that EVs constitute a major, if not complete, chunk of their product portfolios. On their part, governments worldwide (e.g., China, Poland, India, USA, etc.) have used various policy measures to facilitate EV adoption. In this paper, we study how incentives offered in terms of subsidy and differential taxation schemes could increase the market penetration of EVs. We analyze different models under uniform and differential taxation policies with and without subsidy, using a non-cooperative game-theoretic approach. Our analysis reveals that the government can follow any of the three tax-subsidy mixes that could maximize social welfare, i.e., differential taxation with and without subsidy, and identical tax with a subsidy. Surprisingly, the manufacturer's profit, the government's income, and consumer surplus for these three models are also the same and are better than the other two models depending on the consumer's green sensitivity, i.e., for higher green sensitivity, these three models can provide a win–win outcome. From an environmental perspective, levying tax on gasoline vehicles (GV) without subsidy to the manufacturer minimizes the overall environmental impact. In contrast, levying the same tax for both types of vehicles without subsidy to the manufacturer generates the maximum overall environmental impact. Furthermore, an increase in the unit environmental impact of vehicles attracts higher taxes. We portray that the increase in the cost-difference between EV and GV increases GV demand and is detrimental for EV acceptance. In addition, multifaceted insights are drawn for manufacturers and policymakers to envisage electric mobility. We extend our models and show that our main results hold under the implementation of mandate on EV manufacturers under subsidy and non-subsidy model, and inclusion of hassle cost for consumers due to lack of infrastructure in terms of charging facilities and maintenance.",1366-5545,Not found
Peak-easing strategies for urban subway operations in the context of COVID-19 epidemic,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102724,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Subways play an important role in public transportation to and from work. In the traditional working system, the commuting time is often arranged at fixed time nodes, which directly leads to the gathering of “morning peak” and “evening peak” in the subway. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, this congestion is exacerbating the spread of the novel coronavirus. Several countries have resorted to the strategy of stopping production to curb the risk of the spread of the epidemic seriously affecting citizens' living needs and hindering economic operation. Therefore, orderly resumption of work and production without increasing the risk of the spread of the epidemic has become an urgent problem to be solved. To this end, we propose a mixed integer programming model that takes into account both the number of travelers and the efficiency of epidemic prevention and control. Under the condition that the working hours remain the same, it can adjust the working days and commuting time flexibly to realize orderly off-peak travel of the workers who return to work. Through independent design of travel time and reasonable control of the number of passengers, the model relaxes the limitation of the number of subway commuters and reduces the probability of cross-travel between different companies. We also take the data of Beijing subway operation and apply it to the solution of our model as an example. The example analysis results show that our model can realize the optimal travel scheme design of returning to work at the same time node and avoiding the risk of cross infection among enterprises under different epidemic prevention and control levels.",1366-5545,Not found
Multi-period vaccine allocation model in a pandemic: A case study of COVID-19 in Australia,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102689,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"While the swift development and production of a COVID-19 vaccine has been a remarkable success, it is equally crucial to ensure that the vaccine is allocated and distributed in a timely and efficient manner.

This study proposes an innovative vaccine allocation model to contain the spread of infectious diseases incorporating key contributing factors to the risk of uninoculated people including susceptibility rate and exposure risk. Analyses of the data collected from the state of Victoria in Australia show that a vaccine allocation model can deliver a superior performance in minimizing the risk of unvaccinated people when a multi-period approach is employed and augmenting operational mechanisms including transshipment between medical centers, capacity sharing, and mobile units being integrated into the vaccine allocation model.",1366-5545,Not found

To fill the gap, we aimed to provide a comprehensive systematic literature review on this topic to analyze the previous research from different perspectives such as area of the application, type of application, machine learning method, data, and location of the study. Results showed that the number of articles in the field has been increasing annually, and the most prevalent use case of machine learning methods is to predict different port characteristics.

Optimization model for sustainable food supply chains: An application to Norwegian salmon,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102723,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Food supply chains encompass multiple actors and simultaneously produce multiple products that require transportation using various modes or networks before arriving on consumers’ tables. Transportation costs and related carbon emissions along a supply chain, however, can be high, prompting a search for efficient management solutions. This paper proposes a mathematical formulation in the form of a mixed-integer linear programming model, drawing on evidence from a Norwegian salmon supply chain network. The model addresses environmental aspects by aiming to minimize the fuel cost component from various transportation modes and considers carbon emissions related restrictions. Testing using various problem instances highlights the robustness of the proposed mathematical formulation and models. Moreover, a real-world case study of a Norwegian salmon exporter helps understand the applicability of the proposed model. The paper discusses the impact of different supply chain arrangements regarding their overall cost, including fuel cost, and carbon emissions to understand the need for holistic optimization of food supply chains. Sensitivity analysis regarding demand variability allows the proposed mathematical model to restructure the Norwegian salmon supply chain network to meet fluctuating retail demand.

On the role of battery degradation in en-route charge scheduling for an electric bus system,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102727,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Electric buses (EB) are widely promoted as a clean alternative to conventional fleets to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from ground transportation. En-route charging that takes advantage of bus dwell time is an efficient and promising charging strategy to address mileage limitations and long energy replenishment time. However, the charging and discharging behavior of electric buses during operation has a vital impact on battery degradation, grid stability, and schedule robustness. The present study proposes an optimal electric bus charge scheduling model that addresses the grid and battery issues by introducing peak-to-average power ratio, time-of-use electricity price, and battery wear formulation while ensuring the original bus schedules. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer program that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers even for large-scale problems. Extensive numerical studies based on real-world bus networks are introduced to demonstrate the performance and to gain insights from sensitive analysis. The result shows that the optimal schedule achieves a balanced spatial and temporal distribution of charging demand. Besides, it reveals that the battery wear costs have a greater impact on operations than charging costs, accounting for about 87.26% of total operating costs. However, this impact can be well controlled by controlling the battery state-of-charge (SOC) intervals.",1366-5545,Not found
Parcel delivery using the hyperconnected service network,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102716,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The small parcel delivery industry is experiencing rapid growth, primarily driven by the growth of the e-commerce sector. We introduce a logistic model for delivering parcels to service points that are used as drop-off, pickup, and intermediate storage locations. A parcel may be carried from its origin to its destination in several legs via several possible intermediate service points. Such a system constitutes a hyperconnected service network (HCSN). The HCSN is a generalization of the current practice of using a hierarchical, tree-like service network (TLSN), where a parcel can switch vehicles only in a large sorting facility (hub) and a service point is served by a single route. The HCSN topology presents an opportunity to improve the delivery process by reducing the total distance that parcels are carried while still exploiting the possibility of shipment consolidation. In addition, such a system may save resources that are associated (and tied for an extended period) with the construction and operation of a large sorting facility. In this paper, we develop tools to design and operate a successful HCSN for parcel delivery – a parcel routing mechanism and a math heuristic for routing and scheduling of the vehicles that transfer the parcels in the network. The effectiveness of the proposed tools and the advantages of the HCSN are demonstrated by a simulation study.",1366-5545,Not found
The isolated community evacuation problem with mixed integer programming,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102710,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"As awareness of the vulnerability of isolated regions to natural disasters grows, the demand for efficient evacuation plans is increasing. However, isolated areas, such as islands, often have characteristics that make conventional methods, such as evacuation by private vehicle, impractical to infeasible. Mathematical models are conventional tools for evacuation planning. Most previous models have focused on densely populated areas, and are inapplicable to isolated communities that are dependent on marine vessels or aircraft to evacuate. This paper introduces the Isolated Community Evacuation Problem (ICEP) and a corresponding mixed integer programming formulation that aims to minimize the evacuation time of an isolated community through optimally routing a coordinated fleet of heterogeneous recovery resources. ICEP differs from previous models on resource-based evacuation in that it is highly asymmetric and incorporates compatibility issues between resources and access points. The formulation is expanded to a two-stage stochastic problem that allows scenario-based optimal resource planning while also ensuring minimal evacuation time. In addition, objective functions with a varying degree of risk are provided, and the sensitivity of the model to different objective functions and problem sizes is presented through numerical experiments. To increase efficiency, structure-based heuristics to solve the deterministic and stochastic problems are introduced and evaluated through computational experiments. The results give researchers and emergency planners in remote areas a tool to build optimal evacuation plans given the heterogeneous resource fleets available, which is something they have not been previously able to do and to take actions to improve the resilience of their communities accordingly.",1366-5545,Not found
Promotions of online reviews from a channel perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102697,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The impact of promoting online reviews on pricing strategies and profits of a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer is modeled: channel members can improve their average rating in a reasonable range by promotional strategies with some costs. In the promotion process, a retailer can either increase or decrease the variance. Two channel structures, centralized and decentralized, are examined. By comparing the results with and without review promotion, it is discovered that a change of variance may enhance or undermine the effect of review promotion. First, a reduced variance can always increase the demand of the product but may hurt the profits of the manufacturer and retailer, regardless of the channel structures. Second, with an increased variance, both the manufacturer and the retailer gain more profits, but the efficiency of the promotion may decrease with the quality level. Third, under the decentralized structure, the manufacturer has a greater threshold interval to benefit from review promotion than the retailer, but the promotion strategy may not always play a positive role in improving the channel efficiency of the decentralized channel.",1366-5545,Not found
Data-driven optimization: A flexible route pricing method for Non-Truck Operating Common Carriers,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102678,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper investigates a data-driven flexible pricing method for Non-Truck Operating Common Carriers (NTOCCs). Different route price intervals are provided based on the data cleaning, mining and clustering of an NTOCC. Furthermore, an innovative data-driven flexible pricing method based on a two-category (category-I and category-II) phased payment strategy is presented to systematically improve the empirical pricing process between NTOCCs and freight carriers. The method includes grabbing order, planning, bargaining, transportation and evaluation stages. First, category-I and category-II (pricing) strategies are proposed for the profit management of NTOCCs. The application of the two strategies is identified by a data-driven route price prediction model. Second, considering the loss risk of NTOCCs, the loss deposit (pre-penalty) is introduced for unpunctual cargo delivery in every category pricing strategy. Moreover, every category strategy includes two phases (phase-I and phase-II). In phase-I (planning stage), the paired pricing references are explored based on the predicted route price, bi-level and interval bi-level programming models; loss deposit intervals are developed for planning bargaining references for NTOCCs. In phase-II (evaluation stage), the references for the loss deposit/phase-II payment are formulated by evaluating the unpunctual cargo delivery. Additionally, in the systematic research, numerical experiments show the necessity of new features’ formulation and the good performance of route price prediction, indicate that the historical data set can be matched with two strategies, and verify that the data-driven flexible pricing method can effectively contribute to the profit management of NTOCCs.

Competitive implications of personalized pricing with a dominant retailer,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102690,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The speedy development in information technology has enabled the dominant retailer to profile consumers and serve them with personalized pricing. Although adopting personalized pricing expands the dominant retailer’s market share, it may not increase the dominant retailer’s profit due to intense price competition with the fringe retailer. In this article, we develop a game-theoretical model to examine the competitive implications of personalized pricing in the presence of a dominant retailer, a fringe retailer and a common supplier. Our analysis shows that if the dominant retailer imposes personalized pricing on all consumers, all channel members’ profits decrease but consumer surplus increases, compared with the case where both retailers adopt uniform pricing. However, if the dominant retailer imposes personalized pricing on a part of consumers and endogenously determines the fraction of consumers who are given tailored prices, the dominant retailer’s profit and consumer surplus increase but the supplier and fringe retailer’s profits decrease, compared with the case where both retailers adopt uniform pricing. We also find that when the fringe retailer would like to purchase consumer information and both retailers impose personalized pricing on a part of consumers, the supplier and fringe retailer’s profits and consumer surplus increase but the dominant retailer’s profit decreases, compared with the case where only the dominant retailer adopts personalized pricing. In addition, we find that when consumers would like to pay the privacy-protecting cost to engage in identity management, all channel members’ profits may not decrease but consumer surplus is certain to decrease, compared with the case without consumer identity management.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal composition of solo and pool services for on-demand ride-hailing,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102680,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"On-demand ride-hailing services are becoming a ubiquitous means of mobility in major cities. While convenient and accessible, they are costly for many, and thus ride-hailing providers are often offering pooling options that allow passengers to share a ride and split the fare. The downside of pooling is the extra waiting time passengers may experience as drivers make detours to find and board additional passengers. This paper assesses the competitive advantage of solo (single occupancy) and pool services and investigates the potential benefits of offering both. We characterize the search friction using bilateral meeting functions and present a closed queueing system to capture the pooling effects. We then derive the optimal fare, vehicle occupancy and fleet size for solo and pool services. In symmetric-elasticity meeting functions, we analytically show that (i) the pool service is profitable only when there is increasing returns-to-scale in matching, (ii) the solo service is profitable when the marginal fleet acquisition cost is low, and (iii) the provider should offer both solo and pool services only when there is decreasing returns-to-scale in matching. These observations are further validated numerically for more general cases.",1366-5545,Not found
A cooperative strategy for optimizing vehicle relocations and staff movements in cities where several carsharing companies operate simultaneously,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102711,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Carsharing has become a popular travel mode owing to its convenience of use, easy parking, and low cost of using a car by those who only need it occasionally. However, because of the inadequate location of carsharing stations (station-based systems) or vehicles (free-floating systems), effectively requiring expensive and complex relocation strategies, a number of customers are lost, and some carsharing companies are facing bankruptcy. This study proposes a data-driven, dynamic, multi-company relocation method, which aims to reduce relocation costs and increase profit in one-way carsharing station-based systems through cooperative strategies. The method starts from the prediction of carsharing inflows and outflows at each station throughout the day using a new deep learning algorithm designated as “the attention-enhanced temporal graph convolutional network”. It adopts an encoder-decoder structure to simultaneously capture the temporal and spatial carsharing usage patterns. A two-phase integer programming model is proposed to optimize the process of vehicle relocation and staff rebalancing with cooperative relocation strategies: the sharing of relocation staff, the sharing of vehicles and stations among the different companies. An adaptive large neighborhood search based heuristic approach is implemented to solve the two-phase model. Based on the 6-month travel records from four carsharing companies operating simultaneously in Fuzhou, China, the proposed model and cooperative strategies are assessed. The results show that the total profit of the four carsharing companies can be increased by 25.49% with the cooperation of staff and vehicles. In addition, we prospect the future relocation with automated vehicles, whereby the profit can be increased by 46.69% without the need to employ the relocation staff.",1366-5545,Not found
Timescales of delay propagation in airport networks,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102687,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Flight delays persist and spread in airport networks due to high interconnectivity in the air transportation infrastructure. How quickly delay propagates between two airports is determined by factors such as the number of flights between airports, the duration of the flight, presence of disruptions, and schedule buffers. Accurate estimation of the time for delay propagation can improve system predictability and reliability. However, noisy airport delay data, along with a lack of visibility into airline scheduling and disruption management strategies, result in a challenging estimation problem for such propagation timescales. We present an algorithm to estimate statistically significant time lags between airport delays from noisy, aggregate operational data. The algorithm uses sliding correlation windows to extract the airport pairs with stable delay lags. We apply our method to identify different timescales of interactions for US airport delays in 2017. Our analysis yields two main results: (1) The most stable lags between airport delays involve the Northeast airports; (2) The stable lags between two airports are negatively correlated to the scheduled flight times between the same two airports.

This study analyzes the impact of government-subsidy-based incentive policy and berthing-priority-based incentive policy on ship-borne power receiving system deployment. The two incentive policies are compared in a quantitative way. A nonlinear programming model is constructed to optimize the ship-borne power receiving system deployment, berth allocation, and the order of ships being served in each berth. Due to the complexity of the proposed model, a sequential heuristic algorithm is designed. A critical-shaking neighborhood search method is applied to improve the solution quality of the sequential heuristic algorithm. In extensive numerical experiments, the effectiveness and efficiency of the improved algorithm are verified by comparing it with particle swarm optimization algorithm, tabu search algorithm, and a lower bound of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the berthing-priority-based incentive policy is recommended to be implemented when the government subsidy rate is low.

Adoption of blockchain technology in a two-stage supply chain: Spillover effect on workforce,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102685,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Although blockchain technology (BCT) has been applied to supply chain practices, the theoretical understanding of its impact is limited. Motivated by the practice of an apparel supply chain, we study the application of BCT in a supply chain model to enable the effective and efficient implementation of trade credit (called “smart credit”) and demand information transparency. In this model, a retailer (“she”) and a supplier (“he”) manage their own inventories to satisfy autocorrelated customer demands and fill downstream orders during a planning horizon; the supplier strategically plans the number of full-time workers for manufacturing workforce consumption before the horizon begins. By analyzing this model, we try to address BCT’s operational value to supply chain firms and the spillover effect on the supply chain workforce. The spillover effect is expected to be negative because the BCT will replace human workers. We find that BCT’s operational value to the retailer is positive because the smart credit benefits her; however, the value to the supplier may not be positive because the smart credit hurts him and information transparency improves. The condition for a positive value depends on the type of demand autocorrelation: when the demands are positively correlated, the condition is simple, namely, the autocorrelation coefficient is higher than a threshold; when the demands are negatively correlated, the condition becomes complicated. BCT’s spillover effect on the supply chain workforce also differs according to the type of demand autocorrelation. Contrary to intuition, we find that the spillover effect can be positive (i.e., more full-time workers are hired) when demand is negatively correlated. The underlying reason is that the supplier updates his manufacturing process under BCT and this updated process’ variability can be amplified when the demands are negatively correlated; this leads the supplier to hire more full-time workers to hedge against the increasing uncertainties in the manufacturing workforce consumption. Finally, we conduct a numerical study based on a dataset collected from the apparel supply chain to provide more managerial insights.",1366-5545,Not found

To achieve a high societal welfare, public authorities regulate vehicle sharing. However, it remains unclear whether these regulations work efficiently without unexpected influences on seemingly unrelated aspects of the fleet and service structure. We study impact of regulations on decisions of vehicle sharing operators, and measure efficiency and effectiveness of these regulations. By investigating the influences of these interactions on societal welfare, we gain insights on how operators should adjust their decisions and regulators should adjust their regulations. Operators adapt fleet size, open stations, availability, and rebalancing operations to given regulations. We formalize the decision on the optimal fleet and service structure as a Mixed Integer Second-Order Cone Program. Using examples, we show that the inter-dependencies between different regulations and societal welfare indicators are non-trivial, possibly even counter-intuitive, suggesting a numerical approach to determine the direction and relevance of influencing factors. We, thus, conduct a large numerical study on artificial instances and a case study using data from New York City. Regulating the number of open stations, fleet size, or total distance reduces empty vehicle distance to a similar extent (by more than 30% of empty vehicles in the NYC case study), and more substantially than regulating the empty vehicle distance directly. Among all studied regulations, enforcing equal service availability results in the least profit loss (10% in the NYC case study). Unlike other regulations, imposing a tax predominantly affects the societal welfare indicators linearly, and can thus be enforced and controlled more easily.",1366-5545,Not found

We find that in the presence of monetary incentives, the supplier may exhibit free riding behavior when the buyer’s cost-sharing is sufficiently high, thereby leaving the buyer with no incentive to motivate the supplier. In contrast, a hybrid contract combining monetary with symbolic incentives enhances supplier participation. As the hybrid incentive is not always effective, we propose an improved hybrid contract with a reward-punishment mechanism to better motivate the supplier. Analytical results reveal that both members enjoy higher profitability when the buyer’s reward and punishment scheme is set within a reasonable range.",1366-5545,Not found
Data-driven ordering and transshipment decisions for online retailers and logistics service providers,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102684,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Emerging advanced technologies enable logistics service providers (LSPs) to offer supply chain services, such as inventory management, rather than only shipping services. In the traditional retailer-led system, the retailer makes the ordering and transshipment decisions and outsources shipping to the LSP, but this paper studies an LSP-led preventive transshipment system where the LSP is the decision-maker, providing the optimal ordering and transshipment policy solution to the online retailer. An optimal two-threshold transshipment policy is proposed for the LSP-led system. The LSP has lower operational cost for transshipment than the retailer, so one may expect that the LSP can bear more risk of mismatch between the transshipment and uncertain demand, leading the LSP to be more aggressive in transshipment. Interestingly, the analysis reveals that the transshipment quantity chosen by the LSP is not necessarily high. The LSP will transfer less inventory between distribution centers than the retailer if the delivery cost or transshipment cost of the LSP, or the lost sale cost, holding fee, or selling price of the retailer are high. Based on real industrial data, the evaluation result shows that preventive transshipment in the LSP-led system can bring an average increase of 40.33% (even 93.31% for products with high demand uncertainty in the first selling period) in the total profit of the retailer and the LSP over the non-transshipment scenario. Importantly, even if the transshipment cost is the same for both the retailer and LSP, using the optimal policy decided by the LSP rather than the retailer will generate a profit improvement of 6.37%.",1366-5545,Not found

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of TRE (1997–2021), we aim to investigate impactful research topics addressed by TRE in the past 25 years, review their research methodologies, and analyze their trends. To achieve the objective, we collect 2,268 documents published in TRE during 1997–2021. Based on these documents and their citations, we identify hot research topics over time and reveal their evolution using the bibliometric analysis approach. We further shed light on seven emerging research topics and point out the future valuable research directions.",1366-5545,Not found
Data envelopment analysis and stochastic equilibrium analysis for market power investigation in a bi-level market,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102705,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This study investigates how the exercise of market power affects the economic efficiency and revenue sharing in a bi-level market, which integrates upstream contract market and downstream wholesale market. We consider price volatility and identify Nash equilibrium restricted by the data envelopment analysis (DEA)-estimated capacity constraint. This study develops stochastic mixed complementarity problems (MiCP) models embedded with stochastic programming (SP) and robust optimization (RO) to address price uncertainty in a bi-level market. We investigate the exercise of market power: (1) wholesalers as leaders or (2) bilateral market power between manufacturers and wholesalers. A numerical study of the power generation market is conducted to validate the proposed stochastic MiCP models. The results show that price uncertainties in the upstream contract market have a significant effect in a bi-level market, and thus controlling price volatility in the upstream contract market will improve productivity and support policies. In addition, we suggest the wholesalers should be market leaders and the manufacturers should negotiate profit-sharing contracts with the wholesalers in a deregulated system.",1366-5545,Not found
Multi-class hazmat distribution network design with inventory and superimposed risks,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102693,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Transportation and inventory are essential to hazardous materials logistics, while different classes of hazardous materials are often transported over a network simultaneously. Despite their in-transit and storage incompatibility, the superimposed risks among different materials, which results from possible chemical reaction once accidents (e.g., leakage, explosion) happen, further complicate the comprehensive plans. In this study, we introduce a new multi-class hazmat distribution network design problem with inventory and superimposed risks (MHND) in a multi-echelon supply chain, where the planning of locations, inventory, and routes are made together. The long-term detour cost/risk and the cyclic time windows penalty costs under the time-dependent (periodic) road closure policy are explicitly formulated. We further propose a new population-based risk definition that evaluates the risk for the population at any location and any time with respect to its multi-class hazmat logistics system. In particular, to capture the interactions between different types of materials, we introduce risk superposition coefficients to capture possible superimposed risks among different hazmat that accommodate a general system with more than two hazmat types. We develop a knowledge-based NSGA-II algorithm with cyclic dissimilarity-based elitist selection (NSGA-II-CD) to solve the problem. The devised cyclic dissimilarity-based elitist selection (CD) operator can tackle the issue of speeding proliferation, which greatly improves the solution quality. Our model is applied to a metropolitan-wide real-world case study in Guangzhou, China. The results suggest that, from the perspective of the traffic management sector, the periodic road closures policy in Guangzhou could be possibly upgraded to a full-time prohibition. Moreover, the results provide the following insights to authorities (1) there is a positive convex relation between risk minimization and risk equilibration. The authorities should not try to find a perfect distribution of risk, and they should make a trade-off between the risk equity and total exposed risk; (2) there is a positive correlation between the level of service and total risk. Thus, in practice, the agencies should make a trade-off between economic viability of the system, exposed risk, and maintaining good service for customers; and (3) the interactions between different types of hazmat considerably affect the distribution network design; specifically, the route overlapping ratio for different types of hazmat decreases when their interactions intensify.",1366-5545,Not found
Negative effect of price-matching policy on traditional retailers in a dual-channel supply chain with different content formats,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102682,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"We investigate a model in which a monopoly supplier distributes two types of its product, physical and electronic products, through a traditional/brick-and-mortar retailer with a wholesale price contract and an online retailer with an agency contract, respectively. The supplier and the online retailer negotiate the royalty rate, which is a ratio of the online retailer’s revenue to the entire revenue of the channel. We also discuss the case in which the supplier imposes the following self-regulation to balance its dual-channel supply chain: the retail price of the online retailer is not lower than the wholesale price for the traditional retailer. What will happen if the supplier employs such self-regulation? Is self-regulation beneficial to the two retailers? To answer these questions, we first derive the equilibrium without such self-regulation. Second, we investigate what happens if the supplier employs such self-regulation. We obtain the following results. First, in the baseline model, an increase in the online retailer’s bargaining power over the supplier benefits the two retailers but harms the supplier. Second, under self-regulation, the wholesale price is strictly higher than that in the baseline model. Third, the retailers’ equilibrium prices are also strictly higher than those in the baseline model. Self-regulation always benefits the online retailer. It benefits the traditional retailer if the online retailer’s bargaining power is sufficiently weak. Furthermore, self-regulation benefits the supplier if the substitutability between the two retailers is not high. However, it reduces consumer and social welfare.",1366-5545,Not found
Fleet sizing and routing of healthcare automated guided vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102679,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper proposes techniques to improve the efficiency of transportation activities within hospitals. Transportation is a major activity in hospitals which requires management efforts to improve its efficiency and increase the quality of patient services. One of the most powerful ways of achieving more efficiency of transportation systems in hospitals is via the labor-saving technology of logistics processes using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In this paper, we study the fleet sizing and routing problem with synchronization for AGVs with dynamic demands (FSRPS-AGV) in the context of a real-life application. The goal is to simultaneously optimize the number and types of carts and AGVs needed to perform all daily requests in a hospital while optimizing AGVs’ routes and respecting time constraints. Different requests require different types of carts, which are transported by the AGVs. Each request is composed of several tasks consisting of moving material from a pickup point to a delivery point. Operation synchronization among the tasks of the same request (task 1 must be performed before task 2, possibly by different AGVs but using the same cart) and movement synchronization with respect to AGVs and carts (an AGV may drop off a cart, and later another AGV picks up the cart to continue serving the same or another request) are major challenges of the addressed problem. In this paper, we describe, model, and solve the FSRPS-AGV. We introduce a mathematical formulation and propose a powerful matheuristic based on a fast and efficient dynamic reoptimization of the routes upon the arrival of new requests. We compare the performance of our matheuristic under different scenarios, including against the solutions obtained by an oracle, showing that it can handle dynamism of demand very well and achieve near-optimal solutions. We assess our methods using small and large instances generated based on real data from an industrial partner. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements and important savings can be achieved with a small degree of flexibility in timing constraints and less conservative speed estimations (while taking into account safety concerns). Finally, we provide managerial insights with respect to the number of AGVs and carts that should be acquired by our industrial partner.",1366-5545,Not found
Deep dispatching: A deep reinforcement learning approach for vehicle dispatching on online ride-hailing platform,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102694,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The vehicle dispatching system is one of the most critical problems in online ride-hailing platforms, which requires adapting the operation and management strategy to the dynamics of demand and supply. In this paper, we propose a single-agent deep reinforcement learning approach for the vehicle dispatching problem called deep dispatching, by reallocating vacant vehicles to regions with a large demand gap in advance. The simulator and the vehicle dispatching algorithm are designed based on industrial-scale real-world data and the workflow of online ride-hailing platforms, ensuring the practical value of our approach. Besides, the vehicle dispatching problem is translated in analogy with the load balancing problem in computer networks. Inspired by the recommendation system, the problem of high concurrency of dispatching requests is addressed by sorting the actions as a recommendation list, whereby matching action with requests. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to existing benchmarks. It is also worth noting that the proposed approach won first place in the vehicle dispatching task of KDD Cup 2020.",1366-5545,Not found
Scrubber installation and green fuel for inland river ships with non-identical streamflow,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102677,161,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Recently, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and government sectors have enacted several stringent regulations to curb the emissions of ships. Green fuel and scrubber installation are two prevailing adaptation strategies used by ships to reduce emissions. Green fuel leads to a high shipping cost with the consumption of low-sulphur but highly-priced oil, while scrubber installation is a long-term decision, which incurs a high capital cost from the setting up of desulphurization facilities but ensures ships can continue consuming low-priced oil. This paper makes a theoretical and holistic investigation of the strategy choice of a container ship in an inland river by taking into account the impact of streamflow velocity. For the inland shipping service, the sailing speed of a ship is the sum of its engine speed and streamflow velocity. The engine speed determines the fuel consumption, and the sailing speed determines the round-trip time of a ship. We found that the engine speed of a ship increases with respect to the streamflow velocity under both strategies in the sense of cost minimization. Also, the streamflow velocity increases the incentive of a ship to install a scrubber. Finally, numerical experiments based on the Yangtze River are conducted to demonstrate our proposed models.",1366-5545,Not found
2-echelon lastmile delivery with lockers and occasional couriers,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102714,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"We propose a new approach for the lastmile delivery problem where, besides serving as collecting points of orders for customers, parcel lockers are also used as transshipment nodes in a 2-echelon delivery system. Moreover, we consider that a customer (occasional courier) visiting a locker may accept a compensation to make a delivery to another customer on their regular traveling path. The proposed shared use of the locker facilities – by customers that prefer to self-pick up their orders, and also as a transfer deposit for customers that prefer home delivery – will contribute to better usage of an already available storage capacity. Furthermore, the use of occasional couriers (OCs) brings an extra layer of flexibility to the delivery process and may positively contribute to achieving some environmental goals: although non-consolidation of deliveries may, at first sight, seem negative, by only considering OCs that would go to the locker independently of making or not a delivery on their way home, and their selection being constrained by a maximum detour, the carbon footprint can be potentially reduced when compared to that of dedicated vehicles. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem that integrates three delivery options – depot to locker, depot to locker followed by final delivery by a professional fleet, and depot to locker followed by final delivery by an OC. Furthermore, to assess the impact of OCs’ no show on the delivery process, we extend the formulation to re-schedule the delivery of previous undelivered parcels, and analyze the impact of different no-show rates. Thorough computational experiments show that the use of OCs has a positive impact both on the delivery cost and on the total distance traveled by the dedicated fleets. Experiments also show that the negative impact of no-shows may be reduced by using lockers with higher capacities.",1366-5545,Not found
Reducing material convergence in disaster environments: The potential of trusted change agents,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102736,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The research in this paper seeks to advance the effective management of one of the most intractable aspects of disaster response phenomena: material convergence—the sudden and mostly uncoordinated arrival of physical donations in the aftermath of large disasters and catastrophic events—referred to by disaster respondents as a “second-tier disaster.” To do so, the paper analyzes the strategic interactions among, and the incentives presented to, the various agents that influence the generation and management of material convergence, establishing that material convergence management is a Collective Action Problem. The paper defines the agents’ roles in material convergence management and assesses the potential of demand management. To achieve the desired switch of donation choice the paper investigates the use of appeals made by trusted change agents, i.e., representatives of the disaster agents considered by survey respondents as the most trustworthy and knowledgeable of the conditions at the disaster area. The research is based on unique data, the first of its kind available to researchers, assembled by a survey of registered donors in a donation campaign after the Tohoku disasters in 2011. As part of the research, the data is used to: gain insight into the factors that influence donors to donate physical goods or cash; identify the agent(s) that ought to lead the demand management effort; quantify the potential impact of appeals from trusted change agents; and identify a preliminary list of the key messages that trusted change agents should employ in their appeals to induce donors to switch donations from physical supplies to cash. The data show that about 21–32% of donors in the sample would very likely switch to cash donations if trusted change agents (TCAs) requested them to do so.

Route-based performance evaluation for airlines – A metafrontier data envelopment analysis approach,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102748,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The international aviation industry is essential for both passengers and commodities. Previous literature tends to evaluate aviation performance from the perspective of airlines or airports. However, each route faces a different operating environment and thus has a different profit portfolio. Therefore, a route-based performance evaluation can better reflect the range of operating characteristics by considering the differing characteristics of routes. This study conducted an empirical analysis of 112 international routes from two Taiwanese airlines. To first identify the key variables that have a significant impact on airline performance, a systematic literature review was conducted using a meta-analysis approach. This study then used those key variables to measure route-based performance with data envelopment analysis (DEA) modeling. Finally, k-medoids cluster analysis was used to explore successful factors for air route performance as complementary research to the DEA modeling. Model results show three groups of routes can be clearly identified by considering route efficiency. Each group has very distinct route characteristics (e.g., Asian routes vs US routes) and some route planning recommendations can be developed. The results of this study can help operators and policy makers improve operating performance and identify key factors for route development and planning.",1366-5545,Not found
Management of trade-in modes by recycling platforms based on consumer heterogeneity,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102721,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Today, the world has entered the era of the circular economy, and environmental regulations have become more stringent. This article considers a monopolistic recycling platform (RP), which offers three recycling strategies (trade-in for cash, trade-in for refurbishment, and trade-in for new) to generate more profits based on the heterogeneity of consumers in terms of perceived quality. There are three modes of RPs with diversified recycling strategies: (1) only trade-in for cash (e.g., Lehuiso); (2) trade-in for cash and for refurbishment (e.g., Gazelle); and (3) trade-in for cash, for refurbishment, and for new coexisting (e.g., Suhuishou). We develop a game model and derive optimal decisions of the RP under the three trade-in modes respectively. Comparing the different trade-in modes, we find that for the RP, the decision of which mode to offer among trade-in for cash, for refurbishment, and for new service, depends on the quality depreciation coefficients of used and refurbished products and the value of new products. We also conduct extensive numerical analysis and show the optimal service strategies for the three trade-in modes.",1366-5545,Not found
A railcar re-blocking strategy via Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102713,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"This article presents a novel solution namely Pre-blocking through Re-waybilling to minimize railcar cuts in freight railways. The Pre-blocking through Re-waybilling Problem (PRP) can be described as follows: A freight train carrying m railcars, loaded or empty, arrives at a local classification yard where, based on the destination on their electronic waybills, railcars will be physically switched to n outbound trains. Number of railcar cuts depends on the order of railcars on train. The objective is to minimize the number of railcar cuts by means of changing the electronic waybills of empty railcars, i.e. re-assignment of empty railcars to customers, while respecting supply, demand, and feasibility constraints. In order to solve this problem, a supply–demand network is constructed first, where supply nodes and demand nodes represent railcars and destinations, respectively. The problem is then formulated as a modified transportation problem. Unlike the conventional transportation problem, a linear arc cost function is proposed to describe the adjacent cars’ impact on railcar cut. The objective is converted to a quadratic function, leading to a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) problem. We improve proposed MIQP to a Convex Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (C-MIQP) problem by adding a quadratic term to the objective function. Illustrative and realistic examples are presented to validate the feasibility and efficiency of proposed pre-blocking optimizer.",1366-5545,Not found
Advanced modelling of commuter choice model and work from home during COVID-19 restrictions in Australia,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102718,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The decision to work from home (WFH) or to commute during COVID-19 is having a major structural impact on individuals’ travel, work and lifestyle. There are many possible factors influencing this non-marginal change, some of which are captured by objective variables while others are best represented by a number of underlying latent traits captured by attitudes towards WFH and the use of specific modes of transport for the commute that have a bio-security risk such as public transport (PT). We develop and implement a hybrid choice model to investigate the sources of influence, accounting for the endogenous nature of latent soft variables for workers in metropolitan areas in New South Wales and Queensland. The data was collected between September-October 2020, during a period of no lockdown and relatively minor restrictions on workplaces and public gatherings. The results show that one of the most important attributes defining the WFH loving attitude is the workplace policy towards WFH, with workers that can decide where to work having a higher probability of WFH, followed by those that are being directed to, relative to other workplace policies. The bio-security concern with using shared modes such as public transport is a key driver of WFH and choosing to commute via the safer environment of the private car.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimizing the loaded train combination problem at a heavy-haul marshalling station,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102717,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"In this paper, we address a loaded train combination problem at a heavy-haul marshalling station. This problem lies on assigning/combining loaded inbound trains to/into heavier outbound trains, and determining the actual departure time of outbound trains. By using a time-discretized modelling technique, we formulate the studied problem as a mixed integer linear programming model, to minimize the weighted sum of the total railcar dwell time and the total railcar extra transfer time. Several variable fixing rules and valid inequalities are designed to strengthen the proposed model. An iterated search algorithm, in which an intensification search and a neighborhood search are executed iteratively, is developed to solve large-scale problems efficiently. In the intensification search, the proposed model is reduced into a simpler assignment model to compute an incumbent solution, by fixing the departure time of outbound trains. In the neighborhood search, a rolling horizon heuristic is designed to improve the incumbent solution, by dividing the departure period of outbound trains into multiple overlapped shorter stages, and re-optimizing the solution in each stage while maintaining that in other stages unchanged. Different scales of instances, randomly generated from a real-world marshalling station in one of the busiest Chinese heavy-haul railways, are used to test the proposed approaches. Computational results demonstrate that our algorithm computes (near-)optimal solutions (with a maximum relative gap of 1.73% only) for all the tested instances within a maximum computation time shorter than 13 min. Our approach can also find better solutions (with an average improvement rate of 3.27%) in shorter computation time, when compared to the empirical method used in practice.",1366-5545,Not found
Financing format selection for electronic business platforms with a capital-constrained e-tailer,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102720,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"In today’s new stage of digitization, the rapid development of FinTech enables an increasing number of electronic business (EB) platforms to have access to providing financing services to capital-constrained e-tailers. This paper studies the EB-platform’s financing format preference for self-supported loan financing, assisted loan financing, and joint loan financing and investigates the multifaceted impacts of loan programs on the order quantity of e-tailer, the operational decisions of the EB-platform, as well as the whole supply chain performance. A multi-period game-theoretic model made up of one capital-constrained e-tailer (the follower), one bank (the sub-leader) and one EB-platform (the leader) is established wherein the EB-platform has a financing format option, and the bank determines the competitive interest rate. The analytical results indicate that if the opportunity cost of the EB-platform is greater than the one for the bank, then the EB-platform prefers to adopt either an assisted loan or a joint loan, rather than a self-supported loan for the e-tailer. Otherwise, the EB-platform provides the e-tailer with a self-supported loan or assisted loan. In particular, given the e-tailer’s relatively high procurement cost, the EB-platform may adopt an assisted loan mode. We also find that the appropriate financing format selection for the whole supply chain depends heavily on the interaction of the commission fee and the procurement cost. Further, a counter-intuitive finding is that under the assisted loan format, the EB-platform will also charge the bank a negative service fee when the unit commission fee is relatively high. In contrast, under the joint loan format, the EB-platform should not charge the service fee.",1366-5545,Not found
Effects of asymmetric cost information on collection outsourcing of used products for remanufacturing,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102729,162,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Due to environmental and economic benefits from remanufacturing as well as an existing or potential take-back regulation, a manufacturer often implements remanufacturing, but it often delegates a third-party (3P) to collect used products. However, the collection efficiency is the 3P’s private information while the prior distribution of the 3P’s collection efficiency is possessed by the manufacturer. To maximize its expected profit, the manufacturer can design nonlinear pricing contracts to stimulate the 3P to select one that corresponds to its true type, where the nonlinear pricing contracts consist of the wholesale price and the collecting quantity. Specifically, our modeling analysis reveals that asymmetric information can result in the downward distortion of quantities collected by the 3P with low collection efficiency, whereas the quantities collected by the 3P with high collection efficiency remain unchanged. Besides, faced with information asymmetry and collection outsourcing, the manufacturer may also bring the new product quantity down if the 3P has low collection efficiency. Moreover, the take-back regulation will indirectly reduce consumer surplus, and this negative effect will be amplified by asymmetric information.",1366-5545,Not found

Influencing factors of trucking companies willingness to shift to alternative fuel vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102753,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Freight transportation is a manifestation of a vibrant economy, but it is also associated with negative externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions. To mitigate these impacts, freight vehicles using alternative fuels have been developed, but they are not widely adopted. Moreover, there is not much information on the factors that could incentivize trucking companies to adopt such vehicles, especially in emerging economies where diesel engines dominate the market. Using Colombia as a case study, this paper aims to evaluate the factors that influence businesses to shift towards acquiring trucks powered by alternative fuels, applying an econometric approach based on discrete choice models. Results suggest that demand for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) is highly sensitive to purchase costs, operational range, and environmental awareness. Hybrid fuel alternatives seem to be preferred over electric and compressed natural gas vehicles. The analysis is supplemented with the estimation of marginal substitution rates, elasticities, and the simulation of scenarios considering subsidies and tax exemptions, from which we identify implications and draw policy recommendations to promote the use of AFVs.",1366-5545,Not found
The effect of task complexity on stated choice processes: The moderating role of cognitive ability,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102744,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"There is ample evidence that individuals’ evaluation and choice of transportation-related alternatives in stated choice experiments vary by task complexity. Previous research has analyzed experimental error primarily as a function of the number of choice alternatives, the number of attribute (levels) and response time. It has ignored the fact that the cognitive ability of individuals may be another important moderating variable. Another limitation of previous research is that experimental error has been studied exclusively for utility-maximizing models, not for the more recently introduced regret-rejoice models. To augment this body of research, this study therefore proposes two advanced flexible reference-dependence models, based on the concepts of regret and rejoice, and argues that information processing depends on task complexity, which is affected not only by information load and response time but also by subjects’ cognitive ability. We apply an integrated approach examining both varying the variance of error term and simplifying task complexity by considering only partial information. Furthermore, we explore how the effect of information load differs between long-term and short-term decision problems. To that end, two stated choice experiments with varying information load are designed, one related to a short-term decision context (route choice) and one about a long-term decision context (residential choice). Cognitive ability is explicitly measured using a validated psychological test. Results show subjects’ inclination to consider full information in arriving at a choice increases with increasing cognitive ability. Response time and age appeared to be other significant determinants for the magnitude of error variance of choices. The proposed models outperform the conventional utility model and conventional regret- rejoice models and result in less error in the prediction of market share. The improvement in the prediction performance is more pronounced for more complex choice tasks.",1366-5545,Not found
A new network equilibrium flow model: User-equilibrium with quantity adjustment,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102719,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Travelers’ route choice behaviors affect the distribution of network flow. The paper presents an unconventional equilibrium flow model that extends the well-known non-Walrasian equilibrium theory of economics to the analysis of route choice behavior. With the introduction of path residual capacity as the quantity signal, a quantity adjustment user equilibrium flow model depicts the route choice dynamics based on the maximum path residual capacity, and thus differs from the traditional traffic equilibrium pattern regulated by path travel time. An equivalent nonlinear complementary problem to the proposed model is developed, and further reformulated as an unconstrained mathematical program using a gap function, which permits many efficient solution algorithms. The maximum residual capacity path algorithm and the maximum residual capacity traffic assignment algorithm are developed, and the gradient descent algorithm is used to solve the unconstrained mathematical program. Numerical results show that the proposed model and solution algorithm are feasible and effective. The paper proposes that both price adjustment and quantity adjustment are special cases of the price-quantity adjustment principle, and the equilibrium flow model based on which can capture route choice behaviors that has not been modeled in previous studies.",1366-5545,Not found
Transportation systems management considering dynamic wireless charging electric vehicles: Review and prospects,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102761,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"This paper reviews and prospects the research in transportation systems management with the presence of dynamic wireless charging (DWC) electric vehicles (EVs). DWC is based on inductive coupling that allows EVs to get charged wirelessly by driving over the coils installed in the ground. Thus, DWC is also known as ‘charging-while-driving’ or ‘in-motion charging’, which is regarded as one of the most promising charging solutions for EVs. The road that is equipped with wireless chargers underneath its surface is called a wireless charging lane (WCL). The deployment of WCLs will lead to a profound change in the field of transportation systems management. We give a review of recent studies on related topics including WCL allocation and related decisions, energy consumption of EVs considering WCLs, and pricing of EVs for the use of DWC facilities. Based on the analysis of the existing studies, we identify the needs for more flexible WCL design and allocation models, as well as novel ways that incorporate the complexities in energy consumption by EVs and routing behaviour into traffic network analysis. In addition, we emphasise the research opportunities of dynamic traffic modelling and real-time control considering DWC and EVs with state-of-charge (SOC) constraints.

COVID-19 vaccine distribution planning using a congested queuing system—A real case from Australia,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102749,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Crisis-induced vaccine supply chain management has recently drawn attention to the importance of immediate responses to a crisis (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). This study develops a queuing model for a crisis-induced vaccine supply chain to ensure efficient coordination and distribution of different COVID-19 vaccine types to people with various levels of vulnerability. We define a utility function for queues to study the changes in arrival rates related to the inventory level of vaccines, the efficiency of vaccines, and a risk aversion coefficient for vaccinees. A multi-period queuing model considering congestion in the vaccination process is proposed to minimise two contradictory objectives: (i) the expected average wait time of vaccinees and (ii) the total investment in the holding and ordering of vaccines. To develop the bi-objective non-linear programming model, the goal attainment algorithm and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) are employed for small- to large-scale problems. Several solution repairs are also implemented in the classic NSGA-II algorithm to improve its efficiency. Four standard performance metrics are used to investigate the algorithm. The non-parametric Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are applied on several numerical examples to ensure the privilege of the improved algorithm. The NSGA-II algorithm surveys an authentic case study in Australia, and several scenarios are created to provide insights for an efficient vaccination program.",1366-5545,Not found
"Blockchain-supported business model design, supply chain resilience, and firm performance",10.1016/j.tre.2022.102773,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Supply chain resilience (SCR) is imperative for operation and performance continuity in the presence of disruptions. One of the important SCR capabilities is end-to-end visibility which can be supported by Blockchain technology in facilitating transparency, traceability, and trust in using data and information. Meanwhile, Blockchain can change and enhance the existing efficiency- and novelty-oriented business model design (BMD). However, the impact of Blockchain-supported BMD on SCR and firm performance has not been investigated so far. This study fills this research gap and empirically examines the relationships among BMD, SCR, and firm performance with consideration of Blockchain technology and using data collected from Chinese firms. Our findings contribute to the literature by revealing the antecedents of SCR and its mediating role between Blockchain-enabled BMD and firm performance. We also provide insights into enhancing SCR in light of the Blockchain-supported BMD. Our research offers several important findings. We demonstrate that companies with high strategic emphasis on BM efficiency can achieve higher firm performance and SCR through Blockchain usage than those without such a focus. This emphasizes the importance of process transparency and information symmetry which can be implemented by Blockchain. Blockchain-enabled novelty-centered BMD significantly enhances the agility part of SCR. SCR can improve firm performance acting as an intermediary between efficiency-centered BMD and firm performance.",1366-5545,Not found
A novel integrated MCDM framework based on Type-2 neutrosophic fuzzy sets (T2NN) for the selection of proper Second-Hand chemical tankers,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102765,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Shipping companies may not present appropriate and reasonable shipping charges to their customers due to the high investment costs of chemical tanker vessels. Hence, the second-hand chemical tanker vessel selection may present many advantages and opportunities to the shipping companies. However, selecting a suitable chemical tanker represents a complicated process requiring overcoming many ambiguities and considering many conflicting criteria. For this purpose, the current paper proposes a new and integrated MCDM approach based on Type-2 Neutrosophic fuzzy sets. The proposed model combines the advantages of TOPSIS and WASPAS techniques, and it uses Type-2 Neutrosophic fuzzy sets to process the uncertainties. The proposed model was applied to solve decision-making problems in selecting appropriate second-hand chemical tankers among 15 alternatives to show effectivity, pertinence, and robustness. In the current paper, 14 different selection criteria were identified to evaluate the chemical tanker vessels. According to the results, C13″ Maintenance cost” is the most significant factor, and A3 is the best and most preferable chemical tanker. Also, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the validity and applicability of the suggested model, and the sensitivity analysis approves the applicability, robustness, and validity of the model.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimizing automotive inbound logistics: A mixed-integer linear programming approach,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102734,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The optimization of inbound logistics from first-tier suppliers at the aggregation level of a factory is a challenging coordination problem. In practice, different transport modes and multiple constraints exist and need to be taken into account: the available number of storage places, capacity of goods-entry, delivery profile and transportation pattern constraints, truck utilization, demand satisfaction, and the reverse flow of empty load carriers. A scalable solution method that is tailored to an automotive factory is currently not available. Optimization is usually carried out manually, e.g. experience-based or by using decision trees that follow an iterative optimization approach. Most of the mathematical models in the literature only deal with parts of the requirements and do not validate results in the required complexity. We present a mixed-integer linear programming approach to solve this complex problem using Gurobi. The solution capability and quality are enhanced by the introduction of a cyclic inventory constraint and valid inequalities. The evaluation of the approach is based on a case study of a German automotive factory with 570 suppliers and 3927 stock keeping units and reduces the as-is total cost by 33.86%. Additionally, CO2 emissions are reduced by 74.66%. We further show that variable order quantities, along with a courier and express service as an additional transport mode, are of high economic relevance. As part of a sensitivity analysis, we show how the total costs change, when (a) goods-entry handling constraints, (b) truck utilization, (c) storage constraints, or (d) transportation costs vary, and (e) the effect of a cyclic inventory constraint.",1366-5545,Not found
Creating all-win by blockchain in a remanufacturing supply chain with consumer risk-aversion and quality untrust,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102778,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Remanufactured product, by definition, is the product with the same-as-new quality but a low cost because the components are reused and/or repaired. Consumers have doubts about the wastage status of the components so risk-aversion and quality untrust are incurred when they buy remanufactured products. To cope with this, it is necessary for both the components supplier and the manufacturer to adopt blockchain which enables credible traceability of the components’ real-time wastage information that can be disclosed to the risk-averse consumers. In this paper, we formulate consumers’ valuation of remanufactured products with and without blockchain quality information, based on which we examine blockchain adoption incentives of both the supplier and the remanufacturer that might create all-win situations. When the manufacturer sells both regular and remanufactured products, we find that the manufacturer prefers blockchain adoption while the supplier prefers blockchain adoption if (1) the consumers are not very risk-averse; (2) the consumers’ risk-aversion degree is moderate but customers’ quality uncertainty of the remanufactured product is small. We further investigate whether blockchain adoption can coordinate the supply chain and improve the environmental performance.",1366-5545,Not found
A computational approach for real-time stochastic recovery of electric power networks during a disaster,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102752,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Disasters are occurring with increasing frequency worldwide, causing significant social hardship and economic losses. Critical infrastructures such as electric power networks are prone to failure under such events, and this significantly impacts the daily lives of people in affected areas. It is hence critical that the restoration planning of these power networks be done proactively. Disaster response in power networks is a well-studied problem, especially for pre-and post-event restoration Similar to pre-event, we consider uncertainty associated with the failure paths, and we look into real-time response while failures are happening. In this regard, at each time step, we move repair teams towards distribution loads based on their current state, their likelihood to fail, and the impact of the damage in case of node failure. We consider large-scale networks ( > 50 nodes and > 20 repair teams) and propose an efficient algorithm to support real-time recovery. In particular, to address the curse of dimensionality, we design a novel approximate dynamic program that (i) evaluates the future impact of current actions using rollout, (ii) reduces the action space relying on aggregate dynamic programming. The proposed approach is applied to the power distribution network in Aguada municipality, Puerto Rico. Our results show that the proposed rollout approach significantly improves the network service level compared to the base heuristic through prepositioning of the repair crew. Moreover, we find that the performance gap grows larger with the concave restoration function (i.e., a decreasing Rate of Increase in the Load Service Level as the recovery progresses) compared to the linear restoration (a constant recovery rate throughout the recovery operation). Finally, the performance gap also grows larger under stronger failure scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found
Individual scheduling approach for multi-class airline cabin crew with manpower requirement heterogeneity,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102763,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The cabin crew pairing problem is one of the major challenges faced by airlines. Traditionally, multi-class cabin crews are scheduled on a team basis separated by aircraft types (families) as cockpit crews. However, the manpower requirements for cabin crew across aircraft types (families) are heterogeneous, which cannot be handled by the team scheduling approach. Thus, some airlines nowadays are adopting the individual scheduling approach to deal with the flight manpower requirement heterogeneity. Motivated by the emergence of the individual cabin crew pairing practice, we conduct an analytical study which aims at improving manpower utilization while reducing costs by utilizing a new individual cabin crew pairing generation approach. We also mathematically formulate crew substitution in the model which can help hedge against manpower requirement variations. The impacts of the relationship between manpower availability with requirement benchmarks on cabin crew scheduling strategies are investigated to derive deep insights. A column generation based solution approach is developed. Computational experiments based on small-scale real-world collected flight schedules are conducted to test the distinctive features of the proposed individual pairing model. In addition, a series of large hypothetical instances are employed to examine the advantages of the proposed model over the traditional team-based model in terms of manpower utilization improvement and cost reduction through a customized Genetic Algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found
Quality and distribution channel selection on a hybrid platform,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102750,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"We consider a supply chain with a manufacturer selling a product to consumers through a hybrid online platform. The platform offers the manufacturer (she) two channels (agency and reselling channels) to sell her product. The literature assumes that the manufacturer can choose to sell her product through either the agency channel or the reselling channel, whereas this study expands the literature by allowing the manufacturer to sell her product through two channels, which is common in practice. Specifically, we study the manufacturer’s distribution channel decision on a hybrid platform and explore the impact of product quality on this decision. We reveal that it is not optimal for the manufacturer to sell solely through the agency channel in quantity competition. In the short run, she chooses to sell through the two channels if product quality is low and solely through the reselling channel otherwise. The manufacturer’s channel decision may benefit the platform and consumers, leading to a win-win-win outcome if the quality level is intermediate or sufficiently high. In the long run, the manufacturer can flexibly adjust product quality. Our analysis shows that if the commission rate is low, the manufacturer chooses a low-quality level and sells via both channels. Otherwise, the manufacturer chooses a high level of quality and sells solely via the reselling channel. Compared with the short-run model, if the manufacturer is efficient in manufacturing a high-quality product, the quality decision enlarges the region where she sells solely through the reselling channel and the region where the platform benefits from the channel decision. Although the quality decision narrows the region where consumers benefit from the manufacturer’s channel decision, it nonetheless enlarges the region where the win-win-win outcome occurs.",1366-5545,Not found
Risk assessment of maritime container shipping blockchain-integrated systems: An analysis of multi-event scenarios,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102764,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Blockchain applications in maritime logistics services face uncertainties and risks, obstructing a broader and more sustainable adoption.

This research is a mixed-methods risk analysis focusing on (1) modeling the risk situation by a connected network of potential disruptive events in container shipping BISs, and (2) applying a quantitative risk analysis with probabilistic indexes considering the multiplicity of multi-event risk scenarios (MESs). Thirty-two telephone interviews with experts from container terminal operators, shipping companies, and freight forwarders helped establish a risk network with the description of 25 vertices and 54 directed connections. The quantitative analysis of 64 web survey responses provided insights and foresight about different characteristics of each risk and causal connection. The results enable a comprehensive view of the potential failure modes of blockchain applications.

Data-driven Wasserstein distributionally robust mitigation and recovery against random supply chain disruption,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102751,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"This paper studies joint robust network design and recovery investment management in a production supply chain, considering limited historical data about disruptions and their possibilities. The supply chain is subject to uncertain disruptions that reduce production capacity at plants, and the cascading failures propagate along the supply chain network. A data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization model with Wasserstein ambiguity set (TWDRO) is constructed to determine the strategic location and tactical allocation decisions in the first stage as well as the operational production and inventory decisions and recovery policy by recourse in the second stage. This paper also proposes a model for depicting a recovery-fund based mitigation strategy, and the model is general in depicting the accelerated, constant-speed, and decelerated recovery processes. In addition, partial backorder policy is adopted to depict the customers’ choices upon product stockout. The TWDRO model is solved by converting it to a mixed integer linear programming model and designing a joint solution method using benders decomposition and genetic algorithm. The performance of TWDRO solutions is demonstrated through numerical experiments and a case study, benchmarking on the stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches. This paper shows the effectiveness and robustness of TWDRO and provides managerial implications and suggestions for supply chain disruption and recovery management.",1366-5545,Not found
The interplay between strategic inventories and cost misreporting in supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102737,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"For retailers, carrying inventories may force suppliers to lower wholesale prices in their future transactions. Previous literature on strategic inventories has assumed that the unit production cost of the supplier is negligible. In practice, the production cost is the supplier’s private information. In this research, we study the impact of supplier’s cost misreporting behavior on supply chain decisions in a two-period strategic inventory basic model consisting of a retailer and a supplier. We find that the retailer’s retention of strategic inventories can incentivize the supplier to misreport costs. As the retailer carries inventories, the supplier can misreport a higher cost, thus increasing the wholesale price and supplier’s profit margins. Moreover, we find that misreporting behavior hurts the retailer and exacerbates the double marginalization effect, leading to inefficiency in the supply chain. The supplier’s profit is further improved when the supplier can misreport the different costs in each period. When we consider competition from downstream retailers, only if both two retailers do not hold strategic inventories, can they prevent the supplier from misreporting. The retailer’s detection measures are needed to ensure the coordination role of strategic inventory.",1366-5545,Not found
A causality analysis of risks to perishable product supply chain networks during the COVID-19 outbreak era: An extended DEMATEL method under Pythagorean fuzzy environment,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102759,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"In nowadays world, firms are encountered with many challenges that can jeopardize business continuity. Recently, the coronavirus has brought some problems for supply chain networks. Remarkably, perishable product supply chain networks, such as pharmaceutical, dairy, blood, and food supply chains deal with more sophisticated situations. Generally, during pandemic outbreaks, the activities of these industries can play an influential role in society. On the one hand, products of these industries are considered to be daily necessities for living. However, on the other hand, there are many new restrictions to control the coronavirus prevalence, such as closing down all official gatherings and lessening the work hours, which subsequently affect the economic growth and gross domestic product. Therefore, risk assessment can be a useful tool to forestall side-effects of the coronavirus outbreaks on supply chain networks. To that aim, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach is used to evaluate the risks to perishable product supply chain networks during the coronavirus outbreak era. Feedback from academics was received to identify the most important risks. Then, experts in pharmaceutical, food, and dairy industries were inquired to specify the interrelations among risks. Then, Pythagorean fuzzy sets are employed in order to take the uncertainty of the experts’ judgments into account. Finally, analyses demonstrated that the perishability of products, unhealthy working conditions, supply-side risks, and work-hours are highly influential risks that can easily affect other risk factors. Plus, it turned out that competitive risks are the most susceptive risk in the effect category. In other words, competition among perishable product supply chain networks has become even more fierce during the coronavirus outbreak era. The practical outcomes of this study provide a wide range of insights for managers and decision-makers in order to prevent risks to perishable product supply chain networks during the coronavirus outbreak era.",1366-5545,Not found
An analysis on the role of blockchain-based platforms in agricultural supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102731,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The traditional agricultural supply chain (ASC) has been overwhelmed by several challenges, including financing risk, counterparty risk, and lack of consumer trust. Platforms based on blockchain technology combined with Internet-of-Things technology have emerged to address these challenges by improving supply chain visibility, guaranteeing the execution of contracts, and increasing the authenticity of products’ provenance information in the ASC. This study analyzes how the adoption of a blockchain-based platform can affect the decisions of ASC participants and identifies how the platform creates value for the supply chain by addressing these three challenges. We consider a two-level supply chain featuring a typical cooperative and a buyer and establish stylized game models with and without the blockchain-based platform. By comparing equilibrium outcomes with and without the blockchain-based platform, we show that the involvement of the blockchain-based platform can lead to increased production quantity and total surplus of the supply chain. This can also motivate more sustainability/green investment to produce greener products. Interestingly, we show that the value of the blockchain-based platform decreases in the credibility of the business environment in which the supply chain operates. Furthermore, the buyer will always benefit from the established blockchain-based platform, whereas the cooperative can benefit in most cases but could be worse off under certain conditions. The adoption and operational costs could outweigh the benefits caused by the addition of the blockchain-based platform.",1366-5545,Not found
Intelligent logistics transformation problems in efficient commodity distribution,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102735,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"In recent years, comprehensive information, intelligence and automation technology have become the emerging development trend in distribution enterprises. Intelligent logistics transformation (ILT) is the basis of realising efficient commodity distribution. However, the real-time practice of implementation of ILT is not running smoothly in China. This is caused by a lack of a theoretical framework of causes of intelligent logistics transformation problems (ILTP) in efficient commodity distribution that helps enterprises avoid problems. This pilot study proposes a conceptual model of ILTP based on the grounded theory and tests it by a survey in application to efficient commodity distribution. There are five major factors influencing ILTP in efficient commodity distribution: inherent risks of transformation, difficulties in organizational adjustment, market obstacles, market drivers and social factors. The inherent risks of transformation and difficulties in organizational adjustment are direct factors affecting the ILTP, while market obstacles, market drivers and social factors moderate significantly these relations. The key contribution of this paper provides firms and governments with relevant management and policy recommendations to implement the ILT in the context of the efficient commodity distribution.",1366-5545,Not found
A Cross-disciplinary review of product recall research: A stakeholder-stage framework,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102732,163,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Research on product recalls has recently witnessed a sharp increase; however, this stream of research is dispersed within and outside the discipline of management. In the current article, we review this research stream by adopting a stakeholder-stage framework that draws on stakeholder theory and crisis management literature. Specifically, we summarize and integrate the product recall research along two dimensions: the stakeholders involved (e.g., managers, employees, shareholders, consumers, suppliers, competitors, media, and regulators) and the key issues at different stages of a recall (before-recall, during-recall, and after-recall). We find that current research has focused on managers, shareholders, and consumers, but has paid limited attention to other equally important stakeholders such as suppliers, employees, competitors, media, and regulators. Also, researchers have predominantly examined the issues associated with the after-recall stage to minimize the consequences of recalls, while the before- and during-recall stages that prevent recalls and make them more effective are relatively underexamined. To address these gaps and extend the current research, we develop a range of future research opportunities that can make nuanced theoretical contributions and generate implications for practice and policy. By emphasizing the need to adopt a stakeholder management approach and consider recalls as a process, rather than an event, this review paves the way for enriching future research on product recalls.",1366-5545,Not found

First-mile logistics parcel pickup: Vehicle routing with packing constraints under disruption,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102812,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"First-mile logistics tackles the movement of products from retailers to a warehouse or distribution centre. This first step towards the end customer has been pushed by large e-commerce platforms forming extensive networks of partners and is critical for fast deliveries. First-mile pickup requires efficient methods different from those developed for last-mile delivery, among other reasons due to the complexity of cargo features and volume — increasing the relevance of advanced packing methods. More importantly, the problem is essentially dynamic and the pickup process, in which the vehicle is initially empty, is much more flexible to react to disruptions arising when the vehicles are en route. We model the static first-mile pickup problem as a vehicle routing problem for a heterogeneous fleet, with time windows and three-dimensional packing constraints. Moreover, we propose an approach to tackle the dynamic problem, in which the routes can be modified to accommodate disruptions — new customers’ demands and modified requests of known customers that are arriving while the initially established routes are being covered. We propose three reactive strategies for addressing the disruptions depending on the number of vehicles available, and study their results on a newly generated benchmark for dynamic problems. The results allow quantifying the impact of disruptions depending on the strategy used and can help the logistics companies to define their own strategy, considering the characteristics of their customers and products and the available fleet.",1366-5545,Not found

Contingent channel strategies for combating brand spillover in a co-opetitive supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102830,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Brand spillover, which arises frequently and increasingly, becomes a serious concern for well-known (strong) brand manufacturers, as some giant retailers may develop and sell their private (weak) brand products by sourcing from the same contract manufacturers as the strong brand manufacturers and disclosing such a relationship. To cope with such brand spillover, strong brand manufacturers may adopt contingent channel selling strategies. In this study, we investigate a co-opetitive supply chain wherein a weak brand retailer (she) ex-ante decides whether to implement the brand spillover strategy, whereas a strong brand manufacturer (he) determines channel selling strategies for his own-branded products. We specifically consider three channel formats for the strong brand manufacturer, namely, Scenarios R (i.e., the manufacturer sells his own-branded products only via the reselling channel), D (i.e., the manufacturer opts to establish the direct-selling channel and sells his own-branded products via dual channels), and S (i.e., the manufacturer sells his own-branded products only via the direct-selling channel), to explore the strategic interactions between the two firms. We find that regardless of whether the retailer implements the brand spillover strategy or not, any channel format (Scenario R, D, or S) could be dominant for the manufacturer, hinging on certain conditions. Moreover, we uncover that, compared with non-brand spillover, brand spillover can enhance the manufacturer’s incentive to construct the direct-selling channel. Counterintuitively, we demonstrate that employing brand spillover strategy does not necessarily benefit the retailer when the direct-selling cost is moderate and the brand spillover level is weak; otherwise, the retailer will opt to do so.",1366-5545,Not found
Synchromodal transport planning considering heterogeneous and vague preferences of shippers,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102827,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In synchromodal transport, a freight forwarder usually serves multiple shippers with heterogeneous and vague preferences, such as low-cost, fast, or reliable transport. Ignoring shippers’ preferences will negatively impact the satisfaction of shippers and lead to the loss of them in the longer run. In order to incorporate these preferences, a Synchromodal Transport Planning Problem with Heterogeneous and Vague Preferences (STPP-HVP) is proposed and formulated as a mathematical model. Heterogeneous and Vague Preferences (HVP) are modeled through Multiple Attribute Decision Making approaches that integrate fuzzy set theory. The proposed model has two objectives, i.e., maximizing the number of served requests and minimizing the transportation cost. Preferences of shippers are set as constraints such that the freight forwarder needs to satisfy the preferred levels for each attribute. A heuristic algorithm (Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search) is proposed to find (near) optimal solutions. The case study in the European Rhine–Alpine corridor demonstrates that the proposed model can provide more attractive solutions to shippers compared with optimization which ignores preferences. Under various scenarios, the attributes, such as cost, time, emissions, reliability, and risk of damage, are analyzed and the (near) optimal modes and routes are suggested according to HVP. Moreover, the results show that the conflicts among attributes, conflicts among shippers, and conflicts between the freight forwarder and shippers are resolved by making one actor more satisfied without compromising any other actor’s preferences.",1366-5545,Not found

We propose mathematical models to compare the performance of three scenarios based on several sustainability indicators: logistics costs, CO2 emissions, created job opportunities, noise level, and accident risk. The scenarios assume multi-period transportation planning, performed by a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. Mathematical models are used to determine the number of hubs, their capacities, and their locations, as well as the links between network nodes, the quantities transported, the quantities delayed, the inventory level, and the number and type of vehicles used in each period. Single-objective optimization is performed in an exact manner for small instances, while the genetic algorithm is used to solve large instances. Multi-objective resolution is performed using the ε-constraint method for small instances and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II for large instances. We use a distribution network located in France for our numerical experiments. The costs of collaboration were shared by three approaches: egalitarian approach, volume method, and Shapley value. Experimental results and sensitivity analysis reveal some interesting findings: (1) it is always beneficial to design a collaborative distribution network; (2) relaxing delivery times and increasing the number of available vehicles further improve collaborative performance; and (3) cooperative game-theoretic approaches are most appropriate for sharing costs.",1366-5545,Not found
Blockchain technology and supply chains: The paradox of the atheoretical research discourse,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102824,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Blockchain technology has seen increasingly important practical applications. The literature has expanded greatly in the past four to five years. One area that has seen significant application and growth is in supply chain management—which includes transportation and logistics. The growth of this literature has also resulted in several literature reviews—each has specific scope and emphasis. Of the growing number of literature review and bibliometric analysis studies, the focus has ranged from understanding application cases, themes, trends, and methodologies. Theoretical developments and theorizing have been limited for supply chain management in general and even more limited for sustainable supply chains. Arguably, much of the current research has been relatively atheoretical—a lack of theory development and theory application. Hence, we conclude the existing blockchain research discourse has been centered around application and less around the theory. As a sub-discipline, the nexus of blockchain and supply chain management is still in the early developmental stages. Using a critical synthesis review of the literature, this paper focuses on the most popular theories that have been applied to explain blockchain adoption and implementation within supply chains—how each theory explains the motivations, formalizes the organizational process around the acceptance of blockchain technology, and predicts the outcomes of blockchain-supported business models.

Building trust in online trade-in programs with a blockchain-enabled system,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102833,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Online trade-in programs provide efficient and convenient buyback services. However, they suffer from a trust deficit because of potential cheating by service providers (platforms). In this study, we design a blockchain-enabled system in which platforms tend to avoid cheating. The system employs an updated operation process to ensure reliable information inputs, a consortium blockchain network to avoid data tampering, and an intelligent algorithm embedded in a smart contract to automatically detect cheats. We then theoretically analyze the behavior of participants in the proposed system. In particular, we model the cheating decisions of a platform as chance-constrained programming and develop a Monte Carlo simulation method based on exploited optimality properties to solve it. Numerical experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the system reduces platforms’ motivation to cheat to an acceptable level. We draw managerial and policy implications to improve system performance.",1366-5545,Not found
Raising funds through crowdfunding for a capital-constrained servicing manufacturer,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102813,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Servitization (service-oriented manufacturing) is an emerging business model under which a manufacturer offers services derived from physical goods. A servicing manufacturer is more likely to be capital-constrained, as its revenue is monetized over a long period of time. Therefore, we explore how a capital-constrained servicing manufacturer raises funds through crowdfunding. We construct a game-theoretical model to capture the optimal decisions (quality and price) of a servicing manufacturer facing two types of customers. In our paper, the endogenous quality level is derived by tailoring the service to consumers’ needs. According to the posted quality level, customers determine their optimal usage of the service, which impacts the target of crowdfunding. We find that when both types of customers share the same product in crowdfunding, a higher proportion of high-end customers will lead to a lower quality level determined by the manufacturer. In addition, the servicing manufacturer also optimizes price decisions to induce high-type customers to make a contribution to the success of crowdfunding. These results underscore the influence of the crowdfunding mechanism on the servicing manufacturer’s decisions. However, offering a product line lets no one sacrifice interests for the success of crowdfunding. Both the manufacturer and customers obtain the highest benefits because servitization enables the manufacturer to provide customers with customized services. We argue that servitization improves the performance of crowdfunding by allowing the manufacturer to optimize operational decisions.",1366-5545,Not found
The effect of online meeting and health screening on business travel: A stated preference case study in Hong Kong,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102823,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This study quantifies the effects of health control measures at the airport on passenger behaviour related to business travel. A stated preference survey was conducted over potential air travellers in Hong Kong in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Panel latent class models were estimated to understand passenger preference toward new travel requirements given the applicability of online meeting. Online meeting is applicable in cases where it is a good substitute of air travel and achieves the same outcomes of a trip, and inapplicable otherwise. Empirical results indicate that traveller subgroups are affected in different ways. When an online meeting is inapplicable, nearly 75% of the respondents prefer to travel for business and undertake health screenings. These passengers (identified as “captive” business travellers) perceive such measures necessary to lower health related risks during air travel. As such, they are willing to spend up to 21 to 38 min on the health control measures such as vaccination record requirements and test involving sample collection. When an online meeting is applicable, the share of “choice” business travellers is about 45%, among whom the attitudes towards health control measures become more averse. The average weighted willingness-to-pay for the time saved at health checkpoints increase significantly. The aviation industry thus faces a “double-hit” problem: operation costs will increase due to pandemic control measures, and the resultant inconvenience, extra time and costs further reduces travel demand. Unlike previous short pandemics, business travel is likely to suffer with an extended decline until the pandemic is fully controlled. These identified challenges call for financial and operational support to help the aviation industry reach a sustainable “new normal”. The high value of time saved at check points also justifies investments that make the pandemic control and health measures efficient and smooth. Travellers’ time spent on airport health control should be within 20 min to avoid substantial negative impacts on business travel demand.",1366-5545,Not found
A logistic model for a french intermodal rail/road freight transportation system,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102819,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In Europe, there are major obstacles limiting the growth of rail freight. In this paper, we investigate problems related to the development of small multimodal terminals which are usually utilized to ensure a more environmentally friendly freight transport and serve metropolitan areas with daily train shuttles arriving from ports. The small size of such terminals and limitations of the storing area, and service and cost constraints, require that resource use is optimal, handling operations for overnight train shuttle schedules are timely, and final truck delivery is optimized. Besides designing the complete service, an optimization-simulation approach is proposed for container transportation, handling operations and container stacking in the small rail/road terminal, as well as for final delivery, to optimize resource use and time. In an original multidisciplinary perspective, the case of a Le Havre-Paris intermodal shuttle is presented using real data. Optimization/simulation results are fed into the economic model to ensure cost efficiency and conditions for efficiency, profitability for investors and also to measure the environmental impact. Our experimental results show the efficiency of our optimization-simulation approach, and the methodology used delivers full guidelines for the implementation of similar terminals.

Online model-based reinforcement learning for decision-making in long distance routes,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102790,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In road transportation, long-distance routes require scheduled driving times, breaks, and rest periods, in compliance with the regulations on working conditions for truck drivers, while ensuring goods are delivered within the time windows of each customer. However, routes are subject to uncertain travel and service times, and incidents may cause additional delays, making predefined schedules ineffective in many real-life situations. This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm capable of making en-route decisions regarding driving times, breaks, and rest periods, under uncertain conditions. Our proposal aims at maximizing the likelihood of on-time delivery while complying with drivers’ work regulations. We use an online model-based RL strategy that needs no prior training and is more flexible than model-free RL approaches, where the agent must be trained offline before making online decisions. Our proposal combines model predictive control with a rollout strategy and Monte Carlo tree search. At each decision stage, our algorithm anticipates the consequences of all the possible decisions in a number of future stages (the lookahead horizon), and then uses a base policy to generate a sequence of decisions beyond the lookahead horizon. This base policy could be, for example, a set of decision rules based on the experience and expertise of the transportation company covering the routes. Our numerical results show that the policy obtained using our algorithm outperforms not only the base policy (up to 83%), but also a policy obtained offline using deep Q networks (DQN), a state-of-the-art, model-free RL algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found

This paper extends and unifies the shipping lines and cargo port service providers port choice literature by recognizing that shipping lines and providers of cargo port services do not choose their ports in isolation of each other. Instead, their choices are interdependent. To model this interaction, a cargo port choice equilibrium model is proposed. To demonstrate how the model can be used in practice, a discussion is provided of how the proposed equilibrium model can be adopted to forecast directional behavioral changes by carriers and cargo port service providers in the case of disturbances in the equilibrium.",1366-5545,Not found
Assignment of parcels to loading stations in robotic sorting systems,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102808,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Autonomous robots are increasingly used in warehouses in the recent decade, due to their flexible throughput capacity and low operating cost. Sorting may be the newest warehouse scene where autonomous robots are adopted. We consider a robotic sorting system with a two-tier layout where robots drive on the top mezzanine and sort parcels from loading stations (inputs) to drop-off points (outputs) via spiral conveyors connected to roll containers at the lower tier. We investigate the assignment optimization of arrival parcels to loading stations, to minimize the system throughput time. We first build an open queueing network to estimate the system performance and validate its accuracy by simulation. Then, we formulate an integer-programming model that takes the minimization of throughput time as the objective. We prove the computational complexity of the model by transferring it into an order batching problem, and design a Tabu search algorithm for solution. We evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm by both numerical experiments that take the Gurobi solver, the random and closest assignment rules as the comparison target, and a real case study. The results show that our algorithm can reduce the system throughput time by 7.09% and 8.76% and lower the manual cost by 11.99% and 17.50% over the random and the closest assignment rule, respectively. Moreover, it outperforms the Gurobi solver in large instances in terms of throughput time. The real case study shows that the system throughput time and the manual cost can be reduced by about 25% and 16%, compared with the assignment rule used in practice.",1366-5545,Not found
The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem with stochastic travel time: A reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102816,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"As a novel urban delivery approach, the coordinated operation of a truck–drone pair has gained increasing popularity, where the truck takes a traveling salesman route and the drone launches from the truck to deliver packages to nearby customers. Previous studies have referred to this problem as the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FSTSP) and have proposed numerous algorithms to solve it. However, few studies have considered the stochasticity of the travel time on the road network, mainly caused by traffic congestion, harsh weather conditions, etc, which heavily impacts the speed of the truck, thus affecting the drone’s operations and overall delivery routine. In this study, we extend the FSTSP with stochastic travel times and formulate the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP). The model is solved using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms including the deep Q-network (DQN) and the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Using an artificially generated dataset that was widely accepted as benchmarks in the literature, we show that the reinforcement learning algorithms also perform well as approximate optimization algorithms, outperforming a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and a local search heuristic algorithm on the original FSTSP without the stochastic travel time. On the FSTSP with stochastic travel time, the reinforcement learning algorithms obtain flexible policies that make dynamic decisions based on different traffic conditions on the roads, saving up to 28.65% on delivery time compared with the MIP model and a dynamic local search (DLS) algorithm. We also conduct a case study using real-time traffic data collected in a middle-sized city in the U.S. using Google Map API. Compared with a benchmark calculated by the DLS, the DRL approach saves 32.68% total delivery time in the case study, showing great potential for future practical adoption.",1366-5545,Not found
Evasion strategy for a coastal cargo ship with unpunctual arrival penalty under sulfur emission regulation,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102818,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"To comply with the sulfur emission control area (ECA) regulation, a ship can burn expensive MGO (marine gas oil) inside ECA but relatively cheap VLSFO (very low sulfur fuel oil) outside ECA. This paper investigates a coastal cargo ship’s evasion strategy, which refers to a detour decision that decreases its sailing distance within ECA and increases its sailing distance outside ECA to save fuel costs. To this end, a voyage cost minimization model is proposed to determine the optimal sailing trajectory and speed profile inside and outside ECA. A distinguishing feature is that the ship’s sailing time is endogenously determined, depending on the penalties imposed on early and late arrivals. The necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained so that the ship operators can quickly determine whether ECA evasion can save voyage costs. It is demonstrated that the evasion triggering condition depends on the fuel price ratio of VLSFO to MGO and the relative position between the ports and the ECA boundary. Compared with non-evasion, the ship operators have less incentive to arrive punctually under evasion. The proposed models are applied to compare the evasion behavior of ships operating in the coastal ECAs of China and the US. The resultant economic and environmental impacts of ship’s evasion behavior are further discussed from the government’s perspective. The numerical results suggest significant differences arise due to the different widths of the two ECAs.",1366-5545,Not found
Modeling the effects of government subsidy and regulation on BOT transport project contract design within contractible service quality,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102820,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Government subsidy and regulation are frequently employed to encourage the private sector to participate fully in Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) transport projects. Besides service charge, the service quality of BOT transport project (i.e., maintenance quality, toll service, operational monitoring, emergency management, safety management and so on) is also an important factor affecting the choice of users. This paper studies the optimal service quality decisions in both concession period (CP) and post-CP, in which we assume that the market demand is dependent on both service price and service quality. Firstly, in the absence of subsidy scheme, we derive the related players’ optimal decisions of toll charge, contractible service quality, project capacity and length of CP in the BOT contract design process. Secondly, we investigate how to design an optimal BOT transport project contract when the government subsidizes the private sector. Thirdly, we explore the effects of government regulation policies (i.e., price cap regulation and service quality floor regulation) on the BOT contract design. Finally, we make three extensions to further examine the impacts of the demand uncertainty, the risk-aversion attitude of private sector, the asymmetric cost information and the nonlinear demand function on the BOT contract design. From our model results, some policy implications are derived regarding BOT transport project contract design when the service quality is a fundamental contractible variable.",1366-5545,Not found
Integrated aviation model and metaheuristic algorithm for hub-and-spoke network design and airline fleet planning,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102755,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Most extant studies on aviation’s hub-and-spoke network focus on the optimization problems from the perspective of economies of scale thanks to the inherent inter-hub connections, whereas the economies of scale on each route is contingent on the associated allocation of different types of aircraft. In this paper, we devise an integrated model of hub-and-spoke network design and fleet planning with the constraints of the passenger flow demand as well as the adaptation of different types of aircraft for each route, with the objective to minimize the total system cost (i.e., the sum of the hub setting cost and aircraft’s related cost). To tackle the complexity of the integrated model, we develop a heuristic solution algorithm based on a Genetic Algorithm framework and an improved Floyd–Warshall algorithm to solve the value of the fitness function. The proposed model and the developed algorithms are tested with the US flight network (i.e., the CAB dataset) and China’s aviation network. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the demand window is one of the critical factors that affect hub-and-spoke network design and fleet planning, while the utilization rate of specified aircraft fleet determines the fleet configuration, which poses relatively less impact on hub-and-spoke network design.",1366-5545,Not found
Offline supplementary service strategies for the online marketplace: Third-party service or marketplace service?,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102810,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Offline supplementary service that supports and enhances the core product is one of the key factors leading to the success of online sellers and the online marketplace. We explore the optimal supplementary service strategies for the online seller and online marketplace. We consider three kinds of supplementary service, namely unauthorised service (UAS), third-party authorised service (TAS), and marketplace authorised service (MAS). We identify that the marginal cost-revenue ratio (MCRR) shapes the service strategies of the online seller and marketplace. The seller prefers TAS when the MCRR is low but prefers UAS if it is high. However, when the MCRR is moderate, the seller provides both UAS and TAS simultaneously. In addition, we show that the marketplace offers MAS to the seller when the commission rate is relatively low or relatively high. The offering of MAS results in a win–win outcome for the seller and marketplace, and engenders a subsidising effect for the seller and consumer, as well as a revenue-enhancement effect for the marketplace. Interestingly, we find that a higher commission rate not only decreases the selling price but also increases the demand for the product-MAS bundle.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimality-guaranteed algorithms on the dynamic shared-taxi problem,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102809,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Shared mobility has attracted increasing attention due to its advantages in relieving traffic congestion and low-carbon environmental protection. This paper studies the dynamic shared-taxi problem of the on-demand shared-taxi system, where we introduce a rescheduling ratio to measure the proportion of requests that can be rescheduled in the total scheduled requests. To match vehicles and passengers in the on-demand platforms with high quality and efficiency, we formulate the problem into a mixed-integer model and develop two optimality-guaranteed algorithms, the branch-and-price algorithm and the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm. The two algorithms share a common subproblem which is solved by dynamic programming in parallel to speed up the solving. Computational results reveal that the branch-and-price algorithm and the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm are significantly superior to the commercial solver (Gurobi) in terms of the solution quality, solvable problem size, and the computational time. Specifically, the branch-and-price algorithm is superior in solution quality, while the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions for several large-scale instances faster. After that, we further compare the proposed algorithms with several commonly used heuristic algorithms to verify the necessity of developing optimality-guaranteed algorithms. Finally, sensitivity analyses of the rescheduling ratio factor are carried out to provide several insights for the shared-taxi platform on balancing the relationship between the system-wide profit and user experience.",1366-5545,Not found
Vehicle routing problems with drones equipped with multi-package payload compartments,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102757,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The vehicle routing problem with drones (VRP-D) consists of designing combined truck-drone routes and schedules to serve a set of customers with specific requests and time constraints. In this paper, VRP-D is extended to include a fleet of drones equipped with multi-package payload compartments to serve more customers on a single trip. Moreover, a drone can return to a truck, different from the one from which it started, to swap its depleted battery and/or to pick up more packages. This problem, denoted as VRP-D equipped with multi-package payload compartments (VRP-D-MC), aims to maximize total profit.

Truthful multi-attribute multi-unit double auctions for B2B e-commerce logistics service transactions,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102814,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This study investigates truthful multi-attribute multi-unit double auction mechanism design problem for B2B e-commerce logistics service transactions (LSTs). The optimization problem of the auctioneer is modeled as an integer program to maximize social welfare where the utility of shippers is related to their monetary profits and non-price attributes of corresponding carriers. To handle the information asymmetry of price and non-price attributes, a Multi-Attribute Multi-unit Trade Reduction (MA-MTR) mechanism is proposed to resolve the problem in a decentralized setting.

Collaborative truck multi-drone routing and scheduling problem: Package delivery with flexible launch and recovery sites,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102788,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper deals with the problem of coordinating a truck and multiple heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) for last-mile package deliveries. Existing literature on truck–drone tandems predominantly restricts the UAV launch and recovery operations (LARO) to customer locations. Such a constrained setting may not be able to fully exploit the capability of drones. Moreover, this assumption may not accurately reflect the actual delivery operations. In this research, we address these gaps and introduce a new variant of truck–drone tandem that allows the truck to stop at non-customer locations (referred to as flexible sites) for drone LARO. The proposed variant also accounts for three key decisions — (i) assignment of each customer location to a vehicle, (ii) routing of truck and UAVs, and (iii) scheduling drone LARO and truck operator activities at each stop, which are always not simultaneously considered in the literature. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to jointly optimize the three decisions with the objective of minimizing the delivery completion time (or makespan). To handle large problem instances, we develop an optimization-enabled two-phase search algorithm by hybridizing simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search. Numerical analysis demonstrates substantial improvement in delivery efficiency of using flexible sites for LARO as opposed to the existing approach of restricting truck stop locations.

Foresighted medical resources allocation during an epidemic outbreak,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102762,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"While some reports show that the existing real-life medical resources allocations during epidemic outbreaks are myopic, some experts claim that medical resources allocations based on foresighted future allocations might enable a better balance of supply and demand. To investigate this claim, we develop a foresighted medical resources allocation model to help governments manage large-scale epidemic outbreaks. We formulate a demand forecasting model with a general demand forecasting function based on the last-period demands, extra demand caused by the last-period unfulfilled demand, and uncertain demand. In the foresighted allocation model, the government decides the current-period allocation based on the foresighted demand, which considers the last-period area demand and uncertain demand from the current period to the end of a planning horizon, using a stochastic dynamic program. We find that the optimal allocation is a function of the allocation capacity in each period. The optimal foresighted allocation is always higher than the optimal static (one-period) allocation and decreases with allocation capacity. When the allocation capacity is sufficiently large, the foresighted demand is close to the static demand. Besides, if the cost of oversupply is close to zero, the optimal allocations for both the foresighted allocation and one-period models are the allocation capacity. Our results provide useful managerial implications for a government contemplating medical resources allocation in response to an epidemic outbreak.",1366-5545,Not found
Selection of vehicle size and extent of multi-drop deliveries for autonomous goods vehicles: An assessment of potential for change,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102806,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper examines how vehicle size and multi-drop deliveries may change as a result of the removal of the driver cost for autonomous goods vehicles. Analysis is conducted by combining parameters derived from transport economics and vehicle engineering for a series of increasingly complex applications, ultimately incorporating a unique vehicle routing problem formulation for two multi-destination applications. It is concluded that while the removal of the driver cost produced the greatest savings, the use of smaller vehicles and fewer deliveries per journey could produce incremental savings, dependent on the application. The incremental savings and potential change in vehicle sizes and number of deliveries was greatest for applications: 1) where the human driver would otherwise constitute a greater proportion of overall cost (such as urban deliveries), 2) where there is greater dispersion of delivery locations relative to the origin depot, 3) where the value of the cargo time is higher. For a UK customer deliveries case study currently using 3.5 t vans, a shift to smaller 2.1 t vans performing 40–60% fewer stops per route could lead to an additional 7–16% of cost savings, or up to 75% savings when combined with the direct driver cost savings. By contrast, for a UK supermarket distribution case study using 44 t articulated trucks, the introduction of some 26 t rigids serving fewer stops per route indicated effectively negligible potential savings compared to the 22–32% of savings due to the removal of the driver. Conclusions are conditional on treating a number of aspects of the logistics system as fixed in order to isolate factors of interest. Realistically, such aspects may be subject to change in future scenarios under the combined impact of autonomous freight vehicles and other trends.",1366-5545,Not found

We propose a multi-commodity, develop an exact branch-and-cut algorithm with patching heuristics to efficiently tackle this problem, and provide insightful analyses based on optimal plans. The simplicity of the proposed approach is an important aspect, as it facilitates its usage in practice, opposed to complicated stochastic or probabilistic methods. The computational experiments suggest that in the deterministic demand setting, pickups are mainly used to balance initial inventories, achieving an average total cost reduction of 1.1%, while transshipping 2.4% of total demand. Under uncertain demand, pickups are used extensively, achieving cost savings of up to 6.5% in specific settings. Overall, our sensitivity analysis shows that high inventory costs and high degrees of demand uncertainty drive the usage of pickups, which, counter-intuitively, are not desirable in every case.",1366-5545,Not found

Streamers perform for users in a virtual chat room on the platform. Users watch streamers’ performances and purchase virtual gifts for their favorite streamers. There are two types of streamers: non-contracted ones who stream independently and contracted ones who sign with and work for the platform. Based on observed industrial practice, the platform provides non-contracted streamers with a straight commission plan and contracted streamers with one of three alternative compensation plans, namely, the basic compensation plan (B-plan), salary-based incentive plan (SI-plan), and commission-based incentive plan (CI-plan). The platform first decides its compensation plans for two types of streamers, then the streamers decide their type and effort level. We explore and compare the streamers’ optimal decisions under different compensation plans. We interestingly find that the SI/CI bonus does not always motivate streamers to perform better. The SI bonus is only effective for the streamers whose ability is neither low nor high while the CI bonus can effectively motivate the majority of streamers except those having extremely low ability or some low-intermediate-ability streamers. In addition, the platform can screen out low-ability streamers and attract high-ability streamers to sign with it by properly designing its compensation plans. Finally, we examine managerial insights for the platform. We show that both SI-plan and CI-plan result in higher expected profits for the platform than the B-plan.",1366-5545,Not found

Tackling uncertainties in aircraft maintenance routing: A review of emerging technologies,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102805,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Aircraft maintenance routing (AMR) is crucial for both passenger airlines and cargo airlines to maintain flight operations efficiency, meanwhile it ensures that aircraft fulfill the civil aviation safety regulations in respect to maintenance checking. An optimal AMR solution can maximize the aircraft utilization for significantly increasing the airlines’ transport capacity and profitability. Therefore, extensive research works have been undertaken in this area. Traditionally, AMRs are optimized based on deterministic approaches. However, the theoretical optimality of the solution is usually difficult to achieve during practical operations due to disruptions arising from uncertainties. Thus, optimization of AMRs with uncertainty considerations has become more prevalent. More importantly, because of the maturity of technologies such as sensors nowadays, applications of these emerging technologies to tackle uncertainties have attracted much attention. Motivated by this, we conducted a critical review on AMR papers in handling uncertainties with emerging technologies. Currently, this is the first review in AMRs that contributes by systematically reviewing the emerging technologies in handling uncertainties in AMR. By reviewing 75 papers in the area, we have categorized the papers into four areas: uncertainty and robust solutions, big data and machine learning, smart technologies, and integrated information support systems. Based on the above, we also suggest some future research directions for researchers in the area.",1366-5545,Not found
Personalized route recommendation for ride-hailing with deep inverse reinforcement learning and real-time traffic conditions,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102780,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Personalized route recommendation aims to recommend routes based on users’ route preference. The vast amount of GPS trajectories tracking driving behavior has made deep learning, especially inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a popular choice for personalized route recommendation. However, current IRL studies assume that the traffic condition is static and approximate the expected state visitation frequencies to update the neural network. This study improves the IRL to recommend personalized routes considering real-time traffic conditions. We also improve the expected state visitation frequency calculation based on characteristics of ride-hailing and taxi trajectories to calculate the gradient of the neural network. In addition, the graph attention network is employed to capture the spatial dependencies between road segments. Numerical experiments using real ride-hailing trajectories in Chengdu, China validate our model. At last, a statistical test is conducted, and route preferences reflected by the same driver’s empty trajectories and occupied trajectories are found to have significant differences.",1366-5545,Not found
When it's the slaves that pay: In search of a fair due diligence cost distribution in conflict mineral supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102801,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Modern slavery and conflict minerals are often treated as two separate grand challenges governed by different legislation, yet conflict mineral settings commonly involve and inflict slavery in supply chains – hence these two wicked problems are deeply interconnected. This paper focuses on due diligence in the context of conflict mineral supply chains, and in doing so provides important insights for modern slavery in general. Using more than 38 h of recordings from exploratory interviews with 46 experts from 43 organizations, our study investigates: a) how due diligence costs and benefits are actually distributed in supply chains in practice; and b) the means through which due diligence costs and benefits can be (more appropriately) shared. We find that there is a lack of contextualization of cost-sharing mechanisms to conflict mineral supply chains, with most mechanisms being imported from the standard business literature where the producer must pay the production costs before reaping the benefits that offset these costs. But in conflict mineral supply chains, these benefits often do not materialize for the producer and, consequently, cost-sharing mechanisms lead to unintended consequences. The findings question the usefulness of due diligence, call for alternative financing mechanisms, and for contextualized solutions designed from the bottom up. This in turn has important implications for enhancing legislation on modern slavery.",1366-5545,Not found
A cost-based comparative analysis of different last-mile strategies for e-commerce delivery,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102783,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The growth of e-commerce has bridged the gap between the consumer and the retailer, bringing prosperity for both. However, in a quest to achieve even larger profits and market share, e-retailers compete to offer consumers cheaper shipping, expedited deliveries, free returns, and other lucrative deals. To keep pace with these growing needs of e-commerce, e-retailers have piloted various alternative distribution strategies. To aid a fuller understanding of the costs and benefits of these distribution strategies in diverse delivery environments, this work develops a multi-echelon last-mile distribution model using Continuous Approximation (CA) techniques. The model results suggest that traditional last-mile delivery with diesel trucks is a good fit for e-retailers delivering in dense environments with lenient temporal constraints (parcel service), a strategy that allows for demand consolidation and thus low-cost low-emission distribution. For e-retailers delivering in sparsely populated environments with stringent temporal constraints (grocery delivery), this work finds outsourcing alternatives (crowdsourced delivery, customer self-collection) to render low-cost distribution albeit with high emissions. As a result, the authors suggest the use of low-volume low-pollution vehicles from smaller consolidation facilities close to the market to provide expedited deliveries at fairly low costs and emissions. The analysis bolsters the case for the use of electric trucks for last-mile deliveries, as the study finds an electric truck fleet to not only eliminate tailpipe emissions but also to lower distribution costs compared to a diesel truck fleet. Thus, with this work the authors discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with different last-mile strategies for e-commerce delivery.",1366-5545,Not found
Estimating the reorder point for a fill-rate target under a continuous review policy in the presence of non-standard lead-time demand distributions,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102766,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Skewed and multimodal lead-time demand (LTD) distributions can be present in supply chains. Under these conditions, logistics managers find that conventional approaches, which assume standard LTD distribution shapes, yield unreliable estimates of a single item’s reorder point (ROP) in relation to meeting fill-rate targets under a continuous review inventory policy. Furthermore, logistics managers have limited data available from which to determine the true shape of the underlying LTD distribution. In this study, I present a non-parametric bootstrap approach to set a least-biased estimate of the ROP. In addition, to deriving bootstrap expressions for non-standard LTD shapes, I derive expressions for standard distribution shapes to estimate the ROP across a range of fill rates. Thus, eliminating the double counting of stockouts with conventional fill-rate measures. Using Monte Carlo simulation experiments, I show that in comparison to the conventional state-of-the-art approaches the non-parametric bootstrap approach yields the least-biased ROP estimates robust to both the shape of the LTD distribution and the sample size. This research offers more accurate ROP estimators, which can serve as a basis for expanding the scope of future inventory management research and enabling logistics managers to reduce inventory while maintaining and even improving fill rates.",1366-5545,Not found
The berth assignment and allocation problem considering cooperative liner carriers,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102793,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper investigates a novel extension of the berth allocation problem (BAP), which mainly determines berths and times for arriving vessels. Most previous studies on the BAP do not consider a cooperative environment among liner carriers. This paper proposes a berth assignment and allocation problem considering cooperative liner carriers (BAAP), which integrates the BAP with the berth assignment problem and the liner clustering problem (LCP). The LCP addresses how to group a number of liner carriers into various liner clusters, and the berth assignment problem aims to assign proper number of berths for serving vessels of various liner clusters. For solving our proposed problem, we develop a two-stage optimization method. In stage I, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is constructed to formulate our BAAP with given liner clusters, integrating the BAP with the berth assignment problem. According to the results obtained in stage I, a decision model based on cooperative game theory is presented to solve the LCP in stage II. A genetic algorithm framework embedded with a mixed-integer linear programming solver (CPLEX) is designed to solve the MINLP model constructed in stage I. The LCP in stage II can be solved by using the enumeration method. Experimental results are provided to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models and algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found
Urban consolidation centers and city toll schemes–Investigating the impact of city tolls on transshipment decisions,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102782,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Around the world, many cities are struggling with the negative effects of urban freight transport, such as congestion and emissions. To mitigate these negative effects, both innovative solutions, such as urban consolidation centers, and regulations, such as city toll schemes and delivery time windows, can be adopted. In this paper, we investigate the impact of city toll regulations on the vehicle routing and transshipment decisions of logistics service providers. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation and an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic that address the interdependent decisions of vehicle routing and the use of urban consolidation centers, taking into account city toll schemes and time window constraints. In this context, we consider heterogeneous fleets, multiple trips per vehicle, and use a multigraph to address the trade-off between fastest and cheapest paths. We validate the adaptive large neighborhood search by comparing it with the mixed-integer linear programming model on test instances with up to 20 customers. To analyze how city toll schemes affect the cost attractiveness of urban consolidation centers and the fleet composition of logistics service providers, we conduct an extensive computational study featuring real-world instances that provide managerial insights for both local administrations and logistics service providers. Our results show that both per-day and per-entrance tolls can be used by local administrations to support the use of urban consolidation centers and that the number of truck entries into urban areas can be reduced. However, our results also indicate that due to the transshipment fee per unit load, the cost attractiveness of using urban consolidation centers is considerably lower for logistics service providers with larger delivery quantities per stop.",1366-5545,Not found
Impacts of intercity commuting on travel characteristics and urban performances in a two-city system,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102792,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper investigates the effects of intercity commuting on travel characteristics and urban performances. A spatial equilibrium model of the two-city system which involves the travel mode choice and workplace selection equilibrium, as well as the housing demand and supply equilibrium, is proposed and well formulated. A two-level iterative procedure is presented, and the properties of the proposed model are analytically and numerically analyzed. The finding shows that, the improvement of intercity commuting always improves the households’ utility level. From the respects of spatial structure and intercity commuters, both two cities become more compact, the number of households residing in the less economically developed city and intercity commuters both increase with the improvement of intercity commuting condition when incomes are exogenous.

Strategic role of charitable donation in supply chain coordination with consumer prosocial preference,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102777,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Enterprises commonly make charitable donations to attract customers to purchase their products. We explore the supply chain coordination problem with charitable donation via a Stackelberg game, wherein the e-commerce platform is the leader and the manufacturer is the follower. The former sells the products and decides the commission, whereas the latter determines the charitable donation investment and price. We investigate the charitable donation and pricing strategies in a centralized and decentralized system, and obtain the following insights. (1) The donation and pricing strategies hinges on the proportion of prosocial customers and the donation cost coefficient. (2) Donation can increase the product price and the supply chain performance, unlike non-donation. (3) In the decentralized system with extremely profitable market conditions, charitable donation will aggravate the competition in the supply chain, which benefits the e-commerce platform but hurts the manufacturer. Nonetheless, under certain conditions, the coordination of supply chain can be automatically realized.

Optimizing driver consistency in the vehicle routing problem under uncertain environment,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102785,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper investigates the construction of routes over multiple days while maintaining driver consistency, which requires that the multi-day service of each customer be provided by as few different drivers as possible over a planning horizon. Furthermore, if one customer is assigned to different drivers over multiple days, it is desirable that services are provided by one driver on as many days as possible. To optimize this driver consistency, a new quantitative measure of driver consistency is defined. In the proposed vehicle routing problem with driver consistency, driver consistency is modeled in the objective function. Another contribution is that we model the vehicle routing problem with driver consistency considering uncertainties in customer demands, travel times, and service times. Uncertain programming models for the considered problem are developed utilizing uncertainty theory. A hybrid algorithm with large neighborhood search and simulated annealing is designed to address the proposed NP-hard problem. Computational experiments are conducted on several datasets to highlight the performance of the proposed approach and the models. The impacts of uncertainty and the trade-off between the total travel time and driver consistency are also analyzed to reveal some managerial insights. Our analysis shows that uncertainty has negative impacts on minimizing total travel time while can improve driver consistency in some cases; Remarkable reduction in the total travel time can be achieved with little damage on driver consistency; However, totally focusing on minimizing total travel time comes at the price of sacrificing driver consistency drastically.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal BOT contracts in a two-road transportation network,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102733,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"We consider the Build–Operate–Transfer (BOT) contracts for a newly built road within a transportation network which includes another existing free access road. We consider a standard BOT contract in which the firm builds and operates the new road in the concession period and then transfers it to the government in the post-concession period. We find that the government may not prefer the length of concession period as long as possible. Next, we consider a coordinated BOT contract between the government and the firm to form a board to build and operate the new road over the whole life. In such a case, we transform a bi-objective programming problem as a weighted sum of the profit of firm and social welfare of the society. We find that social welfare may not always increase with the government’s weight. Besides, if the government weight is low, the coordinated BOT contract will lead to a wider road than the standard BOT contract, even if the construction cost is high. If the government weight is high, the coordinated BOT contract will lead to a wider road if the construction cost is very low. In other cases, the coordinated BOT contract leads to a narrower road compared to the standard BOT contract.",1366-5545,Not found
Pricing and quality strategies for an on-demand housekeeping platform with customer-intensive services,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102760,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In this paper, we study an on-demand housekeeping platform in which suppliers have heterogeneous opportunity costs, and customers are sensitive to service quality, price, and waiting time. The platform charges fees from customers and divides revenue with service suppliers in a certain proportion. We analyze two types of market coverage, namely full market coverage and partial market coverage. We find that as the potential demand market capacity expands, the platform will choose to lower prices to attract more customers and service suppliers until it reaches the partial market, thereby obtaining higher revenue, and suppliers will provide lower quality services to serve more customers and thus obtain more wages. Moreover, we show that the partial market is more favorable to the platform than the full market. However, for service suppliers, the partial market is not always more favorable. Meanwhile, as customers are more sensitive to the service value, suppliers will tend to lower their service rates to improve service quality, and the platform will tend to set higher service prices. Interestingly, we observe that when the sensitivity of service value is relatively small, the sensitivity of service value has even the opposite effect on the platform’s revenue and service suppliers’ payoffs, as well as the equilibrium number of service suppliers in different market scenarios. In addition, different market scenarios also will lead to the opposite effect of the service cost on the optimal equilibrium price, arrival rate, and service rate. However, the increase in the service cost will lead to a decrease in platform revenue and service supplier payoffs and the number of service suppliers in both market scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found
A multimodal multicommodity network equilibrium model with service capacity and bottleneck congestion for China-Europe containerized freight flows,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102786,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"As a traditional way for transporting containerized cargoes, international liner shipping has long played a dominant role in the China-Europe freight transportation market. In recent years, China Railway Express has offered a new and competitive freight transportation option, contributing to a significant increase in the trade volume by rail between China and Europe. With the goal of providing a holistic computational tool that can predict and analyze the spatial distribution of containerized freight flows and suggest strategic transportation infrastructure and service expansion options, this paper develops and implements a multimodal multicommodity freight transportation network equilibrium model, based on a newly constructed supernetwork integrating international liner shipping lines, international freight rail services, and international and domestic highway networks in relevant countries. The combined transportation mode-route choice behavior of individual shippers is characterized by the widely used multinomial logit model, where the values of time of different commodity categories are included in its utility functions. The congestion effects arising from bottleneck facilities along liner shipping and freight rail lines (i.e., seaports, water channels, and break-of-gauge stations) are first captured by queueing models and then approximated by polynomial delay functions, while the accommodation capacity of individual service lines is explicitly embedded into the model as hard constraints. This supernetwork equilibrium model is tackled by a subgradient algorithm in the Lagrangian relaxation framework embedding a disaggregate simplicial decomposition algorithm. Computational experiments are conducted with a multi-layer, hetero-structure set of supply and demand data collected from multiple data repositories, government agencies, freight carriers, and research papers and reports. The preliminary results exhibit the computational performance of the solution procedure and reveal the variation of congestion levels of bottleneck facilities, capacity usage profiles of service lines, and competitiveness conditions between liner shipping and freight rail services under different monthly demand patterns.",1366-5545,Not found
A risk-averse approach for joint contract selection and slot allocation in liner container shipping,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102781,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Liner shipping companies need to satisfy the shipping demand from both the long-term contracts and the spot market. In general, the container shipping demand of the long-term contract has more stable volumes but lower freight rates compared with the spot market demand. It is thus a critical problem for the shipping companies how to provide discriminative shipping services to these two types of shipping demand through contract selection and container slot allocation to simultaneously increase the shipping profit and control its variations resulting from the demand variations. To handle this problem, a two-stage stochastic programming model is constructed in this paper which adopts the Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to measure the profit variations. In the first stage, the shipping company selects the long-term contracts from a candidate contract set to sign with customers under the uncertainties in the show-up rates of containers in long-term contracts, and the volumes and the freight rates of the spot market demands. In the second stage, after all uncertainties have been realized, the shipping company determines the slot allocation for both the contract and spot demands. With the introduction of the CVaR, classical Benders decomposition cannot be directly applied to solve the risk-averse model. This paper thus develops a risk-averse Benders decomposition method tailored for the model. Numerical experiments are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the solution method and provide some meaningful managerial insights.",1366-5545,Not found
Quadratic quantity discount contract under price-dependent demand and consumer returns,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102756,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This study introduces a new type of supply contract, the quadratic quantity discount contract, whose average transfer payment is a quadratic function. Thus, both the total and average quantity discounts increase nonlinearly in order quantity, unlike the typical linear quantity discount contract, whose total discount is nonlinear but average payment is a linear function of order quantity. We reveal the quadratic quantity discount contract’s unique properties by comparing it with linear quantity discount and wholesale price contracts. Our investigation, conducted in basic and closed-loop supply chain situations, reveals the potential of the quadratic quantity discount contract to be considered a serious choice for supply chain managers in various situations. Specifically, we reveal that the quadratic quantity discount contract always coordinates the supply chain, achieving the first-best supply chain profit while always enhancing the profits of all players. This is the most important difference from the typical linear quantity discount contract that entails a profit distribution problem and bargaining power issues. Further, unlike other contracts, its profit improvement performance is predictable; moreover, it offers the acceptable wholesale price with an additional nonlinear average discount. However, when the supplier can exercise its power and only considers its own profit, the typical linear quantity discount contract can be considered the better option, as it produces superior profits for the supplier, but the profits of the retailer and supply chain are sacrificed in this case. If the supplier considers the supply chain’s long-term health and wants voluntary compliance from other players, the quadratic quantity discount contract is the optimal choice.",1366-5545,Not found

Competitors or frenemies? Strategic investment between competing channels,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102784,164,2022-08-01,2022,8,"It is increasingly common for an online retailer to invest in a competitor offline retailer, or vice versa. In order to identify the conditions under which this type of cross-investment in a competitor is attractive, we develop a duopoly model with an e-tailer and a brick-and-mortar (BM) retailer, and ask when, or whether, one member of the duopoly should invest in the other. The impact of the investment decision on the duopoly’s leadership structure, prices, demands, and profits are investigated. Our study shows that the investor chooses to invest in the investee when the investee’s value is medium; the investment can weaken the price competition between the two channels, and lead to a win-win outcome. When there is no cross-channel investment, the member of the duopoly that is more efficient in selling the product should take the leadership role by setting the selling price first. When one member of the duopoly does decide to invest in the other, however, the leadership decision depends strongly on the relative initial values of the two retailers. Finally, we show that when the initial value of the investee as estimated by the investor is sufficiently low, and the customer’s degree of acceptance of the e-tailer’s channel is sufficiently high, the investor prefers to be an investment holder; otherwise, the investor prefers to receive a dividend.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal deployment of autonomous buses into a transit service network,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102865,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Autonomous vehicles empowered by emerging automation technologies are highly anticipated to be introduced into public transit service operations in the future mobility system. Considering the low acceptance rate of the new service with autonomous buses when it is initially put into practice, it is not ideal to make a “one-off” deployment to replace all the service lines with autonomous bus services. Rather, the service operator is to determine an optimal plan for the deployment of autonomous buses onto different service lines in multiple stages. This paper proposes a multi-stage mathematical modeling framework to optimize the deployment strategy in which conventional buses are sequentially replaced by autonomous buses. More specifically, the model decides when (at which planning stage) and where (on which service line in the network) the deployment of autonomous buses should be conducted. Passengers’ acceptance attitudes towards autonomous buses are explicitly considered in their transit routing choices. To forecast the evolution of the passengers’ adoption rate of the autonomous bus service, a diffusion model is applied. The proposed multi-stage planning model framework, which is indeed a mixed-integer nonlinear program, is to determine the optimal deployment strategy that minimizes the total travel cost during the planning horizon. A two-phase solution method that combines a searching algorithm and a double projection method is proposed to solve the model. Finally, numerical studies are conducted to test the validity of the modeling framework and solution method.

Managing inventory financing in a volatile market: A novel data-driven copula model,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102854,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Inventory financing is crucial to helping businesses survive during an economic crisis—such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic—and supporting economic recovery in the aftermath. However, inventory financing is particularly risky in a volatile market environment since fluctuating collateral prices increase default risk. This paper presents an innovative data-driven copula model that was combined with the European call option theory to set loan-to-value ratios and determine interest rates that can help improve inventory finance providers’ (IFPs) competitiveness and manage their risk in volatile market environments. Specifically, the loan-to-value ratio estimated by the data-driven GARCH-EVT-Copula can help IFPs extract more value from collateral units due to its ability to capture both the autocorrelations among collateral prices and the dependencies among prices in different collateral units. The interest rate determination model derived from the European call option theory is employed to derive interest rates and reveal the risks of collateral units. The generated loan-to-value ratio and interest rate can serve as a reference for IFPs when preparing inventory financing contracts. Furthermore, the copula parameterization process can help IFPs identify the least risky and most predictable collateral unit. Finally, an extended analysis over the COVID-19 period demonstrates that the proposed approach can offer superior performance in a highly volatile market environment.",1366-5545,Not found
Manufacturer's contract choice and retailer's returns management strategy,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102862,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Managing customer returns is a supply chain issue; manufacturers typically manage them through buyback contracts, while retailers can attempt to recover a product’s salvage value, or sell it as an open-box item. This paper investigates returns management strategies by developing a game theoretical model for a supply chain with a manufacturer (Stackelberg leader) and a retailer (the follower) facing customer returns. The manufacturer chooses either a buyback or a wholesale-price contract. Under a wholesale-price contract, the retailer either salvages or resells returned products. We identify the optimal returns management strategy. We show that each of the three strategies may achieve Pareto improvement for both supply chain members, and for the customers and society. The retailer’s choice to resell or not depends on its inspection cost, or the system efficiency of the supply chain in reselling a returned product relative to that in selling a new product. The manufacturer’s choice of contract depends on whether it can salvage a returned product more efficiently than the retailer, and on the retailer’s unit inspection cost of the returned product.

Dynamic bicycle relocation problem with broken bicycles,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102877,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"In response to the demand imbalance across stations with broken bicycles in a bicycle sharing system (BSS), this study proposes a novel decision problem that aims to determine the size of the fleet of relocation vehicles, the bicycle stations they are assigned to serve, and efficient adaptive routing plans to ensure a good level of bicycle inventory at each station and on a timely basis, by considering the broken bicycles in each station, which is referred to as the dynamic bicycle relocation problem with broken bicycle consideration (a.k.a DBRPB). Assuming that the numbers of broken bicycles and bicycle relocation demand at each bicycle station are independent random variables and will only be revealed upon the arrival of the relocation vehicle, the objective of the DBRPB is to maximize the expected total satisfied demand, comprising both relocation demand and broken bicycle demand, using the adaptive routing strategy while incorporating the deployment cost of the relocation vehicles. The relocation vehicle will adjust its relocation route after the actual demand is revealed, every time it visits a station. A tailored branch-and-price (B&P) approach is proposed to find the exact optimal solution of the DBRPB. To solve the pricing problem, a tailored Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated in the pricing problem of the B&P approach, to determine both the optimal value of the expected satisfied demand and the next station to visit, given the available information, including time, current station, the unordered set of unvisited stations and the bicycle inventory of the relocation vehicle.

Under each of the pricing strategies, stochastic dynamic programming models are developed to determine the optimal pricing and inventory policy so that each member’s total expected discounted profit over the planning horizon is maximized. Numerical studies are carried out to compare the performance of different pricing strategies. Results show that: the optimal inventory policy under different pricing strategies is a base-stock type; under DD strategy, both members should reduce prices as long as one member’s initial inventory level is above its base stock level; under DS and SD strategies, the member adopting dynamic pricing should reduce price if its initial inventory level is above its base stock level; there exists a Nash pricing strategy which is affected by market parameters including demand variety, market size, channel preference, and price sensitivities.",1366-5545,Not found
Strategic introduction of logistics retail and finance under competition and channel spillover,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102863,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Some novel operation modes of third-party logistics providers (3PLs) have been arising. 3PLs run retail businesses (i.e., logistics retail) and provide financial assistance to capital-constrained product suppliers (i.e., logistics finance). However, introducing logistics retail brings the effects of competition and channel spillover, which further affect logistics finance. This intrinsic connection raises key questions about whether and under what conditions the 3PL firm should cooperate with the supplier by integrating logistics services, retail, and financing. In this paper, we consider four scenarios to analyze this problem: logistics service, logistics finance, logistics retail, and logistics retail–finance. Interestingly, compared with the former two scenarios, the retail competition existing in the latter two scenarios will not consistently lower down sales prices and raise sales quantities, especially when the spillover effect, either positive or negative, is significant. Moreover, we find that the 3PL firm prefers the logistics retail–finance scenario in most cases because the intersection of selling and financing roles enables the 3PL firm to increase financing income by affecting two parties’ sales margins (diversion effect). However, the supplier prefers the logistics retail–finance scenario when the spillover effect is relatively small even negative and the unit logistics cost is relatively lower. Otherwise, with the increasing positive spillover effect, the supplier prefers the logistics retail scenario because the enhanced diversion effect enlarges competition losses. Finally, we find that a lower 3PL firm’s interest rate facilitates achieving a win-win result, especially when the spillover effect becomes negative.",1366-5545,Not found
Pricing and quality decisions with conspicuous consumers,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102857,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"With the growing demand of individuality, conspicuous consumption has gradually become a common phenomenon. This study focuses on how conspicuous consumption affects firm’s pricing, quality decisions and profit. By developing a game-theoretic model consisting of one monopolist who sells a conspicuously consumed status product and two segments of consumers, i.e., conspicuous consumers and non-conspicuous consumers (the former are less sensitive to price than the latter), we come to the following results. Firstly, the presence of conspicuous consumers benefits the firm by leading to higher quality and price when their price sensitivity is relatively low, while can hurt the firm by leading to lower quality and price regardless of the proportion of conspicuous consumers and the conspicuousness degree when their price sensitivity is quite high. Secondly, for a moderate price sensitivity, we find an interesting result that the proportion of conspicuous consumers shows a non-monotonic effect on the firm’s profit. Specifically, the firm’s profit increases (decreases) with the proportion of conspicuous consumers when the quality investment efficiency is high (low) and the conspicuousness degree is low (high), while the profit decreases first and then increases for those medium quality investment efficiency and conspicuousness degree. Furthermore, we find that the joint decisions on quality and price exhibit strategic complementarity. Finally, the robustness of the results obtained is verified in numerous model extensions.",1366-5545,Not found
A machine learning-driven two-phase metaheuristic for autonomous ridesharing operations,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102835,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This paper contributes to the intersection of operations research and machine learning in the context of autonomous ridesharing. In this work, autonomous ridesharing operations are reproduced through an event-based simulation approach and are modeled as a sequence of static subproblems to be optimized. The optimization framework consists of a novel data-driven metaheuristic within a two phase approach. The first phase consists of a greedy insertion heuristic that assigns new online requests to vehicles. The second phase consists of a local-search based metaheuristic that iteratively revisits previously-made vehicle-trip assignments through intra- and inter-vehicle route exchanges. These exchanges are performed by selecting from a pool of destroy–repair operators using a machine learning approach that is trained offline on a large dataset composed of more than one and a half million examples of previously-solved autonomous ridesharing subproblems. Computational results are performed on multiple dynamic instances extracted from real ridesharing data published by Uber Technologies Inc. Results show that the proposed machine learning-based optimization approach outperforms benchmark state-of-the-art data-driven metaheuristics by up to about nine percent, on average. Managerial insights highlight the correlation between selected vehicle routing features and the performance of the metaheuristics in the context of autonomous ridesharing operations.",1366-5545,Not found
An integrated multi-objective model for disaster waste clean-up systems optimization,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102867,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Post-disaster waste clean-up systems are complex and expensive operations that need to consider multiple stakeholders with different objectives. We propose a mixed-integer programming model that models the waste clean-up operations as a two-echelon system. The model decides on the location of waste processing facilities, the use of demolition resources, and the number and type of vehicles to be assigned to each echelon at each time slot of the planning horizon. The objectives considered in the model include minimizing environmental impacts, economic costs, and total time spent on the operations. Numerical results obtained on a case study based on the '2009 Victoria Black Saturday Bush-fires' case and on synthetically generated instances are used to obtain Pareto frontiers. The research concludes that the three objectives considered are indeed conflictive, and the explicit consideration of each goal can help decision-makers find the best trade-off solutions.",1366-5545,Not found
Service interruption and customer withdrawal in the congested facility location problem,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102866,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This research addresses the location problem of congested facilities, assuming service interruptions and customer withdrawals. Service interruptions can occur as a result of events such as machine failures, power outages, and communication system disconnections. As long as no interruption occurs, each facility functions as a M/M/1 queuing system. Upon an interruption, the server stops working, and customers receiving service or waiting in line leave the queue before being served. Moreover, customers who visit the facility during the repair avoid entering the facility. The problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, for which two piecewise mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) relaxations, an exact solution algorithm (the branch and bound algorithm), and a metaheuristic algorithm (the antlion algorithm), are then presented for solution. Numerical experiments indicate the efficiency of the branch and bound algorithm.

"Store brand introduction, retail competition and manufacturers’ coping strategies",10.1016/j.tre.2022.102861,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Many retailers offer store brands, which causes fierce competition between store brands of different retailers. In this paper, we discuss whether a retailer should launch a store brand when another retailer may also introduce a store brand. We find that if a store brand’s base level of demand is low, the retailer is more likely to launch the store brand when the degree of competition between the store brand and the national brand is lower. Our finding contrasts with the literature, which indicates that the store brand should be introduced when the competition is fierce. Moreover, both retailers have incentives to introduce store brands, although they obtain less profit due to the introduction of store brands. Furthermore, when a retailer launches a store brand, the manufacturer should not tilt trade terms towards the retailer with the store brand and may increase the wholesale price of the national brand. Our finding provides support for the Robinson–Patman Act, which requires the manufacturer to offer all retailers with products at identical wholesale prices. Finally, we identify the conditions under which one retailer only sells the national brand and another retailer only sells the store brand.",1366-5545,Not found
B2C car-sharing services: Sharing mode selection and value-added service investment,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102836,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This work investigates the sharing mode selection strategy of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the value-added service investment strategy of a business-to-consumer car-sharing platform. The OEM has three sharing modes, i.e., Mode N, only selling shared cars to the platform, Mode B, selling shared cars to the platform and providing the car-sharing services by itself, and Mode A, selling shared cars to the platform and consigning the platform as an agent to manage its shared cars. The platform decides whether to invest in value-added services. Some important findings are obtained. Regardless of the platform’s value-added service investment and the commission rate, for a low fixed investment cost, the OEM should select Mode B if the offline operating cost is relatively low, and select Mode A otherwise. For a high fixed investment cost, the OEM should select Mode N if the commission rate is relatively high and the offline operating cost is moderate, select Mode B if the commission rate is relatively high and the offline operating cost is relatively low, and select Mode A if the commission rate is relatively low or the commission rate and the offline operating cost are both relatively high. Additionally, the commission rate and the offline operating cost can significantly affect the platform’s profit. The value-added services decrease the OEM’s demand but increase the profits of both the OEM and the platform. Two extensions are considered, including the change in the power structure of the supply chain and the free-riding effect of the OEM.",1366-5545,Not found
What value does blockchain bring to the imported fresh food supply chain?,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102859,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, blockchain has been widely used to trace imported fresh food information from sources to destinations. Motivated by observations of real-world practice, we studied the role that blockchain played in imported fresh food supply chains. We first developed the basic models to examine the cases without and with blockchain. We derived the optimal pricing decisions for the supply chain and the conditions under which using blockchain was profitable under each model. To assess the robustness of the results, we then analyzed how risk attitudes affected the optimal supply chain decisions. We found some interesting results: When the effect of assuaging consumers’ safety concerns brought by blockchain was not obvious, blockchain was more likely to help the manufacturer and retailer increase their profits; otherwise, the value of blockchain was not significant. Besides, the risk-averse manufacturer and retailer would decrease their prices in response to the risks of demand fluctuations. Also, the blockchain platform would benefit from the risk-averse manufacturer and retailer but suffer from risk-averse consumers.",1366-5545,Not found

A growing number of studies have investigated the various aspects pertaining to ADR-based delivery operations. Nevertheless, there is a lack of extensive literature review that holistically reports on various problems in ADR-based delivery operations, adopted methodologies, novel findings, and future needs. This paper aims to systematically survey the existing research on ADR-based delivery systems and associated operations. Foremost, we discuss various technology, design, and legal factors that impact ADR operations. Subsequently, we are the first to review the state-of-the-art research in ADR-based deliveries concerning the following areas—routing, infrastructure and fleet planning, factors affecting efficiency, technology acceptance, and social intelligence. Finally, we anticipate potential challenges from an operations management perspective, identify research gaps, and delineate future research opportunities for ADR-based deliveries.",1366-5545,Not found
Community logistics for dynamic vehicle dispatching: The effects of community departure “time” and “space”,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102842,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The rise of e-commerce has completely transformed the dynamicity and problem nature of last-mile delivery, owing to significant B2C customer demand in compact urban areas. Given the unprecedented growths of urban last-mile deliveries, this paper proposes a novel postponement prioritized-route optional approach, namely Community Logistics (CL), as a new logistics tool to manage dynamic arrivals of delivery requests received in e-commerce hubs. Each vehicle is responsible for serving a “community”. At each decision epoch, fragmented e-commerce delivery requests arrived at the depot are either allocated to a community or postponed to later epochs for actual last-mile delivery. With an objective of consolidating newly arrived requests, we develop two dynamic policies – temporal and spatial, respectively for temporally delaying vehicle’s departure and spatially allocating more pre-partitioned geographical cells into one community. The main contribution of this study lies in a spatiotemporal relativity analysis and a comparative analysis. The former demonstrates the essence of incorporating both dynamic community departure times and dynamic community regions into managing urban e-commerce deliveries, whereas the latter validates the merits of Community Logistics against dynamic vehicle routing solutions. In the end, we call for further developments of community logistics strategies to address the impacts of urban deliveries due to the rise of e-commerce and online shopping.",1366-5545,Not found
How does Store Branded Lookalike Packaging Affect Competition in a Dyadic Supply Chain: A Consumer Confusion Perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102841,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Store branded lookalike packaging resembling national brand product (NB) packaging creates confusion for consumers who are uncertain about their quality preference of the store brand product (SB). This paper presents a model for exploring the NB manufacturer’s wholesale price decision, and the response of the SB retailer, considering consumer confusion. Consumers differ in their quality preferences for products and are classified into two groups: deliberate and confused, depending on whether they have precise quality preferences of the SB. We find that when facing a hybrid structure of consumers, the retailer will introduce the SB only when the quality preference difference between high- and low-end consumers is moderate. When the SB is offered, the retailer may not always benefit from targeting low-end consumers with the SB only; a mixed strategy by attracting low-end (high-end) consumers to the national (store) brand product can bring higher profit. Examining the effect of consumer confusion, we find that it may bring a win-win, lose-lose, or win-lose situation for the manufacturer and retailer, depending on the quality preference difference and proportion of high-end consumers. We then consider the case when being deliberate is a choice of the consumer, finding that the retailer will induce consumers to be deliberate only when the store brand quality is low. Consumer confusion will always create a win-win outcome for the manufacturer and retailer when (1) SB quality is higher than NB quality, (2) SB quality is endogenized, or (3) consumers are confused about their quality preference for both the NB and SB. The consumer surplus may be enhanced or weakened, depending on the retailer’s market segmentation strategy. Our results reconcile some discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical findings regarding the impacts of consumer confusion about the SB derived from lookalike packaging on a two-echelon supply chain, and our insights are robust.",1366-5545,Not found
Anti-Counterfeiting in a retail Platform: A Game-Theoretic approach,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102839,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The retail platform has developed rapidly, but the problem of fake products has also become increasingly severe. This paper investigates the impact of anti-counterfeiting in a retail platform and the incentives for the platform and the manufacturer to invest in anti-counterfeiting technology by using a game-theoretic model. We consider that the product can be sold directly by the manufacturer, or indirectly through a reseller on the platform. The reseller might also sell fake products, but the platform and the manufacturer can use anti-counterfeiting technology to fight against the fakes. Our analysis shows that the payoff of anti-counterfeiting in the retail platform is not always positive. Specifically, when the production valuation is low, the anti-counterfeiting payoff for the platform (the manufacturer) is negative if the proportion of fakes is sufficiently low (high). We also find that anti-counterfeiting may harm consumer surplus and social welfare. In addition, if the investment cost of anti-counterfeiting is high, at most one firm, either the platform or the manufacturer, has the incentive to invest in anti-counterfeiting contingent on the relative valuation on the platform’s services. Finally, with the investment in anti-counterfeiting, the platform should provide better services than before for surviving in the market.",1366-5545,Not found
Implications of government subsidies on shipping companies’ shore power usage strategies in port,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102840,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The shore power available in ports has a low utilization rate, though its use is an effective way to reduce pollution emissions. Encouraging shipping companies to use shore power has become an important issue in green port construction. This paper builds a Nash game between two shipping companies regarding the decision to use shore power and analyzes the impact of government intervention on the equilibrium that can be reached between them. The result shows that in the absence of government intervention, an equilibrium between the two shipping companies in the use of shore power would require a sufficient benefit. Unfortunately, the two shipping companies could be caught in a prisoner’s dilemma when they reach such an equilibrium. However, government intervention through price subsidies can improve this situation, either by expanding the area in which an equilibrium is reached or by mitigating the toll of the prisoner’s dilemma. Moreover, price subsidies are also conducive to improving supply chain profits and social welfare. The paper also analyzes the mutual influence between different government intervention methods and the impact of other important factors on the performance of government subsidies.",1366-5545,Not found
A big data approach to cargo type prediction and its implications for oil trade estimation,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102831,165,2022-09-01,2022,9,"To estimate global crude oil trade flows, current research either considers only crude oil tankers, or simply applies external information to distinguish between crude and refined product oil cargoes transported by coated product tankers; these limitations often reduce an estimation’s accuracy or compromise replicability. Our methodology directly addresses these issues by applying the random forest (RF) ensemble learning technique to Automatic Identification System (AIS) data in order to predict the cargo types of coated product tankers. By leveraging domain knowledge, we construct a set of unique input variables for the RF model, and use its predictions to quantify the global crude oil trade in a more accurate manner. Our estimation shows that coated product tankers were responsible for approximately 8% of global seaborne crude oil trade from 2017–2020. Further, unanticipated variations in the crude oil volume carried by these tankers are consistent with several major historical oil trade disruptions. Our study further extends current applications of AIS data in the domains of operations management and maritime transportation, and facilitates the exploration of the more minute characteristics of oil transportation. The resulting shipping dataset and associated decomposition strategy also enable relevant stakeholders to quickly identify emerging trade flow risks and adapt more effectively.",1366-5545,Not found

Free rider effect of quality information disclosure in remanufacturing,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102907,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"With increasing concerns about quality information disclosure strategy in the supply chain, little attention has been paid to the free-rider effect of quality information disclosure in remanufacturing. This paper fills this gap and finds that the free-rider effect will inhibit the manufacturer (supplier of new products with high-quality attribute) from disclosing quality information. With free-rider effect of quality information disclosure, the manufacturer takes advantage of the disclosure of the remanufacturer to improve consumers’ quality perception of new products. Interestingly, the remanufacturer (supplier of remanufactured products with low-quality attribute) voluntarily discloses the quality information of remanufactured products, which facilitates the manufacturer to be a free rider. The manufacturer takes a free ride only when the quality of remanufactured products is higher than a certain value. Otherwise, the manufacturer will actively disclose the quality of new products. Our work measures the value of the free-rider effect, explains the influence of free-rider effect on social welfare as well as the environmental impact and finds the free-rider effect is not always harmful to social welfare.",1366-5545,Not found

A hedging policy for seaborne forward freight markets based on probabilistic forecasts,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102881,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Rate volatilities in seaborne freight markets lead charterers and ship owners to use financial agreements such as Forward Freight Agreements (FFA) for fixing freight rates in advance. The use of FFAs requires effective hedging policies since fixing freight rates in advance might cause both benefits and opportunity costs depending on future rate changes. We propose a data-driven hedging policy prescribing purchasing decisions for FFAs based on comparisons of FFA rates with future spot rate forecasts. The proposed approach is based on probabilistic forecasts instead of point forecasts because the most accurate forecasts in terms of predictive errors do not necessarily lead to the best decisions. We adjust spot rate forecasts by selecting percentiles that result in minimum prescriptive errors (i.e., cost) in cross-validation. Experiments on synthetic data show that the probabilistic forecast-based hedging policy outperforms the point forecast-based policies and benchmark policies, including data-driven policies from the literature. Experiments on Baltic Exchange data from 15 dry bulk and tanker routes confirm the performance of the proposed policy. Compared to two different point forecast-based policies defined in this study, the proposed approach achieves on average 3.31% and 3.02% total procurement cost reduction per route in 15 routes for four years testing period. It results in from 0.67% to 4.79% cost reductions against the benchmark policies.",1366-5545,Not found
A dynamic routing protocol with payments for the Physical Internet: A simulation with learning agents,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102905,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The Physical Internet is meant to dynamically route hundreds of thousands of loads a day all over the world. Each time a load arrives at a node that is not its destination, a next node, a carrier, and a price should be jointly selected to get the load closer to its destination. The dynamic nature of the routing system and the large number of loads to process in short periods of time are problematic for standard optimization processes. Fast and easy to run protocols, like those we see employed in the Digital Internet, must be designed. Using a game theoretic approach, we design a protocol whose core component is an auctioning process run each time a load arrives at a new node different from its destination. The protocol promises to be fast, reliable, and resilient, and aims to minimize the price of the total routing process by using concepts like administrative distance as used in Digital Internet routers. If the behaviors of the carriers are rational, then the proposed auction, when played only one time, is Incentive Compatible, Allocatively Efficient, Budget Balanced, and respects Individual Rationality. The final protocol, however, involves three intelligent agents – shippers, nodes, and carriers – whose action space and interactions are too complex for pen and paper analysis. As a first step to understand the performance of such a new system, we simulate an environment with only Full-Truck-Loads in a market composed of single truck companies. We assume simple behaviors for shippers, and we use a learning process for nodes and carriers. We show that the usage of such a protocol is extremely efficient for it significantly reduces total delivery costs as well as empty mileage.",1366-5545,Not found

In this paper, we consider a fleet of HEVs in logistics operations and introduce the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (HEVRP).Since we allow HEVs to operate in different drive modes, we refer to this problem as the Multi-Mode HEVRP (MM-HEVRP). We first model the problem as a mixed-integer linear program, where the objective function minimizes the total cost of the distances traveled at different modes.Since the problem is not tractable, we develop a matheuristic approach to solve it.

Platform vs. Manufacturer: Who should implement innovation in e-commerce supply chains?,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102858,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"With increasing investments in technology innovations, such as artificial intelligence and augmented & virtual realities, e-commerce grows faster than ever before. In this paper, we analyze two innovation strategies: one is manufacturer innovation in which the manufacturer implements innovation; and the other is platform innovation in which the electronic retailer implements innovation. Moreover, we propose two types of e-commerce business structures which are widely adopted in reality: one is reselling structure in which the electronic retailer buys products from the manufacturer and resells them to consumers; the other is agency selling structure in which the manufacturer directly sells products to consumers through the platform by paying a commission fee. A theoretical model is developed to compare the above four scenarios. Our results show that under reselling structure, when platform innovation is as efficient as manufacturer innovation, manufacturer innovation achieves higher profit for both supply chain players, which implies that policy makers can encourage manufacturer innovation by providing incentive mechanisms. Whereas under agency selling, the impact of innovation efficiency on firms’ profit depends on the platform’s commission rate. Moreover, the manufacturer is more likely to benefit from platform innovation than the electronic retailer, and the electronic retailer is better off under agency selling.",1366-5545,Not found
Performance evaluation and optimization of design parameters for electric vehicle-sharing platforms by considering vehicle dynamics,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102869,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) faces many challenges such as range anxiety, high cost of EVs, and inadequate charging infrastructure. EV-sharing platforms resolve such concerns by setting up an optimal configuration for charging infrastructure and optimizing the charging decisions for depleted EVs. These platforms manage the vehicles’ flow to different charging stations and decide when and to what energy level the depleted vehicles should be recharged. Station-based platforms are one of the mainstream vehicle sharing systems where the customer picks-up and drops-off the vehicle at the designated stations. If a vehicle’s battery energy level falls below a threshold after completing the customer trip, it is charged either partially or fully at the charging station. This study addresses various operational and strategic decisions (such as the number of chargers, vehicle repositioning, and partial charging policy) for a one-way station-based EV-sharing platform using a stylized three-stage analytical framework. We use vehicle dynamics to model the EV powertrain and regenerative braking under different traffic conditions and simulate them using AVL CRUISE™. We model the platform operations using an open queuing network and provide a mixed-integer non-linear optimization program using inputs from the queuing network and vehicle dynamics simulation. We also provide a bound-based heuristic to solve this NP-hard optimization problem. We generate various managerial insights for an efficient implementation of the partial charging policy for EV-sharing platforms. The increase in the partial charging probability (the fraction of depleted vehicles charged partially) reduces the effective charging demand, resulting in fewer chargers and a higher profit. On the other hand, if we increase the target battery energy level for partial charging, the platform’s profit decreases due to higher effective charging demand dominating the benefits of lower charging frequency of vehicles.",1366-5545,Not found
Deep reinforcement learning for dynamic incident-responsive traffic information dissemination,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102871,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This study is concerned with the optimal dynamical information dissemination (DID) problem in a transportation network interrupted by traffic incidents. Optimizing system performance with DID after road incidents is challenging because of the uncertainty in traffic flow variation and travelers’ heterogeneous responses to information. To address the problem, we consider a traffic manager who aims to improve the system performance by dynamically generating and disseminating information to road users in a time period after an incident happens. We develop a decision tool for obtaining DID strategy based on double deep Q-learning (DDQL) for the traffic manager, aiming at finding an optimal DID strategy. The decision tool is integrated with traffic sensors which collect traffic data in real time. With advanced traveler information systems, the DID system dynamically sends out various types of information to users according to the current and anticipated traffic states so as to minimize congestion and enhance road network capacity. In particular, the proposed DDQL method utilizes a double deep Q-network (DQN) structure to learn the state–action values. To test and evaluate the performance of the decision tool, we develop a microscopic simulation model of a real road network in the Serangoon area of Singapore in PTV VISSIM and calibrate the model with real historical traffic data. We train and compare the DDQL controller model with different reward signals, including the weighted sum of the average speed and queue delay, total traffic flow, and average travel time. Numerical experiments demonstrate the good performance of the proposed DDQL-based DID approach in improving the congestion and other performance metrics of the expressway. The robustness and generalizability of the DDQL agent are also verified by evaluating the algorithm performance in environments with different traffic demand patterns and driving behavior profiles.",1366-5545,Not found
Trajectory planning for autonomous modular vehicle docking and autonomous vehicle platooning operations,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102886,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Emerging autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology allows vehicle units to physically dock on or split from each other en route to form vehicles of different lengths. This technology has great potential in roadway logistics where platoons/long trains are formed to transport goods and passengers, i.e., freight and transit systems. AMV docking is an extreme case of autonomous vehicle (AV) platooning in that AMVs are physically connected with zero gaps. This paper formulates the AMV docking and AV platooning trajectory planning problem into a two-stage optimization problem. A feasible cone method is proposed to reveal the theoretical properties of solution feasibility and solve the first-stage problem analytically. This method provides the basics for a parsimonious heuristic approach to design trajectories specified as several quadratic segments. A heuristic alternative solution based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is proposed to solve a special case of the original problem to the exact optimum. Then an exact solution approach based on quadratic programming is proposed to optimize the trajectories. The feasible cone method is used to construct valid cuts to expedite the exact solution efficiency. Numerical experiments show that the parsimonious heuristic approach can achieve near-optimal solutions and greatly reduce the solution time compared with the exact solution approach, appealing to real-time engineering applications. The results also demonstrate the superiority of the parsimonious heuristic approach in optimizing AMV docking and AV platooning trajectories compared with traditional platooning methods. Sensitivity analysis results shed insights into advising parameter selections of platoon-related logistics to balance the tradeoff between operational efficiency and cost.",1366-5545,Not found
Stochastic one-way carsharing systems with dynamic relocation incentives through preference learning,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102884,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The development of carsharing services is expected to achieve greater resource efficiency and provide a sustainable solution for future mobility systems. However, operators inevitably face the imbalance between demand and supply in one-way carsharing systems (CSSs). Also, it is challenging for them to make quick and efficient operational decisions when both travel time and trip requests are uncertain. This study leverages historical and online data and proposes a learning-based methodology to quickly make real-time decisions for CSSs, including vehicle assignment, relocation, and user incentive decisions. Compared to the literature in approximate dynamic programming (ADP), which mostly focuses on uncertainty in trip requests, we propose an offline–online ADP approach to consider the temporal and spatial uncertainty in both trip requests and travel time. To tackle our high-dimensional problem, we integrate an online look-ahead policy into the offline value function approximation (VFA) policy to produce a computational tractable high-quality dynamic fleet management policy. Furthermore, a user-based relocation strategy is investigated to rebalance the fleet distribution to meet the demand better. Specifically, we aim to solve the optimal incentives the operator could offer to users to relocate cars, while user preferences towards relocation incentives are generally unknown in practice. We further enhance our anticipatory policy by developing an online module via Bayesian learning that learns the preference model on the fly using users’ revealed preference data collected online. The numerical experiments in Singapore demonstrate our offline–online ADP approach improves the solution quality and significantly compared to offline VFA policy. The results also confirm the importance of incorporating uncertainty in travel time. The benefits of the user-based relocation scheme using the Bayesian learning method using online data to enhance anticipatory decisions and learn unknown user preferences are also illustrated. It quickly and efficiently learns the user preferences, which further reduces the relocation cost and increases the profit.",1366-5545,Not found
Plug-in hybrid electric refuse vehicle routing problem for waste collection,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102875,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Commercial waste collection is an essential service requiring efficient and reliable provision for customers. At the operational level, one of the most challenging problems is to design a set of refuse vehicle routes to collect waste from a set of bins. To be used multiple times, these vehicles must be emptied regularly throughout the day. This paper investigates a waste collection problem with a homogeneous fleet of plug-in hybrid electric refuse vehicles powered by two different power sources, i.e., electricity and compressed natural gas (CNG). In addition, realistic fuel consumption functions are used to estimate total energy requirements for each type of fuel, including refueling and recharging, and the detailed energy consumption along the path between two nodes of interest. We propose a Hybrid Threshold Acceptance (HTA) algorithm for this problem and denote it as the Hybrid Waste Collection Problem (HWCP). Extensive computational experiments confirm that the proposed HTA algorithm provides good results against current state-of-the-art algorithms designed for the electric vehicle routing problem. Out detailed computational results demonstrate the performance of our method considering either full or partial recharging, as well as the effect of different battery/tank capacities. Compared to the standard CNG or electric vehicles, we also show the benefits of using a fleet of hybrid electric refuse vehicles in terms of operational costs and total distance traveled.",1366-5545,Not found
Benefit from a high store visiting cost in an omnichannel with BOPS,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102904,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Omnichannel sales surge in the coronavirus pandemic. This paper establishes an analytical model to study when a firm can benefit from implementing the omnichannel strategy of buy-online and pick-up in-store (BOPS), where the market characteristics are captured by the two-dimensional heterogeneity of product valuation and online waiting cost. The increase in the store visiting cost will reduce BOPS consumers’ willingness to pay, but it will also strengthen the encroachment of BOPS on traditional dual-channel. The results show that the firm can benefit from the BOPS strategy when the store visiting cost is relatively high. This well explains the rapid development of the omnichannel with BOPS because of a high store visiting cost during COVID-19. Furthermore, sharply contrasting to the traditional dual-channel sales in which a higher store visiting cost always hurts the firm, the profit under BOPS can be nonmonotonic in the store visiting cost and the firm can benefit from a higher store visiting cost. Specifically, the combination of cross-selling effect, BOPS encroachment effect and BOPS expansion reduction effect associated with the store visiting cost can result in a U-shaped or inverse U-shaped BOPS profit. In addition, introducing BOPS motivates the firm to either increase or decrease the optimal price, conditional on the store visiting cost. For consumers, online and offline consumers can also indirectly benefit from the BOPS strategy, though they may not enjoy the BOPS service.",1366-5545,Not found
Coordinating supply and demand in ride-sourcing markets with pre-assigned pooling service and traffic congestion externality,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102887,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This paper proposes an equilibrium model to describe a ride-sourcing market with both ride-pooling (RP) and non-pooling (NP) services considering traffic congestion externality. In particular, we develop a deductive model to approximate the pool-matching probability and passengers’ expected waiting time under a pre-assigned pool-matching mechanism with meeting points, which is being used in products like Uber Express Pool. Using the model, we derive the equilibrium properties and examine the optimal operating strategies for achieving two market scenarios, including the monopoly optimum and social optimum. In contrast to the traditional wisdom, we find that the market could exist in one or multiple equilibria, depending on the trip fare difference between RP and NP services. Additionally, we show that average sojourn time first decreases in the vehicle fleet size (when traffic congestion is mild) and then increases in the vehicle fleet size (when traffic congestion is heavy), exhibiting a “smiling curve”. It is found that the monopoly optimum solution is always located in the downward side of the “smiling curve”, which implies the ride-sourcing platform will self-regulate its fleet size to avoid heavy traffic congestion. We also discuss the impacts of potential labor supply and background traffic on the platform’s optimal operating strategy and its optimal profit. This study gains interesting managerial insights that help understand how ride-sourcing platforms determine optimal operating strategies for both RP and NP services by considering traffic congestion externality.",1366-5545,Not found
Dynamic On-Demand Crowdshipping Using Constrained and Heuristics-Embedded Double Dueling Deep Q-Network,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102890,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to the dynamic on-demand crowdshipping problem in which requests constantly arrive in a crowdshipping system for pickup and delivery within limited time windows. The request pickup and delivery are performed by crowdsourcees, who are ordinary people dynamically arriving in and leaving the crowdshipping system, and dedicating their limited and heterogeneous available time and carrying capacity to crowdshipping. In return, crowdsourcees get paid by the delivery service provider who periodically assigns requests to crowdsourcees in the course of a day to minimize shipping cost. We adopt heuristics-embedded Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms that incorporate double and dueling structures, to train DRL agents. The idea of heuristics-embedded training is conceived by designing an elaborate action space where several refined local search heuristics are embedded to direct the specific action to take once an action type is chosen by DRL, with the purpose of preserving tractability of DRL training. To tackle the hard constraints pertaining to crowdsourcee and request time windows, we propose and integrate three new strategies (feasibility enforced local search, multiple schedules with different penalties, and exponential penalty) as part of the DRL training and testing. Extensive numerical analysis is conducted and shows that Double Dueling DQN with the exponential penalty strategy demonstrates the best performance. We compare the performance of the agent trained by Double Dueling DQN with conventional heuristic approaches, and find that the agent yields total shipping costs that are on average 24–37% lower than the conventional heuristic approaches. For problem instances that can be solved to optimality, the optimality gap using the trained agent is also quite small, in the range of 3–7%. Moreover, the trained agent is robust to stationary/non-stationary demand patterns. Lastly, our approach is further compared with a recent study that uses heuristics-embedded DQN, and shows superior performance (total shipping costs on average 19% lower) as a result of several differences.",1366-5545,Not found

However, air delivery service will not scale up without proper traffic management for drones in dense urban environment. Currently, a range of Concepts of Operations (ConOps) for unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) are being proposed and evaluated by researchers, operators, and regulators. Among these, the tube-based (or corridor-based) ConOps has emerged in operations in some regions of the world for drone deliveries and is expected to continue serving certain scenarios that with dense and complex airspace and requires centralized control in the future. Towards the tube-based ConOps, we develop a route network planning method to design routes (tubes) in a complex urban environment in this paper. In this method, we propose a priority structure to decouple the network planning problem, which is NP-hard, into single-path planning problems. We also introduce a novel space cost function to enable the design of dense and aligned routes in a network. The proposed method is tested on various scenarios and compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we present a mixed-integer linear programming model for HHC routing and scheduling problems, which considers fair and balanced workload allocation of caregivers while minimising the total cost and addressing the client’s needs. Due to the complexity of the problem, using a commercial solver is not practical for real size instances.

Considering government’s regulations, this paper investigates whether the supplier selling remanufactured components (Supplier R) should develop a self-brand and whether the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) should keep sourcing from this competitive Supplier R or source from a supplier selling new components (Supplier N). We develop a channel system comprising of Supplier R, Supplier N, and OEM, based on which we analyze their equilibrium decisions in three typical structures (i.e., Base Scenario, Co-opetitive Scenario, Chain-to-chain Scenario). We find the OEM prefers to purchase remanufactured components when (1) its brand image advantage is significant; or (2) its brand image advantage is limited but the environment tax rate is high; or (3) its brand image advantage is limited, the environment tax rate is low, but the subsidy to supplier is high, even if Supplier R has self-brand and competes with the OEM. Our results are both theoretically interesting and practically relevant because we build a unifying model to study the government’s regulation optimization and show a full map for both the component suppliers and the OEMs to decide market encroachment or channel structure configuration.",1366-5545,Not found

We systematically analyze and summarize eight spatial structures for micropolis, as a result of a great diversity of station locations. The conditions and analytic solutions of each structure are derived. It is shown that the HSR station of micropolis closer to metropolis may decrease the number of metropolis residents.

Daily load planning under different autonomous truck deployment scenarios,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102885,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This paper presents and tests modified service network design formulations that account for five levels of truck automation in a daily load planning setting. Given daily updates of load information, the paths for the five deployment scenarios are adjusted using two daily updating strategies. Both strategies start with a base plan in which paths are generated based on the historic daily distribution of load dispatches during an average week. The two strategies are: (1) Option 1: re-optimization of pre-booked loads and new requests, and (2) Option 2: optimization of new requests only. The solutions of the two strategies are compared to the hindsight plan which assumes complete information of actual requests placed. The presented formulations are tested out on an industry partner’s network. Results show that the savings achieved with re-optimization (Option 1) compared to insertion (Option 2) increase with more demand variability; this outcome is consistent across all fleet mixes. When most of the loads are new arrivals, the computational time of the two approaches is comparable and insertion is less attractive than re-optimization. With daily re-optimization, most of the plan changes adjust the terminals visited by a load compared to just changing the dispatch and arrival times along the load’s path.",1366-5545,Not found
Unraveling the cheap talk's informativeness of product quality in supply chains: A lying aversion perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102873,166,2022-10-01,2022,10,"In many industries, product quality can be uncertain due to design complexity and component variety. Manufacturers, who possess private information about product quality, may exaggerate quality level or conceal defects to dealers via informal communication, even though the product’s true quality is inferior. When this happens, it may mislead dealers to order more inventory and result in overstock. This paper investigates whether and when the manufacturer’s deceptive behavior can be mitigated by factors such as lying aversion. We find that private quality information can be credibly communicated to the dealer via cheap talk if the manufacturer is sufficiently averse to lying. Interestingly, credible information sharing may not always lead to performance improvement, depending on the quality level and the accuracy of the signal. Specifically, when the product’s quality is relatively consistent, credible information sharing increases the profits of both the manufacturer and the dealer, resulting in a win–win situation. On the other hand, less accurate quality signal can benefit the manufacturer most of the time, but will hurt the dealer and the supply chain as a whole. Our research unravels the core mechanism of cheap talk’s informativeness, highlights the pros and cons of credible communication, and proposes possible solutions that lead to mutually beneficial outcomes for the supply chain.",1366-5545,Not found
"Improving consumer welfare in vaccine market: Pricing, government subsidies and consumer awareness",10.1016/j.tre.2022.102913,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"In practice, governments are commonly witnessed to offer subsidies in vaccine market to reduce vaccination costs for a specific infectious disease. To study governments’ optimal subsidy program, we develop a game-theoretic model with a manufacturer supplying vaccines and a government offering public subsidies. In the model, we consider two typical vaccine price settings, namely, government-led and manufacturer-determined prices, in which the government’s objective is to maximize consumer welfare. Important elements, such as consumer awareness and consumer-perceived quality, are involved, which indicates that the consumers may be informed or uninformed of the benefits of the vaccine. We show that the government should publicize the benefits of the vaccine to raise the awareness level of consumers, which helps improve consumer welfare and increase the vaccination rate. Under a fixed subsidy program, we show that the government will subsidize the consumers rather than the vaccine manufacturer. It is optimal for the government to offer subsidies for both the informed and uninformed consumers (only the informed consumers) when the awareness level is substantially low (high), regardless of with government-led or manufacturer-determined vaccine price. In addition, we discuss the situations in which the government aims to maximize social welfare or vaccination rate, and demonstrate that the equilibrium is identical with that when maximizing consumer welfare.",1366-5545,Not found
Is it wise to offer rebates for unused extended warranties under trade-in programs in supply chains?,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102915,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Nowadays, more and more firms are providing trade-in and “(product) extended warranty” (EW) services to attract new and old customers and boost new product sales. In practice, firms have two trade-in strategies for replacement consumers who own an unused EW, namely (i) do not offer another rebate for an unused EW (Model TT), and (ii) offer a rebate for an unused EW (Model TE). To explore which trade-in strategy for an unused EW is better, we develop theoretical models to study the optimal product pricing, EW pricing, and rebate decisions for a used product. The results show that if the percentage of replacement consumers who own unused EW and the extra operational cost of providing a rebate for an unused EW are both sufficiently large, TT is the better choice for the firm; otherwise, the firm should choose TE. Interestingly, if the extra operational cost of providing a rebate for an unused EW is relatively large, the total trade-in rebates under TE is lower than the trade-in rebate under TT. To check the robustness of our basic model and generate some new insights, we consider the following five extensions: (i) TT has a negative effect on consumers, (ii) the repair cost is linear, (iii) the unused EW has different remaining time, (iv) in the “supply chain context”, (v) the used products have different durability (depreciation).

Modeling activity-travel behavior under a dynamic discrete choice framework with unobserved heterogeneity,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102914,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"The major challenges in dynamic activity-based models include predicting activity-related choices and understanding inherent heterogeneous preferences. The dynamic discrete choice model (DDCM) has been used for daily activity-travel planning. However, ignoring unobservable heterogeneity can bias the estimation and prediction results. To solve this problem, we propose a DDCM that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity to capture useful hidden information on travelers’ characteristics. The conditional choice probability estimator and expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm are used in conjunction to estimate the dynamic model. The algorithm iteration depends mainly on the mapping relationship between posterior distributions and conditional choice probabilities. Meanwhile, a less complex log-likelihood function is proposed in the maximization step to estimate two types of parameters simultaneously. The proposed techniques are verified using household travel survey data from Chongqing (China). Two unobserved types of travelers, time and cost sensitivity, are identified based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value. Time- and segment-varying sensitivity analyses are conducted to present choice probability differences of mode and activity scheduling under a one-unit increase in the number of schoolchildren and cars.

Initial coin offerings (ICOs), an emerging start-up fundraising method developed with blockchain technology, are now popular among start-ups that issue initial tokens as the sole exchange medium for their planned products. In addition to the public offering stage and market stage, the pre-ICO stage is an important phase for many ICO projects. In this paper, we establish an initial coin offering (ICO) model with network effects, a common phenomenon in ICOs, to study the effect of institutional investors’ participation in the pre-ICO stage of offerings made by cash-strapped entrepreneurs. We find that introducing institutional investors significantly increases the equilibrium price of tokens during the public offering stage as well as the price fluctuation of tokens over time. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs will over-issue tokens when the intensity of network externality is relatively high. Interestingly, when institutional investors’ required rate of return decreases, the change in the optimal issuance is not monotonic. Under some circumstances, the lower the rate of return required by institutional investors is, the less the optimal issuance to them is, even if the network externality is high. A higher issuance in the pre-ICO stage is thus a mixed blessing that can increase the price during public offerings and reduce the equilibrium price in other stages. The negative impact is even greater when network externality is high.",1366-5545,Not found

Data from 356 manufacturing companies in developing countries and regions, drawn from the sixth version of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey is used to examine the hypothesized model empirically. The findings indicate that the MPC activities effectively respond to SCU and act as an enabler of preventive and reactive SCRM. Furthermore, the paper finds that MPC activities drive operational performance through effective SCRM.

Online retailers’ platform-based Worry-Free-Shopping: Retailing strategy considering consumer valuation bias,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102902,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Platform-based Worry-Free Shopping (WFS) is an emerging retail service system developed by online platforms. Online retailers on such platforms can actively decide whether to provide WFS services for consumers. If WFS service is offered, a WFS logo will be displayed on the product information page by the platform. Although WFS can enhance consumers’ willingness to pay, it incurs cost for online retailers and may cause more product returns due to valuation bias. This paper investigates when an online retailer on a platform should offer customers WFS, and it explores the detailed effects of WFS on the retailer, platform, customers, and society. We find that both the retailer and platform do not necessarily benefit from WFS. Although the platform can take a “hands-off” attitude towards the retailer in most cases, they may have conflicting interests while providing WFS, so we have developed a mechanism to coordinate their benefits. Our results explain why the platform develops such a WFS service system, and when it should incentivize the online retailer to offer WFS to customers. Furthermore, WFS always hurts customers when the valuation bias is small, while it may favor the society when the WFS cost is low. In extensions, we verify the robustness of our results and also get new insights. First, a small product salvage value motivates the platform to encourage the retailer to offer WFS. Second, though a larger proportion of overestimating customers always benefits the platform, it may hurt the retailer when it is less than a threshold. Finally, a larger heterogeneity in valuation increment allows the retailer to charge higher price and benefits the platform.",1366-5545,Not found
A two-stage stochastic programming model for seaport berth and channel planning with uncertainties in ship arrival and handling times,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102919,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"The limited availability of berths and channels is generally the bottleneck restricting the capacity of a seaport and thus resulting in traffic congestion. Optimizing the operations of the berths and channels has been recognized as a more economic avenue for mitigating seaport traffic congestion compared with channel dredging and berth expanding that needs significant capital and time costs. This paper presents a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming model for the seaport berth and channel planning, aiming to minimize the expected total weighted completion times of ships under uncertain ship arrival times and ship handling durations. The first stage decides the berth allocation of ships under uncertainty. In the second stage, the channel planning, including the selection of lanes, assignment of tugboats, and sequencing of ships, is determined after the uncertainty has been realized. To effectively solve the model, we propose two tailored decomposition methods, that is, the stage decomposition method and the decomposition-based heuristic algorithm (DHA). Then, a lower bound of the problem is derived to evaluate the quality of the solution. Numerical experiments on Tianjin Port of China show the satisfactory performance of these two proposed methods. Especially, the DHA is able to obtain near-optimal solutions with the average optimality gap less than 3% within four-hour computational time for the instances up to 500 scenarios and 190 ship movements. Some managerial insights are obtained to guide the operations of the port.",1366-5545,Not found
Service fairness and value of customer information for the stochastic container relocation problem under flexible service policy,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102921,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This paper considers the optimization of service efficiency and service fairness in a Stochastic Container Relocation Problem (SCRP) under flexible service policies at a container terminal. Under the flexible service policy, the external trucks arriving within the same time window can be served out of sequence, which may raise a concern of service fairness. We incorporate the concept of service fairness into the SCRP in two phases. In phase 1, we propose a multiple sub-time windows-based flexible service policy, under which each time window will be divided into multiple sub-time windows and the flexible service policy is only applied to each individual sub-time window. In phase 2, the SCRP is formulated as a dynamic programming model with two lexicographically ordered objectives representing both relocation efficiency and service fairness, which is solved via a hierarchical iterative approach. In addition, we investigate whether the information of trucks’ arrival probability over the time window (which represents the customer preference information) would add value to the terminal operators. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the impacts of the number of sub-time windows and to examine the impacts and value of customer preference information in various scenarios. The results show interesting trade-offs between efficiency and fairness. As the number of sub-time windows increases, the service fairness is generally improving (but not guaranteed) while the expected number of relocations is increasing. It is found that the customer preference information can be valuable in some circumstances, especially when each truck indicates a certain arrival sub-time window.",1366-5545,Not found
Green investment in a sustainable supply chain: The role of blockchain and fairness,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102908,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"We study a green investment problem of a sustainable supply chain with one manufacturer who decides whether to implement blockchain and one retailer who has emotional fairness concerns. Although blockchain adoption is costly, it can raise customers’ green sensitivity level and exempt a firm from environmental taxes. A fair-minded retailer cares about disadvantageous inequity in addition to monetary payoffs. We compare the supply chain performance with and without blockchain, each in combination with and without emotional fairness concerns. We show that the manufacturer has the incentive to adopt blockchain if the operational cost is below a certain threshold, and this threshold increases in both tax rate and the blockchain-driven increment in customers’ green sensitivity. We find that fairness can encourage blockchain implementation if and only if the blockchain-driven increment in customers’ green sensitivity level is nominal. Moreover, blockchain adoption may weaken the positive impact of fairness on the supply chain performance such as the mitigation of double marginalization and consumer welfare improvement. We also find that blockchain can encourage green investment and benefit the retailer only if the blockchain-driven increment in customers’ green sensitivity level is relatively high; that is, an “all-win” situation for the supply chain can be achieved by blockchain adoption. Extended studies on consumption-based emission taxes and blockchain setup cost are also provided.",1366-5545,Not found

Ocean shipping company's encroachment with outsourcing competition,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102910,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"As a new source to increase profits, some ocean shipping (OS) companies are beginning to encroach on the downstream market to canvass for cargoes, which would form a co-opetition relationship between OS companies and forwarders. Meanwhile, forwarders need to complete the transportation tasks through outsourcing strategy selection, that is, choose a delegation decision to outsource all transportation to an OS company, or choose a control decision to outsource ocean transportation and hinterland transportation to the OS and hinterland shipping (HS) companies, respectively. This paper uses a game-theoretical model to study the equilibrium strategy of OS company’s encroachment and forwarders’ outsourcing, and to further explore the strategic interactions between the two strategies. We solve the model analytically and find that an OS company might be worse off from encroaching on the shipping market if the entry cost is high or the cargo-canvassing capacity is high, whereas forwarders are always worse off with the OS company’s encroachment. Surprisingly, forwarders can suppress the OS company’s encroachment by changing their outsourcing decisions from control to delegation, or by improving their cargo-canvassing capacities. Our study also shows that forwarders prefer control decisions in the non-encroachment scenario, and they prefer delegation decisions if the market competition is fierce in the encroachment scenario. As for the HS scheme, introducing competing HS companies into hinterland transportation is always the optimal choice. Further, we consider an extension of the effect of OS company’s encroachment timing and show that forwarders as the first movers can make the OS company be less possible to encroach on the shipping market.",1366-5545,Not found

It deals with the minimization of total cost while satisfying customer delivery demands. First, we develop a mixed integer mathematical programming formulation for the MF-VRP-MC. Because of the NP-hardness of the problem, to solve medium and large-size instances, then we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) based algorithm with introducing new advanced neighborhood mechanisms to successfully handle complex problem constraints. Meantime, new approaches are tailored for boosting diversification effect in addition to new neighborhood scoring policy and new enhancement procedure. Furthermore, selection of recharging technology among the others at charging station is firstly considered in the solution phase of a mixed fleet problem.

Fulfillment and pricing optimization for omni-channel retailers considering shipment of in-store demand,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102912,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Omni-channel retailers meet the demand through the e-commerce channel and the stores in different locations. They have specific centers to fulfill their online orders (e-fulfillment centers); however, they may fulfill their online orders using their in-store inventory. On the other hand, retailers can use pricing decisions to control the demand in each channel. We first model the customers’ demand by the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model. We then propose two mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models to maximize the total profit by considering both fulfillment and pricing decisions. We assume e-fulfillment inventory can also be used as a backup inventory for in-store orders if stores are out of inventory, but only for a store in the same zone. We also assume limited initial inventory and no replenishment in a finite selling horizon. In the second MINLP model, we also allow for multiple shipping options and inventory decisions. By numerical experiments, we show that omni-channel retailers can increase their profit by having control over initial inventory allocation and fulfilling the in-store demand by e-fulfillment inventory.",1366-5545,Not found
Beneficiary-centric decision support framework for enhanced resource coordination in humanitarian logistics: A case study from ASEAN,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102909,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"The growing frequency, impact, and complexity of natural- and human-made- disasters have resulted in an increased attention toward humanitarian logistics management practices. With most disasters having a global scale due to the high level of interconnectedness between supply chains, the adequate provision of humanitarian assistance through streamlined logistics systems has become paramount. Correspondingly, the traditional organization- and execution-centric approaches are no longer sufficient, and greater attention to beneficiary- and ecosystem-centric supply chain networks with equal emphasis on planning and execution are necessary. Accordingly, this work proposes a multi-method decision support framework to analyze, visualize, optimize, and simulate supply networks to address the key challenge of resource coordination in disaster response operations. A real-world application to the Disaster Emergency Logistics System for ASEAN (DELSA), the network of pre-positioned stockpiles managed by the ASEAN Humanitarian Agency in ASEAN, is also presented. Results of the analyses show that with the introduction of inventory management policies with safety stock, the DELSA network improves its performance in service level by +41%. Unlike the current practice where inventory decisions are, in most cases, supply-and funds-driven, the findings of this work bring about a paradigm shift for beneficiary-centric policies. More importantly, the analyses of this study could generate practical insights for proper humanitarian logistics planning not only in ASEAN but throughout the world.",1366-5545,Not found
Integrated path controlling and subsidy scheme for mobility and environmental management in automated transportation networks,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102906,167,2022-11-01,2022,11,"In recent years, as automated vehicle (AV) technologies are advancing at a breathtaking pace, path controlling has engaged increasing attentions among transportation researchers. As an emerging technology for transport management, it employs AVs as mobile actuators to regulate traffic flow on transportation networks, aiming at alleviating inefficiency due to selfish routing. Existing studies have proved the potential of such a path control scheme for mitigating traffic congestion, but research on its competence for environmental management is still lacking. Given above, this paper develops a path control scheme to achieve expected goals of both mobility and emission. Specifically, we assume a fully automated environment where all the vehicles on the network are highly automated and serve as candidates for the path control scheme. We assume that they originally follow the classic user-equilibrium (UE) principle and can be controlled as either system-optimum (SO) or least-emission (LE) users by the central agent. We formulate the mixed traffic equilibrium including the three classes of users as a variational inequality (VI) problem and integrate it as an equilibrium constraint into the optimal control problem. To compensate for the travel utility loss for being controlled, we also propose an integrated path controlling and subsidy scheme, under which travelers who suffer from the control scheme will be compensated with subsidy. The total subsidy, along with the network performance, are considered in the objective function. A sensitivity-analysis-based Frank-Wolfe (SA-FW) method is applied to solve the proposed problems. Using example networks, we test the computational performance of the SA-FW method and examine the control performance of the control scheme under various settings. Based on the numerical results, it is found that considering LE users and environmental benefits renders the control problem more complex than merely achieving SO.",1366-5545,Not found
An exact algorithm for scheduling tandem quay crane operations in container terminals,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102949,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This study investigates the scheduling problem of the tandem quay crane (TQC), which is a new type of loading/unloading device used at container terminals. The TQC can execute either a single-lift or tandem-lift at a time. Considering the changeover time between the above two operational modes of the TQC and the weight limitation for executing a tandem-lift, a novel integer linear programming model is established to minimize the time needed for unloading the containers from the containership, and valid inequalities are introduced to enhance the model. Then, an exact algorithm based on logic-based Benders decomposition is applied to solve the problem. The proposed approach decomposes the problem into a mode-assignment master problem and an operation-sequencing slave problem. Logic-based cuts are proposed to ensure the convergence of the algorithm, and several enhancement measures are developed to accelerate the convergence speed. The computational results indicate that the model is superior to the previous model proposed in the literature, and the proposed inequalities are effective. Moreover, the exact algorithm was verified to be efficient for solving realistically sized instances within an acceptable time.",1366-5545,Not found
Logistics cluster and its future development: A comprehensive research review,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102974,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Logistics clusters play an essential role in bridging production and consumption.

The aim of this study is to present an intellectual landscape through a structured literature review of logistics cluster research. First, following the logic of “what-why-how”, we found that logistics cluster research can be divided into three parts: the concept and quantitative identification of logistics clusters, the agglomeration externalities of logistics clusters, and the competitiveness and growth mechanism of logistics clusters. Second, the bibliometric results indicate that: (i) logistics clusters have gradually developed from an engineering or operations management discipline into one involving multidisciplinary approaches of geosciences, sustainable science, etc.; (ii) the focus of research has gradually shifted from the development and operation of logistics clusters to the exploration of the clusters growth mechanism; (iii) researchers start to concentrate on spatially explicit analyses of the economic and environmental effects of logistics clusters, and the exploration of sustainable growth paths for clusters. Finally, in consideration of these trends and the emerging situation, we propose some new research topics, such as (i) the convergence and competitive effect of logistics clusters, (ii) data science and analytics in logistics clusters, (iii) the application of new theories and technologies to transportation and supply chain, etc. in logistics cluster scenarios, (iv) sustainable operation of logistics clusters, and (v) quantitative modeling research in logistics clusters.

Robust traveling salesman problem with multiple drones: Parcel delivery under uncertain navigation environments,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102967,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The improved unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, or drone) delivery systems allow an unattended truck to pair two or more drones to accelerate delivery.

This paper introduces a robust traveling salesman problem with multiple drones (RTSP-mD), in which a truck coordinates with a heterogeneous fleet of drones to make deliveries under uncertain navigation environments. The RTSP-mD is first formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) to minimize makespan and synchronization risk simultaneously. To solve this complex problem, a three-phased adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed. The experiment results show that nominal optimal solution generally has a lower expected makespan but rarely remains efficient or feasible under a small perturbation to schedules. About one-third of robust optimal solutions can be against a large reduction of synchronization risk at a negligible price in makespan. And we demonstrate that the drone number remains stable for robust (near-)optimal solutions rather than growing along with customer density increase.",1366-5545,Not found

Motivated by this observation, we investigate the interaction and timing of firms’ e-commerce brand introduction and self-operating channel opening in a coopetitive supply chain with a platform retailer and an NB manufacturer, who is the platform retailer’s upstream cooperator and downstream competitor. Using game theory, we give and analyze the equilibrium results of six different scenarios, which characterize the platform retailer’s strategies about whether and which quality of EB should be introduced and the manufacturer’s strategies about whether to open the self-operating channel. Our results show that when the platform retailer is a first-mover, his optimal EB introduction strategy depends on the platform fee, consumers’ self-operating channel preferences, the NB’s quality, and the manufacturer’s self-operating strategy. When the manufacturer is a first-mover, the platform retailer is best to introduce a higher-quality EB irrespective of the manufacturer’s self-operating strategy. Furthermore, the manufacturer prefers the platform retailer to concentrate on her NB’s sale rather than introduce an EB in most cases, and the self-operating channel as an anti-entry approach to the platform retailer’s EB introduction is effective in some scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found

Considering a new employment limit in each rebalancing model, the optimization procedure iteratively solves a set of cluster relocation problems and an inter-cluster relocation problem until a convergent solution is obtained. Numerical experiments based on data from a carsharing company in Chengdu reveal two interesting findings: (1) Employing temporary workers from understocked stations costs less than that from overstocked stations; (2) Using a time-based salary contributes to 49.1% reduction in the working hours and 33.8% in the relocation costs.",1366-5545,Not found

The results show that the manufacturer obtains more profit when the collection platform offers a trade-in program with a differential pricing strategy, and that the retailer earns no profit from reselling a used product. However, the collection platform always obtains profits from the resale of used products through the trade-in service.

Although many studies have investigated consumer perceptions and attitudes toward fashion rental services, analytical models that help businesses make more informed supply chain decisions are scarce. Consequently, we develop game-theoretical models to study the fashion market with two firms, i.e., a fashion manufacturer and its rental platform partner. The models consider four green-advertising investment situations: no firm invests, only the fashion manufacturer invests, only the rental platform invests, or both firms invest in green advertising for fashion rental services. We compare pricing and green advertising decisions under different power structures between the two firms across the four green-advertising investment situations. Our results demonstrate when and how the power structure affects the key decision variables. We reveal that it is least profitable for both firms if neither contributes to green advertising, while both firms obtain the highest profits when they both invest in green advertising. In the two situations when only one firm invests in green advertising, we note that it is not necessarily unfavorable for firms to accept the green-advertising cost proactively. Specifically, the Stackelberg follower benefits from investing in green advertising. Furthermore, in these two situations, whether or not the Stackelberg leader covers the green-advertising cost is more important than their identity.

For the first time, this study designs a novel heuristic algorithmic structure for the generalized serial lock scheduling problem (GSLSP) from a batch-processing-based flexible job-shop scheduling perspective, which converts the GSLSP into a discrete optimization problem. Subsequently, the overall discrete optimization problem is decomposed into an assignment problem and two subproblems (a two-dimensional packing problem and the shortest path problem). They are solved by a tabu-based adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (TALNS), a multi-order best-fit algorithm, and the Bellman–Ford algorithm, respectively. Additionally, a solution-space cutting strategy is proposed to accelerate the TALNS, which occupies most of the computational burden. Case studies are implemented based on practical historical data from the two-lock system in Yangtze River and the six-lock system along the Albertkanaal canal. Numerical results demonstrate that high-quality solutions can be obtained for large-scale GSLSPs within a reasonable time by the proposed hybrid algorithmic structure. After that, GSLSPs with simplified settings are solved with the proposed framework, and the computational results are compared with those obtained by state-of-the-art methods in the literature. Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons infer the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach for solving different variants of GSLSP and its superiority over existing methods.

This paper explores the train regulation and passenger flow control strategies for large-scale urban rail transit networks. Specifically, we develop a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation to improve the punctuality and regularity in train operations, reduce the passenger waiting time, and alleviate the passenger flow burden of platforms, where the dynamic coupling interactions among network-wide passengers, trains and stations are systematically considered. To reduce the computational complexity and satisfy real-time requirements, we particularly devise a real-time optimization approach based on iterative nonlinear programming (INP) combined with Lagrangian relaxation (LR) under the rolling horizon (RH) framework, which effectively disposes of the intractable nonconvexity and constructs the desirable properties of decomposability and parallelism. The original problem is transformed into a sequence of line-level subproblems that can be solved quickly, so as to circumvent the computational burden. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to address numerical examples on a simplified network and the real-world Beijing Subway network. The realistic case studies illustrate that the proposed approach can reduce the train deviation from the original timetable, the passenger waiting time, and the passenger accumulation risk on the platform, by around 84.92%, 30.34% and 61.42% in comparison with the common rule-based strategy.

Pricing decisions for a social comparison product supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102934,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"As a natural psychological tendency of human beings, social comparison is pervasive among consumers. However, while plenty of literature studied the role of social comparison in affecting consumer psychology empirically, few focus on the problem of social comparison in supply chains. This paper proposes a modified utility model in which a consumer has an intrinsic and social value from the social-comparison products. Furthermore, the social value incorporates two different consumer psychologies from social comparison: the assimilate effect from upward comparison and the contrast effect from downward comparison. Based on this model, we derive the firm’s price decisions for a social-comparison product supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer under two cases, the centralized case and the decentralized case. We find several interesting patterns of consumers’ behavior in the presence of social comparison. We also find that when consumers are highly sensitive to social comparison, the supply chain can be coordinated spontaneously using a simple wholesale price contract. Moreover, even when consumers are not very sensitive to social comparison, the wholesale and retail prices in a decentralized supply chain will significantly reduce compared to those for non-social-comparison products — social comparison can mitigate the double marginalization effect. Also, we obtain some other interesting managerial insights. For instance, while social comparison always benefits the manufacturer, it benefits the retailer under certain conditions. This paper contributes to the behavioral operations management literature by first revealing a new mechanism that coordinates supply chains through consumer social comparison.",1366-5545,Not found

In addition, compatibility and load configuration constraints define which and how many containers can be transported by each truck. We propose a state transition logic to model these constraints. Based on this logic, we develop two mixed-integer programming models for this family of problems. The first model is a compact formulation that can be input into a black-box solver. The second model combines partial routes in a space–time network and is solved with a tailored branch-and-cut approach. To analyze the efficiency of the proposed models, we conduct extensive computational tests on instances with different numbers of requests, geographical distributions of locations, time-window lengths, and fleet compositions. Moreover, we discuss how our modeling approach can assist decision-making in three different drayage routing applications.",1366-5545,Not found
Scheduling zonal-based flexible bus service under dynamic stochastic demand and Time-dependent travel time,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102931,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper schedules the zonal-based flexible bus service (ZBFBS) considering elastic stochastic demand, stochastic location, time-dependent travel time, and passenger time window constraints based on a scheduled-based formulation. Unlike a traditional time–space network that stipulates the precise arrival and departure times on specific nodes, a zonal-based time–space network is proposed to define the routes in terms of zonal visits of the flexible buses while allowing for flexibility in their arrival and departure times to cater for randomness. The ZBFBS scheduling problem is formulated as a two-stage decision-dependent stochastic problem with recourse. The first stage schedules the zonal visits of flexible buses and the second stage matches each passenger with either flexible bus or ad hoc service, with the latter incurring extra cost to carry the unmatched passengers. To effectively solve the problem, a state-augmented network, that integrates time and zone, is proposed to reduce the number of variables. Moreover, relaxation formulations based on vehicle types and routes are introduced, with an insertion heuristic implemented for vehicle scheduling. The problem is solved by a gradient-based solution approach. Numerical studies demonstrate the efficiency and quality of the solution methods under a variety of ride requests, as well as its advantage over the frequency-based approach in substantially reducing the ad hoc service cost. The applicability of the model is validated by solving an instance of Chengdu, China, with real data.",1366-5545,Not found
EMS location-allocation problem under uncertainties,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102945,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Emergencies, especially those considered routine (i.e., occurring on a daily basis), pose great threats to health, life, and property. Immediate response and treatment can greatly mitigate these threats. This research is conducted to optimize the locations of ambulance stations, deployment of ambulances, and dispatch of vehicles under demand and traffic uncertainty, which are the main factors that influence emergency response time. The research problem is formulated as a dynamic scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming model, aiming to minimize the total cost while responding to as much demand as possible. The Sample Average Approximation is proposed to approximate the original problem using a limited number of scenarios, and a two-phase Benders Decomposition solution scheme is proposed to accelerate computation, especially when solving a large-sized problem. Numerical experiments using real-world emergency data are conducted to validate the performance of the solution method. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Modeling the capacity of multimodal and intermodal urban transportation networks that incorporate emerging travel modes,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102937,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Given the increasing prevalence of new urban transport modes such as ridesharing, e-hailing, and combined transport, it is essential to evaluate their effects on the capacity of transportation networks. Hence, this paper develops a novel transportation network capacity model to capture the travel behaviors of inter-multimodal mobility in an urban transportation system that incorporates emerging travel modes. The novel model is formulated as a bi-level programming problem, in which the lower-level model is a combined modal split and traffic assignment (CMSTA) problem based on mathematical programming. The CMSTA problem adopts the cross-nested logit model to account for intermodal travel behavior in the modal split phase and the path-sized logit model to account for route overlap in the traffic assignment phase. Moreover, the logit-based trip distribution model is used to capture the dispatch of the e-hailing traffic flow and the matching of ridesharing drivers with passengers. Besides, we consider flow interactions (e.g., cars and buses sharing the same link) in the road network. We customize a solution framework for solving this novel model that adopts the recently developed fast path-based algorithm with the Barzilai–Borwein stepsize strategy to efficiently solve the CMSTA problem, and derive a sensitivity analysis-based (SAB) algorithm to solve the entire bi-level programming problem. The effectiveness of the novel model is verified in numerical experiments that demonstrate the effects of intermodal transportation, e-hailing, and ridesharing on the capacity of a multimodal transportation network.",1366-5545,Not found
Deterministic capacity drop and morning commute in traffic corridor with tandem bottlenecks: A new manifestation of capacity expansion paradox,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102941,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Deterministic capacity drop is a common phenomenon that occurs in traffic bottlenecks, and it has an intricate impact on the evolution of traffic flow in a traffic corridor with tandem bottlenecks. Considering the above facts, this study investigates deterministic capacity drop’s effects on commuter’s departure time choice, the evolution of traffic flow and traffic congestion in the morning commute process in a traffic corridor with tandem bottlenecks. We derive the closed-form solutions of the departure flow rate and arrival flow rate in different bottlenecks. Based on the formulations of these solutions, we analyze the influences of the deterministic capacity drop on commuter’s trip cost and the existence of different cases in the morning commute process in one origin one destination traffic corridor and Y-shape traffic corridor.

Relief and stimulus in a cross-sector multi-product scarce resource supply chain network,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102932,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"In the era of a growing population, systemic changes to the world, and the rising risk of crises, humanity has been facing an unprecedented challenge of resource scarcity. Confronting and addressing the issues concerning the scarce resource’s conservation, competition, and stimulation by grappling its characteristics and adopting viable policy instruments calls the decision-maker’s attention with a paramount priority. In this paper, we develop the first general decentralized cross-sector supply chain network model that captures the unique features of scarce resources under a unifying fiscal policy scheme. We formulate the problem as a network equilibrium model with finite-dimensional variational inequality theories. We then characterize the network equilibrium with a set of classic theoretical properties, as well as with a set of properties that are novel to the network games application literature, namely, the lowest eigenvalue of the game Jacobian. Lastly, we provide a series of illustrative examples, including a medical glove supply network, to showcase how our model can be used to investigate the efficacy of the imposed policies in relieving supply chain distress and stimulating welfare.

The dynamic ride-hailing sharing problem with multiple vehicle types and user classes,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102891,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper proposes a dynamic ride-hailing sharing problem with multiple vehicle types and user classes. Ride-hailing vehicles (RHVs) can be classified into express ride-hailing vehicles (ERHVs) and premier ride-hailing vehicles (PRHVs) according to service levels. PRHVs can provide the high-quality ride-hailing service with upmarket vehicles and ERHVs provide the normal ride-hailing service with normal vehicles. The fare of PRHVs is higher. PRHVs can be temporarily used as ERHVs to serve the customers who order ERHVs with or without ride-sharing, which is referred to as the substitution of ERHVs with PRHVs. A lexicographic multi-objective function with three-level objectives is proposed to formulate the problem, in which the first-level objective is to maximize the profit of the platform, the second-level objective is to minimize the number of requests of customers who involve ordering ERHVs matched to PRHVs, and the third-level objective is to minimize the total driving distance of all RHVs. The dynamic problem is divided into a set of continuous and small ride-hailing sharing subproblems based on equal time intervals. Each subproblem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program for matching RHVs to the requests collected in the last time interval or unmatched in previous time intervals and re-scheduling the vehicle routes. To solve the subproblems, a new solution method is proposed based on the modified artificial bee colony algorithm developed by Zhan et al. (2021). Numerical examples using real request data from Didi are given to explore the problem properties, and the results gain insights into the ride-hailing market. For example, the profit of the platform and the number of matched requests are higher when the substitution of ERHVs with PRHVs is allowed while the matching percentage of requests of customers who select a mixed choice is higher when there is no substitution. Different ratios of vehicle types and user classes influence the performance of the ride-hailing sharing market (e.g., the profit of the platform, the number of matched requests, matching percentage, etc.). The value of the fare discount multiplier for the passengers who successfully share RHVs with others can affect the number of shared requests, the number of matched requests, and platform profitability.",1366-5545,Not found
A patrol routing problem for maritime Crime-Fighting,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102940,168,2022-12-01,2022,12,"In this study, we investigate a patrol routing problem for fighting maritime crime that is motivated by challenges faced in actual practice. Although maritime shipping and ecosystems are critical to human well-being, shipping lanes and related natural resources are vulnerable to maritime crimes. However, the time, location, and extent of the illegal activities in these areas are largely unknown, and maritime authorities have scant resources (such as patrol boats and aircraft) to monitor them. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach to identify suspicious ships and develop patrol routing methods to enhance the patrol efficiency. The problem of enhancing patrol efficiency is analyzed in three scenarios that differ according to the availability of aerial photographs. We formulate three mathematical programming models to address this problem in each scenario. The patrol route is optimally designed based on information available online. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed patrol routing models. Maritime illegal activities are attracting increasing attention, and our proposed approach can be applied to various maritime crime scenarios in oceans and seas around the world.",1366-5545,Not found
Regulating the ride-hailing market in the age of uberization,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102969,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The entry of transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft in the ride-hailing market has generated concerns that they unfairly compete against traditional street-hail services. However, regulatory action seeking to address this issue has either been lacking or has resulted in the suspension or restriction of e-hail services. In this paper, we propose a model of competition between these two services and investigate the design of optimal and parsimonious regulation to achieve social efficiency. When the e-hailing platform adopts instantaneous matching with a relatively large matching radius, we analytically show that, absent restrictions, the street-hailing firm has a pricing advantage and can thrive when competing against the e-hailing platform in dense markets or when trip distances are relatively short. Moreover, while a monopolist controlling both firms will tend to internalize some of its congestion externality, we show that congestion can become quite severe in a duopoly setting. However, we show that even when accounting for competition and congestion, regulators only need to regulate the per trip commission that each company earns to maximize social surplus. This provides a potential avenue to simplify the host of regulations, which have historically been a feature of the ride-hailing market and are currently hampering the street-hailing industry.",1366-5545,Not found
Local container drayage problem with improved truck platooning operations,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102992,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Truck platooning has been identified as a promising technology to save labor force for the local container drayage problem (LCDP). However, existing studies for the platoon-based LCDP assumed that each driver was attached to respective leading truck throughout the service process, and the driverless following trucks dropped off at customer sites cannot further serve the drayage requests until regaining guidance, resulting in low efficiency and utilization of drivers and trucks. To overcome this issue, this paper examines the LCDP under a novel improved platooning operation mode (IPOM), where the drivers are not necessarily attached to their respective leading trucks but can move by alternative transport modes to perform subsequent tasks. The objective is to determine the optimal numbers, routes, and schedules of the drivers and trucks that minimize the total operational cost to complete all the delivery and pickup requests of customers. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to capture the features pertaining to the new platooning mode. A heuristic construction method incorporating simulated annealing is proposed to solve the problem. Numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed model and solution method and quantify the advantages of the improved platooning mode. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to explore the impacts of some major influential factors on the system performance and derive managerial insights.",1366-5545,Not found
Supply chain management professionals’ proficiency in big data analytics: Antecedents and impact on performance,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102972,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"While big data analytics (BDA) carries great potential for supply chain management (SCM), actual advanced applications of these approaches are still limited in practice. Within this context, we seek to identify what can foster an SCM professional’s proficient use of BDA, and define BDA proficiency as an individual’s ability to effectively use BDA. Grounding our research in the theoretical framework of technology acceptance, we consider perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward, and behavioral intention to use BDA as potential influential antecedents. Using primary survey data from 212 SCM professionals, we find that all but one of these hypothesized relationships are confirmed among the sample. This offers valuable insight on how to drive the intention of SCM professionals to use BDA, which serves as a foundation to become proficient in it. In addition, we hypothesize about the impact of BDA proficiency on generating business value in terms of both quality and cost performance, two important outcome variables in SCM research. While the impact on cost performance is confirmed, the impact on quality performance is non-significant, bringing greater clarity to the differentiated performance impacts of BDA proficiency. When further scrutinizing these links to performance under the moderating effect of environmental competitiveness, we not only find the impact of BDA proficiency on cost performance to be greater under higher levels of environmental competitiveness, but also that under such greater levels the link from BDA proficiency to quality performance becomes significant. Overall, our research provides insight not only into what can foster an SCM professional’s BDA proficiency, but also into its impact on performance under various levels of environmental competitiveness.",1366-5545,Not found
An efficient heuristic for the fixed-route vehicle-refueling problem,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102963,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Trucking companies have to decide each day at which truck stops their trucks should be refueled. The underlying problem is called fixed-route vehicle-refueling problem (FRVRP). Since large trucking companies have more than 10000 trucks, small improvements in the solution quality or the required time lead to substantial cost reductions. This makes the FRVRP an important daily scheduling problem. This paper presents a fast and efficient heuristic solution approach. We introduce an exact algorithm to determine the optimal refueling policy given the selected truck stops. It has a worst case performance of O ( n 2 ) but requires linear time on average. Our computational study shows that the heuristic is able to solve instances with up to 2000 truck stops within a fraction of a second to (near) optimality. We propose two variants. The first found for 96.8% of our instances an optimal solution with an average solution gap of 0.001% while requiring 0.001 seconds of computation time on average.

Fundamental challenge and solution methods in prescriptive analytics for freight transportation,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102966,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Prescriptive analytics, in which some parameters are predicted using statistical or machine learning models and then input into an optimization model, is often used to prescribe recommended solutions to freight transportation problems. The effectiveness of the optimal decision prescribed by prescriptive analytics is typically evaluated through a comparison with the results of the current decision model using predicted data. However, such comparisons are often flawed because of insufficient and uncertain data. We use four freight transport examples to illustrate this fundamental challenge in prescriptive analytics modeling. Furthermore, we propose three solutions to fully or partially overcome this challenge and fairly compare the optimal decisions generated by prescriptive analytics and the current approach. The three solutions involve using sufficient historical data, constructing new test sets, and generating synthetic data. We show how these solutions address the challenges in the four examples and are suitable for different problems considering data availability. The proposed solutions allow for a more comprehensive, accurate, and fair comparison of the optimal decisions to validate those generated by prescriptive analytics.

The multi-visit drone routing problem for pickup and delivery services,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102990,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, have gained wide attention in recent years due to their potential of revolutionizing logistics and transportation. In this paper, we consider a variant of the combined truck-drone routing problem, which allows drones to serve multiple customers and provide both pickup and delivery services in each flight. The problem concerns the deployment and routing of a fleet of trucks, each equipped with a supporting drone, to serve all the pickup and delivery demands of a set of customers with minimal total cost. We explicitly model the energy consumption of drones by their travel distance, curb weight and the carrying weight of parcels, develop a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) with problem-customized inequalities, and show a sufficient condition for the benefit of the combined truck-drone mode over the truck-only mode. Considering the complexity of the MILP model, we propose a novel two-stage heuristic algorithm in which a maximum payload method is developed to construct the initial solutions, followed by an improved simulated annealing algorithm with problem-specific neighborhood operators and tailored acceleration strategies. Furthermore, two methods are developed to test the feasibility for both trucks and drones in each solution. The proposed algorithm outperforms two benchmark heuristics in our numerical experiments, which also demonstrate the considerable benefit of allowing multiple visits and both pickup and delivery operations in each drone flight.",1366-5545,Not found
Partial and complete replanning of an intermodal logistic system under disruptions,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102968,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The exclusive and excessive use of long-distance road transportation is not suitable way to reduce the negative environmental impacts of logistics systems. Intermodal transport, combining road with other transport modes, has the potential to reduce both operating costs and carbon footprints. One of the reasons for the low share of intermodal transport is its requirement for the coordination of scheduled transport services that can result in reducing reliability in case of disruptions due to the arrival of new shipment orders, fluctuations in shipment quantities, delays, and service cancellations within the network. This calls for reliable and efficient algorithms to replan the shipments’ distribution. In this paper, the replanning problem is formulated as a path-based multi-commodity network flows. We provide two different network topologies, one of which is based on a time–space network, while the other embeds time aspect in a highly scalable alternative structure to large transportation networks. We propose a column generation method whose pricing sub-problems are presented as resource constrained shortest path problem solved via a tailored label-correcting algorithm. We look at the pros and cons of complete and partial replanning in case of disruption and provide managerial insights for intermodal networks.

This paper investigates the optimal shipping quantity and product pricing strategy of the online retailer that uses this logistics mode under a stochastic demand, which is shipping-dependent and price-dependent. First, we build an extended newsvendor model and explore the closed-form solutions of the optimal shipping quantity and optimal product pricing strategies under certain assumptions on the demand function. Then, we compare the differences of the optimal strategies under different risk attitudes and analyze the impact of key parameters on the optimal strategies. At last, we extend the basic model by considering a general demand function. We conduct numerical experiments to verify the theoretical conclusions and analyze the effect of parameters on online retailers’ optimal strategies and profits. The results show that the optimal shipping quantity first increases and then decreases with the increase of the price. This suggests that the online retailers should avoid blind price war under this logistics mode. The risk aversion degree slightly affects the optimal price, but significantly affects the optimal shipping quantity. Moreover, we find that parameters such as disposal cost and sensitivity of demand to shipping in advance significantly affect the optimal strategies of online retailers.",1366-5545,Not found

We construct multiproduct newsvendor models with cross-selling under two dimensions: rational or narrow-bracketing newsvendors, with budget constraints or not. We first provide conditions for optimal order quantities, and obtain analytical results for model comparisons under a special case. We then examine the impacts of the cross-selling effect between products on decisions and profits across different models through numerical analysis. We further develop decision rule heuristics for the decision sequence of narrow-bracketing newsvendor with a budget constraint by employing classic data mining methods (i.e., Apriori and C4.5 algorithms) for the two-product settings. We find that: (1) The narrow-bracketing newsvendor orders no more product types than the rational newsvendor in the presence of cross-selling effects among products when there is a budget constraint. (2) In a complementary two-product setting for the rational or narrow-bracketing newsvendors, as the cross-selling effect caused by the shortage of one product increases, the optimal order quantity of this product increases, and the optimal order quantity of the other product decreases, leading to lower expected profits for both products, regardless of the budget constraint condition. (3) For the narrow-bracketing newsvendor with two complementary products and budget constraints, the product with lower cost or higher active cross-selling effect should be ordered first, and the product cost has higher priority in most cases.

Vulnerability-based regionalization for disaster management considering storms and earthquakes,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102987,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Existing approaches to risk assessment in natural disasters usually suffer from information specificity and data density. For example, road vulnerability assessment requires disaster information on the neighbors of all road segments, but weather stations may be far from such locations. The widely used intensity–duration–frequency analysis is too rough to overcome the tradeoff between estimation accuracy and reliability for assessing road vulnerability. Therefore, this study proposes a machine learning method to replace the frequency-style vulnerability with an intelligent measure, which will enhance the assessment by predicting the missing weather information at all road segments. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, our Markov chain random field kriging can reliably estimate the ungauged information when available stations are distributed asymmetrically. Therefore, our model contributes to the assessment methods by providing accurate and reliable vulnerability information for the transportation network under contemporary changing weather conditions. Through elaborate proofs to demonstrate the theoretical validity of our mathematical results, empirical results are also presented for application to practical governance. The empirical accuracy of 0.3 normalized root mean square error for disasters of storms and earthquakes is sufficient to convince local authorities to change their existing methods.

Drawing inspiration from economic theory, this mechanism allocates the slots based on an affine maximizer allocation rule and charges payments to the airlines to incentivize them to participate in the allocation process and reveal their actual valuations. The allocation also optimizes the occupancy of each slot to keep them as uncongested as possible. The formulation solves an optimal integral solution in strongly polynomial time. We conduct experiments on the data collected from two primary airports in India. We also compare our results with existing allocations and an allocation based on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) guidelines. The computational results show that our mechanism is more egalitarian and generates 20 % − 30 % higher social utility than the IATA based state-of-the-art approach and current allocations.",1366-5545,Not found
Integrating ride-sourcing with electric vehicle charging under mixed fleets and differentiated services,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102965,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This paper proposes a novel nested two-sided market framework to investigate integrated ride-sourcing (RS) and electric vehicle (EV) charging services considering mixed electric and gasoline vehicles (GVs). In the proposed integrated scheme, a monopoly RS platform builds or purchases charging piles to provide RS and private EV drivers with additional differentiated services (i.e., different charging prices and priority) besides public charging piles. Both RS and private drivers with different charging pile ownership are considered. The complex endogenous correlations between RS and charging services are formulated. The mathematical properties of drivers' charging behavior, passengers' mode choices, and platform's operation strategies are analytically derived, which is closely related to the differentiated priority of drivers. The conditions for judging the profitability of the RS and charging business under profit maximization strategies are obtained. We examine and compare the potential impact of introducing integrated services with two strategies and identify the sufficient conditions to boost total profit by providing the integrated services. It is rigorously proved that the integrated services benefit passengers and specific driver groups, while it may be harmful to the environment under a high RS electrification level. The Pareto-efficient frontiers indicate that the charging price for RS drivers in the social optimum regime is higher than that in the profit maximization regime. The analytical results gain managerial insights into platform operations and government regulation of integrated RS and charging services in the RS market under mixed fleets of EVs and GVs.",1366-5545,Not found
Reliable design of container shipping network with foldable container facility disruption,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102964,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Foldable containers constitute an emerging technology that returns an operational benefit in terms of cost savings and green transportation by curtailing empty container movements. However, their facilities are vulnerable to unfavorable events caused by disruptive events, and often experience complete failure in practice. To guarantee a certain level of reliability in foldable container operations, this study focused on designing a reliable container network against facility failure for foldable containers. A novel integer linear programming formulation for the problem of reliable facility location with foldable containers is proposed by designing an objective function with failure patterns. In this problem, special handling manners for operating foldable containers are incorporated for repositioning activities. We comprehensively analyzed numerical experiments to illustrate trade-offs between cost savings and potential risks concerning reliability in supply of empty containers by using a mix of standard and foldable containers. The impact of the failure on foldable container facilities is jointly influenced by foldable and standard containers and the degree of failure probability.",1366-5545,Not found
Financing strategy of transnational supply chain with vertical shareholding under tax system difference: Creditor or guarantor?,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102973,169,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Economic globalization enhances the international effect of income tax collection, which significantly impacts the taxable income and cash flow management of a transnational supply chain. This study investigates the financing preferences of the buyer and supplier in a transnational supply chain with vertical shareholding under tax symmetry and asymmetry. The buyer can act as a creditor to provide early payment financing or as a guarantor to help the supplier obtain a low-interest loan. We construct Stackelberg game models to determine the buyer’s and supplier’s equilibrium decisions and profits in two financing strategies under different tax systems. The results indicate that the buyer and supplier have inconsistent financing preferences when the supplier cannot borrow directly from the bank. The buyer always prefers to be a creditor, whereas the supplier’s financing preference depends on the trade-off between the sales revenue, production cost, financing interest, tax cost, and dividends. Surprisingly, we find an optimal shareholding ratio interval related to tax rates that can eliminate double marginalization under tax symmetry, and the supply chain can be more profitable than that under centralized decision-making. However, double marginalization cannot be eliminated under tax asymmetry. The results suggest management implications for the financing strategy choice and operational decisions of a transnational supply chain with vertical shareholding.",1366-5545,Not found
Impacts of blockchain-based digital transition on cold supply chains with a third-party logistics service provider,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103014,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Blockchain is a driver for digitalization in the fresh industry, but the resulting improvements in each supply chain member’s performance are difficult to predict. In this study, we examine the effects of blockchain-based digital transition in a cold supply chain with a manufacturer, a retailer, and a third-party logistics service provider (3PL). Our study provides several managerial implications. First, blockchain adoption would lead to a preservation service level increase if the 3PL charges a low transportation fee, but a preservation service level decrease if the 3PL charges a high one. Second, the blockchain adoption may induce the manufacturer to increase its wholesale price, which does not cause the retailer to cut the order quantity but instead sets a lager one. Third, our results indicate that simply relying on the market mechanism may not enable the cold supply chain to make the optimal decision; thus, government intervention or an exogenous coordination mechanism must be introduced to drive the cold supply chain members to reach a consensus on blockchain-based digital transition. Finally, the main results in the basic model are proven to remain robust. Managerial implications are discussed and provided.",1366-5545,Not found
For better or worse: Impacts of information leakage by a common supplier with innovation imitation of downstream firms,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103020,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"This paper considers a supply chain structure where an incumbent and an entrant order a critical component sequentially from a common supplier. The incumbent introduces an innovative product whose innovation value is its private information, and the entrant strategically chooses to either imitate the incumbent’s innovation at a cost or introduce a regular product without imitation. The supplier can choose whether or not to leak the incumbent’s order quantity to the entrant. This paper theoretically investigates the interplay between information leakage and innovation imitation, and examines the impacts of information leakage on the channel entities. We find that the entrant always imitates the innovation when the imitation cost is low, and imitation benefits the supplier but damages the incumbent. In the absence of incumbent’s quantity distortion, the supplier is more likely to leak the information except when the entrant’s imitation cost is moderate and the imitation ability is strong; however, its willingness to abandon information leakage increases in the presence of quantity distortion. Different from previous studies, our results suggest that quantity distortion enables a win–win–win outcome for supply chain members, all of whom have consistent preferences on information leakage. Besides, an information sharing agreement can be achieved between the incumbent and the entrant, which is beneficial to the supplier as well.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal procurement strategy for multi-echelon remanufacturing systems under quality uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103023,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Uncertainties in the quality and price of returned items add to the management complexity of remanufacturing system. To achieve the optimal procurement strategy for improved economic performance, this paper develops a mathematical model to quantify the impact of quality-based categorization of returned products under different return scenarios. Through the stochastic analysis of quality uncertainty with returns, it derives the optimal procurement strategy for cost minimization. The results show that an optimal procurement decision leads to over 80% cost savings in multi-echelon remanufacturing systems. Further, to bridge the gap between optimality theory and practical applications, this paper employs maximum likelihood estimation to speculate the key parameters of quality distribution in an empirical case whereby the optimal procurement strategies are formulated. Thus, the study provides a mathematical foundation for remanufacturers to make optimal decisions for the minimization of total cost. Importantly, the paper innovatively employs a quality coefficient to signal the overall condition in a batch of returned cores before accepting or dismantling, and then establishes the explicit relationship among the quality coefficient and production indexes in remanufacturing.",1366-5545,Not found
Pricing strategies in reward-based crowdfunding: Whether to introduce price guarantee?,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103024,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Reward-based crowdfunding often exhibits high uncertainty in terms of product quality and market performance; thus, consumers may choose to strategically delay their purchases until crowdfunding succeeds. Price guarantee (PG) is adopted by some crowdfunding platforms to encourage consumers’ participation in crowdfunding, but it also reduces the flexibility to change prices in the future. To address the strategic issue for reward-based crowdfunding regarding whether to introduce PG, we develop a two-stage theoretical model composed of a crowdfunding stage and a regular selling stage. The results show that whether to introduce PG heavily depends on the crowdfunding project’s funding target and community benefit. When the funding target is relatively low, the creator can offer PG as an effective substitute for community benefit to achieve crowdfunding success and increase profit, but it is unwise to offer both. That is, introducing PG can simultaneously increase the crowdfunding amount and the two-stage profit in the case of relatively low community benefit. When the funding target is relatively high, the creator will adopt a target-dependent pricing scheme to guarantee crowdfunding success. In this case, PG can increase the upper bound of the funding target but will decrease the profit in most situations. Our results also show that PG can increase both the creator’s and consumers’ payoffs under some conditions. The main findings are verified by means of empirical examples, and some managerial insights are obtained.",1366-5545,Not found
Blockchain and third-party logistics for global supply chain operations: Stakeholders’ perspectives and decision roadmap,10.1016/j.tre.2022.103012,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"In global supply chains, third-party logistics (3PL) services have proven to be critically important in helping many supply chain agents with distribution tasks so that they can focus on their core competencies of product development and manufacturing. However, there are many inadequacies in current global supply chains that affect the functions of 3PL. These shortcomings have necessitated digital transformation in many businesses. This digitalization enhances information sharing and supply chain visibility, which improves supply chain performance; however, it may create challenges regarding cybersecurity and data quality. Blockchain technology (BCT), with features such as being highly secure and distributed, can help. In this paper, we examine the literature and identify challenges associated with 3PL and how BCT can be used for 3PL. Then, we conduct interviews with four innovation/project managers of well-established logistics companies to uncover the status of BCT adoption in 3PL and the challenges that are hampering the adoption of this technology.

In this study, we investigate the supply disruption and international trade risks of an offshoring-based global production network using system dynamics simulation and game theory. The production network is formed by two contract manufacturers (CMs) and one original equipment manufacturer (OEM) located in different countries. First, a system dynamics simulation model considering supply disruption risk is established to evaluate the impacts of different supply disruption modes on the profit of OEM. To counteract the supply disruption risk, dynamic and static penalty mechanisms are proposed. By applying game analysis, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate why and how the dynamic penalty mechanism is superior to the static penalty mechanism. Second, we apply system dynamics and game theory to analyze the international trade risks (tariffs and exchange rates) for the offshoring-based global production network, and a cost-sharing mechanism for mitigating the trade risks is proposed.

Two-stage distributionally robust optimization for disaster relief logistics under option contract and demand ambiguity,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103025,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Disaster relief logistics (DRL) provides adequate relief supplies to victims of natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes and volcanic eruptions). This study explicitly considers supplier selection and inventory pre-positioning corresponding to static preparedness decisions, and post-disaster procurement and delivery associated with dynamic response decisions in actual DRL operations. To tackle issues triggered by shortage and surplus of multi-class relief resources, a flexible option contract is adopted to purchase relief items from suppliers. To measure the risk of demand ambiguity, a worst-case mean-quantile-deviation criterion is introduced to reflect the decision-maker’s risk-averse attitude. To handle the ambiguity in the probability distribution of demand, a novel two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed for the addressed DRL problem. The proposed DRO model can be transformed into equivalent mixed-integer linear programs when the ambiguity sets incorporate all distributions within L 1 -norm and joint L 1 - and L ∞ -norms from a nominal (reference) distribution. A computational study of earthquakes in Iran is conducted to illustrate the applicability of the proposed DRO model to real-world problems. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DRO model has superior out-of-sample performance and can mitigate the effect of Optimization Bias compared to the traditional stochastic programming model.

Logistics outsourcing: Effects of greenwashing and blockchain technology,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103015,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"In this paper, we study the logistics outsourcing strategy of a manufacturer with regard to green logistics, greenwashing, and blockchain. The manufacturer sells its products through an e-commerce platform, which has self-built logistics service. To transport the products to the customers, the manufacturer can choose to outsource this logistics service to the e-commerce platform or a third-party logistics (3PL) firm. The e-commerce platform and 3PL firm are called logistics firms in this paper. Both logistics firms consider investing in green logistics activities and may involve in greenwashing behavior. We show that outsourcing to the e-commerce platform is more beneficial for the manufacturer, no matter whether the logistics firms pursue greenwashing. Moreover, whether the logistics firms pursue greenwashing depends on both the probability that the greenwashing behavior is exposed and the corresponding penalty for greenwashing. Although adopting blockchain has the potential to prevent greenwashing, the logistics firms may still take risks to pursue greenwashing when the cost of blockchain adoption is too large. Interestingly, we find that the logistics firms will set the same green levels in logistics activities, independent of the outsourcing strategy of the manufacturer, and greenwashing decisions and blockchain adoption decisions of the logistics firms.",1366-5545,Not found
The economic ship speed under time charter contract—A cash flow approach,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102996,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Various deterministic models for economic ship speed optimisation exist in the literature, but none considered the time charter contract, and in particular the influence of the redelivery time. This paper studies the economic optimal speed of a ship on a (time) charter contract through the development of an Operational Research (OR) optimisation model. The ship charterer’s objective is to maximise the Net Present Value (NPV) of a cash-flow function of the ship’s activities over a relevant future horizon H , where H can be interpreted as any possible day within the redelivery time window as specified in the time charter clause. We develop a general time charter contract model P M ( H ) , and three special cases P 1 , P ∞ and P M ( H → ∞ ) , each model mapping onto different contractual contexts, and present algorithms to each of these models for finding optimal ship speeds for any journey structure. While ships on time charter contracts may travel to any series of ports during the charter contract, examining the models’ behaviour when the ship repeatedly executes a roundtrip journey allows us to reach some important general insights about the impact of contract type for any journey structure. In particular, economic speeds in P M ( H ) follow a very different pattern than those in the classic models from the literature, as well as in the recent class of NPV models P ( n , m , G o ) from Ge et al., (2021). We prove that P 1 and P ∞ map quite generally to the classes P ( 1 , n , 0 ) and P ( ∞ , n , − ), respectively, while P ( n , m , 0 ) shows behaviour in approximation equal to the special case P M ( H → ∞ ) . We prove that two main strands of speed optimisation models from the literature, which did not consider the contract type nor used the NPV approach, show equivalence under mild conditions to P 1 and P ∞ , respectively. These results facilitate matching models to contract types. None of these models, however, matches the general time charter contract model P M ( H ) introduced in this paper. In general, the paper demonstrates how optimal economic speed is dependent on the (time) charter contract type, and that this should thus be reflected in the speed optimisation model developed.",1366-5545,Not found
"Airport dominance, route network design and flight delays",10.1016/j.tre.2022.103000,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Airlines with a dominant position at the destination airports have little competitive pressure to reduce delays, but they might care about the negative effects that delays generate on their own flights. Using detailed daily flight data for six Spanish airports in 2017–2018 including very precise information on the external factors that generate flight delays, we find that flights operated by network airlines (i.e., airlines that operate a hub-and-spoke network) with a large presence at the destination airports have less delays than flights operated by other airlines. This finding is in line with the literature on congestion internalization, which predicts a negative relationship between airlines’ dominance at the destination airports and delays. We also show that flights operated by low-cost airlines (i.e. airlines that operate a point-to-point network) with a dominant presence at destination airports are more likely to exhibit delays. This result could be explained by the route configuration of low-cost airlines and by their relative low number of connecting passengers.",1366-5545,Not found

Purchase subsidies have been efficient tools in overcoming the cost barrier. In this paper, we formulate an analytical model to study the impact of EV anxiety and EVs’ environmental benefits on optimal subsidy and pricing decisions. We consider a market consisting of a vehicle manufacturer, a social planner and two segments of consumers: green and non-green. Both segments have EV anxiety. The manufacturer produces and sells both EVs and traditional vehicles. EV purchase decisions are influenced by consumers’ EV anxiety, preference for EVs, EV subsidy amounts, and retail prices for both EVs and traditional vehicles. Our results justify the necessity of a subsidy program in promoting EV sales. We identify the optimal subsidy under various market conditions. We further analyze how environmental benefit and consumers’ EV anxiety impact the optimal subsidy decisions. We find that it is optimal to offer the maximum level of subsidy when the environmental benefit is above a certain threshold value. Our results also show that the optimal subsidy either decreases or increases in consumers’ EV anxiety, depending on the level of environmental benefit of EVs. In addition, we show that EV anxiety has both positive and negative effects on the demand for EVs, but overall harms EV adoption.",1366-5545,Not found
Data-driven static and dynamic resilience assessment of the global liner shipping network,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103016,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"As a critical infrastructure system of modern society, the global liner shipping network (GLSN) has become increasingly complex and thus vulnerable to disruptions. This study proposes a resilience assessment framework for the GLSN across two dimensions, including static resilience and dynamic resilience. First, by leveraging high-frequency vessel movement data, the GLSN is constructed. Then, with the clique percolation method (CPM), overlapping community structures and key nodes can be identified. The static resilience assessment is initially conducted using simulation techniques, with nodes attacked through pre-designed scenarios. Then, a network disintegration method is employed to consider the impact of traffic flow on system resilience assessment, which separates the weighted GLSN into different layers for evaluation. The results show that both overlapping community structure and traffic flow significantly impact the resilience evaluation of the GLSN. Finally, to assess the dynamic resilience of the GLSN, we propose an innovative, knock-on effect simulation model with tailored, locally weighted flow redistribution rules. It provides a method for predicting the impacts of potential global disruptions (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) and critical maritime infrastructure failures (e.g., the Suez Canal obstruction) on the shipping network, which are of great concern not only to academia but also to industry.",1366-5545,Not found

We consider capacity expansion, capacity sharing, and rerouting as resilience strategies. We consider disruptions to be stochastic and to incorporate two sources of uncertainty: transportation costs and available capacity at facilities. We develop a Monte-Carlo simulation-based algorithm that uses the sample average approximation scheme to generate high quality solutions for our problem. We analyze the robustness and efficiency of the proposed model on a set of instances with up to 117 nodes and six collaborating enterprises.

Stochastic ridesharing equilibrium problem with compensation optimization,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102999,170,2023-02-01,2023,2,"In the urban traffic system with ridesharing programs, we develop a generalized stochastic user equilibrium model to formulate travelers’ mode and route choice behavior. To suit more general scenarios, the proposed model takes into consideration travelers’ heterogeneity in terms of car ownership and value of time, and travelers’ limited perceived information based on the stochastic user equilibrium principle instead of Wardrop’s user equilibrium principle. The proposed model is formulated as variational inequalities and an equivalent nonlinear mixed complementarity problem due to the inseparable and asymmetric travel cost functions. Furthermore, we address the decision-making problem of ridesharing compensation from the perspective of traffic managers and policy-makers who want to minimize the total travel cost and vehicular air pollution emissions simultaneously. A bi-objective optimization model and two single-objective optimization models are proposed to formulate this decision-making problem, in which travelers’ mode and route choice behavior has been respected. As a mathematical problem with complementarity constraints, the bi-objective optimization model is solved by an improved Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions for policy-makers and allow them to choose desired solutions. Finally, several numerical experiments based on two different scales of networks are conducted to demonstrate the properties of the problem and the performance of the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that rational pricing of ridesharing compensation can indeed mitigate urban traffic congestion and pollution emissions simultaneously. Moreover, by integrating travelers’ choice behavior based on the stochastic user equilibrium principle instead of the user equilibrium principle in the ridesharing compensation optimization model, this study derives a series of more effective decision-making strategies for ridesharing compensation.",1366-5545,Not found

When the cross-price elasticity coefficient is small and the platform commission rate is high, the dominant strategy of the e-tailer depends on the unit logistics service cost gauge of both the e-tailer and the third-party logistics provider.

We propose a multi-view fusion approach to automatically learn an adjacency matrix from flight duration and flight schedule factors. The learned adjacency matrix is then fed into a specially designed graph convolutional block, which governs the message passing process among airports. Finally, the graph convolutional block with the learned adjacency matrix is embedded into the gated recurrent units to capture temporal dependencies. Experimental results on a real-world dataset for the multistep prediction task show the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed model. In addition, visualisation and analysis of the learned adjacency matrix verify that the proposed multi-view fusion approach is capable of learning informative spatial interaction patterns.",1366-5545,Not found

Real landing data for twelve major European airports and ten Chinese ones are then analysed, showing that more interactions are present than what expected for the corresponding traffic.

Does the physicians’ medical team joining behavior affect their performance on an online healthcare platform?

However, only a handful of studies have explored the pros and cons of the OMT channel over the traditional individual online service channels in an OHP or examined the critical roles of physicians’ OMT joining behavior. To fill this gap, utilizing two sets of unbalanced panel data, representing high- and low-risk diseases, from 3,500 physicians in a leading OHP in China, we investigate the impacts of physicians’ OMT joining behavior on their online performance based on the trust-transfer theory. The moderating effect of physician’s team involvement is investigated based on data from a famous OHP application. Employing a combination of propensity score matching and difference-in-differences identification, the results indicate that physicians’ OMT joining behavior positively influences their online performance. Furthermore, for the physicians who deal with low-risk diseases, their OMT involvement weakens the positive relationship between their OMT joining behavior and online performance although it has the opposite impact in the case of high-risk diseases. Our subsample analyses provide further insights into how physicians’ OMT joining behavior influences their online performance based on their seniority levels. Specifically, for physicians with higher seniority levels, the team joining behavior positively influences their online performance whereas there is no significant effect for the physicians with lower seniority levels.",1366-5545,Not found
Pricing and carbon reduction strategies for vertically differentiated firms under Cap-and-Trade regulation,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103064,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This paper develops a price and low-carbon competition model for two vertically differentiated firms, a high-quality manufacturer (HM) and a low-quality manufacturer (LM), with consumers who prefer low-carbon products. The implementation of the cap-and-trade regulation (CATR) by the government is essential for the carbon trading market where firms can choose to buy (resp., sell) carbon quota when the unit carbon emission reaches above (resp., below) the allocated quota. An investigation is conducted into how the pricing and carbon reduction rate (CRR) of manufacturers would be affected by the CATR and low-carbon preference of consumers. In the absence of CATR, price and CRR always show a positive correlation for a manufacturer. However, under the CATR, hiking price is not necessarily the best choice for the manufacturer when the CRR is increased. Furthermore, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we demonstrate that in order to motivate manufacturers to increase CRR, the government should increase the unit carbon quota rather than reduce it. Moreover, it is demonstrated in this paper that the enforcement of the CATR does not necessarily result in a higher CRR, a lower total carbon emission, or higher social welfare. The government should be mindful in designing the CATR and choosing the unit carbon quota to achieve the desired outcome.",1366-5545,Not found

By comparing the revenue gap between information disclosing and hiding strategies concerning exogenous and endogenous member-only discounts, we find that platforms that aim at the high-end market by charging a higher product price and membership fee and whose target customers hold higher negative but lower positive reference price effect should implement the information hiding strategy. The findings guide e-commerce platforms to improve revenue by strategically hiding or disclosing member-only discounts in fee-based membership management.",1366-5545,Not found
"Integrated optimization of demand-driven timetable, train formation plan and rolling stock circulation with variable running times and dwell times",10.1016/j.tre.2023.103035,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Timetable, train formation plan and rolling stock circulation are the key operational issues for efficient railway operation. The three issues are optimized sequentially based on the order of the operational plan. Sequential optimization manner cannot balance the costs of the three stages effectively and could create an infeasible solution for a later stage when the resources are limited. In addition, because of the computational complexity, multiple variable elements, such as the variable running times, variable dwell times and the coupling/decoupling operations, of a transportation system are ignored. This paper focuses on optimizing timetable, train formation plan and rolling stock circulation simultaneously to minimize costs and meet passenger demand. The key to solving the problem is to determine operation times (i.e., arrival times, departure times, running times and dwell times), the formation type of each train service and rolling stock connections (including the turnaround operations and the coupling/decoupling operations) between these train services. Considering the passenger costs and operator costs, a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed to minimize the total passenger waiting time (TWT), the number of rolling stocks (NR), the number of formations (NF) and the number of coupling/decoupling operations (NC) based on a time–space network. The multi-objective MINLP model is further reformulated into a single-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model by logical linearizing, piecewise linearizing and fuzzy programming. A numerical example is used in which the exact solution of MINLP obtained by the BARON solver is compared with the approximate solution of MILP obtained by the CPLEX solver to verify the effectiveness of the piecewise linearization. Finally, the model is tested on a real-world case study of the Jinshan Line in Shanghai. The CPLEX solver can efficiently produce the approximate solution within a given computation time in acceptable gaps. The results demonstrate that the integrated model can reduce the number of rolling stocks and improve the utilization rate of rolling stocks. Furthermore, the integrated model can effectively resolve the shortage of rolling stocks when only one depot has rolling stocks or the number of available rolling stocks is limited. In addition, considering the multiple variable elements have a significant effect on the improvement of all the objectives and reduce both the passenger costs and the operator costs.",1366-5545,Not found
Adoption intentions of home-refill delivery service for fast-moving consumer goods,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103041,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Plastic waste from fast-moving consumer goods packaging has become a global concern. One solution is home-refill delivery service (HRDS) that offer the distribution of consumable products, including to environmentally conscious customers. This research thus employs an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with environmental concerns, green perceived value, and trust to explore the factors involved in the adoption intentions of HRDS among Indonesian consumers. From hypotheses empirically evaluated using partial least square structural equation modelling and multi-group analysis, we show a strong relationship between attitudes and adoption intentions of HRDS. Environmental concern relates significantly to green perceived value, perceived ease of use, and trust in forming positive attitudes toward HRDS. We further identify heterogeneity in relationships across socio-demographic characteristics, levels of trust, and stages of behavioral change. The findings herein provide useful insights into zero waste delivery services for consumer goods and empirical support for the important roles of consumer trust and environmental concern when adopting such services.",1366-5545,Not found
Agricultural insurance and power structure in a capital-constrained supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103037,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This study focuses on an agricultural supply chain with a capital-constrained manufacturer, a bank and an insurer under three power structures: insurer-led Stackelberg (IS), bank-led Stackelberg (BS) and vertical Nash (VN). By establishing a two-level Stackelberg game, we examine the application condition and role of agricultural insurance under three channel structures and reveal the preferences of the supply chain and its participants for different channel structures. This study shows that, in either model, the manufacturer purchases agricultural insurance when the bank is highly loss-averse, but the probability of the manufacturer adopting agricultural insurance in the BS model is lower than that of the VN model but higher than that of the IS model. In these three models, the manufacturer’s application of agricultural insurance increases the profits of the manufacturer, bank and insurer but reduces supply chain efficiency. In addition, from the perspective of the profit level and profit share of supply chain participants, for the manufacturer, the VN model of the two-level supply chain power structure betters than the BS and IS models of the three-level supply chain power structure, but the BS model is superior to the IS model; for the bank and the insurer, the higher their leadership positions in which power structure model, the better the power structure model. From the perspective of the overall profit and efficiency of the agricultural supply chain, the model preference of the supply chain is the same as that of the manufacturer. The findings provide new theoretical insights for the application of agricultural insurance and power relationship in the agricultural supply chain.",1366-5545,Not found
Impacts of blockchain technology with government subsidies on a dual-channel supply chain for tracing product information,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103032,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Transparent product information is a critical factor that promotes product sales. To satisfy the consumers’ expectation of product quality information, in practice, manufacturers (e.g., Beinmate, Aptamil, and Qiao’s compound) have adopted Blockchain Technology (BT) to help consumers trace the associated product information. In addition, the governments also encourage the application of BT by implementing relevant policies. This paper proposes a stylized dual-channel supply chain model to investigate the value added from adopting BT for manufacturers. We consider a setting that a manufacturer sells its product through two channels, i.e., offline retailer and online e-tailer. Under this circumstance, we find that the manufacturer is always willing to adopt BT to disclose product information. In particular, the offline retailer and consumers can receive benefits from this innovation, while the action is a double-edged sword for the online e-tailer. Moreover, under a special scenario that the government offers a quantity/innovation subsidy, we show that there exists a win–win–win situation for the manufacturer, the both selling channels, as well as the consumers. Finally, we compare the two subsidy policies and show that innovation subsidy can always achieve a better social welfare than quantity subsidy. Numerical examples are conducted to select the optimal subsidy policies and examine the extensions of this work.",1366-5545,Not found
Designing fast-charge urban electric bus services: An Integer Linear Programming model,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103065,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Currently, there is serious political support for the decarbonization of transport locally, nationally and even internationally. Public transport operators are focusing on the use of electric buses as an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. However, using electric buses requires a functional infrastructure of urban charging points. Fast-charging can be made available thanks to the progress made on the major technological charging devices in recent years. In this study, we consider an optimization problem of the design of an infrastructure for a fast-charge city electric bus service. The decisions which have to be made include determining a mixed fleet of conventional and electric buses, points for electric chargers and power stations, quantities of charging plug devices, a distribution of electric buses between the routes, and matching chargers with power stations. The objective is to maximize the route-weighted total passenger capacity of electric buses. An Integer Linear Programming model has been developed to complement the existing non-linear model. The new model is efficient if the number of possible charging spots is small, which is natural and frequent in practice. Extensive computer experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers near-optimal solutions of the studied problem in ten minutes for real-world instances on a standard PC and it outperforms the earlier approach on every instance.",1366-5545,Not found
Cluster linkages in the global production networks: Exploring the impacts on the expansion of emerging market multinationals,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103039,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The past two decades have witnessed the rapid penetration of emerging market multinational enterprises (EMNEs) into global production networks. Although existing literature documents the agglomeration effect of industrial clusters in affecting firms’ strategic decisions, less is known about how the heterogeneous cluster linkages at the national level affect the foreign market expansion of EMNEs. Based on a supply chain perspective, this study investigates the different cluster linkages between countries based on their upstream/downstream relations. We find that upstream–downstream (U-D) cluster linkages reduce the EMNEs’ expansionary entries into a foreign country, while the downstream-upstream (D-U) linkages lead to an increase in expansionary entries. These relationships are adversely moderated by firm-cluster relatedness. We also find that the expansionary entries of EMNEs positively affect their performance, and the relationship is moderated by the institutional environments in host countries. In summary, this study informs a more holistic understanding of the complexity of global production networks, considering the interplay between firms, clusters, and institutions.",1366-5545,Not found
Contracting with countervailing incentives under asymmetric cost information in a dual-channel supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103038,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This study investigates the optimal contract design with countervailing incentives under asymmetric selling cost information in a dual-channel supply chain comprising a manufacturer and retailer. The manufacturer’s selling cost is private and determines their reservation profit, which gives rise to type-dependent participation constraints. This study provides several intriguing results. First, when the external market correctly evaluates the selling cost advantage of the manufacturer, information asymmetry does not necessarily hamper channel efficiency, even in the dual-channel setting. Second, the retailer may distort the manufacturer’s selling quantity either upward or downward, while the retailer may distort their own selling quantity in the opposite direction. Such a synergistic effect unique to the dual channels may help the retailer balance information rent extraction and channel efficiency. Third, the manufacturer may benefit from intensified channel competition as long as the cost differential is not significant, or the cost differential is significant, but the channel substitution rate is relatively low. Finally, further examining the value of information, we demonstrate that the profit differential of the retailer (manufacturer, supply chain) exhibits an inverted U-shaped (U-shaped, hat-shaped) pattern with respect to the low-cost manufacturer’s reservation profit.",1366-5545,Not found
Experience-based territory planning and driver assignment with predicted demand and driver present condition,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103036,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The parcel delivery industry has enjoyed rapid growth with the rise of the e-commerce business. To survive the highly competitive market, service providers have introduced various methods to improve the customer experience, for example, providing faster response or wider delivery coverage. One way is to adopt the territory-based delivery system, in which each courier serves a fixed group of customers. In this study, we propose a novel territory design method allowing the territory plan to be adjusted while guaranteeing service consistency. The territory planning problem (TPP) can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), and we develop a two-stage Rolling Horizon (TSRH) method to compute the optimal territory plan. In the first stage, the algorithm assigns certain cells to the drivers based on the predicted demands. In the second stage, the remaining cells are assigned to the drivers with the actual demands while taking driver experience into consideration. The computational studies reveal that the proposed TSRH method is able to resolve the TPP efficiently, and it is robust under different situations. The TSRH method outperforms the classical method with fixed core areas. We also find that the learning potential and learning efficiency can largely impact the optimal territory plan, which eventually leads to significant improvement on driver’s performance.",1366-5545,Not found
Integrated operations planning in highly electrified container terminals considering time-of-use tariffs,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103034,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"With the electrification of port equipment, container terminals have become electricity-intensive consumers. The time-of-use (TOU) pricing policy has prompted container terminals to reoptimize their operations planning to decrease electricity costs. However, it is an essential challenge to optimally plan highly correlated operations of a container terminal in response to TOU tariffs. Traditional operations planning of a container terminal focuses on improving operational efficiency under flat electricity tariffs. The obtained solution under flat electricity tariffs may be far from optimal when the TOU pricing policy is involved. To this end, this paper addresses an integrated operations planning problem from container terminals under TOU tariffs. In particular, several vital resources, including quay cranes, yard cranes, and berths, are jointly scheduled to handle tasks from vessels and external trucks. The objective is to minimize the total costs. We formulate the integrated optimization problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. We then propose a logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) algorithm for the problem. The proposed LBBD method uses valid inequalities to speed up the solution procedure. To address practical-sized instances, we design a tailored genetic algorithm (GA) with several acceleration techniques. We demonstrate the performance of the LBBD method and tailored GA through numerical experiments. Results indicate that the proposed integrated approach yields a better solution than its decentralized counterpart, demonstrating that the total operational cost can be significantly reduced by applying the developed model. We also discuss managerial implications drawn from our results for the integrated operations planning under TOU tariffs, which help port operators make critical decisions.",1366-5545,Not found
Light commercial vehicles destination choice: Understanding preferences relative to the number of stop and tour-based trip type,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103042,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Freight delivery modelling has made significant progress in the past few decades. In this study we propose to use an aggregate multi-step approach to gain a better understanding of the tour-based trips of light commercial vehicles in Sydney, Australia. The paper identifies differences in destination choice-making given by the number of stop and the stop count of the trip, defined by the total number of stops in the tour-based trip. The findings suggest that estimating a separate model for each number of stops and stop count provides a better understanding on how destination choices are made. Different scenarios were simulated to show how the probability of choosing a certain destination depending on the number of stop and stop count changes due to variations in travel time and distance. Results show that light commercial vehicles are more sensitive to the generalised cost (defined by travel time and distance) in the first stop, and the sensitivity decreases as the trip is completed.",1366-5545,Not found
Exploring the drive-by sensing power of bus fleet through active scheduling,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103029,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Vehicle-based mobile sensing (a.k.a drive-by sensing) is an important means of surveying urban environment by leveraging the mobility of public or private transport vehicles. Buses, for their extensive spatial coverage and reliable operations, have received much attention in drive-by sensing. Existing studies have focused on the assignment of sensors to a set of lines or buses with no operational intervention, which is typically formulated as set covering or subset selection problems. This paper aims to boost the sensing power of bus fleets through active scheduling, by allowing instrumented buses to circulate across multiple lines to deliver optimal sensing outcome. We consider a fleet consisting of instrumented and normal buses, and jointly optimize sensor assignment, bus dispatch, and intra- or inter-line relocations, with the objectives of maximizing sensing quality and minimizing operational costs, while serving all timetabled trips. By making general assumptions on the sensing utility function, we formulate the problem as a nonlinear integer program based on a time-expanded network. A batch scheduling algorithm is developed following linearization techniques to solve the problem efficiently, which is tested in a real-world case study in Chengdu, China. The results show that the proposed scheme can improve the sensing objective by 12.0%–20.5% (single-line scheduling) and 16.3%–32.1% (multi-line scheduling), respectively, while managing to save operational costs by 1.0%. Importantly, to achieve the same level of sensing quality, we found that the sensor investment can be reduced by over 33% when considering active bus scheduling.

Service network design with consistent multiple trips,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103028,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"We introduce and study a challenging service network design problem arising within a city logistics company based in Beijing, China. To provide cost-effective same-day delivery services, the company divides the whole urban area into regions. Within each region, a fleet of small-capacity vehicles picks up and delivers packages. A fleet of line-haul vehicles (large-capacity vehicles) executes consistent multiple trips over the regions to transport consolidated packages, during which transshipment is allowed. In this study, we focus on designing the trips of line-haul vehicles, i.e., their region visiting sequences, as the performance of the logistics system depends significantly on the coordination of line-haul vehicles. We model the trip design problem as a service network design problem with consistent multiple trips. We develop a continuous-time MIP model to formulate the problem and optimally solve small-size instances. In addition, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic to solve larger instances. Numerical experiments on randomly generated instances as well as real-world operational data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution approach.",1366-5545,Not found

This study validates the feasibility of the proposed approach through an empirical study. We find that network connectivity decreases with a similar slope in the scenarios of earthquakes with magnitudes between 5.0 and 6.5 but begins to flatten at larger magnitudes.

Optimal pricing strategy for electric vehicle battery swapping: Pay-per-swap or subscription?,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103030,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Electric vehicles (EVs) contribute to carbon emission reduction, but the limitations of existing charging technologies impose a bottleneck to their further diffusion. Addressing the root issues of long waiting time and range anxiety, battery swapping demonstrates great market potential. A swapping service provider may choose between two pricing strategies based on battery rental: pay-per-swap and subscription. This study establishes a game-theoretical model to portray a simplified EV replenishment market including one charging station, one swapping station, and one battery renter, and explores the optimal pricing strategy. To capture the influence of consumer preferences, the model considers high versus low opportunity cost of time. In either scenario, consumers choose between charging and swapping to maximize surplus utility. Equilibrium prices, demands, and profits under pay-per-swap and subscription strategies are obtained through backward induction. The results indicate that pricing strategy choice-making hinges on provider-side operating cost, battery depreciation and reserve size, as well as consumer-side time sensitivity and opportunity cost. Numerical and extended analyses suggest that the subscription strategy is conducive to initial market development, whereas the more consumer-friendly pay-per-swap strategy is preferred afterwards.",1366-5545,Not found
Incentivized user-based relocation strategies for moderating supply–demand dynamics in one-way car-sharing services,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103017,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"One-way car-sharing services have drawn much attention in recent years in transportation research and practice. The flexible operating scheme stimulates patronage but causes unbalanced distributions of the shared cars and consequently low utilization of the services. In light of the empirical evidence that users are willing to cooperate with the operators for relocations, this paper formulates the supply–demand dynamics of shared cars under four user-based relocation strategies, including a naive one without incentive and three alternatives with incentives. We formulate the triggering conditions and travel disutilities responding to the incentive-based strategies based on the concept of load-space–time paths. To systematically assess the effects of the strategies, we propose an incentive-based boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium (IBR-DUE) model in a multimodal transportation system. A cluster-based column generation algorithm is developed to solve the IBR-DUE model without path enumeration in a space–time supernetwork. Numerical examples demonstrate that the alternative drop-off incentive outperforms other strategies and can improve the utilization and service rates about 2 times on average.",1366-5545,Not found

An economic analysis of on-demand food delivery platforms: Impacts of regulations and integration with ride-sourcing platforms,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103019,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This paper presents an economic analysis of on-demand food-delivery platforms and investigates management strategies that protect restaurant owners and for-hire gig workers in the sharing economy. We consider two markets that are both operated based on sharing economy: (a) the food-delivery market where a platform offers on-demand food-delivery services to customers; and (b) the ride-sourcing market where a platform provides on-demand ride-hailing services to passengers. These two markets are interdependent as the two platforms share the same pool of for-hire drivers. An economic equilibrium model is proposed to capture the incentives of food-delivery customers, ride-hailing passengers, restaurant owners, for-hire drivers, the food-delivery platform, and the ride-sourcing platform. The profit-maximizing decisions of each platform are modeled, and both competitive and collaborative interactions between the platforms are characterized. Based on the model, we first investigate the impacts of a cap on the commission rate charged to restaurant owners. We find that within certain regime the commission cap would benefit restaurants. However, beyond this regime, the commission cap becomes overly-protective, and further reducing it will induce increased costs for food-delivery customers, reduced earnings for food-delivery couriers, reduced profits of the food-delivery platform, which can even lead to slightly reduced earnings for the restaurants, making everyone worse off in the food-delivery market (compared to a less aggressive commission cap). Furthermore, we consider an alternative strategy where no regulatory intervention is necessary and the food-delivery and ride-sourcing services are integrally operated by a single platform. We show that collaboration between the two platforms can offer a Pareto improvement when the market demand of the ride-sourcing service is relatively small.",1366-5545,Not found
Passenger engagement dynamics in ride-hailing services: A heterogeneous hidden Markov approach,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103018,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Despite their current growth and future promise, ride-hailing companies struggle with brand loyalty. As a result, they spend heavily on various marketing tools, especially promotional offers, to encourage passenger engagement, which is often measured by how frequently passengers ride through their platforms. Although extensive research has investigated the passenger intention to continue using ride-hailing services, research that explicitly models the dynamics of passenger engagement is very scarce. In this research, we propose to capture passenger engagement dynamics in ride-hailing services and the factors contributing to them. We combine a heterogeneous hidden Markov model framework with Poisson regression models to probabilistically analyze the transition processes of passenger engagement. Specifically, we capture the influences of various promotional offers on the engagement transition probabilities. We conduct numerical experiments using real-world ride-hailing data. Results show that our model identifies inactive, occasional, and active engagement levels. Our coefficient estimates and sensitivity analysis show that giving moderately more promotional offers to inactively and occasionally engaged passengers would efficiently activate them. More importantly, we derive information about which promotional offers have more significant impacts on the passengers of different engagement levels.",1366-5545,Not found
On-demand ride-sourcing markets with cryptocurrency-based fare-reward scheme,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103027,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Cryptocurrency-based fare-reward scheme has been emerging from on-demand ride-sourcing platforms. The reward scheme provides each passenger with some units of cryptocurrency as rewards for use of ride service. The passengers can redeem the rewards for various redemption options. The redemption options offer the passengers economic benefits to offset a portion of costs of using ride services. In this way, the economic benefits serve as incentives for the passengers to repeatedly use ride services, which leads to increase in passenger demand for the platforms. From a passenger perspective, the reward scheme has a distinctive feature in that economic benefits can fluctuate according to changes in price of cryptocurrency in the future. Therefore, the passengers perceive the benefits differently based on their own risk preference and expectation of future price changes. It creates a challenge for the platforms because the optimal decisions for ride services vary by the value that the passengers place for their cryptocurrency rewards. To tackle this challenge, this paper analyzes the impacts of the reward scheme on on-demand ride-sourcing markets. The analysis is done with a mathematical model where a ride-sourcing platform makes decisions for trip fare, vehicle fleet size and cryptocurrency reward size. The reward decision is available under the assumption that the platform secures as many units of cryptocurrency as it rewards to passengers at their equilibrium price level. The model defines passengers’ perceived value of cryptocurrency rewards in terms of risk aversion level and expectation of future price growth of cryptocurrency. Afterwards, we investigate equilibrium and optimal properties of monopoly, social-optimum and second-best optimum ride-sourcing markets. Our analysis gives several key insights on the markets. First, the markets always locate at normal regime where interactions between passenger demand and vehicle supply for ride services converges to a stable equilibrium state. Second, this study shows that a ride-sourcing platform would make a decision to reward if passengers expect larger economic benefits from future redemption of cryptocurrency rewards than their current value. Third, it is shown that the quality of ride services would get worse because average pick-up time for passengers and drivers gets longer with more passenger retention. Fourth, this paper finds that the markets have more room to improve profit or social welfare as passengers expect larger speculative gains from reward redemption.",1366-5545,Not found
Opportunism in supply chains: Dynamically building governance mechanisms to address sustainability-related challenges,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103021,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Opportunism has long been highlighted as one of the hazards of complex buyer–supplier relationships. This hazard has become more challenging to manage as the pressure from consumers and the public for improved sustainability-related performance is passed along the supply chain between buyers and suppliers. For example, buyer demands for and supplier implementation of sustainability requirements, such as low carbon emissions or fair worker treatment, are often poorly defined; difficult to document; and subject to change as pressure for immediate improvement builds, as scientific understanding deepens and as societal expectations advance. This complex setting generates tempting openings for either a buyer or supplier to act opportunistically. In an effort to advance both theory and managerial practice, we consider three aspects of sustainability-related opportunism. First, in line with prior research, we focus on defining sustainability-related opportunism as jointly considering the codification of expectations and verification of performance (while allowing for false suspicions). Second, our conceptualization stresses the need to move away from an implied static view to embrace more fully the changing nature of stakeholders’ sustainability-related concerns. For example, supply chain relationships evolve based on repeated interactions as firms influence each other’s beliefs, practices and outcomes. Third, in a related sense, a dynamic model can combine several theoretical perspectives to inform how the balance of transactional and relational governance mechanisms might adapt as our understanding of sustainability changes, institutional forces evolve, and dyadic relationships mature.",1366-5545,Not found
A comparative investigation of a seller's disaster payment period policy,10.1016/j.tre.2022.103009,171,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Sellers can offer various payment schemes for buyers to boost demand, with the advance, cash, and credit payment policies being popular approaches. To provide further insight into the dynamics of these policies, we consider them in addition to a Disaster Grace Period payment option, which has become increasingly prevalent. The seller’s motivation for offering Advance, Cash, Credit or Disaster Grace Period (ACCD) payment options include the desire for a stronger relationship to the buyer, a smoother cash flow throughout the supply chain, and a potential increase in demand. In addition, the disaster grace period payment scheme can help in better navigating worldwide emergencies, such as pandemics, but also natural emergencies like severe storms, floods, tornadoes, and landslides, which have been happening with an increasing frequency over the last decades. However, the increase in the payment period increases the default/disaster risk, rendering a trade-off between risk and demand, making these crucial parameters in influencing the seller’s profit. Within this context, we aim to find the optimum replenishment cycle and payments period for a seller to increase their total profit. To do so, we perform numerical analysis to examine the impact of the demand coefficient, interest rate, default risk, disaster risk, and the disaster demand coefficient on profit. The results offer managerial insights on which payment option to choose in a particular setting to maximize profit. We for example find that sellers should offer a disaster grace period when the disaster demand increases and the risk of a disaster decreases.",1366-5545,Not found

To address the conservativeness of robust solutions during the evolution of the epidemic, an uncertainty budget adjustment strategy is proposed and integrated into the rolling horizon optimization approach. The results of the case study show that (i) the short-term prediction method has higher accuracy and the accuracy increases with the amount of observed data; (ii) considering the demand uncertainty, the proposed robust optimization model combined with uncertainty budget adjustment strategy can improve the performance of the emergency logistic network; (iii) the proposed solution method is more efficient than its benchmark, especially for large-scale cases.

These additional considerations are important to include in the development of more efficient food supply chains, but lead to a challenging routing problem. In this paper, we formulate the HFVRPTW-MDHS using a mixed-integer linear programming model. Due to the complexity of the model, we propose a customized adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) metaheuristic. We design a multi-level struct-based solution representation to improve the efficiency of the ALNS and develop customized methods for solution evaluation, feasibility checks, and neighborhood search. Comparing our results with the results of an exact algorithm and solutions in the existing literature, we find that our ALNS algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions quickly when solving HFVRPTW-MDHS and related variants of the VRP. Finally, we study the application of our approach in the case of precooling, which is a commonly used preprocessing operation, to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in a relevant practical context.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal combination of platform channel contract and guarantee financing strategy in e-commerce market,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103094,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"With the development of economy and technology, e-commerce platforms can connect consumers and online channel suppliers providing transportation services through third-party logistics (3PL). To help these suppliers, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with financing dilemmas, this paper proposes evidence on the members of the e-commerce supply chain providing procurement and financial assistance. Many partner enterprises offer various innovative financing schemes, such as guarantee financing. To examine the advantage in practice, we study the guarantee financing in the online channel of e-commerce market, which includes capital constrained SME suppliers, e-commerce platforms, 3PLs and banks. We analyze the equilibrium of the optimal combination strategy with channel sales mode and guarantee financing scheme, and explore the conditions under which this innovative financing scheme will benefit all members. It is more feasible for the SME supplier to seek the e-commerce platform (or the 3PL) guarantee financing with high (low) platform service construction cost compared with bank loans without guarantee. This preference comes from the trade-off between the potential market demand risk in sales season and the financing risk of the debtor. We further determine how the release on the sales mode of platform is affected by the guarantee financing scheme. No matter who guarantees, the platform tends to provide the reselling (marketplace) mode when the market demand risk is flat (high). With the increasing of investment in platform’s service construction, the platform is more (less) willing to switch the role from the non-guarantor to the guarantor in the reselling (marketplace) mode. The reason is that the e-commerce platform and the 3PL prefer to act as non-guarantor to obtain free-riding benefits, especially in the marketplace mode. Results of this paper provide theoretical support for the innovative financial practice of the e-commerce industry. The insights are relevant to the e-commerce platform and the 3PL managers who aim to promote the applicability of financing scheme to debtors under two channel modes and increase the revenue through construction investment and business expansion.",1366-5545,Not found
Exploring a new development direction of the Belt and Road Initiative in the transitional period towards the post-COVID-19 era,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103082,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, its impacts have been envisaged in multi-dimensional ways, including global supply chains, international logistics, and transportation. Owing to a series of virus variants since 2020, several Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects have been halted along the Belt and Road (B&R), and their implementation progress has been affected. In addition, China, which initiated the BRI in 2013, has been facing challenges which are caused by its economic, socio-demographic, and international political structural changes. Moreover, growing conflicts and tensions in international trade and politics, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine, China-US trade conflicts, foreign companies’ reshoring the production lines from China, and diplomatic disputes between China and Australia, have been interwoven with the impacts of COVID-19 on the supply chains, international trade, and transportation in the world. Having considered the above, this study explores a new research-driven approach to reignite the BRI momentum in the transitional period towards the post-COVID-19 era from a Chinese economic perspective. In doing so, this paper proposes nine research agendas, such as the optimization network of transportation and logistics distribution centers (LDCs) along the B&R, priority development and performance of LDCs, greening the B&R with green shipping corridors, revisiting port devolution continuum, humanitarian logistics in association with COVID-19, security and risk analysis of China’s energy supply chains, and export of the 6th Generation Ports (6GP) model with smart ports to major container ports along the port supply chains.

Innovative development strategy of a risk-averse firm considering product unreliability under competition,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102970,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This paper aims to seek the innovative development strategy for a leading firm in a competitive market when considering product unreliability and risk behavior. A higher innovation level may bring about better product performance. Nevertheless, it may cause some unreliability events which might incur serious negative outcomes (e.g., products recall). Facing uncertain outcomes, the innovative firm may care more about the risk of innovation when making decisions, especially in a competitive market. We build a Stackelberg game model for a competitive market consisting of a leading firm and a competitor. The Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is used to measure the firm’s risk attitude. The optimal innovation strategy of the leading firm and the response strategy of the competitor is obtained. We find that the optimal innovation strategy takes three different forms depending on the risk attitude and the development cost of innovation. i.e., no innovation, complete innovation and partial innovation. In addition, different from most existing literature on risk-averse players’ pricing decisions, we find that a risk-averse innovative firm may set a higher price to focus on only tech-savvy consumers. Moreover, the effects of innovation are also investigated. We find that the two competing firms can achieve a win–win result by adopting an appropriate innovation strategy.",1366-5545,Not found
A comparative analysis of charging strategies for battery electric buses in wholesale electricity and ancillary services markets,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103085,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The application of smart charging to battery electric buses can provide opportunities for bus operators to reduce the operational costs of their bus fleet. This research aims to create insight into the impact of different charging strategies for battery electric bus fleets on charging costs and the grid load. It proposes a novel framework to model the charging process of battery electric buses for different charging strategies: charging-on-arrival, peak-shaving, day-ahead market optimization with and without vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functions, including the provision of Frequency Containment Reserves (FCR) and automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR) for system balancing in ancillary services markets. Model simulations are conducted to compare the charging costs and grid impact of different charging strategies, using three depots of bus operator Qbuzz in the Netherlands as a case study. Results indicate that the application of smart charging algorithms can considerably reduce charging costs for bus operators. Application of the peak-shaving strategy was found to reduce charging costs by 23–32% compared to the reference case of charging-on-arrival. Charging costs can be further reduced by 6–11% when considering day-ahead market optimization. Participation in ancillary services markets for system balancing is economically attractive for bus operators, particularly in the aFRR market, characterized by a cost reduction potential of 90–¿100% compared to the charging-on-arrival strategy. The grid impact analysis indicates that charging-on-arrival can result in high charging demand peaks, which can be drastically reduced by the application of peak-shaving or day-ahead market optimization charging strategies. However, the provision of aFRR and FCR using the battery electric bus charging process can have a severe impact on the local grid in terms of high peak demand.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimization of ride-sharing with passenger transfer via deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103080,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"With the emergence of the sharing economy and the rapid growth of mobile communications technologies, many novel sharing service models have been developed stemming from ride-hailing. Urban traffic congestion, coupled with energy conservation and emissions reduction, has prompted research on enhancing vehicle seat utilization in taxi service. To offer more effective and reliable ride-hailing, we consider ride-sharing problem with passenger transfer that allows passegers to transfer between vehicles at transfer stations. The problem requires simultaneous addressing the issues of request dispatching, transfer scheduling, and vehicle rebalancing. Studying such a ride-hailing model, we propose a novel joint decision framework combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with integer-linear programming (ILP) to solve the problem. We use ILP to obtain the optimal online dispatching and matching strategy in each decision stage, and DRL to learn the approximate state value of each vehicle that incorporates with some strategies to limit the state space and reduce the computational complexity. Performing numerical studies on the real-world trip dataset in Chengdu, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, and that ride-sharing with passenger transfer is more beneficial than traditional ride-sharing.",1366-5545,Not found
The ride-hailing sharing problem with parcel transportation,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103073,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This paper proposes a ride-hailing sharing problem with parcel transportation. In the study, both passengers and parcels can be transported by ordering the requests through a ride-hailing platform, in which the passengers can only be delivered by ride-hailing vehicles (RHVs) while parcels can be delivered by both RHVs and electric motorcycles (EMs). Compared with RHVs, EMs have a lower speed, a smaller capacity for parcels, and a lower driving cost per kilometer. Parcels are divided into eight classes according to the size of parcels (i.e., extra small, small, middle, and large) and the urgency of parcels (i.e., urgent and non-urgent). Passengers and passengers, passengers and parcels, as well as multiple parcels, are allowed to share the same vehicles in this problem. A two-level lexicographic multi-objective function is proposed from the perspective of the ride-hailing platform, where the first-level objective is to maximize the profit of the platform and the second-level objective is to minimize the total driving cost of RHVs and EMs. The time-varying property of passenger requests is considered and the proposed problem is divided into a set of continuous and small-scale ride-hailing subproblems. Each subproblem is formulated to match both passenger and parcel requests to RHVs and EMs, and to determine vehicle routes. Time window constraints, RHV capacity constraints for passengers, RHV trunk capacity constraints for parcels and luggage, and EM delivery box capacity constraints are considered. The modified artificial bee colony (MABC) algorithm is proposed based on the framework developed by Zhan et al. (2022) to solve the ride-hailing sharing problem with parcel transportation. The results of numerical experiments show that allowing RHVs to transport parcels can significantly increase the profit of the platform, the number of matched requests, and the average profit of RHV drivers. If RHVs are allowed to pick up parcels, the government should encourage the replacement of all EMs with RHVs under the more-passengers-fewer-parcels scenario. However, the government should not encourage the replacement of all EMs with RHVs and allow some EMs in the ride-hailing market under the fewer-passengers-more-parcels scenario.",1366-5545,Not found
Do parcel lockers reduce delivery times? Evidence from the field,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103070,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Common-carrier parcel lockers have emerged as a secure, automated, self-service means of delivery consolidation in congested urban areas, which are believed to mitigate last-mile delivery challenges through reducing out-of-vehicle delivery times and consequently vehicle dwell times at the curb. However, little research exists to empirically demonstrate the environmental and efficiency gains from this technology. In this study, we designed a nonequivalent groups pre-test/post-test control experiment to estimate the causal effects of a parcel locker on delivery times in a residential building in downtown Seattle, WA. The causal effects are measured in terms of vehicle dwell time and the time delivery couriers spend inside the building, through the difference-in-difference method and using a similar nearby residential building as a control. The results showed a statistically significant decrease in time spent inside the building, and small yet insignificant reduction in delivery vehicle dwell time at the curb.

Crowdfunding or traditional mode? Strategy choices in product selling,10.1016/j.tre.2022.103011,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This study examines two selling strategies, namely, crowdfunding and traditional selling. Under traditional selling, the production behavior of the creator occurs before the purchases by consumers. In this case, the demand is uncertain, and the creator’s production behavior is affected by the initial funding level. Under crowdfunding, the production behavior of the creator comes after the consumers have provided funding. In this case, consumers bear the opportunity cost, and the campaign succeeds (leading to production) only when the market demand exceeds a threshold value. In the basic model, we investigate the pricing strategy and the expected profit of the creator for each selling strategy. Our analysis reveals that crowdfunding dominates traditional selling when the creator’s initial funding is low, or the unit production cost is high. We then generalize our models by considering product quality, providing main results consistent with those derived in the basic model but also revealing new and interesting insights. For example, in the case of endogenous product quality, the creator prefers a low production volume under traditional selling, and the opportunity cost has a large (small) impact on crowdfunding (traditional selling). Finally, we examine several extensions to our studies, including adopting Keep-It-All model for crowdfunding, the case involving multiple potential consumers, and the case where the consumer’s valuation follows a normal distribution. Our paper highlights that crowdfunding, as a method of collecting finance, is also advantageous for creators with sufficient initial funding under certain conditions. Conclusions from these investigations can guide creators during their sales planning.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimization of a rural bus service integrated with e-commerce deliveries guided by a new sustainable policy in China,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103069,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Electronic business has expanded, resulting in flourishing rural e-commerce globally, and particularly in China. This paper introduces a novel rural public transit system that integrates passenger and freight services—a rural electric bus service that provides services for passengers and e-commerce packages. This blended service reduces logistical costs and generates additional income for the transit operator. The objective is to minimise cost for the transit user and operator by using a mixed-integer linear programming model that solves bus routing and bus trip scheduling for multiple rural towns; in addition, the model is tested by the Gurobi solver at small-scale instances. The developed solution is a hybrid heuristic algorithm based on adaptive large neighborhood search and tabu search approaches. Finally, a case study in China is conducted to examine the proposed cost-effective methodology and ensure that the integrated scheme will significantly save operational system costs without causing any passenger inconvenience. The research also shows how to optimally design the size of rural electric buses to reduce purchasing and maintenance costs. The optimal results of the case study, comprising 5 towns and 78 villages, show an annual cost saving of approximately ¥847,000 (approximately $121,000) and an annual mileage saving of approximately 66,000 km for the proposed scheme.

Incorporating environmental benefits and economic impacts, a bi-level programming model following the Stackelberg game regime is proposed to capture the SECA design problem for a given coastal area, in which the irregular polygon of the SECA is assumed to be a convex hull and described by a system of linear constraints. The government, as the leader, minimizes total sulphur emissions of ships over the entire coastal area with the voyage cost constraint. The ships, as followers, minimize individual voyage costs by jointly choosing the sailing trajectories and speed profile inside and outside the SECA between the associated port pairs with the given geometric configuration of the SECA. We first derive the optimal trajectory and speed profile for each ship, which can be simplified to a shortest path problem. Subsequently, a heuristic algorithm based on the steepest descent method is proposed to obtain the Pareto optimal solution in the sense of simultaneous minimization of total emissions and voyage costs. Finally, two announced SECAs are adopted to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found
To acquire or compete? Government intervention in transportation under different route structures,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103033,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"What is the ideal way for a government to regulate an existing transportation monopoly based on the structure of the transport market? We analyze the government’s regulatory problem from the perspective of two possible strategies: partially publicizing the existing monopolist, and entering the transport market directly as a competitor. In a model in which heterogeneous consumers are uniformly distributed in their valuation of transportation services while also considering both price and travel latency in their transport choice, we fully characterize the equilibrium under each of the two regulatory strategies under a serial or a parallel transport structure, respectively. The optimal policy depends on both the transport route structure and the government’s degree of intervention. Under a serial structure, the government can achieve the socially optimal traffic flow by entering the market as a competitor or fully acquiring the firm, while partial acquisition cannot achieve this goal. However, in a parallel structure, while direct duopoly competition cannot achieve a socially optimal result, direct competition can outperform partially publicizing the monopolist if the acquisition level is sufficiently low. We also consider asymmetric parallel route structures and joint design of both types of regulations. Our findings provide policy implications for governments interested in applying efficient regulatory policies under different transportation route structures.",1366-5545,Not found

Buy now or later? New or remanufactured? How to attract strategic customers,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103068,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"It is common for sellers to markdown product prices late in a selling season which prompts consumers to strategically manage their purchase timing. Facing consumers’ strategic behaviour, the manufacturer should decide the prices for products carefully to ensure its profit. This paper explores the manufacturer’s optimal pricing decisions in a closed-loop supply chain by considering the customers’ type, the limited number of returns, consumers’ acceptability of the remanufactured products, as well as the discounting rate of consumers’ perceived value for a delayed purchase. The results show that the manufacturer’s retailing plan and the optimal prices depend on the unit production cost of the new and remanufactured products. In general, the consumer’s strategic behaviour hurts the manufacturer’s profit. When consumers are strategic, the manufacturer reduces the selling price of the new product and it is less likely to engage in remanufacturing when the unit production cost of the new product is high as compared to the case of myopic customers. The numerical experiments provide additional implications and show that the manufacturer can take some simple counter-measure strategies to react to either the underestimation or overestimation of the expected price by the consumer.",1366-5545,Not found
Assessing last-mile distribution resilience under demand disruptions,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103066,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant breakdown of the traditional retail sector resulting in an unprecedented surge in e-commerce demand for the delivery of essential goods. Consequently, the pandemic raised concerns pertaining to e-retailers’ ability to maintain and efficiently restore level of service in the event of such low-probability high-severity market disruptions. Thus, considering e-retailers’ role in the supply of essential goods, this study assesses the resilience of last-mile distribution operations under disruptions by integrating a Continuous Approximation (CA) based last-mile distribution model, the resilience triangle concept, and the Robustness, Redundancy, Resourcefulness, and Rapidity (R4) resilience framework.

In particular, the authors analyzed the use of an independent crowdsourced fleet (flexible service contingent on driver availability); the use of collection-point pickup (unconstrained downstream capacity contingent on customer willingness to self-collect); and integration with a logistics service provider (reliable service with high distribution costs). Overall, this work recommends the e-retailers to create a suitable platform to ensure reliable crowdsourced deliveries, position sufficient collection-points to ensure customer willingness to self-collect, and negotiate contracts with several logistics service providers to ensure adequate backup distribution.",1366-5545,Not found
Finite-horizon joint inventory-pricing optimization with non-concave demand and lost sales,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103067,172,2023-04-01,2023,4,"In this paper, we study a periodic-review joint inventory and pricing optimization problem in a stochastic price-sensitive demand framework with lost sales. We contribute to the existing literature from three aspects: generalizing the form of demand functions, developing the technique of proving concavity preservation, and extending the scope of optimality conditions. Specifically, we set the demand in our model as a general function. In order to obtain the optimality condition under general demands, we first introduce the concept of Price Elasticity of the Slope (PES) and transform the original PES condition between sales and profit in literature into a PES condition between sales and demand. Then, we obtain the lower bound of the PES difference between sales and profit by utilizing our transformed condition. With the non-negativity of the lower bound, we obtain two groups of easy-to-verify conditions which consist of the mean demand and the probability distribution of the demand. Under specific demand forms, the obtained conditions are reduced to constraints on the distribution of price-free uncertainty and the deterministic functions of price, respectively. Compared with the existing literature, our study therefore extends the scope of optimality conditions and includes non-concave demand functions when adapting a base-stock list-price (BSLP) policy in a joint inventory-pricing problem. Our conditions ensure that more types of products (e.g., the products of which the price elasticity of demand is constant) meet the optimality of the BSLP strategy, and more retailers can make pricing and replenishment decisions based on this strategy.",1366-5545,Not found

Depending on whether the online platform encroachment happens or not, we consider two different platform operation modes, namely, the mode without platform encroachment where only the third-party retailer sells products, and the mode with platform encroachment where both the online platform and the third-party retailer sell products. Our analysis shows that when the online platform does not encroach, it has no incentives to share forecast information with the manufacturer, but always has incentives to share forecast information with the third-party retailer. Interestingly, when the online platform encroaches, the online platform may share forecast information, depending on the level of substitutability between products and commission rate charged by it, either only with the third-party retailer, or with both the manufacturer and the third-party retailer, or with none of them.",1366-5545,Not found
A day-to-day dynamic model for mixed traffic flow of autonomous vehicles and inertial human-driven vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103113,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is likely to bring unprecedented change to existing transport systems due to its potential to enhance safety and efficiency. Nevertheless, before entering a fully AV era, human-driven vehicles (HVs) and AVs are expected to coexist for a long time, during which HVs and AVs could behave differently in route choice. On the one hand, compared with HVs, AVs can acquire more comprehensive traffic information and also process the information more swiftly. On the other hand, HV users may habitually maintain a satisfactory path but not necessarily choose the optimal one to the same destination to save cognitive during daily trips. AV users, however, may not show such behavior on account of the advantages of AVs. To capture these features in the coexistent period, understand their effects on the evolution of daily traffic flow, and provide managerial insights, this study presents a deterministic discrete time day-to-day dynamic assignment model for the mixed HV and AV traffic flows. In which both AV users and HV users choose their path according to their perception, AV users have better perceptual ability than HV users, and bounded behavioral inertia is first introduced to depict the travel behavior that HV users habitually maintain a satisfactory path during daily trips. The existence and uniqueness of the fixed-point and the convergence conditions of the proposed dynamic model are demonstrated and given. Theoretical results are verified in a simple two-path network, the Nguyen-Dupuis network, and the Sioux Falls network, respectively. The interactions between AVs and HVs are explored in the three numerical examples. Our research indicates that the introduction of AVs can reduce the overall travel time of a transport system and increase road capacity. Bounded behavioral inertia of HV users can maintain more HV flows on a better route, brings a more balanced distribution of travel flow on different paths, and facilitate the stability of a whole transport system.",1366-5545,Not found
Simulation-based dynamic origin–destination matrix estimation on freeways: A Bayesian optimization approach,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103108,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This study focuses on dynamic origin–destination demand estimation problem on freeway networks. Existing studies on this problem rely on high-coverage of traffic measurements and assumptions on travel times, exhibiting limitations in real-world applications. We formulate the problem as a bi-level programming model, where micro-simulations are incorporated to precisely model traffic flows/travel times on freeways. The bi-level programming model cannot provide explicit closed-form expressions for the objective function and its derivatives, and also intrinsically high-dimensional. Thus, it is highly challenging to find efficient solution algorithms. In this regard, a problem-specific and computationally efficient Bayesian optimization approach is designed. Herein, a novel surrogate model is proposed by embedding a physical surrogate model (it characterizes underlying physical mechanisms and provides global yet less precise approximations) into a functional surrogate model (it provides precise local approximations). The embedding provides problem-specific knowledge for the surrogate model. More importantly, it also restricts the feasible region, enabling the surrogate model to efficiently deal with high-dimensional problems. Gaussian process can be served as the functional surrogate model. Two linear physical surrogate models are proposed to capture interactions between travel demand and traffic measurements. To deal with constraints in the surrogate model, a projection-distance based acquisition function is designed. In searching for new points, the proposed acquisition function is capable of assigning unique weight of exploration to each feasible solution. The proposed approach is validated based on a freeway corridor example, which indicates its outperformance over existing dynamic origin–destination estimation methods in terms of computational efficiency and solution accuracy.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimizing subsidy strategies of the ride-sourcing platform under government regulation,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103112,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Under governmental regulation of ride-sourcing platforms, subsidies on passengers and drivers have become an effective incentive to coordinate supply and demand. To achieve the optimization goal of both growth and savings, platforms need to know the impact of the two subsidies on coordinating the supply and demand and what amount of the subsidy is appropriate. This paper formulates a multi-stage game-theoretic model to reveal the coupling game among heterogeneous passengers, heterogeneous drivers, and the ride-sourcing platform in the on-demand ride services market regulated by the government. In this model, passengers with heterogeneous willingness to pay have heterogeneous coupon costs, while drivers are divided into part-time drivers and full-time drivers. We analyze the endogenous influence of platform subsidy strategies on drivers' and passengers' decision-making during surge and regular periods. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the response curves to platform subsidies. The analytical and numerical results show that when the subsidy on passengers is moderate, the rapid demand growth during the regular period can be achieved. Precise subsidies on part-time drivers can achieve the same effect as subsidizing both part-time and full-time drivers, which increases supply and generates higher profits at a lower subsidy cost. Platform subsidies benefit the platform, passengers, and drivers, but may increase driving fatigue. When the subsidy budget is limited, the platform should prioritize subsidizing passengers before providing subsidies for drivers during the surge period. Finally, we discuss the impacts of governmental regulation on different stakeholders. This research gains insights into optimizing subsidy strategies of the ride-sourcing platform under government regulation and budget constraint, and the results provide suggestions for the platform and support government decision-making.",1366-5545,Not found

Then, to go from a good prediction to a good decision, the structure and performance of the following optimization problem are integrated in the prediction model, which we denote by integrated decision trees. Three modes are proposed to develop integrated decision trees with different combination ways and degrees.

Then, the structure of the decision problem is considered into the decision tree construction facilitated by similar sets in mode 2. Finally, similar sets are used to integrate the performance of the following decision optimization problem directly into the decision tree construction process in mode 3. Numerical experiments show that mode 3 can achieve the best performance in the decision optimization model.

The results show that the appropriate mode of live-streaming adopted by the manufacturer is contingent on the commission rate of the streamer and the fixed signing bonus paid to the influencer. Secondly, introducing a live-streaming channel leads to more sales. However, the change in the retail price of the traditional online channel depends on the intensity of price competition between the traditional and live-streaming channels. Compared with the merchant live-streaming channel, although the influencer puts more effort into selling products, the retail price of the influencer live-streaming channel is not always lower, and the product sales are not always higher. Finally, by extending to the hybrid mode (i.e., merchant and influencer live-streaming channels are simultaneously adopted), numerical studies show that the manufacturer and the platform prefer the hybrid live-streaming mode but not streamers under certain conditions.",1366-5545,Not found
A robust optimization approach for the vehicle routing problem with cross-docking under demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103106,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This research addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem with Cross-docking under Demand Uncertainty (VRPCD-DU) where a set of homogeneous vehicles is used to transport orders from the suppliers to the corresponding customers via a cross-dock. VRPCD-DU considers customer demand volumes as random variables and determines a minimum cost delivery plan that is feasible for all anticipated demand realizations. A robust optimization counterpart of a deterministic VRPCD formulation is derived where support for the demand is a polyhedral set. The robust formulation can only be used to solve small VRPCD-DU instances, and an effective adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed for solving large instances. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted on benchmark sets for both VRPCD and VRPCD-DU. The results show that the ALNS algorithm computes new best-known solutions of the VRPCD benchmark instances. Moreover, demand uncertainty is extensively analyzed by investigating managerial insights. The price of robustness (PoR) is compared by considering various budget sets and alternative partitioning methods for the customers (i.e., “random” and “clustered”). The findings imply that a higher probability of capacity constraints’ violation is generally observed for the suppliers and that customer partitioning methods share similar PoR.",1366-5545,Not found
Joint scheduling of barges and tugboats for river–sea intermodal transport,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103097,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"In this paper, we study a barge and tugboat joint scheduling problem arising from a river–sea intermodal transport system, where non-self-propelled barges travel with the help of tugboats between an inland river bulk port and sea transshipment platforms to transport cargo. Due to limited channels and the sequential scheduling among ships, transit inefficiency and resource under-utilization often occur, thus it is essential to design barge timetables and tugboat paths. This paper jointly schedules barges and tugboats in a river–sea transshipment port with a tidally influenced channel, and focuses on barge round trips with multiple legs. We construct a state-space–time network from the perspective of tugboats, in which the state implies whether a barge is served by a tugboat. The problem is formulated as an integer programming model based on the network to minimize time taken for bulk cargo transshipment. A tailored variable neighborhood search algorithm is designed and its efficiency, effectiveness, and stability are demonstrated by numerical experiments, which are based on real data from the Boffa port. It is demonstrated that, by joint scheduling barges and tugboats, transfer efficiency can be significantly improved under limited tugboat resources and shorter tidal windows. The results also provide managerial insights on schedule and valuable conclusions about the resource allocation in the port.",1366-5545,Not found
"The determinants of hidden-city ticketing: Competition, hub-and-spoke networks, and advance-purchase requirements",10.1016/j.tre.2023.103086,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"We offer a comprehensive empirical study on hidden-city ticketing (HCT), a pricing phenomenon in the airline industry that occurs when the fare for a nonstop trip from A to B is more expensive than a connecting trip from A to B and B to C. Exploiting a unique panel of over 473 thousand fares for flights departing between October 1st, 2019 and December 31st, 2019, we find that HCT depends on route competition (both on A–B and A–C routes), largely occurs in the last week to departure, is less likely when airport C is a hub, and primarily occurs on carriers that operate large hub-and-spoke networks (e.g., American, Delta, and United).",1366-5545,Not found
Impacts of online intermediary's platform openness under asymmetric quality information,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103090,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"In a platform economy, alongside the traditional reselling channel, online intermediaries (e.g., Amazon and JD.com) open their platforms to allow manufacturers to distribute products directly to consumers via an agency channel, i.e., platform openness. This paper investigates the implications of platform openness when a manufacturer possesses product quality information unknown to the online intermediary. We analyze a signaling game between a manufacturer and an online intermediary, in which the better-informed manufacturer first sets the wholesale price, which it may use to signal private quality information. Based on the wholesale price, the intermediary decides what quantity of the product to sell through the reselling channel. Finally, if the intermediary opens its platform, the manufacturer decides what quantity of the product to sell through the agency channel. We find that the effects of platform openness on the manufacturer and the online intermediary depend on three model parameters: the commission rate, the degree of channel substitution, and the degree of quality differentiation. Interestingly, information sharing may narrow the region of the win–win outcome in which platform openness benefits both intermediary and manufacturer, which differs from the situation in which the online intermediary is better informed than the manufacturer. Moreover, the online intermediary cannot always induce the manufacturer to share quality information through platform openness; similarly, platform openness may even decrease the value of information sharing for the online intermediary.",1366-5545,Not found
To offer or not to offer? The optimal value-insured strategy for crowdsourced delivery platforms,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103091,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Value-insured services are widely used to reduce senders’ perceived risk in crowdsourced delivery. However, research has not examined whether and how the value-insured strategy provided by crowdsourced delivery platforms (CDPs) affects those platforms’ decisions and the participation behaviors of two-sided users (senders and couriers). In this study, we develop game-theoretic models for a CDP’s pricing and wage decisions when it offers value-insured services and when it does not. Moreover, we compare the CDP’s optimal decisions under three insurance scenarios, i.e., a revenue-sharing scheme, fixed-fee scheme, and reinsurance scheme, to explore the optimal insurance scheme for the CDP. We find that introducing a value-insured strategy will benefit the CDP only when the couriers’ sensitivity to the declared value of the delivered parcel is adequate. When the average declared value is below a certain threshold, the reinsurance scheme produces the highest CDP’s profit; otherwise, the fixed-fee scheme leads to the highest CDP’s profit. We also show that offering a value-insured service does not always increase consumer surplus, labor welfare, and social welfare, and although it increases the CDP’s price level, it is not necessarily beneficial to the CDP. Our findings provide strong support for CDPs’ decision-making.",1366-5545,Not found
Deep attention models with dimension-reduction and gate mechanisms for solving practical time-dependent vehicle routing problems,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103095,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Time dependencies of travel speeds in time-dependent vehicle routing problems (TDVRPs) are usually accounted for by discretizing the planning horizon into several time periods. However, travel speeds usually change frequently in real road networks, so many time periods are needed to evaluate candidate solutions accurately in model and solution construction for practical TDVRPs, which increases substantially the computational complexity of TDVRPs. We develop two deep attention models with dimension-reduction and gate mechanisms to solve practical TDVRPs in real urban road networks. In the two models, a multi-head attention-based dimension-reduction mechanism is proposed to reduce the dimension of model inputs and obtain enhanced node representation, whereas a gate mechanism is introduced to obtain better information representation. On the basis of a travel speed dataset from an urban road network, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models on practical TDVRPs with or without consideration of time windows. Experimental results show that our models can solve TDVRPs with 240 time periods and up to 250 customers effectively and efficiently and provide significantly superior overall performances over two representative heuristics and two state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning models. Especially, compared with a recent tabu search method, our models can reduce the computation time by up to 3,540 times and improve the solution performance by up to 23%. Moreover, our models have an outstanding generalization performance. The model trained for the 30-customer TDVRP with time windows can be used directly to solve problems with up to 250 customers effectively by generating superior solutions over those generated by benchmarking methods.",1366-5545,https://github.com/WM19998/DRL-code-for-TDVRP
Decision and coordination of E-commerce closed-loop supply chains with fairness concern,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103092,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The e-commerce market expands rapidly, and manufacturers sell remanufactured and new products online, making e-commerce closed-loop supply chains face product differential pricing and follower firms’ unfair psychology due to the large profit gap between system members. Therefore, we price differentially by considering consumers’ preference for remanufactured and new products and develop a centralized model and two decentralized models with or without fairness concern to explore its impact on decision-making. We show that consumers’ higher preference for the remanufactured product is conducive to the two products’ price and the remanufactured product’s sales, then the sensitivity analysis shows that the higher preference positively affects system operation. We next incorporate a relative fairness reference point into the manufacturer’s utility function and find the manufacturer’s fairness concern behaviour to punish the e-platform is detrimental to cultivating a remanufactured product consumer market and causes the loss of its profits to be greater than that of the e-platform’s profit. Additionally, a new contract of “dual-revenue and service-cost sharing” can effectively eliminate the efficiency loss of the two decentralized models. Our paper provides theoretical contributions to product pricing, the setting of a utility function with fairness concern, and the design of dual coordination mechanism.",1366-5545,Not found
Dynamic operations of an integrated mobility service system of fixed-route transits and flexible electric buses,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103081,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"As an emerging mobility service with a wide range of benefits, flexible buses balance monetary costs, travel time, and comfort, and have evolved into a powerful supplement to traditional travel modes. This study investigates the dynamic operations of an integrated mobility service system of flexible electric buses and fixed-route transits, such as traditional buses and metros. The proposed integrated framework owns the potential of making the maximum utilization of the flexibility of mobility-on-demand transports and the capacity of fixed-route transits, but it is very challenging to efficiently operate. We establish mathematical models to dynamically optimize the detailed flexible bus routing and timetabling plans, and assign travel routes for passengers while considering the transfer behavior from/to the conventional fixed-route transits in a network. To resolve the curse of dimensionality and facilitate the solution procedure, we embed a learning procedure into an optimization model and further decompose the subproblem in each period into two layers.

An optimization-based methodology equipped with lean tools to strengthen medical supply chain resilience during a pandemic: A case study from Turkey,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103089,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Drawing upon economic and environmental sustainability, this study explores how developing the operational resilience of the medical supply chain (MSC) contributes to maintaining healthcare in the face of disruption risks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, an optimization-based roadmap is proposed by employing lean tools to achieve and realize MSC resilience. A novel two-stage stochastic optimization model and robust counterpart are developed with the objective of overall cost minimization to cope with the unknowable demand uncertainty represented by scenarios. The reason behind proposing a scenario-based stochastic model is to implement preparedness strategies during the (re)design phase by making strategic and operational level decisions. That being the case, seven cases are generated based on the demand uncertainty intervals along with seven different reliability levels for sensitivity analysis. Computational experiments are conducted through a real case study to compare the centralized and decentralized distribution models in terms of efficiency and responsiveness. The results obtained by the stochastic model and robust counterpart are compared to demonstrate how strong the proposed model is. On top of that, lean tools are used to visualize and analyze the improvement opportunities to contribute to the methodology. By doing so, this paper presents novel theoretical and empirical insights regarding MSC resilience. The computational results emphasize the importance of employing a pre-disruption strategy via the proposed methodology to design a resilient MSC to be prepared for pandemic-related risk. The findings from the sensitivity analysis also verify that regardless of the disruption degree, the developed roadmap with the centralized distribution model leads to up to 40% improvements in terms of the overall cost, order lead time, emission amount, and inventory shortage metrics.",1366-5545,Not found
Planning a parts-to-picker order picking system with consideration of the impact of perceived workload,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103088,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"In the digital age, coordinating robots and humans is critical in e-commerce warehousing. Motivated by observed industrial practices, this study presents a queueing theory based analytical model to investigate the planning issue of robot-human coordination in a parts-to-picker warehousing system. The critical planning decisions involve finding the optimal number of robots in the warehouse, the expected number of robots at essential locations of the warehouse, and performance analysis of the order picking system. A distinctive feature of this study is the conceptualization of a human factor called perceived workload (which depends on the number of robots) in the order picking planning model for efficient order fulfillment. Our analyses interestingly suggest that deploying more robots in warehouses with a parts-to-picker system does not necessarily increase the warehousing system’s performance; instead, a trade-off exists. Additionally, the workload-dependent service rate significantly influences the robots queueing in front of the order picking station (internal queue) and the synchronization station (external queue) in the warehouse. More importantly, this work contributes to the design of a human-centric work environment for parts-to-picker order fulfillment system.",1366-5545,Not found
Capital allocation and pricing decisions under trade credit with time-sensitive stochastic demand,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103093,173,2023-05-01,2023,5,"We investigate the delivery investment decision in the context of trade credit (TC), under which the retailer applies for deferred payments from its supplier. In addition to ordering procurement, the retailer must allocate limited capital to reduce delivery time, which promotes time-sensitive demand. We develop a Stackelberg game in which the supplier determines the wholesale price and then the retailer decides the delivery investment amount and order volume. The analytical results indicate that, unless the retailer is slightly capital-constrained, the retailer’s investment activity not only increases its profitability but also benefits the supplier and promotes the coordination of the supply chain. Supplier reduction in wholesale deepens the positive impact. With bank finance (BF) as a benchmark, the Pareto region that entices both parties to participate in TC exists when the investment cost is within certain limits and when the retailer is severely capital-constrained. We also provide insights on the sensitivity of participants’ profits to the capital level, delivery investment features, and other price parameters.",1366-5545,Not found
Public or private? Optimal organization for incentive-based travel demand management,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103137,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Incentive-Based Travel Demand Management (IBTDM) strategies have received more attention in recent years as they are more appealing to commuters than penalty-based strategies and thus result in less public aversion. In IBTDM, fully time-variant positive incentives are endowed to the traveling public to encourage off-peak trips. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of IBTDM in managing morning commuters with elastic demand based on Vickrey's bottleneck model. Due to the decentralization of IBTDM, incentive providers are no longer limited to public organizations, as private organizations can also administrate IBTDM programs. Therefore, from the perspective of public and private organizations, maximizing social surplus and private profit can be treated as objective functions. In addition, IBTDM is usually not mandatory but voluntary. Thus, we also considered the constraint of penetration rate. We found that when commuters are relatively sensitive to changes in their actual travel costs, a low penetration rate and a small incentive budget are enough for IBTDM to reach an optimal state (for both public and private administrators), and an excessive budget actually creates negative effects. Compared with public organizations, incentive schemes administrated by private organizations are a more lightweight strategy. However, public organizations are overwhelmingly dominant in the case of high market penetration and low traveler sensitivity. Therefore, one of the most effective modes of operation is to have private organizations implement IBTDM in the early stages of promotion, and then all private-owned businesses would be integrated into public organizations when they reach a certain scale.",1366-5545,Not found
Synchronization of train timetables in an urban rail network: A bi-objective optimization approach,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103142,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"As urban rail networks in big cities tend to expand, the synchronization of trains has become a key issue for improving the service quality of passengers because most urban rail transit systems in the world involve more than one connected line, and passengers must transfer between these lines. In contrast to most existing studies that focus on a single line, in this study, we focus on synchronized train timetable optimization in an urban rail transit network, considering the dynamic passenger demand with transfers as well as train loading capacity constraints. First, we propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for the synchronization of training timetables, in which we consider the optimization of two objectives. The first objective is to minimize the total waiting time of passengers, involving arriving and transfer passengers. Our second objective is a synchronization quality indicator (SQI) with piecewise linear formulation, which we propose to evaluate the transfer convenience of passengers. Subsequently, we propose several linearization techniques to handle the nonlinear constraints in the MIP formulation, and we prove the tightness of our reformulations. To solve large-scale instances more efficiently, we also develop a hybrid adaptive large neighbor search algorithm that is compared with two benchmarks: the commercial solver CPLEX and a metaheuristic. Finally, we focus on a series of real-world instances based on historical data from the Beijing metro network. The results show that our algorithm outperforms both benchmarks, and the synchronized timetable generated by our approach reduces the average waiting time of passengers by 1.5% and improves the connection quality of the Beijing metro by 14.8%.",1366-5545,Not found
Pricing and replenishment strategy for a perishable product under various payment schemes and cap-and-trade regulation,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103129,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"This study investigates a sustainable three-echelon supply chain structure (supplier–retailer–customer) from the retailer’s perspective for a perishable product where: (1) the retailer pays the purchase cost to the supplier in the form of an advance-cash-credit (ACC) payment while granting their customers a partial credit, (2) the supplier offers a price discount to the retailer to facilitate sales, (3) the deterioration rate of items increases over time due to an expiration date, (4) the customer is allowed a partial delay in orders with a fixed market tolerance period, and (5) the supply chain management (SCM) structure takes consideration of government cap-and-trade regulation. This paper intends to establish the retailer’s optimum cycle time, selling price, and inventory period simultaneously to maximize his/her total profit. An efficient algorithm has been constructed to find optimal solutions. Two examples have been presented to validate the proposed model. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the four different payment methods (upstream ACC, advance, cash, credit, and downstream partial credit payments) has been carried out and sensitivity analyses have been performed to gain managerial insights. Our numerical results reveal that with the increase in the discount rate, the selling price reduces significantly, however, the retailer’s profit increases tremendously. The reason for this phenomenon is that a higher discount rate can lead to a higher profit for the retailer, hence, the retailer may set a lower price to increase sales. Many retailers desire a high discount rate, which is associated with the upstream advance and downstream partial credit payment; however, the computational results show that this payment method causes significant damage to the environment. Hence, two payment methods (upstream ACC, credit, and downstream partial credit payments) are recommended. The reason is that these two payment types bring more profits to the retailer and result in less damage to the environment.",1366-5545,Not found
Outsourcing strategy of an original equipment manufacturer in a sustainable supply chain: Whether and how should a contract manufacturer encroach?,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103132,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"This study investigates the strategic interaction of encroachment and outsourcing strategies between a contract manufacturer (CM) and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in a sustainable supply chain, whether economically or environmentally sustainable. The CM has two encroachment modes, i.e., wholesale encroachment (including two formats, i.e., encroachment with retail cooperation or competition) or retail encroachment (including two formats, i.e., integrated or decentralized encroachment), and the OEM has two outsourcing strategies, i.e., consignment or turnkey. We find that the CM always benefits from encroachment, whereas the OEM might benefit or damage from encroachment. Interestingly, this paper breaks the traditional notion that more competitors mean less profit, and demonstrates that if turnkey is selected and environmental investment cost is low, the “win–win” situation might be achieved regardless of any encroachment format. Moreover, when the CM encroaches on the wholesale market, encroachment with retail cooperation could soften the wholesale competition, and thus increase the OEM’s post-encroachment profitability. Although we propose that the OEM has a short-sighted behavior in outsourcing strategy selection, surprisingly, this behavior unconsciously endows OEM an outsourcing deterrence that could limitedly deter CM encroachment by converting established outsourcing strategies. More surprisingly, if the deterrence is credible, the CM’s corresponding transfer payment could result in “doing well by doing good” by promoting the common sustainability of the economy and environment. Furthermore, we highlight a distinct evaluation index of CM encroachment in a sustainable supply chain: despite the importance of total environmental impact, more motivation for encroachment might emerge and further stimulate market vitality if the index is relaxed to average environmental impact.",1366-5545,Not found

The problem is to determine which vehicles should be set as fixed and how their fixed routes should be designed. To solve this problem, we formulate a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear program. The fixed routes are designed in the first stage before customer demands are realized, and the routes for flexible vehicles are designed in the second stage after customer demands are observed. A learning-based multiple scenario approach is developed as the solution method.

Investing in a shared supplier to encourage environmental responsibility under spillovers and demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103134,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"In this paper, we investigate the issue of whether two competing manufacturers should make environmental quality investments in a shared supplier under spillovers and demand uncertainty. To this end, we develop game-theoretic models and analyze the equilibrium outcomes in cases with no investment, unilateral investment, and bilateral investment. The results show that if the manufacturers are less (more) risk-averse, both (none) of them invest(s). If one manufacturer is less risk-averse and the other is more risk-averse, they act as the unique investor and free-rider, respectively. If both are moderately risk-averse, there are thresholds below which a manufacturer invests; otherwise, they jointly invest or exit. Moreover, any manufacturer may suffer from the competitor’s investment despite the existence of spillovers. In some cases, the bilateral investment is detrimental to the supplier and may yield a win–win, win–lose, lose–win, or lose–lose outcome for the manufacturers. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that, under medium risk aversion, the optimal investment strategies are synchronous if the intensity of spillovers (product substitutability) is high (low); and they are asynchronous otherwise. In general, increased demand uncertainty or customers’ environmental sensitivity strengthens the incentives for the manufacturers to invest in the shared supplier.

Second, the entry of the parallel importer will bring benefits rather than threats to the multinational firm when the multinational firm adopts adaptive GPD and the CEA gap is extremely large. Consequently, the multinational firm is recommended to utilize the tool of widening greenness difference to cope with parallel importation. Furthermore, we make extensions to consider the possible competition between multinational firms and the circumstance whereby multiple parallel importers emerge.

To capture the behavior of order cancellation, this paper derives the cancellation probability based on the perceived inhomogeneous Poisson process. In view of the punishing effect and blocking effect of order cancellation penalty, this paper investigates the impact of order cancellation penalties on market equilibrium and platform revenue.

Joint design of electric bus transit service and wireless charging facilities,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103114,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Cities worldwide are deploying electric buses rapidly to enhance eco-friendly public transportation. Most existing electric transit systems rely solely on stationary charging at terminals and have to equip buses with large-sized batteries to maintain operation in networks. Consequently, the stationary-charging electric bus (SE-Bus) systems are subject to high battery costs, limited range per charge, long charging time (layover time), etc. These limitations may be addressed by integrating the new wireless power transfer technology, which provides contactless charging to the operating buses without extra delays. To guide wireless-charging electric bus (WE-Bus) designs in corridors, this paper proposes an optimization model to jointly optimize (i) the electric supply system and (ii) the transit service that are interdependent. Specifically, we construct parsimonious models for system metrics using five design variables/functions, i.e., battery size, the number of wireless power transfer (WPT) pads, stationary charging rate, service headways, and stop densities. Accordingly, we formulate the optimal design problem to minimize the generalized system cost as the sum of the transit agency’s and patrons’ costs. The problem is attacked by first decomposing into two sub-problems regarding (i) electric supply system design and (ii) transit service design and then solving them iteratively. The (i) sub-problem is converted to a linear programming problem by linearization, and the (ii) sub-problem is analyzed with optimal conditions. Numerical tests show the proposed solution approach produces accurate results. Extensive numerical experiments unveil several findings. First, the WE-Bus systems outperform the SE-Bus in various scenarios except when wireless charging facilities are too costly. Second, the optimized WE-Bus designs can reduce costs not only to the agency (with smaller-sized bus battery and reduced fleet cost) but also to patrons (who enjoy improved services with shorter headways). Additional parameter analyses also investigate the impacts of demand levels, wireless charging rates, depths of discharge, etc. Lastly, a case study in Chengdu (China) illustrates the application of the proposed model.",1366-5545,Not found
A novel flow update policy in solving traffic assignment problems: Successive over relaxation iteration method,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103111,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"This paper presents a novel flow update policy, namely the successive over relaxation (SOR) iteration method, which can be implemented in traffic assignment algorithms. Most existing solution algorithms for the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem (UE-TAP) mainly use two flow update policies: Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iteration methods. The proposed flow update policy SOR can be a more efficient replacement. Following the path-based gradient projection (GP) algorithm, we developed a new method GP-SOR for the UE-TAP. This study first provides the complete procedure of applying the GP-SOR algorithm to solve the UE-TAP. Subsequently, a few properties of the proposed method are rigorously proven. However, empirical tests of the GP-SOR algorithm demonstrate serious oscillations and poor convergence. To cope with this problem, the Armijo Rule is employed to determine the relaxation factor, which substantially improves the convergence of GP-SOR algorithm. The preliminary numerical examples show that the GP-SOR algorithm has speedier convergence compared with the known alternatives, which is reflected by the evident reduction of the computing time and the number of iterations.",1366-5545,Not found
Geo-Fencing or Geo-Conquesting? a strategic analysis of Location-Based coupon under different market structures,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103116,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Location-based technology enables firms to target consumers with personalized coupons based on their real-time locations, making location-based coupons (LBC) an innovative marketing tool. In this paper, we consider two types of LBC strategies, namely defensive geo-fencing versus offensive geo-conquesting. With a defensive LBC strategy, a company sets a virtual geo-fence by offering coupons with deeper discounts to consumers located closer to the focal firm. Using a spatial model, we examine how two competing companies choose between defensive and offensive LBC strategies, as well as the impact of LBC strategies on company profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. The results show that the defensive LBC strategy lowers revenue in a monopoly market but increases it under duopoly conditions. In a duopoly market, both firms adopting the defensive LBC strategy is the Nash equilibrium outcome, leading to the highest profits but lowest consumer surplus. The misalignment of interests among firms and consumers requires policymakers to regulate firms’ LBC strategies for the sake of customers.",1366-5545,Not found
A Two-stage Stochastic Programming for AGV scheduling with random tasks and battery swapping in automated container terminals,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103110,174,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Automated guided vehicle (AGV) is one of the main equipment for horizontal transportation in automated container terminals, and the optimization of AGV scheduling has become increasingly important. Existing scheduling systems tend to make decisions based on deterministic conditions, ignoring the dynamic changes and uncertainties of the terminal environment, such as the arrival of random tasks during AGV operations. In addition, the battery swapping process is neglected in most AGV scheduling studies, yet it is crucial to ensure the operation of AGVs. In this paper, we construct a two-stage stochastic programming model for the joint scheduling problem of battery swapping and task operation with random tasks. A double-threshold constraint for battery swapping decision-making is adopted. The results show that the double-threshold strategy is better for AGV utilization than the single-threshold one. Upon the solution method, a simulation-based ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed. Sample average approximation is used to calculate the expected cost, and two local search procedures are introduced to improve the quality of the solutions. In the cases of multiple instances and several random task samples with different arrival rates, our method was compared with three practical policies under a deterministic model. Computational results show that the scheduling scheme considering random tasks in advance is more robust and stable.",1366-5545,Not found

Production outsourcing decision in the presence of consumer's preference uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103180,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"We investigate upstream coopetition and competition in a supply chain in the context of a high-quality brand manufacturer’s strategy on upstream outsourcing and e-commerce platform’s strategy on downstream information disclosure. The high-quality brand manufacturer outsources production and sells through an e-commerce platform, where a low-quality manufacturer also sells. The high-quality manufacturer may outsource to a third manufacturer who produces only the brand manufacturer’s high-quality product, maintaining a competition relationship with the low-quality manufacturer (competition strategy). The high-quality brand manufacturer also has the option to outsource to the low-quality manufacturer, entering into a coopetition relationship (coopetition strategy). The consumers have knowledge about the quality of the two products, but they are uncertain about their quality preference. That is, they are not sure which of the two quality-differentiated products available in the market will meet their own needs. Their uncertainty can be eliminated by the e-commerce platform’s disclosure of preference-revealing information. We find that the brand manufacturer prefers the coopetition strategy when the ratio of the two products’ cost-quality efficiencies is very low or moderate. The e-commerce platform has an incentive to disclose preference-revealing information when the ratio of the two products’ cost-quality efficiencies is moderate or high. We show the optimal strategies of the supply chain with the brand manufacturer’s outsourcing strategy and the platform’s information disclosure strategy, and we also extend the discussion to the impacts of several related issues.",1366-5545,Not found

An analysis of pricing strategy for bike-sharing services: The role of the inconvenience cost,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103146,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In actual bike-sharing services, an operator can adopt any of three pricing strategies, namely, pay-per-use (Strategy P), flat-fee (Strategy F) and a hybrid of pay-per-use and flat-fee (Strategy H). When the operator launches the mode of picking up and returning bikes at designated shared bike parking points, users often perceive the inconvenience cost because of having to go to the designated parking points to pick up and return shared bikes. This paper investigates operators’ pricing strategies in monopoly and duopoly markets and analyzes the effects of the inconvenience cost on different pricing strategies. We find that in the monopoly market, it is advantageous for the operator to choose Strategy H if the inconvenience cost is relatively small; otherwise, it is advantageous to choose Strategy F. In the duopoly market, the operator can choose Strategy P. In particular, when the two operators bring the same inconvenience cost to users, there exist two pricing strategy combinations in equilibrium, namely, P/F and F/P. When the two operators bring different inconvenience costs to users, there exist five pricing strategy combinations in equilibrium, namely, P/F, F/P, H/F, F/H and F/F.",1366-5545,Not found
AIS data-driven ship trajectory prediction modelling and analysis based on machine learning and deep learning methods,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103152,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Maritime transport faces new safety challenges in an increasingly complex traffic environment caused by large-scale and high-speed ships, particularly with the introduction of intelligent and autonomous ships. It is evident that Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven ship trajectory prediction can effectively aid in identifying abnormal ship behaviours and reducing maritime risks such as collision, stranding, and contact. Furthermore, trajectory prediction is widely recognised as one of the critical technologies for realising safe autonomous navigation. The prediction methods and their performance are the key factors for future safe and automatic shipping. Currently, ship trajectory prediction lacks the real performance measurement and analysis of different algorithms, including classical machine learning and emerging deep learning methods. This paper aims to systematically analyse the performance of ship trajectory prediction methods and pioneer experimental tests to reveal their advantages and disadvantages as well as fitness in different scenarios involving complicated systems. To do so, five machine learning methods (i.e., Kalman Filter (KF), Support Vector Progression (SVR), Back Propagation network (BP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest (RF)) and seven deep learning methods (i.e., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Sequence to Sequence (Seq2seq), Bi-directional Gate Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Transformer) are first extracted from the state-of-the-art literature review and then employed to implement the trajectory prediction and compare their prediction performance in the real world. Three AIS datasets are collected from the waters of representative traffic features, including a normal channel (i.e., the Chengshan Jiao Promontory), complex traffic (i.e., the Zhoushan Archipelago), and a port area (i.e., Caofeidian port). They are selected to test and analyse the performance of all twelve methods based on six evaluation indexes and explore the characteristics and effectiveness of the twelve trajectory prediction methods in detail. The experimental results provide a novel perspective, comparison, and benchmark for ship trajectory prediction research, which not only demonstrates the fitness of each method in different maritime traffic scenarios, but also makes significant contributions to maritime safety and autonomous shipping development.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal intersection design and signal setting in a transportation network with mixed HVs and CAVs,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103173,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"It is widely recognized that human-driven vehicles (HVs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to coexist and share the urban traffic infrastructure in the transportation network for a long time. To fully utilizes CAVs’ potential to reduce congestion in the transitional period, this study proposes and addresses the intersection design and signal setting problem in the transportation network with mixed HVs and CAVs. Due to the difference in terms of communication technology and autonomous driving technology for HVs and CAVs, three types of intersections have been proposed to amplify the efficiency-improvement benefit from CAVs by separating CAVs from HVs in a temporal or local-spatial dimension: the conventional signalized intersection, the novel signalized intersection with a dedicated CAV phase and dedicated CAV approaches, and the intelligent signal-free intersection. The problem is to determine the spatial layout of different types of intersections in the transportation network, the cycle time, and green time duration for each phase of signalized intersections that minimize the total travel cost, in which the route choice behavior of heterogeneous travelers has been respected based on the user equilibrium principle. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to formulate the proposed intersection design and signal setting problem based on the link-node modeling method, in which the path enumeration is avoided. Then, by employing various linearization techniques (e.g., disjunctive constraints, logarithmic transformation, piecewise linearization with logarithmic-sized binary variables and constraints, outer-approximation technique), the proposed model can be further transformed into a relaxed sub-problem in the form of mixed-integer linear programming. A globally optimal solution algorithm embedding with solving a sequence of relaxed sub-problems and nonlinear mixed complementarity problems is proposed to converge to a global optimum. The results of numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed methodology can significantly improve the performance of the whole network. Moreover, it consistently outperforms the optimization model considering only conventional signalized intersections under various CAV market penetration rates.",1366-5545,Not found
Routing UAVs in landslides Monitoring: A neural network heuristic for team orienteering with mandatory visits,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103172,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for surveillance in both civilian and military scenarios. The utilization of UAVs provides an opportunity for monitoring landslide-prone areas by automatically collecting geological information, thereby reducing the risks and the time required to be working in harsh environments. Due to the maximum travel time limit of UAVs and the geographical dispersion of landslide-prone areas, multiple UAVs are dispatched for surveillance tasks, and landslide-prone areas with high emergency priorities require mandatory visits. Here, we investigate a team orienteering problem with mandatory visits (TOPMV) for routing multi-UAVs to monitor scattered landslide-prone areas, with mandatory visits on those in poorly stable states. The proposed TOPMV aims to plan the optimal multi-UAV paths for maximizing the total amount of collected geological information. To solve the TOPMV with a realistic scale, we develop a large neighborhood search (LNS) algorithm embedding a neural network heuristic (NNH), in which the embedded NNH learns to perform adaptive destroy operators through a hierarchical recurrent graph convolutional network (HRGCN). We consider a real-world case study for monitoring of landslide-prone areas in three counties in southern Shaanxi Province, China. Finally, we test the proposed NNH on both small- and large-scale benchmark instances of the team orienteering problem. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed NNH exhibits higher efficiency and provides better solution quality than state-of-the-art methods, especially in large-scale settings.",1366-5545,Not found
National brand manufacturers’ supply strategy in the presence of retailers’ store-branded lookalike packaging and consumer confusion about quality preference,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103143,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Supplying store brands (SBs) to retailers is a strategic decision for national brand (NB) manufacturers in response to the prevalence of retailers introducing SBs. This study proposes a game-theoretical model to examine the manufacturer’s supply strategy when facing the retailer’s store-branded product, which could have lookalike packaging that confuses consumers about their quality preferences regarding the SB and NB. We find that the manufacturer will supply an SB product to the retailer when the unit production cost of supply is low or the unit production-in-house cost is high, which induces the retailer to choose lookalike packaging when both the NB’s unit price of quality and production-in-house cost are low. Consumer confusion may bring a win–win situation for the manufacturer and retailer, which stimulates the manufacturer to lower the incentive to supply. In addition, the proportion of confused consumers brings a non-monotone effect on the profitability of the retailer and manufacturer. Extending the main model to the cases: (1) the consumer confusion from just being about the SB to being about both products; (2) the SB quality is endogenized; (3) the manufacturer can decide whether to accept the lookalike packaging; (4) the quality of SB exceeds NB, we find that the retailer’s decision of lookalike packaging and the manufacturer’s strategy of supply offering remain qualitatively unchanged, and our results are robust. These findings provide theoretical predictions and useful insights regarding the impacts of consumer confusion derived from lookalike packaging in a two-echelon supply chain.",1366-5545,Not found
Predicting drivers’ route trajectories in last-mile delivery using a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103168,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using drivers’ historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used encoder–decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon’s last-mile delivery operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods (such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder–decoder and the original pointer network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes executed by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the proposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four stops from around 0.229 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted route and the actual route by around 15%.",1366-5545,Not found
The role of operations and supply chain management during epidemics and pandemics: Potential and future research opportunities,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103139,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Epidemics have been posing significant challenges to health, existence, and continuity. From the emergence of an outbreak to its elimination, managing an epidemic/pandemic entails many operations and supply chain management decisions that can contribute to a lessening of its impact.

We have witnessed these disruptions first-hand during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a destructive effect on many well-established supply chains, threatening the existence of firms.

Analyzing the development of competition and cooperation among ocean carriers considering the impact of carbon tax policy,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103157,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Due to emission reduction pressure and supply chain changes, this paper analyzes the development trend of the marine supply chain based on the competition and cooperation incentives of carriers, considering the impact of the government’s carbon tax policy. We consider multi-stage Stackelberg games with different power structures consisting of a government, hub port, and two carriers. Equilibrium solutions for different power structures show that carriers tend to build alliance and compete with the port for leadership. Higher bargaining power is the dominant choice for all companies, and neither the port nor carrier alliance accepts the other as the leader. Thus, they compromise on equal bargaining. To resolve the conflicting interests of stakeholders, we examine the reasons for revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contracts that cannot coordinate the marine supply chain, and redesign the subsidy and revenue-sharing contracts. Higher subsidies and revenue-sharing proportions can make carriers give up competing for leadership, or even forming an alliance. The contract provides a new solution for companies’ strategic decision-making beyond equal bargaining. Numerical analyses suggest that although the contract weakens the effect of the carbon tax, promoting deeper cooperation between companies is a better option for the government. Finally, we verify the reasons for the failure of the carbon tax policy after the government failed to consider the market environment, and summarize the development direction of the marine supply chain under a reasonable carbon tax to provide management insights for stakeholders. Further, the model is extended to prove the validity and robustness of recommendations to the government and companies.

White-glove service delivery: A quantitative analysis,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103144,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"White-Glove Service (WGS) is an emerging business model of last-mile service delivery with the intersection of omnichannel retailing, demand-driven supply chain, and the shared economic activity of crowdsourcing by a multiskilled workforce.

Combating counterfeits with the Blockchain-technology-supported platform under government enforcement,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103155,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The intrinsic value of brand names has led to the widespread presence of counterfeits in multi-industries. Although government enforcement plays a role in combating counterfeits, it is difficult to fundamentally curb counterfeiting. This paper examines how the brand-name firm adopts the blockchain-technology-supported (BTS) platform in dealing with counterfeits under government enforcement. We consider a market with a manufacturer (i.e., a brand-name firm) and a counterfeiter. First, we develop a signaling game model to analyze the negative impact of deceptive sales. The results show that, under weak government enforcement and a high rampancy level of counterfeits, deceptive sales will decrease the expected demand for authentic products, the manufacturer’s expected profit, the expected consumer surplus, and the expected social welfare. Although government enforcement forces the counterfeiter to implement non-deceptive sales, it will decrease the expected consumer surplus under symmetric quality information. Then, we develop a Stackelberg game model to analyze the manufacturer’s adoption strategy for the BTS platform. We find that weaker government enforcement will incentivize the manufacturer to adopt the BTS platform. However, the manufacturer does not always adopt the BTS platform even if the counterfeiter implements deceptive sales. Finally, we analyze the effect of adopting the BTS platform under government enforcement. We reveal that the role of the BTS platform in improving consumer rights is stronger than that in combating counterfeits, and the effect of adopting the BTS platform will strengthen as government enforcement weakens.",1366-5545,Not found

Towards sustainable port management: Data-driven global container ports turnover rate assessment,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103169,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Accurate assessment of port turnover rate is essential for port operators and shipping carriers to benchmark and improve their operations. This study proposes a standardized method to estimate the port turnover rate based on satellite data of ocean ships. This method can be generalized to accommodate ports of different geographic and operational characteristics with minimum input and running times. To achieve the research objective, we first construct berth polygon areas for terminals based on Greatmaps (GMap) visual technique. Then, two tailor-made algorithms are proposed to estimate the berthing time of ship in a berthing event. Finally, we assess the port turnover rate with aggregate berthing time at a port and its historical port throughput. Assuming that the turnover rate is unchanged in the short term, we can use the estimated turnover to estimate the monthly throughput of global ports. The findings suggest the average Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of our estimation is 3.84%. Standardized and high-frequency port statistics are highly valued by the industry but very costly to access. The proposed method makes high-frequency port turnover rate and throughput available for a wide range of users.

We then compare the equilibrium outcomes and discover that the EVM, EVR, and 3PR have difficulty aligning their preferences for recycling leadership mode, necessitating technological advancements in remanufacturing and governmental intervention. Our research highlights the significance of environmental responsibility awareness in the recycling process and discusses environmental damage and social welfare. Our findings indicate that in situations where the total recycling rate of the CLSC is low, the EVR may offer a higher price to prevent excessive new battery flow into the market. We suggest that the government should encourage more local EVRs to participate in the recycling system to reduce pollution.

Online platforms’ warehouse capacity allocation strategies for multiple products,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103170,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Online platforms typically store multiple products in their warehouses, which often run out of space. Hence we are motivated to study how platforms can effectively allocate their limited warehouse capacity among different products. We establish a game-theoretic model to investigate the optimal warehouse capacity allocation strategy of a platform that serves the dual role of a marketplace and a reseller. Our research reveals that, in the single-product case, a platform’s profit increases – first convexly and then concavely – with warehouse capacity. Second, we study the optimal warehouse capacity allocation strategy of a platform in the case of multiple products with different characteristics. We establish that the capacity allocated to a product increases with the commission rate and with the platform’s unit procurement cost, and also as the retailer’s unit procurement cost decreases. However, the capacity allocation for products characterized by high fixed warehouse operating costs or high unit product volumes depends to a large extent on the platform’s total warehouse capacity. The numerical study verifies our theoretical results and generates more management insights. We complete our study with two extensions. The first shows that platforms without warehouses cannot use the same warehouse operation strategy as those that do have warehouses unless (a) the warehouse investment cost coefficient is relatively low and (b) the platform intends to manage all products in its newly built warehouse. Our second extension demonstrates that a platform is generally more willing to store and sell high-quality (than low-quality) products.",1366-5545,Not found
An exact algorithm for the multi-trip container drayage problem with truck platooning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103138,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Container Drayage Problem (CDP) refers to the optimization problem of routing and scheduling a set of container trucks around a container terminal. Conventionally, a driver is stuck to one container truck and allowed to perform multiple trips (multi-trip) to the terminal within their working time. The recent development of automation technologies enables semi-autonomous trucks to follow the leading human-driven truck as a platoon on the road; therefore, truck platooning can save human labor and reduce the fuel cost of following trucks through aerodynamic drag reduction. In this paper, we study a multi-trip container drayage problem with truck platooning (MT-CDP-TP), where multi-trip, truck platooning, and fuel cost reduction are simultaneously considered in a CDP. Despite the operational benefits brought by the MT-CDP-TP, the problem is challenging to solve due to its NP-hardness when formulated as a multi-trip pickup and delivery problem with load-dependent cost. We propose a Branch-and-Price-and-Cut (BPC) algorithm, with a route-based set partitioning model and tight linear relaxations, to yield the exact solutions. Valid inequalities are generated based on a graph structure, where each node represents a feasible route, and each arc stands for the conflict between two routes. Moreover, we design a tailored pulse propagation algorithm with novel pruning procedures based on the dual information from the master problem and valid inequalities to solve the pricing problem efficiently. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted for performance validation, and the computational results show that the proposed exact algorithm can solve instances with up to 100 task nodes (i.e., 50 customers) and facilitate reducing the labor cost and fuel consumption by a wide margin in container drayage operations.",1366-5545,Not found

This study identifies and develops GSCDT practices with support from the literature and case studies of six manufacturers with operational GSCDT in diversified industries to explore the practice adoption enablers of GSCDT and contingency factors for performance improvement through GSCDT for manufacturers. We analyze the emergence and adoption of GSCDT and find that the practices are: a) unevenly implemented among the five dimensions of GSCM; b) highly reliant on top management to coordinate internal coordination among organizational units; c) more intensive in manufacturing operations with large suppliers; and d) implemented at a higher level for external practices than for internal practices. Our research findings contribute to academic knowledge by unraveling critical factors that affect the digital transformation process in GSCM and managerial insights by identifying pathways for the successful adoption of GSCDT practices.",1366-5545,Not found
The effects of subsidy programs in byproduct synergy operations,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103141,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Byproduct synergy (BPS) is an innovative waste disposal approach. Waste resulting from manufacturers’ production processes is disposed of at processing plants and converted into a recycled byproduct. To reduce the inefficiency of a decentralized supply chain and enhance BPS operations, we consider a subsidy program scheme and analyze different supply chain scenarios: a centralized supply chain without subsidies and a decentralized supply chain with or without subsidies. We discuss different policymaker objectives (i.e., concerned only with social welfare and concerned with both social welfare and environmental impacts). Our results show that when the policymaker cares only about social welfare, the subsidy program always enhances BPS operations. The subsidy program brings more prime products when the BPS’s relative market value is high and less emissions are produced when the BPS’s relative market value is low. When the policymaker cares about both social welfare and environmental impacts, the subsidy program can enhance BPS operations unless the market values of BPS and the prime product are relatively low. Moreover, when the market value of BPS is medium high and the market value of the prime product is low, the policymaker can reduce production emissions by motivating the manufacturer to reduce production quantity of the prime product and encouraging the plant to reduce BPS capacity. When the market value of BPS is low, the policymaker can reduce emissions through efficient production process by only motivating the plant to enhance BPS capacity.",1366-5545,Not found
A location-inventory-routing model for distributing emergency supplies,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103156,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Dynamic last-mile distribution of emergency supplies to affected people in post-disaster situations is a key emergency response task, which however is seldom addressed in the literature. To fill this gap, we present a path-based location-inventory-routing model for developing a dynamic last-mile emergency supply distribution plan, including a local distribution center, points of distribution, and demand points. The model can be applied to evolving post-hurricane situations, where candidate point of distribution sites and demands dynamically change. Both cost and equity are incorporated into the planning goal to ensure that distribution of emergency supplies is cost-efficient and fair. With a case study of the previously flooded Red Hook neighborhood in New York City during Hurricane Sandy, we show that our model outperforms different comparison models significantly. Moreover, we obtain managerial insights regarding location, inventory, and routing flexibility, which could be leveraged for post-hurricane distribution practice.",1366-5545,Not found
The more the better? The impact of the number and location of product recovery options on the system dynamics in a closed-loop supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103150,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The hybrid closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) system, commonly observed in the consumer electronics and automotive industries, may include one or more product recovery options, such as product repair and core remanufacturing. From system dynamics perspective, one important strategic decision is how many recovery options (and in which locations) should be invested to minimise poor dynamic behaivor such as bullwhip effect. This motivates us to investigate the impact of the number and locations of recovery options on the dynamic behaviour. We adopt step and sinusoidal functions as customer demand, representing a sudden sustained shift in demand and seasonally unadjusted demand, respectively. We also consider different return rates for each echelon of the CLSC. Our simulation results indicate that the bullwhip effect and inventory variance can be significantly reduced in all CLSC scenarios in comparison to a traditional open loop supply chain. However, a increased number of product recovery options does not improve the dynamic performance of the CLSC. Moreover, the bullwhip effect and inventory variance may be reduced if product recovery options are located at downstream echelons that are closer to end customers (e.g. retailers) and have high return rates. Further, return rates play a key role in mitigating the bullwhip effect, consistent with the prior literature. Our findings provide strategic insights for managers seeking to improve their CLSCs performance from system dynamics perspective.",1366-5545,Not found
Integrating dial-a-ride with transportation network companies for cost efficiency: A Maryland case study,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103140,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Dial-a-ride (DAR) is a shared-ride service that provides mobility to transportation-disadvantaged individuals who are unable to use public transit. While most DAR studies focus on optimizing operations, our research explores the feasibility and benefits of outsourcing outlier trips to transportation network companies (TNCs) to minimize the combined service delivery cost. To achieve this goal, we formulate a multi-vehicle DAR problem (DARP) with trip outsourcing to TNCs, which can be solved optimally for small scale instances. To solve larger instances, we propose a two-stage solution framework to improve DAR routes from commercially available software. Firstly, we develop an integer programming model to re-optimize individual routes with trip outsourcing. Secondly, we design a multi-vehicle heuristic that considers reinserting trips initially designated for outsourcing back into the DAR fleet, as well as reinsertion and exchange of remaining trips among routes. We apply the approach to a medium-sized DAR operator in Maryland and achieve cost reductions of 7%-13% depending on the TNC volume discount negotiated by the DAR company.",1366-5545,Not found
How to enhance the effects of the green supply chain management strategy in the organization: A diffusion process perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103148,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Although green supply chain management strategy (GSCMS) plays an important role in the development of firms, there is still uncertaintyabout how to achieve a win–win between environmental and financial performance during the GSCMS diffusion process (e.g., the preparation stage and development stage). Thus, this study firstly examines whether the effects of the GSCMS on firm profits in different diffusion stages vary. Then, we test the moderating effect of the green initiatives (i.e., internal green certification, green cooperation improvement with the suppliers, green recovery with governments and green improvement with customers), operational process and business strategy on the effectiveness of GSCMS during the diffusion process. Based on 140 event samples over a time span of 19 years (i.e., 2001–2018), this study finds that the firms’ financial benefits decreased in GSCMS preparation stage and then increased in the development stage. Two green initiatives (i.e., green recovery with governments and green cooperation with suppliers), the differentiation strategy and process standardization, have positive influence on GSCMS diffusing in preparation stage. So, wisely using appropriate green initiatives, operational process and business strategy can mitigate the dark side of GSCMS in short-term and achieve a win–win between environmental and financial performance in the long term. These findings enrich the green supply chain literature and diffusion theory, and provide practical implications for firms to adopt environmental management strategies and offer some guidelines for governments to formulate environment management policies.",1366-5545,Not found
A hierarchical optimization approach for dynamic pickup and delivery problem with LIFO constraints,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103131,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"We consider a dynamic pickup and delivery problem (DPDP) where loading and unloading operations must follow a last in first out (LIFO) sequence. A fleet of vehicles will pick up orders in pickup points and deliver them to destinations. The objective is to minimize the total over-time (that is the amount of time that exceeds the committed delivery time) and total travel distance. Given the dynamics of orders and vehicles, this paper proposes a hierarchical optimization approach based on multiple intuitive yet often-neglected strategies, namely what we term as the urgent strategy, hitchhike strategy and packing-bags strategy. These multiple strategies can dynamically adapt to dispatch orders to vehicles according to the status of orders and by considering the travel distance and overtime. To account for the LIFO constraints, block-based operators are designed to schedule the delivery routes, thereby enhancing the search efficiency. The result on real-world instances shows that our proposed hierarchical optimization approach outperforms the current practice and the winning approach in an international competition. Finally, the insights gained from generated instances shows the hierarchical optimization approach has broader applicability.",1366-5545,Not found
Inbound replenishment and outbound dispatch decisions under hybrid shipment consolidation policies: An analytical model and comparison,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103135,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"We investigate operational decisions in a distribution warehouse facing stochastic demand and incurring fixed and linear transportation costs for the inbound inventory replenishment and outbound dispatch decisions. In order to realize scale economies associated with transportation both on the outbound and inbound sides, dispatch schedules and replenishment decisions at the warehouse must be synchronized over time. Immediate delivery policies on the outbound side are not financially viable because outbound dispatch operations will benefit from temporal shipment consolidation. Our focus in this setting is the analytical modeling of hybrid shipment consolidation policies and their comparison to the time-based and quantity-based counterparts. To this end, we propose analytical (exact and approximate) methods to compute and compare the cost under hybrid policies relative to its alternatives. Since shipment consolidation impacts customer waiting and inventory holding, we also investigate the average delay per order and average inventory per time unit as two important metrics of the distribution operation’s performance, along with the annual cost. We compare these metrics among the alternative under hybrid, time-based, and quantity-based policies. The comparison then allows us to offer an explicit analytical comparison of long-run average cost under these three policies without needing to solve the corresponding optimization problems. Notably, our results offer an analytical characterization of relative cost performance (vis-a-vis the numerical comparison available in the literature) and demonstrate the implications of alternative shipment consolidation policies regardless of the values of model parameters. The results are of practical value in the context of the design and operation of an integrated framework for inventory-transportation systems.",1366-5545,Not found
Safety-oriented train timetabling and stop planning with time-varying and elastic demand on overcrowded commuter metro lines,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103136,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In some megacities, commuter metro lines that connect suburbs and downtown areas always suffer from serious non-equilibrium passenger congestion at stations during rush hours, bringing huge operation risks. To balance the non-equilibrium passenger congestion on overcrowded metro lines, this study aims to jointly optimize the train timetable and stop plan from the perspective of transportation safety in which some effective skip-stop patterns are adopted to allocate necessary train capacities to overcrowded stations with consideration to time-varying and elastic demand. We formulate the problem of interest as an integer linear programming model where the total passenger gathering risk, passenger waiting time, passenger riding time, and loss of ticket income are all included in the objective function. An efficient iterated local search (ILS) algorithm is designed for the convenience of solving large-scale models. Numerical experiments for a series of small-scale and real-world case studies are conducted to test the performance of the proposed methods.

Congestion pricing and information provision under uncertainty: Responsive versus habitual pricing,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103119,175,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In the face of capacity disruptions (due, for example, to traffic incidents or poor weather), information provision and congestion pricing are alleviating policies. We compare responsive pricing, whereby tolls vary with known or predicted traffic conditions, with habitual pricing, which only considers the probability distribution of possible traffic conditions. We do so under perfect information and imperfect information where travelers receive information from, for example, a weather report or route planning app. We find analytically that the habitual toll is a weighted average of the expected marginal external costs (MECs) over all states/information ‘signals’, with weights depending on the capacity distribution and the ‘quality’ of the information. The responsive toll depends on the information received and equals the information-specific expected MEC. The two tolls will be more similar the more imperfect the information quality or the lower the uncertainty, and they are identical under no information or no uncertainty. Although responsive pricing raises welfare and lowers travel prices, the differences in effects between the two tolls tend to be tiny even under perfect information and high uncertainty. Considering that responsive pricing may be even more unpopular with the populace and costly to implement than habitual tolls, our study reveals the significance of the quality of information and the degree of uncertainty in deciding how to manage our roads.",1366-5545,Not found

For MaaS, personalized trip planning is important but intractable. In this paper, we present a two-phase decision-support optimization framework for the problem of a MaaS system incorporating metros and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). First, a mixed integer programming model is proposed to optimize the routes of heterogeneous travelers considering five transport mode combinations, in which SAVs are regarded as not only a first- and last-mile connector to the metro but also a competitor. Next, the scheduling of SAVs and departure time of each traveler is determined with the purpose of minimizing the SAV operation cost. To apply the proposed framework to scenarios with real-time requests, we adopt the rolling horizon solution method, which includes four sub-modules. The method is evaluated on the Sioux Falls network, and the experimental results show that travelers become more sensitive to the mode choice as the additional time of the metro increases. In addition, the connectivity of the metro network has a considerable influence on the relationship between the metro and SAVs. The methodology can be useful for the trip planning of other transport mode combinations.",1366-5545,Not found

We use panel data from 53 publicly listed Chinese logistics companies between 2011 and 2021 to test our hypothesized model. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between GTI and market value. Interestingly, supply chain partner engagement steepens the inverted U-shaped GTI–market value linkage, whereas scientific institution engagement flattens this curvilinear linkage. In addition, public attention weakens this inverted U-shaped GTI–market value relationship.

Distributionally robust optimization for collaborative emergency response network design,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103221,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The post-disaster emergency response capacity of a single country is limited, and a collaborative approach that pools emergency resources can improve disaster resilience. In this paper, we study a multi-country collaborative emergency response network design problem with uncertain demand and transportation time. Considering the benefits of inter-regional cooperation in sharing emergency facilities and resources, we construct a collaborative emergency response network (CERN) design framework. The cost of CERN is allocated among the partner countries according to their expect standalone response cost and the level of economic development. In practice, the distribution information of random parameters is not perfectly known, so we propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model to design the CERN. A scenario-wise ambiguity set is constructed to characterize the uncertain parameters based on disaster-level-related events. To solve the proposed DRO model, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm with a valid inequality. In the numerical study, we first verify the advantage of the CERN design approach. The proposed scenario-wise DRO method is subsequently compared with alternative modeling approaches to assess its out-of-sample performance. The findings confirm the efficacy of the constructed ambiguity set in capturing the uncertainty stemming from varying magnitudes of catastrophic events. The computational study demonstrates that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to the commercial solver CPLEX for large-scale problems.

How liner shipping heals schedule disruption: A data-driven framework to uncover the strategic behavior of port-skipping,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103229,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Service disruption hurts the reliability of liner shipping schedules and the lack of high-quality data impedes research on schedule recovery in liner shipping.

The framework consists of a series of independent yet closely related algorithms, which are in turn tasked with screening port calls, estimating closed-loop routes, measuring similarity between different routes, and identifying port-skipping behavior, respectively. Compared with partial proprietary data from the shipping industry and port authorities, the identification results can provide transparent datasets with wide applications and much easier access publicly.

The service points’ location and capacity problem,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103216,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"We study the design of a network of automatic parcel lockers to facilitate the last-mile delivery of small parcels where parcels are delivered via service points near their recipients’ home addresses. The recipients then pick up their parcels at convenient times. This method saves a substantial share of the handling and transportation costs associated with the parcel delivery process. The deployment of such a network requires decisions regarding the location and capacity of the service points. If a parcel has to be delivered through a service point with no remaining capacity, the parcel is sent directly to the recipient’s address at a higher cost, or its delivery is postponed. Hence, there is a trade-off between the fixed setup cost, the variable operational cost, and the quality of the service. In this study, we take a bottom-up approach to the problem. We start by analyzing the dynamics of a single service point and show how to calculate a function that maps the parameters of its environment to the expected number of parcels that will be rejected from service or postponed. We then embed these functions in a mathematical model that optimizes the configuration of the network while considering the trade-offs described above.",1366-5545,Not found
Pickup capacitated vehicle routing problem with three-dimensional loading constraints: Model and algorithms,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103208,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This study addresses the pickup capacitated vehicle routing problem with three-dimensional loading constraints (3L-PCVRP), which combined the container loading problem (CLP) and the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). A mixed-integer linear programming model for 3L-PCVRP is designed with the objective of minimizing the total transportation cost. The basic constraints of CLP and CVRP as well as the practical constraints imposed by the pickup operations are incorporated in 3L-PCVRP. An improved branch-and-price-based (B&P) algorithm is proposed to solve 3L-PCVRP. The 3L-PCVRP model is decomposed into the restricted master problem (RMP) for selecting routes and the subproblem (SP) for generating routes that satisfy the loading and routing constraints. A label-correcting-based algorithm (LCA) is presented to solve the SP, which employs a two-stage method and two enhanced loading algorithms to ensure the loading feasibility of the routes. The two loading algorithms (tree search and greedy heuristic algorithms) are improved by a new evaluation function and an improved space-merging method. The two-stage method is designed to call the two loading algorithms at different frequencies to investigate the route feasibility accurately and efficiently. Numerical experiments are designed to test the performance of the proposed algorithms. The efficiency and effectiveness of the improved loading algorithms are demonstrated in hundreds randomly generated instances. For small-scale 3L-PCVRP instances, the B&P algorithm can generate solutions that are not worse than those of the solver within 0.14% of the solver’s running time.

To demonstrate strategic planning, we tested the efficacy of the cluster structure of collection points by comparing its total routing cost (using the revised nearest neighbor algorithm) to that of other partitions obtained with Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and K-medoids clustering.

We posit that managers with higher ability are in continuous pursual of optimizing firm performance, which motivates them to engage in higher levels of CAPEX vide a trade-off with short-term investment in working capital. Given the challenges and costs of raising external funds, able managers contemporaneously engage in more efficient working capital management to release excess working capital funds, and utilize them for enhancing CAPEX levels.

A continuum approximation approach to the depot location problem in a crowd-shipping system,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103207,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Last-mile delivery in the logistics chain contributes to congestion in urban networks due to frequent stops. Crowd-shipping is a sustainable and low-cost alternative to traditional delivery but relies heavily on the availability of occasional couriers. In this work, we propose a crowd-shipping system that uses depots to improve accessibility for potential crowd-shippers to serve a large portion of the demand for small parcels. While small-scale versions of this problem have been recently addressed, scaling to larger instances significantly complexifies the problem. A heuristic approach based on continuum approximation is designed to evaluate the quality of a potential set of depots. By combining an efficient and accurate approximation method with a large neighborhood search heuristic, we can efficiently find a good set of depots, even for large-scale networks. The proposed methodology allows for heterogeneity among crowd-shippers and allows identifying the expected number of delivered parcels in every region, which can be used to enhance lower-level assignment decisions. A case study on the Washington DC network shows that depots are built at geographically central locations but most importantly at locations around popular origins for crowd-shippers. The optimal number of depots is mainly dependent on the marginal number of parcels that can be served by crowd-shippers from a specific depot, relative to the costs involved in opening that depot. The operational costs approximated by our continuum approximation approach deviate on average 2% from the actual operational costs using dynamic assignment strategies. For small instances, our algorithm finds better solutions than solving a discrete formulation using CPLEX, while being almost 200 times faster. For large instances, the discrete formulation cannot be constructed by CPLEX, whereas the CA-based approach finds good solutions within minutes. Finally, the results show that using CA-based strategies in all three layers of decision-making can improve overall performance by 15% compared to non-predictive strategies.",1366-5545,Not found
An analytical model of parking infrastructure and fleet size optimization for Shared Autonomous Vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103213,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Parking is a crucial element of the driving experience in urban transportation systems. Especially in the coming era of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), parking operations in urban transportation networks may inevitably change. Parking stations are likely to serve as storage places for unused vehicles and depots that control the level-of-service of SAVs. This study presents an Analytical Parking Planning Model (APPM) for the SAV environment to provide broader insights into parking planning decisions. Two specific planning scenarios are considered for the APPM: (i) Single-zone APPM (S-APPM), which considers the target area as a single homogeneous zone, and (ii) Two-zone APPM (T-APPM), which considers the target area as two different zones, such as city center and suburban area. S-APPM offers a closed-form solution to find the optimal density of parking stations and parking spaces and the optimal number of SAV fleets, which is beneficial for understanding the explicit relationship between planning decisions and the given environments, including demand density and cost factors. In addition, to incorporate different macroscopic characteristics across two zones, T-APPM accounts for inter- and intra-zonal passenger trips and the relocation of vehicles. We conduct a case study to demonstrate the proposed method with the actual data collected in Seoul Metropolitan Area, South Korea.

This study proposes a general model framework of timetabling and passenger path choice in a URT network to minimize energy consumption under passenger travel time constraints. To obtain satisfactory energy-efficient nonuniform timetables, we suggest a novel model reformulation as a tree knapsack problem to determine train running times by a pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming algorithm in the first stage. Furthermore, a heuristic sequencing method is developed to determine nonuniform headways and dwell times in the second stage.

We propose a Digital Start-up Disruption (DSD) framework – grounded on the existing literature – that allows characterizing digital platforms and their disruptive potential using four antecedents: initial target market, ecosystem framing, value creation, and regulatory agenda. Applying the framework of the four antecedents to a case study of a digital freight forwarder reveals important insights pertaining to the dynamics of disruptive and sustaining technologies. These findings can help investors and funding organizations to identify opportunities for potential disruptive innovations.",1366-5545,Not found
Multiclass bi-criteria traffic assignment without class-specific variables: An alternative formulation and a subgradient projection algorithm,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103210,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"In this paper, we focus on the multiclass bi-criteria (time and toll) traffic assignment (MBTA) problem. The conventional MBTA model keeps multiple copies of class-specific variables to model user heterogeneity, which puts a great burden on memory storage and computational speed when dealing with real transportation networks. This paper proposes an alternative formulation for the MBTA problem without class-specific variables by exploiting the order information of paths and travelers, i.e., high value of time (VOT) travelers will prefer fast but expensive paths, while low VOT travelers will prefer slow but cheap paths. We prove the equivalence of the alternative formulation to the conventional MBTA model. To solve the alternative formulation with a nondifferentiable convex objective function, a path-based subgradient projection algorithm is developed utilizing the subgradient and available second-order information. We adopt a small network and several large networks to examine the detailed features and the computational performance of the proposed formulation and algorithm, respectively. The results show that the alternative formulation provides the same link flow pattern as that of the conventional MBTA model but uses much fewer variables, which can greatly relieve the burden on computer memory and computational speed in solving real transportation networks.",1366-5545,Not found
Store brand introduction under platform financing and competition,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103209,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Motivated by the prevalence of platform store brand entry, this paper investigates how a platform cooperates strategically with a capital-constrained manufacturer possessing its national brand in financing and contract manufacturing for the store brand. We consider four scenarios to analyse this problem: producing for the national brand under bank financing (MB) or platform financing (MP) and producing for both brands under bank financing (BB) or platform financing (BP). Intuition may suggest that the store brand puts the national brand at risk of a reduced sales price due to brand competition. However, we find that producing for the store brand can assist the manufacturer in raising sales prices when the unit production cost is small (large) and the competitive intensity is high (low) Interestingly, even when facing a higher platform interest rate than that under bank financing, the manufacturer prefers Scenario BP if the unit production cost is high and competitive intensity becomes high, because the interplay between selling and financing roles induces the platform to balance overall revenue, which may alleviate price competition and achieve a win–win outcome. Furthermore, as competitive intensity increases, Scenario BB (or BP) is more likely to become the equilibrium result; otherwise, Scenario MB (or MP) is the equilibrium result. Finally, considering the endogenous interest rate, there is a U-shaped strategy equilibrium for the platform to promote platform financing under store brand introduction. Our findings provide insights on how to manage store brand introduction by incorporating financing policies under a co-opetitive supply chain.",1366-5545,Not found
Strategic driver's acceptance-or-rejection behavior and cognitive hierarchy in on-demand platforms,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103175,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"It is critical for an on-demand platform to understand its users’ strategic-decision behaviors and thereby design a good policy to match the supply with the demand. Through behavioral game-theoretical modeling, we investigate the effects of drivers’ strategic acceptance-or-rejection behavior on their incomes and the overall platform users’ welfare, in an on-demand service platform with two service locations (i.e., a hot area and a cold area), wherein the competition between drivers arises due to overall supply exceeding overall demand and the location uncertainty of drivers. We first construct a full-rationality model to investigate drivers’ decision strategy in a competitive environment and attain the Nash Equilibrium outcomes in the stationary state of the system in the long run. We then employ the Cognitive Hierarchy theory to capture the heterogeneity effect in drivers’ strategic acceptance-or-rejection behaviors, which is more realistic than the full-rationality model. We find that the predictions of the Cognitive Hierarchy model can approach the Nash Equilibrium outcomes under an extreme condition. We can conclude that (i) the optimal acceptance probability of the drivers does not decrease with the rejection penalty or with the relative popularity of the cold area under our research settings. (ii) From the profit/welfare perspective, increasing the popularity of the cold area is beneficial for the platform users; however, a higher rejection penalty may not be always better for the platform users as a whole.

Airport gate assignment problem with harbor constraints based on Branch-and-Price algorithm,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103192,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The airport gate assignment problem is the main problem in airport operation management. Most existing studies on the airport gate assignment problem focus more on the improvement of gate utilization efficiency and ignore apron operation safety. Aiming at addressing this problem, an airport gate assignment problem with harbor safety constraints is proposed in this paper. A two-phase mathematical optimization model is constructed to optimize the efficiency of gate utilization considering the safety constraints in harbors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly focus on harbor apron security in the gate assignment problem. Then, the exact branch-and-price method is improved by incorporating a label-based pricing algorithm and two acceleration strategies. These strategies include an upper bound prediction strategy for handling the large number of subproblems and a lower parameter symmetry elimination strategy to overcome column generation degradation. The results show that the proposed gate assignment model and improved branch-and-price method optimize the efficiency of gate utilization under the condition of avoiding security conflicts in harbor aprons. The improved branch-and-price method has advantages in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared with those of other solvers.",1366-5545,Not found
Board structure and financial performance in the logistics sector: Do contingencies matter?,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103187,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Drawing on agency, stewardship, and contingency theories, this study examined whether board structure is associated with corporate financial performance and—if so—whether firm size and leverage (i.e., contingencies) moderate this association in the logistics sector. Hence, the study aimed to provide implications for board configuration and performance enhancement at varying levels of firm size and leverage. The data were retrieved from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database, and the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator was applied to these data. The results revealed that while independent directors augment corporate financial performance, female directors and chief executive officer (CEO) duality do not. The first moderation analysis concerning firm size indicated that women drive firm performance in neither large nor small firms with the exception of sales revenues, which they improve in large firms. Independent directors, on the other hand, were shown to drive firm performance in larger firms. CEO duality was revealed to be particularly influential in boosting sales revenues in large logistics firms. The second moderation analysis detected no disciplinary effect of leverage on board structure in the logistics sector.

Do domestic mergers improve airlines’ international competitiveness?—Theoretical and empirical evidence from China,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103211,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper conducts both analytical modeling and empirical analyses to examine whether domestic mergers can improve airlines’ competitiveness in the international market. We first develop a stylized industrial organization (IO) model to specify the underlying economic mechanisms. The analytical results suggest that a domestic airline merger can bring both “synergy” and “scale” effects to promote the merged airline’s international competitiveness, reflected by an increasing route-level market share. The synergy effect comes from a better-coordinated hub functioning to serve international transfer passengers, while the scale effect is from the increased operational efficiency due to the economies of scale on both domestic and international markets after the merger. We then perform difference-in-differences (DID) estimations using the merger of China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines as a quasi-natural experiment. The empirical estimations support our analytical predictions and confirm the existence of both synergy and scale effects. Our analyses and findings call for a more careful and comprehensive government evaluation of domestic airline mergers, as the welfare gain from the international market could be sizable and should also be taken into consideration.",1366-5545,Not found
Social cost-vehicle routing problem and its application to the delivery of water in post-disaster humanitarian logistics,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103189,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"In the aftermath of a disaster, delivering critical supplies, especially water, is of critical importance. Water, as well as other commodities such as rice and fuel, can be transported in different formats. Bottled water has the advantage of self-storage and easy distribution compared with bulk water, but it needs to be brought in from outside the impacted area and has high logistics costs. Bulk water can be accessed from local streams and water purification stations but requires survivors to have containers. The logistics costs and form of transportation necessary for these two different forms of water resources create tradeoffs normally overlooked in the literature. This paper introduces the Social Cost Vehicle Routing Problem: a mathematical optimization model to determine the right mix of formats for this critical commodity in terms of transportation, routing, and delivery considering social costs in the objective function. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm with a novel local search is developed to solve large instances of the problem. The algorithm uses tabu search, simulated annealing, and variable neighborhood search in a combined manner. The model is applied to a case study of post-disaster water distribution in Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. Numerical experiments indicate that having a combination of bottled and bulk water maximizes aid to survivors while minimizing response costs.",1366-5545,Not found
Supply chain disruption recovery in the evolving crisis—Evidence from the early COVID-19 outbreak in China,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103202,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The speed of recovery from supply chain disruption has been identified as the predominant factor in building a resilient supply chain. However, COVID-19 as an example of an evolving crisis may challenge this assumption. Infection risk concerns may influence production resumption decision-making because any incidents of infection may lead to further shutdowns of production lines and undermine firms’ long-term cash flows. Sampling 244 production resumption announcements by Chinese manufacturers in the early COVID-19 crisis (February–March 2020), our analysis shows that, generally, investors react positively to production resumptions. However, investors perceived the earlier production resumptions were higher risk (indicated by declined stock price). Such concerns were exacerbated by more locally confirmed cases of COVID-19 but were less salient for manufacturers with high debts (liquidity pressure). This study calls for a reassessment of the current disruption management mindset in response to new evolving crises (e.g., COVID-19) and provides theoretical, practical, and policy implications for building resilient supply chains.",1366-5545,Not found
Scenario-based Distributionally Robust Optimization for the Stochastic Inventory Routing Problem,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103193,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"We consider a class of the inventory routing problem in a discrete and finite time horizon, where the demand for homogeneous products at retail stores is uncertain and varies across different scenarios. The supplier is required to determine the times to visit retailers, the replenishment quantities to each retailer, and the routing of a vehicle so as to minimize the sum of stockout, holding, and transportation costs. We propose a scenario-based distributionally robust optimization framework to tackle this problem. We transform the distributionally robust optimization model into a mixed-integer problem, which can be solved efficiently by our proposed algorithm. We adopt a warm-start procedure that utilizes the solution to the nominal model in our methodological framework. Then we apply a Tabu search algorithm, integrated with column generation, to solve a set-partitioning-like integer linear programming model so that a better route set can be identified. By doing so, a large-scale scenario-based distributionally robust optimization model can be solved. We conduct a case study of a fuel company and construct realistic instances to demonstrate the performance of our proposed method. Computational results suggest that the model taking into account various scenarios is more effective when random demands can be classified; the model with a linear decision rule outperforms a non-adaptive model; and the model with the route set identified by an improved algorithm can deliver a better solution than the original route set.",1366-5545,Not found
Circular supply chain management with blockchain technology: A dynamic capabilities view,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103177,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Achieving a circular economy (CE) is considered one of the most significant challenges of our time, as environmental challenges and social discrepancies keep increasing. While companies need to transform their supply chains towards sustainability and circularity, implementing CE concepts into practice is not straightforward and requires technical and non-technical capabilities, referring to dynamic capabilities. One of the most promising digital technologies for improving sustainability and circularity is blockchain. However, the literature on relationships between blockchain technology (BCT), sustainability, and the CE is still in its infancy. This study illustrates how BCT can help implement circular supply chain management (CSCM) from a dynamic capabilities perspective. A multiple case study approach examines how BCT’s potential impacts CSCM. Building on the case evidence, necessary dynamic capabilities are deduced for successful CE implementations with BCT. The analysis demonstrates that supply chain traceability and related sensing capabilities are major benefits of BCT-driven CSCM. Thus, we contribute to theory by examining which dynamic capabilities need to be developed when realizing CSCM through BCT.

An optimization model for express delivery with high-speed railway,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103206,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"With the expansion of the high-speed railway (HSR) network in China, high-speed rail express delivery (HSReD) is being used to satisfy the increasing demand for express cargo.

In this study, we examine the above key issues by developing a two-stage stochastic integer linear programming model to maximize the expected net operation profit of HSReD. A meta-heuristic solution approach introduced some tailored tactics is proposed to speed up the process of solving the above model in the large-scale instances. Numerical experiments based on different sizes and practical investigation on China Railway Nanchang Group are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution approach.

A column generation approach for the crane scheduling with sidekick in a perpendicular automated yard block,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103154,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"In a new container terminal design, the perpendicular block is equipped with a Rail Mounted Gantry crane (RMG) and a sidekick Ground Trolley (GT). The RMG can handle containers by itself, or utilize the sidekick GT for container delivery. Unlike the traditional crane scheduling problem (CSP), the makespan is not merely determined by the job sequence, but also affected by the GT allocation and the RMG-GT synchronization. This novel optimization problem is defined as the crane scheduling problem with sidekick (CSP-S). It can be formulated as a mixed integer programming model to explicitly determine the GT allocation and the handover points. When the choice of handover points is remodeled as an implicit decision, the CSP-S can be transformed into an arc-based surrogate model. Based on the solution patterns of the surrogate model, it is found that the RMG-GT working plan can be decomposed into smaller “segments”. Each segment consists of two intertwined paths of the RMG and the GT respectively. A column generation approach is proposed, where the segments can be generated by a multi-attribute labeling algorithm based on the surrogate model. This solution approach can optimally solve the traditional CSP, and outperforms all benchmark methods under the CSP-S. This can be attributed to the multi-attribute labeling algorithm, which accurately controls the RMG-GT synchronization. Numerical experiments showed that the column generation approach could be well implemented under the rolling-horizon manner in practice. It improved the “Nearest Job” strategy and the TSP-based method by more than 10 % and 5 % respectively under the CSP-S. Experiments also revealed that the RMG-GT system would benefit from a faster GT, but the marginal contribution of the GT speed was gradually reducing.",1366-5545,Not found
Adherence to standard operating procedures for improving data quality: An empirical analysis in the postal service industry,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103178,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Complete and accurate data is an important enabler of effective supply chain decision making. Despite the increasing efforts to fully automate data collection processes using advanced sensors and scanners, human operators are still in charge of data entry tasks in most industries. Unfortunately, operators do not often comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and do not always exhibit the consistency and commitment required to collect high-quality data. In fact, data collection is often perceived as a non-value-adding activity that increases workloads and lowers productivity. We aim to empirically study the extent to which compliance with SOPs for data collection is affected by some of the key factors. Using a large dataset obtained from a leading postal service provider in Australia, we find that an operator’s workload, fatigue, and related work experience directly impact the compliance levels. We also find that a company’s compliance reinforcement intervention to improve compliance behavior can moderate these impacts.",1366-5545,Not found

Examination of sustainability risk in freight shipping based on the theory of planned behavior with temporal analysis,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103191,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Recent years have seen a growing focus on sustainable shipping and logistics from both the academia and business worlds. The emerging impetus towards sustainable freight shipping is accompanied by the surfacing of a novel category of threats recognized as sustainability risks. Sustainability risks could be triggered by numerous technological challenges in freight shipping and act as impediments to sustainability engagements. Despite the availability of abundant literature in the freight domain, studies examining sustainability risks in freight shipping are scarce. This study aims to understand and investigate sustainability risks in freight shipping from the perspective of theory of planned behavior (TPB). Furthermore, studies considering the impact of temporal orientation during risk analysis are virtually non-existent in the literature. This study attempts to address these gaps in the literature in the following ways: First, this study identifies sustainability risks associated with freight shipping and signifies the need to manage these risks to facilitate sustainable shipping; Second, this study investigates the influence of temporal dimension on sustainability risks; Third, this study performs the profiling of sustainability risks from economic, environmental, and social perspectives for short-term and long-term time frames. To address involved complexities, uncertainties, and preconceptions, a novel analytical model combining D-Number theory and intuitionistic Fuzzy Set theory is developed. We found that most of critical factors in all scenarios are triggered by an underlying social and technology-driven feature and not a financial one. Under the umbrella of TPB, we inferred that in the case of sustainability aspects, technology adoption provides the perceived behavioral control and lays the foundation for sustainable development.

Route planning using divide-and-conquer: A GAT enhanced insertion transformer approach,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103176,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Route planning is widely used in areas such as car navigation. For some popular mobility services such as meal delivery and online car-hailing, planning routes that closely follow drivers’ actual routes is important. Some existing methods propose that drivers plan routes in two steps: first identify intermediate waypoints on the route that connects the origin and destination; then find a series of sub-routes between successive waypoints, respectively. In this research, we advance these methods as follows: (1) We generalize the two-step process to a divide-and-conquer framework. We first identify intermediate waypoints between the origin and the destination and decompose the route planning problem into several sub-problems, whose intermediate waypoints are identified again. We recursively repeat this process until no more waypoints are identified for all the sub-problems; and (2) Unlike existing studies that identify waypoints solely based on the travel frequency of links, we propose a Graph Attention Network (GAT) Enhanced Insertion Transformer (GEIT) model for waypoint identification. GEIT model uses an Insertion Transformer to learn the relationship among links, which can better capture the mobility pattern embedded in historical routes. In addition, by incorporating a GAT to enhance our link representations, our model spreads the learned information along the road network to address the trajectory sparseness problem. Numerical experiments on a real-world trajectory data set demonstrate that the routes planned by our model show fewer deviations from the actual routes compared with state-of-the-art route planning algorithms.",1366-5545,Not found
"Reselling, consignment or In-Marketplace selling Mode? Competitive strategy for E-tailers to counteract online third-party marketplaces",10.1016/j.tre.2023.103190,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The increasing prevalence of online marketplaces has induced many suppliers to sell directly on them, which causes potential threats to small- and medium-sized e-tailers. Considering e-tailers’ broader question of how best to counteract these marketplaces, we consider three of online sales modes, namely, the traditional, consignment, and in-marketplace selling modes. In particular, we investigate the interaction between a supplier’s strategy for introducing a marketplace channel and an e-tailer’s choice of selling mode. Our analysis reveals that the e-tailer’s selling mode choice depends not only on the performance of both the supplier and the marketplace but also channel competition. In general, the e-tailer prefers the in-marketplace selling mode with a higher marketplace service level and the consignment mode with higher supplier selling efficiency. If a marketplace channel exists, traditional reselling is a better choice when both the marketplace service level and the supplier selling efficiency are restricted to the middle range. The underlying mechanism is that traditional reselling is less negatively affected by the competition effect. Finally, we find that the supplier wants to eschew the marketplace channel and strategically induce the e-tailer to sell through it even though the marketplace service level is relatively high. This research provides guidance not only for the supplier’s channel choice but also for the small- and medium-sized e-tailers’ choice of selling mode when encountering the online marketplace.",1366-5545,Not found
Impacts of household vulnerability on hurricane logistics evacuation under COVID-19: The case of U.S. Hampton Roads,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103179,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Historical data suggest that when a severe tropical storm or hurricane impacts a community, the vulnerable segment of the population suffers the most severe consequences. With an increased aging population, it is crucial to understand how vulnerability alters evacuation behavior. Emergent variables such as fear of COVID-19 require additional exploration. People afraid of COVID-19 exposure may refuse to evacuate, exposing themselves unnecessarily. Differentiation is critical to evacuation logistics since it is needed to determine what proportion would stay in a local shelter, public or other, rather than evacuating or staying in their home and guide the logistics resource allocation process. This research uses data from a web and phone survey conducted in the Hampton Roads area of U.S. Virginia, with 2,200 valid responses to analyze the influence of social and demographic vulnerability factors and risk perception on evacuation decisions. This research contributes to the existing literature by developing a multinomial order logit model based on vulnerability factors and intended evacuation decisions, including staying at home, looking for a shelter, or leaving the Hampton Roads area. Findings show that race and risk perception are the variables that influence the decision-making process the most. Fear of COVID-19 transmission is also associated with an increased likelihood of leaving homes during evacuation.

This paper studies the interplay between a manufacturer’s technology investment choice and a retailer’s SB encroachment strategy. The research shows that the manufacturer’s technology investment strategy cannot always hold back the retailer’s SB encroachment, which depends on the two brands’ competition effect and the technology spillover effect. If the technology spillover effect is sufficiently pronounced, the technology investment strategy will instead serve to push forward the SB encroachment. Once the technology investment strategy is implemented, the SB encroachment may not serve as a credible threat.

Winner determination problem with purchase budget for transportation procurement under uncertain shipment volume,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103182,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"We study a winner determination problem (WDP) to help shippers in determining the winning bids proposed by carriers in a combinatorial auction for transportation service procurement. The winning carriers, together with spot market carriers which may be optional, undertake the shipper’s annual shipment tasks that are uncertain in the auction stage; completing the tasks incurs a total cost. In particular, the shipper wants to control the total cost under a prescribed purchase budget, resulting in a new problem variant—the WDP with purchase budget (B-WDP). To mitigate both the probability and magnitude of cost overrun, we introduce the Essential Riskiness Index (Zhang et al., 2019) as the decision criterion. Considering the inaccuracy in each predicted scenario/sample of shipment volumes, we allow for some perturbation around each sample and formulate a two-stage sample robust optimization model for the B-WDP. We analyze the properties of the model and, via linear decision rule and duality theory, reformulate it as a mixed-integer linear program solvable via state-of-the-art solvers. By extensive comparative studies against the traditional stochastic and robust models for the WDP, we demonstrate that our two-stage sample robust B-WDP model effectively reduces the expectation of cost overrun and the worst-case total cost. Additional sensitivity analysis confirms that our model consistently and effectively helps shippers mitigate cost overrun.",1366-5545,Not found
Trajectory optimization for autonomous modular vehicle or platooned autonomous vehicle split operations,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103115,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology allows for the flexible adjustment of vehicle length en-route per application needs, e.g., docking multiple short vehicles into one long vehicle or, conversely, splitting a long vehicle into multiple shorter ones. AMV docking is an extreme case of autonomous vehicle (AV) platooning in that AMVs are physically connected with zero gaps. This paper studies the trajectory planning for platoon split operations. A two-stage optimization problem is proposed to design AMV or platooned AV split operations trajectories. The first-stage objective minimizes the split operation time duration for operation efficiency. The second-stage objective minimizes the sum of squared acceleration to identify the smoothest trajectories for riding comfort and fuel efficiency. A feasible cone method is proposed by extending the time geography to reveal theoretical properties on the solution feasibility and analytically solve the first-stage problem. An exact solution approach based on quadratic programming and a heuristic solution approach based on Pontryagin's maximum principle are proposed to solve the second-stage problem. The original feasible region of the second-stage problem is greatly reduced through the feasible region analyses. Numerical experiments show that the heuristic solution approach can always solve the second-stage problem instantaneously without any or with a slight loss of the operation optimality to satisfy real-time applications needs, whereas the exact solution approach with a state-of-the-art solver may take a much longer solution time that may impose challenges to certain real-time applications. It is also noted that the exact solution time is significantly reduced after accommodating the reduced feasible region. This is critical for applications requiring absolute optimality when the heuristic solution approach fails to reach the exact optimum. The comparison between the heuristic solution approach and a customized benchmark approach reveals the superiority of the heuristic solution approach in optimizing vehicle split trajectories. Results from sensitivity analyses on key parameters provide managerial insights into engineering implementations. The generalizability of the heuristic solution approach in solving another trajectory smoothing objective function considering both acceleration and jerk is proven by extensive numerical experiments. The generalizability of the heuristic solution approach in large-scale applications and when considering surrounding traffic is also discussed.",1366-5545,Not found
Improving relief operations via optimizing shelter location with uncertain covariates,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103181,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Designing an efficient shelter location planning is crucial to the rapid implementation of relief operations under the uncertain number of casualties. In practice, the uncertain number of casualties is closely related to disaster severity, whereas previous studies ignore such correlations when modeling uncertainties. In this paper, the scenario-wise ambiguity set is adopted to capture the correlation between the uncertain number of casualties and uncertain covariates, i.e., disaster severity. We develop a two-stage scenario-wise distributionally robust (SDR) model, where the shelter location and capacity allocation decisions are made here-and-now, and recourse decisions to transport casualties are made after the uncertainties on the number of casualties and covariate information have been realized. We approximate the non-convex model into a tractable form, i.e., second-order cone programming (SOCP), which can be solved efficiently by an outer approximation (OA) algorithm for a large-scale computation case. The numerical results with real-world data show that covariate integration (CVI) can contribute to saving costs and improving relief efficiency, and illustrate the computational superiority of the proposed OA algorithm. The results further demonstrate that establishing shelters with large capacities and near the affected areas has indeed had a positive impact on improving relief efficiency.",1366-5545,Not found

Although showing attractiveness in terms of the solutions to emerging challenges such as carbon emission and insufficient labor caused by black swan events such as COVID-19, the applications of MASS have revealed problems in practice, among which MASS navigation safety presents a prioritized concern. To ensure safety, rational route planning for MASS is evident as the most critical step to avoiding any relevant collision accidents. This paper aims to develop a holistic framework for the unsupervised route planning of MASS using machine learning methods based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, including the coherent steps of new feature measurement, pattern extraction, and route planning algorithms. Historical AIS data from manned ships are trained to extract and generate movement patterns. The route planning for MASS is derived from the movement patterns according to a dynamic optimization method and a feature extraction algorithm. Numerical experiments are constructed on real AIS data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving the route planning for different types of MASS.",1366-5545,Not found
An adaptive heuristic for Feeder Network Design with optional transshipment,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103153,176,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper studies the Feeder Network Design Problem (FNDP), which considers the design of a minimum cost liner shipping network for the transportation of cargo (containers) between a given hub port and a set of feeder ports. In addition to determining the services to operate (i.e., the routes), the FNDP deals with deciding the fleet of vessels to deploy on these services. In contrast to most FNDPs previously studied in the literature, the feeder network can, if found beneficial, be a hub-and-spoke system where cargo can be transshipped at any feeder ports. Thus, we denote our problem as the Feeder Network Design with Optional Transshipment (FND-OT). To solve the FND-OT, we propose a novel adaptive Heuristic with a special data structure for solution representation, which gives significant speed-ups. Furthermore, a new escape algorithm is used to escape from local optima. We show that the adaptive heuristic outperforms an existing solution algorithm in the literature on a set of realistic test instances. We also present results for a new set of instances adapted from a previously published benchmark suite (LINER-LIB) and show that including the possibility of having cargo transshipment in the FNDP can give significant benefits and reduced costs.",1366-5545,Not found
Integrating alternating direction method of multipliers and bush for solving the traffic assignment problem,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103233,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This paper introduces two novel parallel algorithmic frameworks to address the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem (UE-TAP). Most of the existing solution algorithms for the UE-TAP are executed in a sequential manner. This study endeavors to explore parallel computing methods based on model decomposition. Considering that the TAPs can be decomposed based on their origins, thus, following the spirit of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a new parallel algorithm B-ADMM is proposed, which integrates the concept of the bush. Subsequently, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is rigorously proven. To enhance the algorithmic parallelism while maintaining the convergence efficiency of the B-ADMM algorithm, this paper further employs the parallel block coordinate descent (PBCD) method to improve the B-ADMM algorithm. We develop a bi-level parallel algorithm PBCD-ADMM, in which the independent origins/bushes are separated into several blocks, and the origin/bush-based restricted subproblems in each block can be solved in parallel. Furthermore, for the given bush belonging to a block, the bush links can also be grouped into several sub-blocks based on the original link-blocking scheme. Thus, these link-based subproblems in each sub-block can also be solved in parallel. A numerical experiment is conducted to validate the proposed algorithms, which indicates that the two new parallel algorithms perform better in terms of convergence speed compared with the original ADMM algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found
TS-STNN: Spatial-temporal neural network based on tree structure for traffic flow prediction,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103251,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Traffic flow prediction effectively supports the sustainable expansion and operation of modern transport networks, one of the emerging research areas in intelligent transportation systems. Currently, most common traffic flow prediction methods use deep learning spatial–temporal models based on graph convolution theory, which cannot deeply explore the spatial hierarchy and directional information of traffic flow data due to their structural characteristics. To address this problem, a spatial–temporal neural network based on tree structure (TS-STNN) is created to anticipate future traffic flow at a specific time at a target location. The principle of this method is to use the characteristics of the tree structure to construct a plane tree matrix with hierarchical and directional features, which is finally fused into a spatial tree matrix to extract the spatial information. Meanwhile, the temporal correlation of traffic flow data in the traffic network is analyzed by TS-STNN using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). By comparing with the existing baseline methods, it is verified that the TS-STNN model has high prediction accuracy in both Random Uniformly Distributed (RND) and Small-Scale Aggregation of Node Distributed (SSAND) scenarios. It is further demonstrated through ablation experiments that the developed tree convolution module greatly impacts the TS-STNN accuracy.",1366-5545,Not found
Tactical planning for dynamic technician routing and scheduling problems,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103225,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"We consider the tactical planning aspect of a dynamic technician routing and scheduling problem with a time horizon of several days. In this problem study, some tasks are known beforehand, while others arrive dynamically. The tactical planning is to schedule the known tasks, such that we minimize the overall driving distance while ensuring short service times for the dynamic tasks. Without tactical planning, the known tasks would be spread throughout the whole area as they are scheduled based on a first-come-first-serve principle. In this study, we partition the area into disjoint slices covering the full plane and then assign the slices to individual work days. The partitioning of the area will be constructed with a balanced sweep algorithm using two approaches: The first is based on a parallel sweep-line following a given angle, while the second is based on a rotating sweep-line around a given origin. To guide the partitioning, we aim to minimize the degree of dynamism, which in our case is defined by the number of dynamic tasks, the distance from known tasks to dynamic tasks, and the tightness of the time windows. The tactical planning is evaluated using real-life and synthetic clustered data, where some of the tasks are known beforehand, and some are dynamic. We benchmark the various partitioning approaches against the default strategy of serving all known tasks on a first-come-first-serve basis. Computational results are reported showing around a 10% reduction in driving distance when using tactical planning. Furthermore, we show that up to 70% of the technicians can have a non-dynamic work day, without a significant increase in driving distance.",1366-5545,Not found
Location and inventory pre-positioning problem under uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103236,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"In humanitarian logistics, the location and inventory pre-positioning problem (LIPP), making decisions on facility location, inventory pre-positioning, and allocation, is critical to post-disaster rescue efficiency. Since post-disaster conditions are complex and uncertain, it is challenging for planners to make LIPP decisions and perform rescue activities. To reduce operational costs while also guaranteeing service levels to customers, it is necessary to take uncertainties into account when making decisions. This study explores a service-oriented LIPP under two types of uncertainties, i.e., uncertain customer demand and third-party supply. We propose a two-stage robust optimization framework to solve the problem, considering the service-level constraints and minimizing the total cost. We develop two algorithms to solve the problem. Specifically, a column-and-constraint generation algorithm is utilized to solve the original two-stage robust model, and an improved row generation algorithm is developed to tackle the affinely adjustable robust counterpart model. Simulation results show that both algorithms can provide satisfying solutions.

Integrated optimization of train stopping plan and seat allocation scheme for railway systems under equilibrium travel choice and elastic demand,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103231,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This paper examines the integrated optimization of train stopping plan and seat allocation scheme in railway systems, where equilibrium passenger travel choice under elastic demand is considered.

The integrated optimization model can be reformulated into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on a series of linearization, relaxation, and outer-approximation techniques, which can then be solved by commercial MILP solvers (e.g., GUROBI). We also compare the integrated optimization approach with that when the train stopping plan and seat allocation are optimized separately and identify the potential benefits.

An application-oriented testing regime and multi-ship predictive modeling for vessel fuel consumption prediction,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103261,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Fuel consumption prediction (FCP) of vessels is the core of many decarbonization efforts by the maritime industry. Understanding the capability of machine learning (ML) FCP models is essential in various decision-making processes. However, the current model testing practice does not reflect their uncertainty and resilience in actual applications. To address this gap, this study proposes a testing regime that could provide insights into models’ behaviors, dependency on different features, and potential vulnerabilities to data uncertainties in the deployment phase. Two multi-ship FCP models were developed for testing, using extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms on noon reports of a container fleet operated globally in 2.5 years. Unlike previous studies, which explicitly indicated the superior ML algorithms, results from this study depicted a complicated situation with no decisive dominance of one algorithm over another, suggesting the potential of model combination and cooperation for optimal application performance. Aiding the FCP model development efforts, this study also includes findings regarding (1) the optimal configurations for ANN models, and (2) the reliance of FCP ML models and algorithms on different fuel consumption influencing factors. To our knowledge, this study is among the first to advocate a more comprehensive understanding of AI-based FCP models’ characteristics in realistic scenarios instead of simple selections based on accuracy indicators.",1366-5545,Not found

Dynamic decisions between sellers and consumers in online second-hand trading platforms: Evidence from C2C transactions,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103257,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Dynamic decisions have become pivotal strategies for sellers and consumers in C2C second-hand product market. This study instroduces a two-stage pricing model and a consumer choice model, aiming to scrutinize the dynamic pricing behaviors of individual sellers and their subsequent impact on consumer choice. Leveraging data from the Xianyu platform, akin to eBay, we identify two fundamental dynamics that underscore successful pricing strategies. Seller pricing behaviors for second-hand products are subject to a number of influences, encompassing the duration since release, consumer engagement with product features, emotive descriptions, and feedback from market information. Our investigation unveils that sellers tend to recalibrate prices in the second phase if their second-hand products remain unsold during the initial phase, leveraging additional insights amassed during the first period. This adjustment is particularly pronounced if the price adjustment in the second phase is influenced by the time since the product's release. Moreover, the extra information gleaned during the initial phase affects the range of price adjustments. Notably, our research uncovers that consumers exhibit heightened attentiveness to product features and optimistic emotional descriptions in the search stage. Conversely, during the purchasing stage, product prices and the time since release emerge as more pivotal determinants. However, prevailing price adjustment practices predominantly center around markdowns or markups, with the time since release dampening purchasing inclinations. Our findings disclose that among these practices, only price markdowns hold the power to effectively stimulate purchase decisions, particularly when influenced by the duration since release. Based on these insights, we suggest that sellers should refrain from concentrating solely on pricing adjustments for their second-hand products. Instead, they would benefit from incorporating the additional market insights gained from the time since the product’s release and the feedback from consumers to enhance the quality of dynamic pricing decisions.",1366-5545,Not found
Vessel weather routing subject to sulfur emission regulation,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103235,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"The International Maritime Organization (IMO) rolled out a set of new regulations that limit the sulfur content in the fuel oil used by ships, which came into effect from 2020. This study aims to explore the operational decisions of vessels inside and outside emission control areas (ECAs) under uncertain weather conditions and scrutinizes the economics of two types of ships: fuel-switching and scrubber installation. Such operational decisions include speed, trim, and path decision. We construct a navigation grid system, in which each grid contains weather parameters and sea condition. This navigation grid system can be applied to other type of ships due to the well-established cost structure. To improve fuel consumption estimation, we train fuel consumption estimation functions with respect to weather parameters, sea conditions, and operational decisions. This study then develops a stochastic dynamic programming model to optimize the path decisions, vessel speed, and trim. To evaluate the efficiency of the developed stochastic dynamic programming model, we further conduct a case study on a Post-Panamax container vessel that operates westbound from Hamburg to Houston. We identify the path decision, speed and trim under ECAs and the uncertain weather conditions. Surprisingly, this case study demonstrates that the ship utilizing fuel-switching takes a detour trip; in contrast, the ship with a scrubber chooses the shortest path by maximizing the speed. Additionally, we observe a knock-on effect — scrubber installation lifts carbon dioxide emissions due to increased vessel speed outside the ECA region.

Extended warranty service provision: A strategic analysis for the E-commerce platform supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103250,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Motivated by the industrial practice that the giant E-commerce platforms are well motivated to engage in offering the extended warranty service, this paper investigates the optimal extended warranty provision with a platform supply chain. Depending on who acts as the extended warranty underwriter with the two online channel modes (i.e., the online agency mode or the online reselling mode), several different extended warranty scenarios are hence formulated, based on which we apply Stackelberg game to address the equilibria. With the analytical studies, our results show several important and interesting insights. For example, but not limited to, it is found that: (a) the dynamics of the optimal extended warranty strategy is largely different in response to various combinations of the warranty underwriters and the online channel modes; (b) the agent, who takes the ownership over the product (i.e., the manufacturer with the online agency mode and the platform with the online reselling mode), acts more responsively in providing the extended warranty service across the two online channel modes; (c) offering the pricing discount is an important intermediary that affects the Pareto improvement zone benefiting the two individuals in this platform supply chain; (d) the specific extended warranty strategies that the warranty underwriter adopts across two online channel modes induce a significant implication for selecting the optimal online channel modes for both warranty underwriters.

Upward scalable vehicle routing problem of automobile inbound logistics with pickup flexibility,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103253,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Motivated by the inbound logistics of a famous automobile manufacturing company, we introduce the upward scalable vehicle routing problem (for order pickup) with time windows (USVRPTW), where the pickup from each supplier can be adjusted upward by a certain degree (pickup flexibility) based on the order volume, thus increasing the vehicle utilization and reducing logistics cost. We solve the USVRPTW exactly by a branch-and-price algorithm, where the flexibility affects the pricing problem, leading to the elementary shortest path problem having to consider resource allocation except the resource constraints. The consideration of resource allocation adds many new properties to the shortest path problem, based on which we design a tree search algorithm. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on the bipartite graph to generate initial columns for the column generation (CG) process. The algorithm can also be adopted as an efficient method for solving large-scale problems due to its ability to find near-optimal solutions quickly. We also propose the penalty stabilization method and the drill-down strategy to accelerate CG. Numerical experiments show that our designed branch-and-price algorithm outperforms the commercial solver Gurobi. The efficiency of the tree search algorithm, the heuristic algorithm, and the CG acceleration methods is also verified. Real-data experiments illustrate that the low increase in driving cost can significantly improve vehicle utilization, proving the significance of flexibility. We then provide management insights to reveal that adopting the proposed flexibility mechanism can reduce logistics cost.",1366-5545,Not found
Route planning for last-mile deliveries using mobile parcel lockers: A hybrid q-learning network approach,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103234,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Mobile parcel lockers (MPLs) have been recently proposed by logistics operators as a technology that could help reduce traffic congestion and operational costs in urban freight distribution. Given their ability to relocate throughout their area of deployment, they hold the potential to improve customer accessibility and convenience. In this study, we formulate the Mobile Parcel Locker Problem (MPLP), a special case of the Location-Routing Problem (LRP) which determines the optimal stopover location for MPLs throughout the day and plans corresponding delivery routes. A Hybrid Q-Learning-Network-based Method (HQM) is developed to resolve the computational complexity of the resulting large problem instances while escaping local optima. In addition, the HQM is integrated with global and local search mechanisms to resolve the dilemma of exploration and exploitation faced by classic reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We examine the performance of HQM under different problem sizes (up to 200 nodes) and benchmarked it against the exact approach and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our results indicate that HQM achieves better optimisation performance with shorter computation time than the exact approach solved by the Gurobi solver in large problem instances. Additionally, the average reward obtained by HQM is 1.96 times greater than GA’s, which demonstrates that HQM has a better optimisation ability. Further, we identify critical factors that contribute to fleet size requirements, travel distances, and service delays. Our findings outline that the efficiency of MPLs is mainly contingent on the length of time windows and the deployment of MPL stopovers. Finally, we highlight managerial implications based on parametric analysis to provide guidance for logistics operators in the context of efficient last-mile distribution operations.",1366-5545,Not found

Will self-gifting of streamers hurt unions? Analyzing the union's compensation mechanism for a live streaming supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103230,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"As an emerging online media for entertainment and social contact, live streaming already has a considerable market after its boom in recent years. On a live streaming platform, as content providers and the agents of providers, streamers and unions are the two most important roles on the supply side. Once streamers join a union, they will be paid according to the union’s compensation mechanism instead of directly paid by the platform. In practice, the union’s compensation mechanism usually contains a basic requirement for streamers’ proceeds, which may induce a specific self-gifting behavior among streamers — when a streamer’s proceeds have not met the requirement, the streamer may donate to himself/herself to increase his/her income. An interesting question is how should the union respond to such speculation, stand by or prohibit it? This paper considers a Stackelberg game between a union and a mass of streamers. The union utilizes a typical compensation mechanism with a basic proceeds requirement, and streamers are heterogeneous in their abilities. Using a backward induction approach, we derive the streamers’ optimal decisions for a given compensation mechanism and then numerically optimize the union’s compensation parameters. Our analysis reveals that when the union’s compensation parameters meet certain conditions, some streamers will donate to themselves, and more low-ability streamers will join the union. We also interestingly find that self-gifting behavior never hurts the union under its optimal compensation mechanism. The union can avoid the self-gifting behavior of streamers or even make this behavior beneficial to itself by properly setting the parameters of the compensation mechanism in different cases.",1366-5545,Not found
Adaptation strategies for building supply chain viability: A case study analysis of the global automotive industry re-purposing during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103249,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have drastically transformed the automotive industry by adversely affecting and seriously disrupting its global networks with regards to degree of severity and complexity, scale and impact duration.

We examine the manufacturer’s optimal quality improvement strategy and the retailer’s optimal in-store service strategy. Our study shows that the optimal customer returns management strategy from the perspective of the supply chain as a whole coincides with the individual interests of both the manufacturer and the retailer. We show that each of the four supply chain strategies (no quality improvement and no in-store service, in-store service but no quality improvement, quality improvement but no in-store service, and both quality improvement and in-store service) can be a dominant supply chain strategy, depending on several factors. These factors include the degree of the increase in product quality and/or the degree of the increase in the likelihood of the customer’s satisfaction due to in-store service, and the relative efficiencies of producing and selling the product with/without the manufacturer’s quality improvement and/or with/without the retailer’s in-store service.

Strategic analysis of supplier integration and encroachment in an outsourcing supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103238,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"To prevent suppliers from gaining full knowledge of production technology, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) typically adopt a multisourcing strategy, wherein each supplier handles only a portion of the production tasks. However, a recent trend has emerged where suppliers are increasingly inclined to integrate and negotiate for control over the entire end market. The implications and impact of such integration strategies, particularly in the context of supplier encroachment, remain uncertain. In this study, we examine an OEM that outsources production tasks to two competing suppliers with varying production capabilities. The supplier with higher capacity has the potential to produce their own branded products and encroach upon the end market. To strengthen their bargaining power during the outsourcing process, the two suppliers may choose to integrate with each other. Our findings indicate that without integration, OEMs can adjust the outsourcing allocation ratio to prevent encroachment by capable suppliers. In cases of integration, although the OEM must outsource all production tasks to the integrated supplier, the likelihood of market encroachment may be reduced. Furthermore, we observe that in situations involving supplier integration and encroachment, both competitive suppliers, the OEM, and the entire supply chain can achieve a win–win–win outcome. This occurs because the supplier, acting as a market competitor, provides positive incentives for the OEM to enhance product quality, thereby maintaining market share and competitiveness. The strategic recommendations derived from our results can be valuable for supply chain members engaged in outsourcing decisions.",1366-5545,Not found
C2M strategies on an e-commerce platform under brand competition,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103184,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"With the growing diversity of consumer preferences, an emerging mode of supply chain innovation, the consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M) model, is being adopted by e-commerce platforms. The C2M model directly connects end consumers to upstream factories digitally, shortens the information pipeline, and helps factories better understand consumer needs. Given the presence in the market of a national brand produced by a manufacturer, whether to incur the costs of introducing C2M store brand products is a key issue for the platform. Specifically, we consider two C2M modes that depend on whether the e-commerce platform has pricing power: (1) TC2M, which involves the factory selling to consumers directly, and (2) JC2M, which involves the e-commerce platform reselling the C2M product. We show that a relatively high mismatch level of the national brand product and a low introduction cost might induce adoption of the C2M model, which is in the interest of both the e-commerce platform and the factory. Furthermore, when the national brand’s mismatch level is not too high, the e-commerce platform prefers the JC2M mode to alleviate intensified brand competition. Interestingly, under certain circumstances, the C2M model can also be beneficial for the national brand producer (i.e., manufacturer) due to more precise targeting of its market segment. Our study extends the literature by modeling the competition between the national brand and C2M store brand, discussing supply chain members’ preference for the C2M model and providing intriguing managerial insights for the platform on the adoption of different C2M modes.",1366-5545,Not found

In view of the rapid development of autonomous taxis, this study proposes AdaBoost-Bagging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning to learn cruising policy from experienced taxi drivers’ trajectories.

We solve the same-day delivery problem by proposing a novel branch-and-regret algorithm in which sampled scenarios are used to anticipate future events and an adaptive large neighborhood search is iteratively invoked to optimize routing plans. The branch-and-regret is equipped with four innovation elements: a new way to model the subproblem, a new policy to generate scenarios, new consensus functions, and a new branching scheme Extensive computational experiments on a large variety of instances prove the outstanding performance of the branch-and-regret, also in comparison with recent literature, in terms of served requests, traveled distance, and computational effort.",1366-5545,Not found
Maximizing robustness of aircraft routing with heterogeneous maintenance tasks,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103237,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"In aircraft maintenance routing, the disruption caused by the stochasticity of the maintenance duration is a critical challenge. Previous studies considered the sources of disruptions in an aggregated manner, which resulted in aircraft schedules with insufficient robustness. In this study, we incorporated the uncertainties of heterogeneous maintenance tasks into a robust aircraft routing decision framework and considered other sources of disruptions. Our aim is to study the impact of maintenance task uncertainties on aircraft schedules. Accordingly, we propose a robust aircraft maintenance routing model, which is solved by an accelerated column generation algorithm. Computational experiments are conducted based on actual flight data to examine the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed acceleration strategies significantly speeded up the computational process without affecting the solution quality. Moreover, robust aircraft routes were obtained that were less vulnerable to maintenance disruptions.",1366-5545,Not found
Interactive bundle pricing strategy for online pharmacies,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103223,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Online retail pharmacies usually price their products differently from traditional drugstores.

We further conduct a numerical study using the data from a leading e-pharmacy in China.

How digitalization transforms the traditional circular economy to a smart circular economy for achieving SDGs and net zero,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103147,177,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Promoting and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) and net zero will be a high priority among companies and institutions. Several strategies are being developed to motivate and integrate SDGs and net zero-related approaches in companies, among which the circular economy (CE) is gaining momentum due to its documented impact on the elements of the SDGs and net zero. In fact, recent studies began to examine the relationship between CE, SDGs and net zero through different perspectives and with different areas of application. Although this relationship is primarily for the implementation of the SDGs and net zero targets, very few studies demonstrate concerns about CE-SDG-net zero relationships, specifically with smart CE. Although the traditional CE influences the SDGs and net zero positively, the traditional approach remains insufficient in several areas, including the lack of real-life information, where most CE practices and principles reside. To address this gap, a smart CE has been established by researchers to unleash the potential of achieving SDGs and net zero. To explore the smart CE and to tackle the existing literature gap, this study focuses on identifying the influence of smart CE with a focus on achieving SDGs and net zero with a single textile case study. The study is divided with four phases, as follows. The first phase attempts to select the best and most feasible CE practices that have a major impact on SDGs and net zero. The second phase understands the smart integrated success factors for adopting selected CE practices. The third phase evaluates and analyzes the overall common success factors for selected CE practices, and finally, the fourth phase validates the available results from the previous phases through feedback from various reliable sources. A case study methodology has been used in this study to understand the core of the research, while it should be noted this study is groundbreaking work in the field of research. Two different multi-criteria decision-making tools (MCDMs) have been used, namely the Best Worst Method (BWM) and the grey DEMATEL for selecting the best and most feasible CE practices and for evaluating the commonly collected success factors. Two theories (CSF theory and TOE theory) have been used to strengthen the study's theoretical background and contribution. To assist practitioners, the available results are discussed in a way that understands the relationship between the chosen CE practices and their considered influential success factors with SDGs and net zero through digitalization.",1366-5545,Not found
Game relations between platform enterprises and participants of digital interaction-sharing platforms in the maritime logistics industry,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103292,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Digital platforms simplify the complexities of day-to-day transactions in the maritime logistics industry and facilitate participants to seamlessly connect with each other.

It is also challenging for these enterprises to share data out of consideration for participants’ privacy concerns, rights, and interests. To promote data sharing, this study intends to understand the strategies of both platform enterprises and participants based on a dynamic game model to provide policy implications to platform enterprises and the government. The main findings are as follows. First, when platform enterprises move first, they should subsidize key participants with high privacy costs to compensate for the negative externality of data. Second, in the early stages of building a platform, when supporting platform enterprises move first, they must subsidize both key participants with low privacy costs and general participants.

A policy gradient approach to solving dynamic assignment problem for on-site service delivery,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103260,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The paper studies the resource allocation problem for delivering on-site services in urban areas. Requests for services are received spontaneously, with deliveries to be assigned dynamically. Real-life examples of such applications include the dispatch of traffic officers to scenes of accidents and the deployment of mechanics to sites of maintenance works. The dynamic assignment problem is to be solved via a policy gradient approach that dynamically assigns workers to different locations so that each customer involved would experience a minimum delay. Our solution framework adopts the transformer architecture with layers of inter-task and inter-agent communications as the approximator. This approximator is trained with the vanilla policy gradient algorithm. To improve computational effectiveness, we introduce an option of withholding an assignment, where workers may not be assigned at a decision point even if a service request is received, to enhance the flexibility of actions. Extensive computational experiments with a varying number of orders, order frequencies, and spatial sparsity are conducted. Our proposed method is shown to outperform other benchmarking methods, including the genetic algorithm and other online heuristics, in terms of stability of effectiveness, computational efficiency, and solution quality.

Inter-terminal transportation for an offshore port integrating an inland container depot,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103282,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Offshore ports, which are located on islands or away from the hinterland, are usually connected with the hinterland via bridges for truck transportation. With the rapid growth of port throughput, the bridges are likely to become a bottleneck restricting the development of port business. Inland container depots (ICD) have been introduced as satellite terminals to address congestion issues on bridges by allowing a proportion of drayage trucks to pick up and drop off containers at the ICD instead of going to the container terminals of the offshore ports. Containers are transported between the ICD and container terminals by inter-terminal transportation (ITT) trucks owned by port authorities. The ICD is expected to mitigate the bridge congestion by transferring the travel demands of drayage trucks in peak hours to the travel demands of ITT trucks in off-peak hours. We propose a methodology for analyzing the influence of ICDs on port efficiency. An integer linear programming model is developed to optimize the movements of containers, drayage trucks and ITT trucks in an offshore port area with the objective of minimizing the costs of drayage trucks and ITT trucks and the penalty for late delivery of containers. Two model transformation approaches are proposed to reduce the solution space of the model for improving the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The influence of ICDs on port efficiency is evaluated through a real-world case study using the proposed methodology. The results provide insights for port authorities to make strategic decisions.",1366-5545,Not found
Impact of information disclosure on global supply chain greenwashing: Is more information transparency always better?,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103288,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"As supply chains become more globalized, retailers outsource the manufacturing of their products to foreign suppliers. Supply chain greenwashing is an immoral practice employed by retailers whereby they selectively disclose information regarding upstream suppliers after exaggerating the environmental benefits of their fake green products to consumers. Using a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium approach, this paper examines the conditions under which a retailer who engages in greenwashing will disclose the information of an unethical foreign supplier under pressure from enhanced scrutiny by a non-governmental organization (NGO). The results show that when the increase in the NGO’s utility from targeting the unrevealed upstream supplier is sufficiently large, the greenwashing retailer prefers to disclose the unethical foreign supplier’s information, whereas when the increased utility is low, the greenwashing retailer prefers to hide the unethical foreign supplier. Different from common belief that increased information transparency may be beneficial, we find that it does not necessarily lead to reduced social damage and that it depends on the unethical foreign supplier’s capability for compliance. In particular, when the unethical foreign supplier has a low capacity for compliance, the supply chain’s transparency advantage will lead to more fake green goods being sold, thus causing greater social damage.",1366-5545,Not found
Crowdshipping for sustainable urban logistics: A systematic review of the literature,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103289,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Crowd-Shipping (CS) solutions have been gaining popularity in industry and academia. Despite numerous CS platforms having been introduced in the real world, only a limited number of them have managed to remain viable. Academics have explored many challenges facing CS platforms and recommended appropriate solution measures. While the growing literature sporadically indicates “economic”, “environmental” or even “societal” benefits of CS initiatives, there is a lack of systematic and conclusive understanding of CS initiatives from these essential “sustainability perspectives”. Considering that sustainability and societal impacts of such new and emerging initiatives are key factors in gaining public policy support and potential government investments and involvements, as critical success factors for the uptake, growth and continuity of these initiatives, this paper aims to present a review of this topic in light of sustainability considerations. A content-based framework grounded on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach is adopted in this review and papers are reviewed, classified, synthesised, and analysed to reveal dominant research trends, challenges, potential and gaps.

Does free brand spillover benefit online retailers? Roles of logistics service selection,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103270,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Brand spillover is a pivotal tool that online retailers have adopted to market their new brand products, especially when competing against well-known product brands that prone to free-riding. This common practice seems beneficial to the adopters, but the motivation remains unclear in a supply chain setting. This study explores a co-opetitive supply chain in which a famous brand manufacturer (she) sells her own-branded products by commission via an online retailer (he) with a private label, who determines whether or not to utilize free brand spillover. The upstream manufacturer has to decide between two logistics service strategies, namely, Scenario T (i.e., using third-party logistics to serve the sales of their own-branded products) and Scenario R (i.e., employing the high-quality logistics of the online retailer). We explore the strategic interactions of the two firms and characterize their equilibrium. We reveal that when the decreased brand attractiveness of implementing third-party logistics is low, the brand manufacturer opts for the third-party logistics; otherwise, she embraces the high-quality logistics of the retailer. Interestingly, the brand manufacturer may be less inclined to utilize the logistics service of the retailer if he employs free brand spillover because it will help intensify market competition from the manufacturer’s perspective. Moreover, although free brand spillover enhances the attractiveness of the retailer’s private label without any cost, the retailer may not adopt it when the brand spillover intensity is low and the decreased brand attractiveness of the third-party logistics is moderate. Finally, we provide managerial insights and guidance for the firms’ managers on how to use the above strategies to obtain a “win–win” outcome. We also extend our analysis to the setting with imperfect substitutes, where the deterrence effect of brand spillover on the manufacturer’s logistics choice remains the same.",1366-5545,Not found
Reliable reserve-crew scheduling for airlines,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103283,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"We study the practical setting in which regular- and reserve-crew schedules are dynamically maintained up to the day of executing the schedule. At each day preceding the execution of the schedule, disruptions occur due to sudden unavailability of personnel, making the planned regular and reserve-crew schedules infeasible for its execution day. This paper studies the fundamental question how to repair the schedules’ infeasibility in the days preceding the execution, taking into account labor regulations. We propose a robust repair strategy that maintains flexibility in order to cope with additional future disruptions. The flexibility in reserve-crew usage is explicitly considered through evaluating the expected shortfall of the reserve-crew schedule based on a Markov chain formulation. The core of our approach relies on iteratively solving a set-covering formulation, which we call the Robust Crew Recovery Problem, which encapsulates this flexibility notion for reserve crew usage. A tailored branch-and-price algorithm is developed for solving the Robust Crew Recovery Problem to optimality. The corresponding pricing problem is efficiently solved by a newly developed pulse algorithm. Based on actual data from a medium-sized hub-and-spoke airline, we show that embracing our approach leads to fewer flight cancellations and fewer last-minute alterations, compared to repairing disrupted schedules without considering our robust measure.",1366-5545,Not found
Freight transport using additional railcars attached to intercity passenger trains with transshipment and railcar circulation: Tabu-search-based Lagrangian heuristic,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103287,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Developing under-exploited passenger rail networks is emerging as an alternative for freight transport. In light of this, we investigate a long-haul freight mode in which additional railcars for carrying shipments are attached to passenger trains, and the shipments can transfer among the trains at intermediate stops. To coordinate space–time schedules of shipments and railcars, we construct a two-level space–time network: one level captures the departure, transshipment, and arrival of shipments; whereas the other level depicts the holding, reshuffling, and repositioning of railcars. Incorporating variables of space–time arc selection and constraints concerning shipment (un-) loading, locomotive pulling capacity, supply–demand coupling, and flow conservation on networks, a binary integer model is established to minimize the total travel cost of both railcars and shipments. The primal problem is decomposed using Lagrangian relaxation. Lagrangian multipliers and dual bounds are approximated by solving the Lagrangian dual.

A micro-economic model of the market uptake of truck platooning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103269,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Truck platooning is a technology allowing trucks to travel in convoy formation using wireless communications and advanced driver assistance systems. This technology is expected to increase road safety and capacity, and to decrease fuel consumption and GHG emissions; it comes with apparently important financial benefits and positive externalities. However, forecasting the market uptake of platooning is a complex economic issue, requiring a dedicated methodology. From a micro-economic standpoint, several features of truck platooning are important. First, forming a platoon implies a coordination cost. Second, platooning requires trucks with specific and costly equipment. That makes platooning a two-layer problem. Third, the decision of one carrier depends on those of other carriers: truck platooning, as a market, is characterized with network externalities. Fourth, road freight transportation is a heterogeneous system: different vehicles follow different operation patterns. This paper submits a micro-economic model of the uptake of platooning which accounts for all of the above points. First, a conditional sub-model of platoon formation is designed, where two trucks decide whether to form a platoon or not based on the net monetary benefits of doing so. Then, platoon formation is modeled in a simplified, single road context, as a Markov chain. At that stage, the share of platoonable trucks entering the market is obtained with a numerical, dynamic model. Upgrading conventional trucks to become compatible with platooning is assumed impossible. The paper concludes that due to the positive feedback loop of network externalities, market uptake is very sensitive to the economic assumptions. In addition, due to the equipment and coordination costs induced by platooning, the overall financial benefits for carriers are much lower than what they would initially appear to be; third, energy savings can be significant on the long run if the technology spreads widely.",1366-5545,Not found
A two-period game-theoretical model for heterogeneous ride-sourcing platforms with asymmetric competition and mixed fleets,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103279,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"In the current ride-sourcing market, significant differences generally exist among various platforms: market share, market position, and vehicle type. Most previous studies focus on symmetric duopoly competition and assume that platforms have similar market power and size. However, much less is known about the operation strategy and market outcome under platform heterogeneity and asymmetry. This paper proposes a two-period Stackelberg-based model to formulate the competition between two asymmetric ride-sourcing platforms and captures the differentiated decision-making sequence and driver utilities under mixed fleets. In the proposed model, the established leader platform operates a mixed fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) and gasoline vehicles (GVs), while the emerging follower platform adopts an all-EV fleet. The mathematical mechanism of how the follower's and leader's decisions impact the demand and supply is analytically derived. It is found that the influence path of the leader's pricing on the supply can be divided into direct and indirect ways. In some cases, the leader can utilize the leadership position to promote the electrification of ride-sourcing services. The impact of potential EV and GV drivers on the platforms' optimal strategies and the surplus of passengers and drivers are also examined. We show that more potential EV drivers benefit both platforms, while fewer potential GV drivers are only conducive to the follower. Moreover, two extended models associated with entry deterrence, order-based wage, and additional profit are developed. The deterrence strategy of the leader platform indirectly accelerates ride-souring electrification and significantly reduces passengers' average waiting time. The economic analysis gains managerial insights into platform operations on the realistic asymmetric ride-sourcing market under transportation electrification.",1366-5545,Not found
Tramp ship routing and speed optimization with tidal berth time windows,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103268,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Tramp shipping companies need to schedule shipping routes and decide on appropriate speeds based on short-term demand. This task differs from traditional vehicle routing problems (VRPs) in that the ship may wait for the tide, which changes with time. The wait time is a nonlinear function of the load, and in this paper, we describe this kind of wait as the ship following a tidal berth time windows. Additionally, the speed of the ship affects both the wait time and the sailing cost. This paper proposes a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to tackle this problem. A branch-and-price framework is applied to solve the model efficiently, decomposing the model into a set partitioning master problem and an elementary shortest path subproblem. A labeling algorithm incorporating ship speed is developed to handle the subproblem, and further enhancements are made by optimizing the speed separately.

Equity is assumed to be respected because the First Planned First Served allocation is an endowment guaranteed to all flights and allocated for free.

Furthermore, the ITS Amap-related traffic efficiency has significant intermediary role on haze pollution mitigation for all cities. And traffic efficiency has positive spatial spillover on haze pollution mitigation in its neighboring cities. Specifically, the ITS Amap-related traffic efficiency is higher and more stable in both the Yangtze River Delta and Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei cities.

Coordinated traffic control of urban networks with dynamic entrance holding for mixed CAV traffic,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103264,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Traffic congestion has been regarded as one of the most challenging problems in the urban transportation systems. The problem becomes trickier at traffic bottlenecks where the heavy traffic flow spills over and over-saturation appears, and the coordination of traffic control strategies in a network scale is required. With the information availability and control precision enabled by connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, this study proposes a network-level traffic coordination method with dynamic entrance holding in a mixed CAV traffic, and establishes a two-layer framework to develop traffic control strategies to handle the over-saturation problem. In the upper layer, the coordination of signal control among intersections is optimized to minimize travel cost within the network. The upper bound of travel delays under the control strategy is theoretically derived and the critical traffic volume is specified for designing the entrance holding strategy. To accelerate the solving process, a two-stage solution method along with a series of valid inequations are developed, and the feasibility and optimality of the solution are investigated. In the lower layer, a dynamic entrance holding strategy is put forward to regulate the entering traffic at network perimeters to avoid over-saturation and improve traffic orderliness. To enhance the holding effectiveness, a traffic prediction method is created to capture the future traffic evolution based on the real-time information, and combined with the flow reservation mechanism to proactively adjust the holding strategy in real time. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodologies, and compare with other control strategies.

Integrated ground vehicle and drone routing with simultaneous surveillance coverage for evading intentional disruption,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103266,178,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The purpose of this study is to examine the use of drones to provide transportation security during times of intentional disruption. Due to the nature of valuable goods, their transportation is always associated with certain risks, necessitating implementing security measures to ensure the transportation process’s security. This study aimed to address the security of valuable goods transportation by proposing a new routing problem using drones termed integrated routing and surveillance (IRS) for ground and aerial vehicles operating in dynamic environments. This approach addresses the problem of deliberate disruption in the planning and implementation phases. Risks are estimated during the planning phase using historical data, and routing is designed to minimize risk and travel costs. Drones conduct online surveillance of the solution routes generated during the planning phase throughout the implementation phase. Ground vehicles are only permitted to enter a link if drones assess the risks before their entry. Drones’ arrival times for this assessment of each ground link are determined by non-predefined time windows. Drones can visit multiple ground links if their time windows overlap in the proposed problem. If the drones detect a suspicious agent, they will perform dynamic replanning to avoid the risk source.

While several modeling approaches and efficient solution algorithms have been proposed for various problem variations, the utilization of decomposition techniques in exact mathematical programming methods has been the most effective. Surprisingly, none of these techniques have taken advantage of the repeating patterns inherent in the problem. We start with a recently proposed compact model that is well-designed and can be exploited in a primal (Benders) decomposition technique, although it cannot be directly used to solve a practical-sized problem. We show that its modeling deficiencies can be fixed and propose a Benders decomposition framework together with several Alternative Objective Functions (AOFs) to generate customized Benders cuts, along with other valid inequalities that can be identified and separated. A classifier is trained to identify the most efficient AOF to use at different stages of the Benders iterations, to help avoid saturation of the master problem with dominated Benders cuts.

In this paper, we first develop analytical models based on the mean–variance theory to investigate a two-level supply chain’s optimal decisions in four scenarios (i.e., without and with DIS and BA). Furthermore, we examine the impacts of supply chain members’ DIS and BA decisions and risk attitude on consumer surplus and social welfare. Lastly, we extend our models to explore a general scenario, i.e., we consider the presence of imperfect information sharing, privacy-conscious consumers, consumer carbon sensitivity differences, carbon cap-and-trade regulations, and inflexible blockchain deployments. We find that retailers should consider more crucial factors (e.g., demand uncertainties and the risk sensitivity of supply chain members) rather than simply focus on the type (i.e., high- or low-type) of demand before sharing demand information. Moreover, DIS and BA practices can not only improve the business performance of supply chain members but also contribute to the circular economy and sustainability. Then, DIS practices can minimize the manufacturers’ misjudgments about the timing of BA.

The impact of consumer skepticism on blockchain-enabled sustainability disclosure in a supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103323,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The growing recognition of sustainable supply chain practices is indisputable. Nevertheless, consumer skepticism regarding the credibility of product sustainability information, which includes environmental impact and social responsibility, poses a significant challenge. Blockchain-enabled disclosure has surfaced as a promising approach to address this skepticism. In this paper, a game-theoretical model is developed to investigate the investment strategy in blockchain-enabled disclosure within a supply chain composed of one retailer and two manufacturers, each selling products with varying levels of sustainability. Considering consumer skepticism, we assume that consumers who trust sustainability information are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products, while skeptical consumers are not. Our analysis suggests that blockchain-enabled disclosure can effectively increase consumer trust in sustainability information and promote sustainable practices. However, our findings reveal a potential pitfall: intensified market competition between manufacturers, leading to reduced profits for both, while the retailer persistently benefits from blockchain-enabled disclosure. Furthermore, we find non-monotonic effects of consumer skepticism on retailer and manufacturer profits, with certain conditions resulting in a decreased likelihood of investing in blockchain-enabled disclosure as skepticism increases. Lastly, we examine the government-mandated disclosure policy, illustrating that such policy can generate a win–win situation for society and the environment by improving social welfare and environmental performance.",1366-5545,Not found
A spatio-functional logistics profile clustering analysis method for metropolitan areas,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103312,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This paper proposes a framework to define a zoning procedure using clustering taking into account socio-economic, spatial and logistics intensity variables to support urban logistics planning and management decision making. The methodology is centered around comparing two dimension reduction algorithms (PCA and UMAP) and four clustering algorithms ( k -means, affinity propagation, HDBSCAN, and SOM). This comparison is based on combinations of dimension reduction and clustering techniques, assessing the results for geographic coherence, patterns that are captured and the statistical validity of the clustering results. The variables used in the clustering are defined from socio-economic, geographic and demographic data issued from standard sources, and a logistics intensity estimation via freight trip generation (FTG models). Within its application to Lima, Peru, results show that the choice of the FTG model, the main logistics intensity variable, has a strong impact on the final composition of the logistics profile and also on ensuring a geographical sense of the clustering results. Finally, research, policy, and practical implications are discussed, as well as future research stemming from these results.",1366-5545,Not found
The maximal detour liner shipping hub location problem: Improving the applicability of the p-hub center problem,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103330,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This paper investigates a novel maximal detour hub location problem arising in liner shipping, referred to as a maximal detour liner shipping hub location problem, which can be regarded as a novel p-hub center problem. Different from conventional formulations of the p-hub center problem, both cost and service can be kept at a good level based on our investigated problem, although economic objectives are not considered in our problem. By considering origin–destination (OD) path based detour and sub-path based detours, we propose three mixed-integer linear programming models for our problem. The proposed formulations with sub-path based detours can be efficiently solved by CPLEX. To efficiently solve our formulation with OD path based detour, we propose an improved Benders decomposition algorithm, where the inspection strategy, the heuristic strategy and the multi-cut strategy are developed for improving algorithm efficiency.

Supplier versus platform bundling: Optimal strategies under agency selling,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103325,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This study explores the bundling decisions in a two-tier supply chain with an upstream supplier and a downstream platform and discusses the consequential implications of bundling on profit distribution between the supplier and the platform. We reveal how the supplier’s marginal cost and the platform’s commission rate determine bundling strategies when they are initiated at the upstream and downstream stages. When the marginal cost is moderate and the commission rate is high, both the supplier and the platform are incentivized to adopt bundling in order to optimize per-unit margins and overall channel demand. However, a high (resp. low or high) marginal cost and a low (resp. high) commission rate prompt only the supplier (resp. platform) to bundle. Furthermore, we highlight the critical role of the initiating party, i.e., supplier or platform, in profit allocation within the supply chain. Bundling, whether initiated by suppliers or platforms, invariably benefits suppliers. Interestingly, platform-initiated bundling yields greater supplier benefits by enabling higher retail prices without compromising demand. However, the platform’s gains from bundling are confined to specific cost configurations; for example, when the supplier’s cost is low, platform bundling can hurt the platform due to the discounted prices to counter the supplier’s high-pricing strategy. Furthermore, we find that both supplier- and platform-initiated bundling often increases the total supply chain profit, especially when the total supplier’s cost is relatively high.",1366-5545,Not found
Blessing or curse? Impact of incomplete information in a networked cournot competition,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103327,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Networked markets are prevalently seen in different industries. Current research mainly focuses on settings with a transparent network. However, in many applications, firms choose their actions without fully knowing their competitors’ information. This study examines oligopolies in networked markets when firms’ production costs are incomplete information. We characterize the unique Bayesian equilibrium supply quantities for any given network under incomplete information. Our results connect the equilibrium outcome with the underlying competition and information structures. We find that when the production cost of a firm is high, incomplete information helps increase its total production quantity. In contrast, the impact is the opposite in the presence of low production costs. However, the impact of incomplete information on a firm’s supply allocation on each edge depends not only on its production cost but also on the network position of the edge. We also find that, unlike the case in single-market, the low-cost firm always suffers from incomplete information, while the high-cost firm benefits from incomplete information only under certain conditions. Moreover, we show that changes in global network structure that do not directly relate to a firm may alter its information preference. We study several extensions and find that not only do firms with cost advantage prefer complete information, but those high-cost firms with smaller cost disadvantages are also more likely to prefer a transparent competition environment. The case of heterogeneous logistic costs is also considered, and we show that for firms of high-cost type, the logistic cost advantage may hedge its benefit from incomplete information. Our findings imply that a firm has to consider not only its own cost type and local competition but also the global network structure to determine its preference for information structure. Moreover, our results may be helpful to the market regulator that, when promoting information transparency, firms with better production technology are more likely to support the movement.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimizing the emission control policies and trade-in program effects: A carbon-constrained closed-loop supply chain network model,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103311,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Economic development and human activities affect the natural environment severely. The government has promogulated several policies such as carbon caps and trading scheme, government subsidies, and green credit to control emissions. Accordingly, enterprises should profit on the premise of undertaking social responsibilities, green technology and trade-in programs are two ways to benefit the environment. However, the interaction between regulations and emission abatement measures is largely unknown. A carbon-constrained closed-loop supply chain network model is proposed to discuss the joint effect of the policies and operational measures. The model is constructed under two scenarios, i.e., Manufacturer-led mode and Retailer-led mode. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to compare the scenarios. The results show that although the retailer-led mode promotes resource recovery and supply chain performance, it weakens manufacturers’ profit. We find that the carbon caps and trading scheme is effective in emission reduction when the initial carbon quota is relatively less, which indicates the importance of carbon caps allocation method. The government subsidies stimulate green manufacturers to do more emission reduction efforts enhancing sustainability. The subsidy on green products has more obvious effect on coordinating economic and environmental targets. We also reveal environmental awareness positively affects the emission abatement level. Finally, we extend our models to two special cases with (i) generalization of customers and (ii) different production cost function forms. The main conclusions remain valid in the special cases. The theoretically derived conclusions contribute to the operational research literature and will guide policymakers and enterprises in the manufacturing industry.",1366-5545,Not found
Pricing and sales-effort coordination facing free riding behaviors between a brick-and-mortar retailer and a platform store owned by the manufacturer,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103285,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"We study a two-channel supply chain with a brick-and-mortar (BM) retailer, a manufacturer, and an e-commerce platform (ECP) store owned by the manufacturer. Some customers may physically examine the product in the BM store before buying from the ECP store. The so-called free-riding or showrooming effect lowers the BM retailer’s desired level of sales effort. To coordinate the BM retailer’s sales effort decision, we design a price-match and bi-directional compensation contract. In one direction, the BM retailer matches the lower ECP price to consumers with the proof and then receives partial compensation from the manufacturer for each unit sold with price match; in the other direction, the BM retailer shares with the manufacturer the revenue of each product sold with regular price. This contract is easy to implement because similar to the widely adopted revenue sharing contract, it only requires the BM retailer to reveal the sales information to the manufacturer and the bi-directional compensation mechanism provides good protection for both parties. We develop an extended Hotelling model to examine the performance of the contact. We show that this contract can fully coordinate the supply chain with exogenous prices through an analytical study, and it can achieve Pareto improvement in the endogenous pricing scenario numerically.",1366-5545,Not found
Choice of the co-opetition model for a new energy vehicle supply chain under government subsidies,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103326,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"We study the co-opetition model selection problem for a new energy vehicle (NEV) supply chain comprising a dominant manufacturer and a subordinate supplier. Given the impact of R&D subsidies on suppliers’ technological innovation, we consider two co-opetition models, namely wholesale co-opetition and patent licensing co-opetition, derive the optimal decisions of the models, and analyze the optimal selections for supply chain members. We also conduct extensive numerical studies to verify the research findings and generate practical insights. We find that patent licensing co-opetition is not necessarily beneficial to supply chain members. However, under certain conditions, patent licensing co-opetition can create a “win-win” situation for the supply chain. Furthermore, as the degree of product substitution increases under patent licensing co-opetition, the optimal retail prices of the manufacturer and supplier both decrease first and then increase, but their thresholds are different. In addition, the R&D cost coefficient positively affects the fixed cost of patent usage, but it does not affect the unit patent licensing fee. This study provides theoretical guidance for supply chain members to choose the optimal co-opetition models and has important practical significance for promoting the sustainable development of the NEV industry.",1366-5545,Not found
Recycling channel design and coordination in a reverse supply chain with customer green preference,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103329,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This study investigates the selection of recycling mode and the coordination mechanism in a reverse supply chain (RSC) that consists of one remanufacturer, one traditional recycler, and one smart recycler. We characterize the collection cost differences between traditional recycling and smart recycling, and the scrap rate of used products by smart recycling. We consider three recycling modes with recycling pricing competition, conditional on whether the remanufacturer collaborates with the traditional recycler, with the smart recycler, or with both recyclers. We show that the optimal recycling channel strategy for the remanufacturer is to enroll both the traditional recycler and the smart recycler, and the competition between these two recyclers exerts some non-trial implications on the firms’ equilibrium pricing strategy and profitability. By comparing the equilibrium outcomes with a centralized system, we further develop two coordination contracts: a two-part tariff contract and a transfer price combined with a profit-sharing contract, both of which can effectively mitigate double marginalization and improve the supply chain’s overall performance. Our findings provide useful guidance for the design of recycling channels, and for the coordination of RSC members to achieve Pareto improvement.",1366-5545,Not found

However, the fierce environmental problems associated with human activities and economic development cannot be neglected. To systematically analyze the research status and development trend of the maritime industry, this paper collects and reviews literature from Elsevier ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases related to green shipping management and green port construction. Future research directions are presented based on the analysis. The results show that green shipping management focus on solving practical emission reduction problems. Most work of green port construction establish mathematical optimization models aiming at minimizing total operation costs or maximizing profits. Designing efficient algorithms is a research hotspot in operation management. By comparing the technical measures, operational strategy, and market-based measures, we found technical innovation is the ultimate way for the maritime industry to realize net zero-emission. Support from governments and organizations is the insurance of green development. Future research perspectives include adopting high-tech technologies such as blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligent to improve operation efficiency and reduce emissions, providing more accurate suggestions for constructing green and smart ports, proposing multi-objective optimization models and highlighting the environmental target.

Triad structure impact on the triad resources-firm performance relationship: Theory and empirical evidence,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103299,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Logistics triads are an emerging research setting, yet there is little theoretical and empirical understanding of how triad structure impacts triad resources and buying firm performance relationship. This study first develops a typology of triad structure (asymmetric, balanced, symmetric triads). Based on the theories of the resource-based view of the firm, balance theory, and equity theory, this study empirically investigates how each triad structure impacts the triad resources-firm performance relationship. It uses three firm performance metrics: financial, operational, and market. It also tests whether environmental complexity and uncertainty affect the triad structure. The study collected empirical data via a survey of 267 matched supplier-3PL pairs for the same buying firms in three countries: the UK, France, and Greece. Group hierarchical regression models analysed the effects of each triad structure on the triad resources-firm performance relationship. Findings show that each triad structure has different effects on buying firm performance. Symmetric triads outperform other triads in operational performance. Asymmetric triads have a positive impact on financial performance. Findings also uncover significant differences among triadic resources. The study presents several novelties resulting in important theoretical and managerial implications, including exposing theoretical contradictions about the role of triad structure on firm performance and integrating the three theories to understand the links between resources-structure-performance. This study’s findings indicate that all firms in a triad can strategise their resources to yield market, financial, and operational benefits.",1366-5545,Not found
Signaling strategies in a low-carbon supply chain with platform encroachment,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103319,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Information asymmetry and e-commerce platform encroachment affect the production and sales strategies of manufacturers, wherein sales information is an effective signal to realize information disclosure. Meanwhile, the low-carbon characteristics of products provide manufacturers with an alternative signal option. We establish a dynamic signaling game model in which a manufacturer sells green products through a platform and the sales potential of the product is unknown to the platform in the first stage. The platform encroaches on the manufacturer with high sales potential (HM) in the second stage. This encroachment behavior prompts the HM to disguise itself as a manufacturer with low sales potential (LM) to evade platform encroachment, thereby aggravating information asymmetry. We explore the signals that the LM should use to separate itself from the HM more efficiently and the optimal low-carbon production strategies under three signaling strategies (i.e., sales, carbon, and dual signals). We reveal that the carbon signal gives the HM a stronger motivation to disguise itself than the sales signal, thereby increasing the LM’s separating costs but decreasing the environmental impact. In addition, the LM should choose the sales signal in a high-quality market; in contrast, the dual (carbon) signal is optimal in a general (low-quality) market.

This is what's in store for you: How online social learning affects product positioning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103317,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Customers can share their opinions on the Internet, and this online sharing affects customers’ quality expectations, their purchasing decisions, and firms’ product positioning such as price and quality decisions. In this study, we examine product positioning in monopolistic, competitive, and collusive markets, where companies must address the social learning of customers. We apply a multi-agent model to simulate the learning process and the product positioning of companies as a gaming process via particle swarm optimization. We find that the optimal policies are highly dependent on market status and the level of customers’ ex-ante quality uncertainty. Specifically, in the absence of competition, social learning can help a monopolistic company gain higher profits by offering low quality products at a low (high) price in environments of low (high) uncertainty. However, duopoly competition leads to reduced prices and lower quality designs in general, except for a low degree of uncertainty. Social learning intensifies the competition between companies, and without it, competition is moderated through differentiated price and quality decisions. Under duopoly competition, a company with high uncertainty deviation benefits more from social learning by adopting a low-price-low-quality strategy, outperforming a competitor with low deviation. Finally, while collusion typically leads to higher prices and benefits for companies compared to duopoly competition, it may hurt the companies when the effects of social learning are small.",1366-5545,Not found
Maximizing truck platooning participation with preferences,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103297,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Truck platooning refers to trucks traveling in convoy with longitudinal proximity. By reducing aerodynamic drag, platooning cuts truck energy use and operating cost along with other benefits to the freight transportation system. This research proposes a platform-based platooning system to maximize the participation of truck platooning considering stability of the formed platoons that arises from truck preferences of platooning partners. Preference-based platooning is of both scientific interest and practical importance to the trucking sector, which is highly fragmented especially in the US. The preferences depend on the benefits of fuel saving and schedule adjustment to coordinate the time for platoon formation. The formed platoons are stable in the sense that no two trucks in two platoons want to break away from their current platoons and platoon with each other. Tackling this operation planning problem, the proposed system involves a platform interacting with individual trucks in a way that reduces truck communication and computation burdens, mitigates truck privacy concerns, and overcomes trucks misreporting private information. The central methodological investigation of the interactive process is on how to solve the Maximum Stable Truck Platooning Participation (MS-TPP) problem, for which a two-phase algorithmic approach is proposed. The underlying idea of this approach is to progressively reduce the lengths of truck preference lists, by eliminating truck pairs that do not affect the MS-TPP solution presence and separating trucks in odd rotations – which are key constructs in this approach – from the rest of the truck population. Theoretical properties and computational complexity of this two-phase algorithmic approach are investigated, along with a comparison with an integer programming approach and extensive numerical experiments in the context of a northern Illinois road network in the US. We find that the proposed two-phase algorithmic approach is very efficient compared to the integer programming approach in forming a maximum number of truck platoons while ensuring stability. In addition, the percentage of trucks that end up platooning by solving MS-TPP is much greater than using a greedy approach. The algorithmic approach is computationally scalable for solving large problem instances. The advantages of MS-TPP, in terms of the percentage of trucks in platooning and the average utility gain, become even more prominent as we deal with a larger system with more trucks.",1366-5545,Not found
Similarity-based bus services assignment with capacity constraint for staggered bus stops,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103315,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The assignment of bus services to appropriate stops is a crucial parameter in ensuring a high level of service for commuters at staggered bus stops. In this study, an innovative similarity-based assignment method is proposed to assign a set of bus services to a set of stop areas in such a configuration, while considering the capacity constraint of the bus stop areas. First, a new concept of the time series of bus stop occupancy is introduced to dynamically track if a bus stop is occupied by a specific bus service. Then, a dynamic time warping-based algorithm is proposed to measure the similarity level of the time series of bus stop occupancy between different bus services. Considering both capacity constraint and performance of similarity level at each bus stop area, bus services assignment can be modelled as a Pareto efficiency problem. We can trade off within the Pareto efficient solutions and determine the best assignment scheme. Finally, the performance of our proposed method is evaluated using data collected from four staggered bus stops in Singapore. To evaluate the model’s stability and reliability, sensitivity analyses are conducted to test the effect of (i) pre-defined bus arrival rate, (ii) time interval used for creating the time series of bus stop occupancy, and (iii) day of week on staggered bus stop performance.

Customers and suppliers may pay a commission to gain access to the service and drivers are granted a wage for providing their delivery service. This study characterizes the properties of three-side on-demand delivery markets, and proposes pricing strategies that enable the platform to manipulate the market towards profit or social welfare maximizing outcomes. We consider earning-sensitive independent drivers, price-and-time-sensitive customers, and price-sensitive suppliers. By assuming that all players are heterogeneous in their valuation of the service, we model their numbers as endogenously dependent on the price, wage, and commission of the platform. We also use the continuum approximation of the vehicle routing problem to derive customer waiting times. Our analyses show that suppliers internalize a portion of the driver wage, and the customers internalize the supplier commission. However, the platform requests lower commissions and offers a higher wage in social welfare maximization compared to profit maximization, which yields a negative profit for the platform in social welfare maximization. Moreover, we validate the results of the analytical model with numerical experiments on more realistic cases.",1366-5545,Not found

Government subsidies promote the remanufacturing activities, and their effects are examined on optimal remanufacturing and pricing decisions for competitive and collaborative models under CPR legislation. The result highlights that competition with IRs under the CPR legislation system within oligopoly market scenarios is profitable for OEMs. Furthermore, the result indicates that a competitive business model increases consumer surplus, increasing used products collection and remanufacturing.

Towards efficient airline disruption recovery with reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103295,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Disruptions to airline schedules precipitate flight delays/cancellations and significant losses for airline operations. The goal of the integrated airline recovery problem is to develop an operational tool that provides the airline with an instant and cost-effective solution concerning aircraft, crew members and passengers in face of the emerging disruptions. In this paper, we formulate a decision recommendation framework which incorporates various recovery decisions including aircraft and crew rerouting, passenger reaccommodation, departure holding, flight cancellation and cruise speed control. Given the computational hardness of solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP) model by the commercial solver (e.g., CPLEX), we establish a novel solution framework by incorporating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm with well-designed neighborhood structures and state evaluator. We utilize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train the stochastic policy exploited to select neighborhood operations given the current state throughout the Markov Decision Process (MDP). Experimental results show that the objective value generated by our approach is within a 1.5% gap with respect to the optimal/close-to-optimal objective of the CPLEX solver for the small-scale instances, with significant improvement regarding runtime. The pre-trained DRL agent can leverage features/weights obtained from the training process to accelerate the arrival of objective convergence and further improve solution quality, which exhibits the potential of achieving Transfer Learning (TL).

A variable neighborhood search heuristic for real-time barge scheduling in a river-to-sea channel with tidal restrictions,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103280,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The scheduling of barge transportation in narrow channels is critical to transportation efficiency, especially when the tide exists and affects the channel navigation of barges. Barge movements in channels are frequently correlated with other activities (e.g., berth allocation) and must thus be considered concurrently.

In this study, we examine the barge scheduling problem arising from a river-to-sea channel with tidal restrictions in the real world, where barges’ loading and unloading operations are placed at both ends of the navigation channel and must be planned and coordinated with their channel movements. To reduce the overall completion time for all barges, we develop a mixed integer linear programming model with several valid inequalities. To satisfy the second-level computational efficiency requirement, a straightforward yet efficient variable neighborhood search algorithm is proposed. Real-world case studies based on a barge transportation project in Boffa, Guinea are conducted. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is applicable for efficient decision-making and effective in assisting barges to avoid missing feasible tide windows by slightly altering the first-come-first-serve schedule of the barges.

Estimating intercity heavy truck mobility flows using the deep gravity framework,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103320,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Accurate estimation of intercity heavy truck mobility flows is of vital importance to urban planning, transportation management and logistics operations. The inaccessibility of big data related to intercity transport systems and the heterogeneity of trucking activities pose challenges for the reliable estimation. Recently, the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a potential solution to this problem. However, most previous studies focused on the estimation of inter-regional passenger mobility. In-depth studies of estimating intercity heavy truck mobility flows by using deep learning techniques are still scarce. To fill in the gaps, we construct a deep neural network based on the Deep Gravity framework, an advanced predictive model for human mobility. We collect a wide range of data related to heavy truck movements, freight locations, road networks and land uses to train the model, and validate its high performance by comparing to traditional gravity model. Furthermore, we use an explainable AI technique to interpret how the city features contribute to the determination of intercity heavy truck movements, and the results can provide valuable policy implications for logistics operations, businesses and urban planning.",1366-5545,Not found
Multi-route coordination for bus systems in response to road disruptions,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103258,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Road disruptions frequently occur in practice, resulting in a productivity loss of bus services and widespread passenger delays. These negative impacts are significant, especially when multiple routes are influenced at the same time. In order to mitigate these impacts, this paper proposes a multi-route coordination approach that collaboratively adjusts multiple bus routes and optimizes bus timetables to provide effective alternative bus services for passengers. Three adjusting strategies are adopted for bus routes with varying passenger demand: detouring, short-running, and cancellation. To address the multi-route coordination problem, a column-generation-based two-stage framework is developed. Concretely, a column generation technique is utilized in the first stage to iteratively generate candidate adaptive bus routes and passenger paths. Following that, an integrated integer programming model is built in the second stage to simultaneously determine bus timetables and the combinations of those adaptive bus routes. After realizing the low computational efficiency for large-scale problems, this paper designs a customized decomposition algorithm based on set partitioning to solve the presented model and obtain near-optimal solutions efficiently. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to an illustrative Sioux Falls network and a real-world bus network in Beijing to verify its validity and effectiveness. Three comparative analyses are conducted to discuss the advantages of the three adjusting strategies, to investigate the benefits of coordinating bus timetables, and to explore the applicability of different adjusting strategies, respectively.",1366-5545,Not found
A two-stage chance constrained stochastic programming model for emergency supply distribution considering dynamic uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103296,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This paper presents a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges of designing a reliable emergency logistics network under the dynamic uncertainty of natural disasters. The proposed multimodal transportation strategy based on level assignments can effectively mitigate the risk of facility disruptions and network uncertainty and enhance the adaptability of the system to diverse emergency supplies. The established two-stage chance constrained stochastic programming model and improved evolutionary algorithm are powerful tools for optimizing the network design and improving its resilience. Based on the real-world case of the Ya’an earthquake in China, the impacts of various practical constraints are analyzed. Several insights into the decision-making process of emergency logistics management are provided: managers should prioritize time utility over cost utility and use multiple aircraft and helicopters, supplies should be sorted into fewer and more important categories and placed in smaller packages for efficient transportation, multimodal transportation should be considered based on geographical and traffic conditions.",1366-5545,Not found
The determinants of online matching platforms for freight services,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103284,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"With the development of information technology and the success of E-commerce, online freight exchange platforms have expanded to trucking freight services by matching truckers with shippers directly. Despite the endeavors of online freight platforms to emulate the success of other platform services, they face difficulties in facilitating successful matches. By analyzing the transactional data of an existing freight service platform, we seek to identify the salient factors that improve platform matching rates using a linear regression with splines for freight rate, capturing non-linearities, and a RUM discrete outcome model for matching. Both models are estimated jointly (simultaneously) using full information maximum likelihood (FIML). The empirical findings indicate that successful matching is more likely if the online freight platforms allow making substantial price adjustments once a job has been posted, as well as allowing shippers to have a longer lead time for loading their shipments, particularly in cases where finding a suitable trucker is challenging. Furthermore, allowing customers to revise shipment information provides greater flexibility in accommodating customer needs and ultimately enhances the likelihood of successful matching. Our analysis provides actionable and pragmatic suggestions to improve matching rates for online platforms of freight services.",1366-5545,Not found
Channel power shift and store brand introduction,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103259,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The extant literature identifies the category characteristics that make a product category more suitable for introducing a store brand. However, it does not address the retailer characteristics that prompt a retailer to introduce a store brand. We investigate how the relative bargaining power of members within a distribution channel affects a retailer’s decision to introduce a store brand, motivated by anecdotal evidences. We develop a game theoretical model and show that as the retailer becomes more powerful compared to the manufacturer, the store brand becomes less appealing to the retailer. Additionally, as the retailer gains more power, the quality threshold for introducing the store brand becomes higher. Furthermore, as the power shifts from the manufacturer to the retailer in the distribution channel, the store brand’s market share and its value to the retailer decrease. We conduct an empirical analysis using six-year panel data on 31 product categories sold by 107 retailers to test the key predictions of the analytical model.

We propose a novel path-based reward credit scheme to provide commuter incentives with the goal of reducing traffic congestion. We consider that a known proportion of commuters subscribe to this reward credit scheme and may earn credits when traveling in the network. We introduce a bilevel optimization formulation to determine optimal non-additive, path-based reward credits under traffic equilibrium conditions. In this formulation, the follower problem is a parameterized user equilibrium traffic assignment problem with two classes of users and non-additive path costs. We develop a single-level reformulation based on its first-order optimality conditions and derive theoretical properties of the reward credit scheme. Customized branch-and-bound algorithms are designed to solve the problem. We also introduce a heuristic approach that repeatedly solves parameterized follower problems to enhance scalability. We report numerical results that demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed methods over a benchmarking approach. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this path-based reward credit scheme compared with a link-based subsidy pricing scheme. We find that, on average, under a limited budget and a user participation level of at least 40%, the proposed path-based incentive mechanism yields larger reductions in traffic congestion over link-based approaches.",1366-5545,Not found
Distributionally robust production and replenishment problem for hydrogen supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103293,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"This study investigates a two-stage production and replenishment problem for the hydrogen supply chain (HSC), where the uncertainty of demand and the risk of pipeline disruptions are simultaneously considered. We model this problem by adopting a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach. Before realizing the demands, the decision-maker decides the hydrogen production, storage, and truck-transported replenishment policies. Then, after demands and pipeline working status are realized, the pipeline-transported replenishment policy is determined in response to the first-stage decisions. The replenishment policies are determined under differentiated service level requirements. In addition, we characterize the uncertainty and correlation of demands through a factor-based model approach to accommodate the uncertainty of the distribution of demand factors. To solve the proposed model, we propose a column and constraint generation (CCG) algorithm, which can terminate in finite iterations. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we verify that the proposed model outperforms classical benchmark models in terms of total costs and are more robust. Finally, we examine the impact of the replenishment structure on the performance of the HSC and the computational efficiency of the proposed CCG algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found

This is a system in which part of the goods to be delivered into a city can be transferred to specific subway stations in advance (e.g., during the night) using underground logistics. During the day, vehicles can then be replenished at these subway stations. In our study, we investigate how a system of this kind affects the decisions to be made by a logistics service provider. We introduce the vehicle routing problem with underground logistics to model how to find the best vehicle routes and goods transfer plan in this system. First, we formulate this problem as a mixed integer linear model. Then, we propose a problem-customized adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic algorithm to solve it.

Integrated multimodal freight service network design and pricing with a competing service integrator and heterogeneous shipper classes,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103290,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"In recent years, the highly fragmented multimodal transport offer in several countries has required the integration of these services by logistics service integrators (LSIs). The challenge for LSIs is to set up multimodal transport corridors that can respond efficiently to the heterogeneous demand of shippers and that are cost- and price-competitive against other transport solutions. We develop a bi-level programming model to assess the corridor’s pricing and the service network design simultaneously. In the upper level, the model maximizes the profit of the LSI by designing the service network and implementing shipment-based pricing for paths adapted to the heterogeneous demand for transport services. In the lower level, the total cost of shippers in the network who choose services according to their preferences is minimized. We solve the model using reformulation and linearization techniques. Computational experiments based on the real-world case of the New Western Land-Sea Corridor in China are conducted to demonstrate the proposed model and to draw managerial insights. The results show that the shipment-based pricing strategy is beneficial for the LSI to obtain profit increases when considering the shippers’ heterogeneous preferences on time and reliability. The results also revealed that the service design and pricing decisions of the LSI are not only related to operational costs but also depend on the competitors’ offers in the market. Moreover, the impact of the level of frequency discretization, waiting time cost, the penalty cost for not fully utilized services, and the generalized cost of the no-purchase option on the decisions of the LSI are also investigated in the sensitivity analysis.",1366-5545,Not found
Warehouses without aisles: Layout design of a multi-deep rack climbing robotic system,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103281,179,2023-11-01,2023,11,"In the last decade, different multi-deep rack climbing robotic (MRR) systems have been introduced, particularly in e-commerce warehouses. These systems have great benefits, as aisles are no longer needed, allowing a high storage density on a small footprint. They only need vertical channels through which battery-powered robots can climb the racks, retrieve totes from any desired position, and bring them to a workstation. This paper studies two novel MRR system layouts: the cross and the compact layout. In addition, we compare performance with the more traditional aisle-based layout. The system performance, particularly operational cost and energy consumption, depends on these system layouts. The paper establishes queuing network models to investigate the trade-off between storage capacity and throughput of the system with these three layouts, taking robot blocking prevention into account. We compare the throughput, storage density, horizontal travel time, and energy consumption of the system. The results show that, in most cases, the compact layout outperforms other layouts on throughput. For energy consumption, the choice of layout depends on the footprint. We formulate a model to assist warehouse managers in choosing a layout of minimum annual operational cost, with a required storage and throughput capacity. We also compare the MRR system with an alternative robotic compact storage and retrieval system on operational cost and energy consumption. The MRR system appears to always have lower energy consumption and operational cost.",1366-5545,Not found

We present a two-stage, stochastic multi-period model that minimizes both expected unmet demand and costs associated with operating emergency response facilities and distributing relief supplies, taking into account evolving road conditions as well as the closure and relocation of temporary relief facilities. To address the computational intractability inherent in large-scale mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), we implement an accelerated branch-and-Benders-cut algorithm, facilitating efficient problem-solving processes. We validate this approach through extensive numerical analysis and its application to a real-world scenario, demonstrating its superiority over deterministic methods, especially when considering the trade-off between nominal operational costs and out-of-sample reliability. Results show that dynamically adjusting the number of operating facilities and their locations may enhance cost efficiency while decreasing unmet demand during the relief delivery process as the transportation network changes with time. Additionally, we show that utilizing stochastic models for decision-making can substantially hedge against demand uncertainty, both in meeting demand and reducing operational costs.

The bright side of outside market entry with manufacturer encroachment,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103358,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"This study discusses the possible benefits of inviting entrants for downstream retailers when facing the encroachment of their upstream manufacturers. We consider a model comprising one retailer, one manufacturer, and one potential entrant. The manufacturer decides whether to encroach or supply the retailer; The retailer decides whether to help a third-party firm overcome its entry barrier. We show that whether firms compete in quantity or price, the manufacturer, in the presence of an entrant, may choose to supply the retailer even if the retailer does not offer any advantages in terms of cost efficiency in retailing or channel differentiation. This is because, in such a scenario, the manufacturer treats the retailer as a strategic collaborator to either restrict the entrant’s market share or alleviate the downstream competition. In other words, triggering the intra-brand competition against the retailer may help the manufacturer perform better in the inter-brand competition against the entrant. On the other hand, the retailer may intentionally prompt entry to trigger inter-brand competition to avoid being foreclosed by the manufacturer and obtain a favorable procurement condition.",1366-5545,Not found

However, ambient temperature significantly affects energy consumption, posing challenges in providing adequate energy supply, especially in cold regions. In this study, we propose a double-battery configuration approach for EBs operating in cold regions with substantial temperature variations between seasons. The method involves utilizing a higher-capacity battery during winter months and a lower-capacity battery for summer operations. To determine the optimal fleet size, battery capacities, and EB scheduling plans in both winter and summer seasons, we formulate an integer programming model, focusing on minimizing the fleet's average annual operating costs (OC) and carbon emissions (CE). The model is solved using the branch and bound method. A case study is conducted, examining EB routes in 11 cold cities. Results reveal that the double-battery configuration method effectively reduces the fleet's average annual OC and CE. Specifically, the reduction ratio range for OC is from 3.34% to 5.18%, while the reduction ratio for CE ranges from 4.06% to 5.16%.",1366-5545,Not found
Would your company's resilience be internally viable after COVID-19 pandemic disruption?: A new PADRIC-based diagnostic methodology,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103183,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The current COVID-19 virus pandemic has created massive disruptions in supply, demand, and production in global supply chains (SCs). The outbreak has revealed the deficiencies of non-resilient SCs. Business prosperity and continuity require internal resilience capabilities (IRCs) and resiliency to supply or demand fluctuations that create disruption risk situations. This paper develops a new methodology for diagnosing and improving the strength of a company’s internal resilience. The huge disruptions caused by COVID-19 are first presented and reviewed. Then, a thorough state-of-the-art analysis was conducted to define supply chain risk management and supply chain resilience, and then to align the substantial contributions of this research to the literature. These insights are followed by presenting and defining IRCs to highlight their role towards resilient business. This research hereby presents a new IRCs-PADRIC (Preparedness, Agility, Development, Recovery, Innovation and Collaboration) framework from which a company’s current resilience healthiness can be diagnosed as being either Healthy, Groaning or Dying. These diagnoses are associated with proposed actions to be taken accordingly. An integrated grey Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)/Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution (MARCOS) approach is proposed to quantify the internal resiliency to enable a more accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, cause-effect analysis was performed to highlight the relationships among PADRIC. The developed IRCs-PADRIC methodology can be adopted by managers in any sector to diagnose their internal resiliency. This would help them to answer the following questions: What could have been internally developed to reduce and so react to the disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic? and how prepared would a company be for disruptions similar to COVID-19 in the future? The healthiness of IRCs of a pharmaceutical company was used to empirically validate the developed methodology.

Impact of downstream emissions cap-and-trade policy on electric vehicle and clean utility adoption,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103353,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"In this research, we incorporate emissions cap-and-trade policy into a decision making model for the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). We consider a fleet environment that includes a taxicab company (TC, a downstream tailpipe emitter) and an infrastructure-service provider (SP, an upstream energy user) that provides fast charging services. Both SP and TC must have allowances to account for their own emissions. We examine several scenarios including (i) an equilibrium case, where the selling and buying prices of carbon are equal, (ii) a “buy-low-sell-high” case with financial derivatives, and (iii) a “transient” case based on market conditions. We combine both analytical and computational approaches to assess the impact of various emission cap values and carbon pricing on TC’s adoption of EVs, SP’s utility provider selection, total emissions, and the profitability of both entities. For instance, in both buy-low-sell-high and transient scenarios, penalizing upstream utility emissions more than tailpipe emissions is preferred if electric vehicles are likely to be adopted; otherwise, tighter tailpipe emissions restrictions should be preferred. In the equilibrium case, we show that policymakers will require additional mandates or market mechanisms to influence TC and SP choices, as both entities prefer dirty technologies. Additionally, we demonstrate that providing intermediate utility options – less expensive, but dirtier or more expensive, but cleaner – did not result in reduced emissions. This indicates that expanding utility options may not be a necessary or high-priority policy.",1366-5545,Not found
Spatiotemporal analysis of bike-share demand using DTW-based clustering and predictive analytics,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103361,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"This paper investigates bike-share activities and explores their relationships with neighborhood features, advancing our current knowledge for integrating cycle facilities into urban space to support first/last-mile mobility. To identify distinct demand patterns, bike stations are clustered based on time-series ridership. Measuring the similarity between time-series data in the transportation field should take into account the influence of phase difference because similar demands happening in the morning and in the afternoon should be considered dissimilar. This study uses a weighted Dynamic Time Warping to address this issue by assigning a larger weight to data points with a larger time difference, enabling a more realistic measure to compare ridership. Using bike-share trip data from Citi Bike, we identified eight station clusters, each of which exhibits unique temporal activities. We further integrated the locations of various points of interest to explore the profiles of the clusters. Bike stations that are closer to public transport, commercial buildings and food service establishments are generally more popular, suggesting that incorporating spatial contexts can develop a richer understanding of bike-share usage. In addition, this study goes beyond descriptive analytics by investigating the role of neighborhood features in predicting cluster memberships of bike stations. Our results show that non-tree-based models, such as Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors, outperform tree-based models. This study provides valuable insights for both urban planners and bike-share operators.

Supply chain channel structure with online platform and dual-purpose firms,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103363,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"This study examines the equilibrium channel structure strategy in a supply chain where a manufacturer can sell products to consumers via/on an online platform, and firms may focus on both profit and consumer surplus. We consider three supply chain channel structures: a reselling channel (mode R), wherein the platform acts as the reseller; an agency channel (mode A), wherein the platform acts as the marketplace; and a dual channel (mode D), wherein the platform acts as both the reseller and marketplace. This study explores the strategic effect of the dual-purpose concern on the co-opetition relationship of firms and derives ramifications for the optimal channel structure. First, the platform may abandon mode A when the manufacturer’s consumer surplus concern is high, even if the commission rate is high. This is because the manufacturer’s sales revenue may be harmed by the higher selling quantity and lower price resulting from the increased concern of consumer surplus in mode A. The manufacturer prefers mode D (mode R) only when the commission rate is low (high). However, the supply chain may prefer mode R (mode D) when the platform’s consumer surplus concern is high (low) irrespective of the commission rate. Second, with dual-purpose firms, both the platform and manufacturer may prefer mode R (mode D) when the commission rate is medium and the platform’s consumer surplus concern is high (low). Third, mode A is beneficial to consumer surplus and social welfare as long as agency selling is viable, which occurs when the consumer surplus concern and the commission rate are not too high; otherwise, mode D is the optimal choice, because it enables the supply chain to sell products to consumers in a more flexible way. Finally, the results are robust to a parsimonious dual-purpose platform, an imperfect competitive market, price competition with a dominant platform, multiple competing manufacturers, and a non-zero slotting fee.",1366-5545,Not found
When ignorance is bliss: The retailer's intelligence hazard under information sharing and exchanging,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103356,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"When a manufacturer possesses demand information, there is an opportunity for the retailer to infer the manufacturer’s demand information based on the wholesale price. This paper explores the impact of such inference on the retailer’s unilateral information sharing and bilateral information exchanging strategies in a supply chain with one retailer and two competing manufacturers. Two scenarios were studied under information sharing and exchanging schemes: an intelligent retailer who infers the manufacturers’ demand information from the wholesale prices and an unintelligent retailer who does not infer the information. Our analysis reveals that, regardless of whether the retailer infers or not, the retailer does not want to unilaterally share his information upward with the manufacturers. However, an unintelligent retailer is willing to exchange information with the manufacturers, and the inference does not fully undermine the retailer’s incentives to exchange information. Furthermore, we find that, although the retailer’s inference can help him cope with demand uncertainty, it can actually turn into a hazard (i.e., the retailer’s intelligence hazard) under both information sharing scheme and information exchanging scheme; that is, being ignorant to the manufacturers’ demand information may be a bliss to everyone. We finally observe that side payment transfer may help eliminate the intelligence hazard under bilateral information exchanging but cannot resolve the intelligence hazard under unilateral information sharing.",1366-5545,Not found
Spillover effects of live streaming selling in a dual-channel supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103298,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Live streaming selling is an emerging business mode to promote sales volume by cooperation between the members in e-commence supply chains and the key opinion leader (i.e., KOL). However, the manufacturer or e-retailer who cooperate with the KOL will bring both positive and negative spillover effects in a dual-channel e-commence supply chain. This study investigates the impact of two prominent factors, including spillover effects and consumer acceptance of direct-selling channel on equilibrium results of two sellers under three scenarios, including no KOL scenario, the manufacturer cooperating with KOL scenario (MK), and the e-retailer cooperating with KOL scenario (RK). Our findings show that regardless of the change of the spillover effects and the consumer acceptance, the manufacturer always prefers RK scenario instead of MK scenario. The rationale is that if the live streaming brings the positive spillover effect under RK scenario, the manufacturer can take free-riding behavior to improve his profit; if the live streaming brings the negative spillover effect, the manufacturer might set a lower wholesale price under RK scenario to mitigate the double marginalization. Thus, the RK scenario is the optimal option for the manufacturer in most cases to earn more profit, while the e-retailer has more options under different conditions. Moreover, the main model is extended to discuss the impact of parameters, including different service cost coefficients and consumer returns on sellers’ preference. In addition, the result of numerical studies shows that a Pareto zone can be found to achieve a win-win situation when both manufacturer and e-retailer cooperate with the KOL simultaneously.",1366-5545,Not found
Buyer collaboration in managing supplier responsibility with ESG due diligence effort spillover and fairness concerns,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103333,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Propelled by climate change and social injustice, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure is popularizing and drives for building a more transparent and responsible supply chain. As many unsustainable and unethical activities are hidden in the upstream supply chain, it demands ESG reporting on suppliers. Against this background, buyers conduct due diligence (DD) to assess, manage, and report the ESG practices of the upstream suppliers. We consider two buyers with different responsible awareness competing for consumers in the end market (referred to as a strong buyer and a weak buyer). Competing buyers can share a common supplier and cooperate in implementing ESG DD to strengthen consumer trust, nevertheless, such cooperation gives the weak buyer an opportunity to free ride on the strong buyer’s ESG effort (i.e., ESG effort spillover). We find that only a significantly low spillover effect can induce a fair-neutral strong buyer to adopt buyer collaboration. Interestingly, with the consideration of fairness concerns, the competitor can be treated as a friend in collaboratively managing the ESG practices of the common supplier even facing a great threat of ESG DD effort spillover. Our results also reveal that fairness concerns have a non-monotone impact on the possibility of realizing a win–win outcome between the two buyers. Our findings shed light on how the optimal supplier ESG DD strategy in a competing market differs when incorporating fairness concerns.",1366-5545,Not found

A better understanding of this relationship could shift the thinking on the disadvantages of the dual-purpose firm model. This study investigates how a retailer’s information strategy may differ for a for-profit manufacturer compared with a dual-purpose one. By analyzing an established mathematical model, the results indicate that by sharing information, a retailer can make a dual-purpose manufacturer more profitable than a for-profit manufacturer. This may occur when the retailer proactively shares market information with the dual-purpose manufacturer and when the dual-purpose manufacturer uses an information compensation fee lower than that for the for-profit manufacturer to incentivize the retailer to share such information. Further, both social welfare and the consumer surplus are higher in the former case than in the latter, implying that the presence of a dual-purpose manufacturer in the market can promote win/win results by benefiting both itself and society.

An extended passenger absorption model that explicitly includes time-dependent passenger origin–destination demands is developed, where the term “absorption” refers to passengers boarding trains. Then, the passenger absorption model is extended to a bi-level framework, where passenger demands and rolling stock availability are considered at the higher level, and detailed timetables and train speed profiles are included at the lower level. A bi-level model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed for the integrated problem. The optimization problems of both levels of the bi-level MPC approach can be converted into mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, which enables us to solve them with existing MILP solvers. We then show that the recursive feasibility of both the higher-level and the lower-level optimization problems can be guaranteed. In this way, we can achieve real-time train scheduling for the metro system.

Insightful managerial implications are derived by comparative analysis on charging rules and charging facility locations, and sensitivity analysis on charging power, charging facility configuration and vehicle configuration. Experimental results provide valuable references for terminal managers to make configuration and scheduling decisions for battery-powered vehicle transporting systems.",1366-5545,Not found
On the value of multi-echelon inventory management strategies for perishable items with on-/off-line channels,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103354,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The progress of digitization makes the integration of online and offline sales channels increasingly necessary for retailers. Multichannel and omnichannel multi-echelon networks are gradually more common in responding to customer demands, but their complexity makes the optimization of replenishment and item allocation policies among different channels challenging, especially if products have a short shelf life, as in the case of food retailers, where customer behavior (e.g., first-/last- in-first-out selection) also plays a role. It is not always possible to solve this problem exactly and heuristics are required. We propose a dynamic model and jointly optimize allocation and replenishment policies in the case of perishable goods with stochastic demand, uncertainty in customer selection preferences, and fixed lead times. We study complexity and structure of optimal policies. Furthermore, we explore several intuitive generalizations of base-stock policies over multi-echelon networks, analyzing the effect that potential correlations and imbalances in demand volumes across channels generate on the heuristics and identifying the pros and cons of such solutions. Results show that inventory-pooling effects in multi-echelon models for perishable items are often combined with the allocation of fresher products to offline channels. Generalizations of the well-known constant-order or base-stock policies can be a viable solution that generates benefits and increases system flexibility. They advantageously leverage negative channel correlation, but in the case of unbalanced demand distributions, increased offline demand can impoverish the quality of some heuristics.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimization of integrated energy system considering multi-energy collaboration in carbon-free hydrogen port,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103351,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Renewable energy is highly efficient, clean, and low-carbon, and it has become the key to energy transformation.

Optimal sales strategies for an omni-channel manufacturer in livestreaming demonstration trends,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103222,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"In practice, online livestreaming demonstration and in-store demonstration services for product sales have experienced rapid development. In response to consumers’ cross-channel access to product demonstration and showrooming behavior of purchasing products at the lowest price via each channel, manufacturers increasingly offer consumers more comprehensive product demonstration services by establishing an omni-channel market. Considering this emerging trend, this paper analyzes the optimal sales strategies for the livestreaming demonstration modes and the pricing strategies for an omni-channel manufacturer. Additionally, this paper further digs into the manufacturer’s dilemma under the influence of omni-channel retailing and consumer showrooming behavior when adopting livestreaming demonstrations. Initially, we consider a scenario where a manufacturer sells a product through the omni-channel, demonstrating its products in the offline store and hiring an online shopping influencer as the sales agent for the livestreaming demonstration. Subsequently, three modes are examined: non-livestreaming mode, basic livestreaming mode, and time-limited livestreaming mode. Through game theory modeling, we compare each mode’s optimal pricing strategies and analyze the omni-channel manufacturer’s preference for livestreaming demonstration modes and the influencing factors. The results indicate that while livestreaming demonstrations enhance consumers’ product valuation, the manufacturer cannot always achieve higher profits through the livestreaming demonstration. Besides, the time-limited promotion measures of the livestreaming mode are not always beneficial to the manufacturer. Furthermore, the impact of the livestreaming demonstration effort level of the sales agent, the browsing cost of different channels, and the impact of the livestreaming demonstration on product suitability are analyzed.",1366-5545,Not found
Decision-making models for formulating and evaluating supplier development programs: A state-of-the-art review and research paths,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103340,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Supplier development refers to the efforts of a purchasing company and its suppliers to improve supplier performance and its ability to fulfill the purchasing company’s supply needs.

Cost minimizing decisions on equipment and charging schedule for electric buses in a single depot,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103337,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Combined decisions on equipment and charging schedule for electric buses (e-buses) are studied in this paper. The most representative day is considered, in which each e-bus fulfills a transfer task composed of a series of passenger transportation trips. Each trip starts and terminates at given times in the same single depot where e-buses re-charge their batteries. The problem is to determine battery variants for the e-buses, number of chargers of different types and daily cyclic charging schedule of e-buses such that a linear combination of (a) the total daily cost of the charging equipment, batteries wear and consumed energy, and (b) the total number of e-bus charging interruptions (switchings) is minimized. The constraints include an upper bound on the supplied electric power, restoration of the initial battery energy state before the next day transfer task for each e-bus and an upper bound on the maximal number of switchings for each e-bus in each depot visit over all e-buses and visits. A bi-level decomposition approach is proposed, in which decisions and constraints related to the detailed charging schedule and the number of switchings are moved to the lower-level problem.

The impacts of carbon insurance on supply chain and environment considering technology risk under cap-and-trade mechanism,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103334,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Carbon insurance is an emerging green financial instrument, which makes significant differences in spreading the failure risk of innovative but immature carbon reduction technology, thereby ensuring enterprises for low-carbon transition. We consider a carbon insurance supply chain including a manufacturer and an insurer. The manufacturer produces and sells a product to customers. To reduce carbon emission and thus save cost under cap-and-trade mechanism, the manufacturer invests in a new but immature carbon reduction technology, and he purchases a carbon insurance from the insurer to hedge the failure risk. We first reveal that carbon insurance can lower the manufacturer’s entry barrier of green investment, attracting more firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to adopt carbon reduction technology. Besides, the manufacturer buying carbon insurance produces more products and earns more profit than not buying. For the environmental impacts, the compensation mode of carbon insurance takes an important role. The carbon insurance can further reduce carbon emissions under a certain condition if the insurer compensates the manufacturer with carbon. However, it always leads to higher carbon emission if the insurer compensates the manufacturer with funds. The impacts of carbon insurance also are influenced by the strategic choice of the insurer. The manufacturer earns the most profit and emits the most carbon if the insurer is non-strategic. In contrast, the manufacturer earns less but emits less carbon if the insurer is strategic. Meanwhile, carbon insurance can play a better role in reducing carbon emissions when the manufacturers volunteer to reduce carbon emissions but are not government-mandated. Finally, we provide corresponding management implications for different situations.",1366-5545,Not found

A machine learning-based Bayesian model for predicting the duration of ship detention in PSC inspection,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103331,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Port state control (PSC) inspections are deemed as an effective way to detect substandard vessels and ensure maritime safety around the world. Despite great efforts on PSC in recent years, one challenge that still exists in today’s PSC inspection practice is that there lack relevant scheme or academic research focusing on the duration of vessel detention, which is of great importance to the inspection system. To assist port authorities in estimating detention duration and minimizing the existence of substandard vessels, this paper aims to develop a novel data-driven machine learning based model based on the inspection records collected within the jurisdiction of Paris MoU from January 2015 to March 2022. The model is trained via the incorporation of an Improved Tree Augmented Naïve (ITAN) learning approach and a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) of Expectation Maximization (EM) approach for the first time within the context of PSC research, which could be used as a prediction tool to determine rational durations for detained vessels. Thorough analysis of the proposed model enables the identification of risk variables and deficiency types having significant effects leading to long duration of detention. Further, the research findings could reveal managerial suggestions and insights for port authorities to reduce the occurrence of substandard vessels via the inspection system, i.e., identify specific risk level of vessels and ensure a more-efficient vessel selection process; design specific instructions and rules to regulate risk variables and deficiencies with huge effect on a long duration of detention.

Joint optimal vehicle and recharging scheduling for mixed bus fleets under limited chargers,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103335,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Owing to the high acquisition costs, maintenance expenses, and inadequate charging infrastructure associated with electric buses, achieving a complete replacement of diesel buses with electric counterparts in the short term proves challenging. A substantial number of bus operators currently find themselves in a situation where they must integrate electric buses with their existing diesel fleets. Confronted with the constraints of limited electric bus range and charging infrastructure, the primary concern for bus operators is how to effectively utilize their mixed bus fleets to adhere to pre-established bus timetables while maximizing the deployment of electric buses, known for their zero pollution and cost-effective travel. Consequently, this paper introduces the concept of the joint optimization problem for vehicle and recharging scheduling within mixed bus fleets operating under constrained charging conditions. To tackle this issue, a mixed integer linear model is formulated to optimize the coordination of bus schedules and recharging activities within the context of limited charging infrastructure. By establishing a set of feasible charging activities, the problem of electric buses queuing for charging at constrained charging stations is transformed into a linear optimization model constraint. Numerical simulations are conducted within the real transit network of the Dalian Economic Development Zone in China. The results indicate that the judicious joint optimization of vehicle and charging scheduling significantly enhances the service frequency of electric buses while reducing operational costs for bus lines. Notably, the proportion of total trips performed by electric buses rises to 80.4%.",1366-5545,Not found
Impacts of fairness concerns on financing equilibrium in a low-carbon supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103328,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"With the implementation of low-carbon policy, many companies begin to consider environmental issues when making decisions. This paper investigates a one-manufacturer-one-retailer supply chain under the low-carbon environment, where the retailer is capital-constrained and the manufacturer provides two credit strategies: manufacturer finance and manufacturer investment. The findings show that without fairness concerns, manufacturer investment is the financing equilibrium, and if the cost coefficient of emission reduction is small, manufacturer investment produces lower total carbon emissions and thus the environmental and profitability goals can align. However, different from the literature, when considering the fairness concerns of the retailer, manufacturer finance becomes the financing equilibrium and the high fairness concerns level would reduce the equilibrium region, which is unfavorable for firms to achieve a win–win situation. Finally, we find that fairness concerns would not always benefit the retailer profitably, but could generate higher environmental performance. Our work has the important management implications for firms by exploring impacts of fairness concerns on financing and environment.",1366-5545,Not found
Integrated optimization for high-speed railway express system with multiple modes,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103336,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"High-speed railway (HSR) express, as an emerging transport option in the logistics industry, provides sufficient transport resources to satisfy the demands for large-scale, high value-added, and customized logistics requirements.

On-demand last-mile distribution network design with omnichannel inventory,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103324,180,2023-12-01,2023,12,"E-commerce delivery deadlines are getting increasingly tight, driven by a growing ‘I-want-it-now’ instant gratification mindset of consumers and the desire of online and omnichannel retailers to capitalize on the growth of on-demand e-commerce. On-demand deliveries with delivery deadlines as tight as one or two hours force companies to rethink their last-mile distribution network, since tight delivery deadlines require decentralization of order picking and inventory holding to ensure close proximity to consumers. This fundamentally changes the strategic design process of last-mile distribution networks. We study the impact of incorporating inventory order-up-to level decisions into the strategic design process of last-mile distribution networks with tight delivery deadlines. We develop an approximate inventory model by including an estimate of the cost of late delivery and additional transportation due to local stock-outs in a newsvendor formulation. Such local stock-outs require an order to be delivered from a more distant facility, which may lead to late delivery and additional transportation cost. We integrate our approximate inventory model and a location–allocation mixed-integer program that determines optimal facility locations, associated order-up-to inventory levels, and fleet composition, into a metamodel simulation-based optimization approach. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that pooling the additional online inventory with brick-and-mortar (B&M) inventories leads to cannibalization by the B&M network and higher B&M service levels. However, the pooling benefits to the online network outweigh the cost of inventory cannibalization. Furthermore, we show under which circumstances omnichannel retailers may have an incentive to consolidate online inventory in specific B&M facilities.",1366-5545,Not found

To handle non-independent and non-identically distributed demand, we construct two different multi-period models and reformulate the two models into mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) based on first-order moment and Wasserstein ambiguity sets. Taking into account the problem size increase caused by multiple periods, we develop a lifted polyhedral approximation algorithm to handle large-scale MISOCP. The numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly improve the solution efficiency compared to benchmarks including the outer approximation algorithm and Gurobi solver. Finally, based on real-world data from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, we perform sensitivity analysis and compare different models.

A Branch-and-Cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem with incompatible customer types,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103394,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Ridepooling is expected to become more and more important in people’s mobility. At the same time, autonomous vehicles are expected to be widely used in such applications in the future. While the driver as a person of trust currently provides security, passengers are alone with strangers in an autonomous ridepooling vehicle. In the paper, we address this aspect by including incompatibilities between customers, meaning that incompatible customers cannot share the vehicle at the same time. Although incompatibilities can be defined in any way by the provider, they can be set, for example, if a customer feels unsafe in sharing the vehicle with customers of a certain type. As other compatible customers can replace the driver as a person of trust, we present a second setting where all customers are allowed to share the vehicle at the same time, but customers are never alone in the vehicle with incompatible customers. We present Branch-and-Cut algorithms for both problem settings including methods to improve the search with respect to the incompatibilities. We show in a computational study that the introduced methods improve the search significantly and evaluate the Branch-and-Cut algorithms on realistic instances with up to 120 customers and 10 vehicles. Moreover, our results suggest that it can be a beneficial option for the provider to allow their customers to participate in the decision process by indicating incompatibilities for types of customers, meaning that they do not want to share a vehicle with a customer of an incompatible type.",1366-5545,Not found

Further, it investigates the impact of two construction modes (manufacturer-construction mode and commission-construction mode) of energy replenishment stations on pricing decisions, EVs demand, and profits. Finally, we optimize the government subsidy level to minimize the total capital expenditure for a specific EVs adoption target. The results reveal that introducing SEVs can bring more stations, higher retail price and charging service fee for CEVs, as well as greater demand for EVs when the unit production cost of CEVs is high. If the consumers’ preference for SEVs is low, introducing SEVs can increase profits in most cases; if the consumers’ preference for SEVs is high, introducing SEVs is detrimental to the EVs manufacturer only when the government subsidy is not too high. Comparing to the commission-construction mode, the manufacturer-construction mode can bring more stations, higher total demand for EVs, and higher total profits; meanwhile, it can lower the optimal subsidy level of the government.",1366-5545,Not found
Does parking matter?

Yet, the routing literature largely does not account for the need to find parking. In this paper, we address this challenge of finding parking through the Capacitated Delivery Problem with Parking (CDPP). Unlike other models in the literature, the CDPP accounts for parking time in the objective and minimizes the completion time of the delivery tour. Parking time represents the process of the delivery person searching for a parking spot and then parking the vehicle at the chosen location. When we restrict the customer geography to a complete grid, we identify conditions for when a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution that parks at each customer is an optimal solution to the CDPP. We then determine when the parking time is large enough for the CDPP optimal solution to differ from this TSP solution. We introduce a heuristic for the CDPP that quickly finds high quality solutions to large instances. Computational experiments show that parking matters in last-mile delivery optimization. The CDPP outperforms industry practice and models in the literature showing the greatest advantage when the parking time is high. This analysis provides immediate ways to improve routing in last-mile delivery.",1366-5545,Not found
Horizontal cooperation strategies for competing manufacturers in a capital constrained supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103369,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Many studies concentrate on the vertical collaboration between upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain. However, we have observed that some competing manufacturers also engage in horizontal collaboration in practice, where they hold minority ownership shares in their rival, especially for those with limited initial capital. Although such collaboration has become increasingly prevalent, achieving the expected effects remains challenging due to frequent conflicts in collaboration mechanisms. This study considers a two-echelon supply chain with one supplier and two manufacturers with different financial statuses, where manufacturer 2 not only engages in Cournot competition with manufacturer 1, but also offers a horizontal collaboration contract as a collaborator. By incorporating the initial capital of manufacturer 1, we develop a benchmark sufficient capital model, and two other models such as capital constrained model and the horizontal collaboration model. The impact of horizontal cooperation on the optimal decisions of manufacturers is analyzed to investigate whether a collaboration strategy exists that can mitigate these conflicts while improving the profits of all participants. We prove that the horizontal collaboration can benefit both manufacturers when manufacturer 1 is highly capital constrained and holds a large equity share in itself. However, collaborating with a competing manufacturer 2 does not always benefit the capital-constrained manufacturer 1 compared to a situation where both manufacturers have sufficient capital, but it can increase the profits of manufacturer 2 and the entire supply chain in certain conditions. There exists an optimal collaboration mechanism that can achieve a win–win situation, where manufacturer 2 transfers partial payments to the capital-constrained manufacturer 1. The transfer payment is influenced by the cost differences between the manufacturers and the shareholding ratio. These findings can provide valuable management insights to enable competitors to adopt the optimal collaboration method in the face of capital constraints.",1366-5545,Not found

The financially constrained manufacturer and retailer may be funded by bank credit or trade credit from their upstream participants, forming four financing structures. The findings suggest that although trade credit offered by the manufacturer brings more profits to the supply chain participants than bank credit, it increases the expected losses of the creditors and incurs both the contagion and diffusion effects of default risk. Pure bank financing cannot completely coordinate the supply chain but can control the contagion and diffusion effects of default risk. These effects are also weakened over time.

Afterwards, the bus motion model and the passenger choice models are integrated, and a Method of Successive Averages type iterative algorithm is developed to obtain stable passenger arrival patterns and transfer choices. Numerical experiments are carried out on a hypothetical network followed by a case with real-world data. Our findings demonstrate that a high transfer demand could amplify the propagation of bus bunching across lines along the common-line corridor. Meanwhile, a 50% increase in transfer demand leads to a 24%–30% rise in headway fluctuation.

Two regression models are proposed to quantitatively measure WTW, both of which are calibrated using an inequality-based least square method. Observation data are collected through field investigation and simulation software. The calibration results confirm the existence of WTW.

Exploring the distance decay in port hinterlands under port regionalization using truck GPS data,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103390,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Ports are pivotal in the socioeconomic development of regions, countries, and cities as they serve as gateways for the transportation of goods between sea and land. Analyses of port hinterlands can enable port authorities and shippers to develop competitive strategies while assisting local authorities in identifying areas where inland transportation systems require improvement. In general, physical distance is a robust proxy for transportation costs. However, the role of distance in the context of port regionalization remains under debate, despite the spatial interaction model, with distance decay being commonly used to analyze the port–hinterland relationship. Doubt concerning the explanatory power of distance may act as an obstacle for port managers and local authorities in assessing the market share of ports, as well as in constructing planning agendas related to facility locations. This study examines the distance decay of port hinterlands using more than 0.18 billion points of heavy-duty truck GPS trajectory data from the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area. We develop an algorithm to compute heavy-duty truck flows and actual travel distance between the port and identified facility areas, and we apply the weighted least squares method to evaluate the explanatory power of six distance-decay models. Our findings reveal that the actual travel distance is a significant reduction factor in the port–hinterland relationship, while it follows the exponential model instead of a power function.

We use real coffee and tea prices to capture the skewness of the distribution of product prices in a numerical analysis. We find that (i) the impoverished farmers would benefit from PASs, but the pro-poor enterprise would incur risks because both parties share the uncertainty of harvest output in PASs; (ii) the local government should provide subsidies to the pro-poor enterprise to implement PASs better; (iii) CT and CS have a lower bound for the procurement price as well as local government compensation; and (iv) if the product price exhibits a left-skewed distribution, then the EPP becomes crucial, and a higher procurement price is required to increase the EPP.",1366-5545,Not found
Assessment of approach separation with probabilistic aircraft wake vortex recognition via deep learning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103387,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Compared to static aircraft wake separation during landing/departure, reducing separation minima related to wake turbulence without compromising safety has initially demonstrated operational benefits, while dynamic pairwise separation remains under development. This paper proposes a two-stage probabilistic deep learning framework for wake vortex recognition and duration assessment, using wake images from the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument at Hong Kong International Airport. The first stage consists of vortex core locating utilising the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the second stage predicts vortex strength within the Region of Interest (ROI), derived from raw images based on the initial core locating results. The existence of vortices is assessed upon the reliable probabilistic estimation of vortex movement under specific wind conditions and the estimation of its endurance in the final approach path. Furthermore, the prediction uncertainty is explained from the feature analysis aspect. Computational results indicate that the proposed two-stage CNN framework excels in estimating the spatial features and strength of coupled vortices. The wake duration measurement suggests a high potential for separation minima reduction when the crosswind exceeds (2–3) m / s . This will establishe conditions for onboard real-time wake monitoring, and the development of dynamic pairwise and meteorologically-related aircraft separation systems.",1366-5545,Not found
Blockchain technology as a strategic weapon to bring procurement 4.0 truly alive: Literature review and future research agenda,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103352,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Balancing efficiency and resilience in any supply chain commences from its ability to secure supplier networks.

Pricing and quality decisions for standardized and collaborative services in a home health care service platform,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103366,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Home health care service platforms (HHCSPs) serve older consumers by gathering informal caregivers who offer standardized care services and/or collaborative care services. These platforms aim to maximize both profit and consumer surplus by motivating participants to make proper price and quality decisions. Service prices can be determined by an HHCSP or an informal caregiver, leading to four scenarios: standardized service pricing by platform ( PLS scenario), standardized service pricing by informal caregiver ( ICS scenario), collaborative service pricing by platform ( PLC scenario), and collaborative service pricing by informal caregiver ( ICC scenario). We develop an analytical model to examine the service price and quality decisions based on these four scenarios. We find that the preferred scenarios of the HHCSP and the informal caregiver are those in which they can take the power of pricing. In most cases, the preferred scenario of the informal caregiver (HHCSP) will more likely evolve from the I C C PLC scenario to the I C S PLS scenario as the informal caregiver becomes more efficient. The HHCSP focusing on consumer surplus may not help generate many more economic benefits. Social welfare can be maximized under the ICS , PLS and PLC scenarios, while it is always lowest under the ICC scenario. In addition, we propose two contracts to increase collaboration between platforms and informal caregivers. The findings are robust in two extensions where both categories of service coexist and where the service rate affects the market demand.",1366-5545,Not found
Deep bi-directional information-empowered ship trajectory prediction for maritime autonomous surface ships,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103367,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"It is critical to have accurate ship trajectory prediction for collision avoidance and intelligent traffic management of manned ships and emerging Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). Deep learning methods for accurate prediction based on AIS data have emerged as a contemporary maritime transportation research focus. However, concerns about its accuracy and computational efficiency widely exist across both academic and industrial sectors, necessitating the discovery of new solutions. This paper aims to develop a new prediction approach called Deep Bi-Directional Information-Empowered (DBDIE) by utilising integrated multiple networks and an attention mechanism to address the above issues. The new DBDIE model extracts valuable features by fusing the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and the Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) neural networks. Additionally, the weights of the two bi-directional units are optimised using an attention mechanism, and the final prediction results are obtained through a weight self-adjustment mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq), and Transformer neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the new DBDIE model achieves the most satisfactory prediction outcomes than all other classical methods, providing a new solution to improving the accuracy and effectiveness of predicting ship trajectories, which becomes increasingly important in the era of the safe navigation of mixed manned ships and MASS.

Towards sustainable UAV operations: Balancing economic optimization with environmental and social considerations in path planning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103314,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), i.e., drones, are expected to be widely used in various applications, such as parcel delivery and passenger transport, with the benefits of mitigating traffic congestion and reducing carbon emissions. In this paper, we study a UAV path planning problem under uncertain weather conditions, and design a data-driven dynamic decision support system for multiple types of UAVs. To this end, we categorize all relevant costs into three types, namely, economic, environmental, and social costs, and formulate a nonlinear two-stage stochastic programming model to establish optimal paths for UAV missions under weather uncertainty. We then discretize the nonlinear model and propose a tight linear approximation for the discretized problem to allow for a near real-time implementation. To quantify weather uncertainty, we propose a weather scenario generation algorithm to map ensemble-based weather forecast information to airspace blockage maps. With comprehensive computational studies through simulations, we show that our proposed stochastic approach can lower operating costs by an average of around 6%, where the savings increase as weather conditions become more severe and complex. We also find that, for missions operated by small UAVs, it is not sufficient to determine a path solely based on economic cost minimization, but it should rather be through total cost minimization, which involves environmental and social costs. Considering only the economic cost in the optimization may lead to much higher non-economic costs. However, for missions operated by large UAVs, it is sufficient to determine paths through economic cost optimization, as including environmental and social costs in the optimization process does not result in solutions that are much different from those obtained by considering only the economic costs. For both small and large UAVs, a path established solely through environmental or social cost minimization may not be economically sustainable, as doing so would imply very high economic costs.",1366-5545,Not found
To fight or not? product introduction and channel selection in the presence of a platform's private label,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103373,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Platform retailers’ private labels have recently flourished, threatening the business of traditional national brand (NB) sellers. To fight against these platforms, some NB sellers introduce new products as low-quality substitutes through marketplace channels or exclusive channels. This raises a question: Considering the existence of a platform’s private label, how does an NB seller’s fight/no-fight strategy affect the co-opetition relationship between the two players? In this paper, we construct a game-theoretic model to explore the optimal response strategy of the NB seller. Our study shows that the interaction between the expansion effect and the cannibalization effect can lead to outcomes in which the no-fight strategy benefits the NB seller and the fight strategy benefits the platform. We find that for the NB seller, introducing a new low-quality product through a marketplace channel may be more profitable than doing so through an exclusive channel, particularly when the expansion effect is large and the quality difference is small. We also find that new product introduction as a fight strategy may cause a win–win situation for the NB seller and the platform when done through a marketplace channel with a large expansion effect. An intriguing result of the extension is that the NB seller may switch from the marketplace channel to the exclusive channel as the operating cost in the exclusive channel increases. This work provides valuable managerial insights for NB sellers in response to strategic competition with platforms’ private labels.",1366-5545,Not found
Multi-Platform dynamic game and operation of hybrid Bike-Sharing systems based on reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103374,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The advent of electric bikes, or ebikes, has significantly enhanced competitiveness of bike-sharing systems, providing benefits to both riders (comfort during uphill and long-distance rides), platforms (more profit), and the environment. Operating such a hybrid bike-sharing system, i.e., with both bikes and ebikes, in a competitive multi-platform market, can be challenging due to the complex and unpredictable interplay among heterogeneous market participants, which becomes more pronounced with the ebike varying battery, and dynamic demand. Most related research is predicated on the assumption of a monopoly market, which is not always the case: in worldwide capital-oriented markets, many firms will quickly imitate and join in rapidly developing fields for profits. Thus, this paper addresses platforms’ hybrid bike-sharing system operation problem with time-varying ebike pricing and rebalancing strategy in consideration of competition. We consider two docked hybrid bike-sharing platforms with charging stations at the site. Platforms utilize trucks for their own rebalancing operation including bike, ebike and mixed bike/ebike relocation tasks. We combine the Markov decision process (MDP) model with game theory, and establish the dual-platform MDP framework in which one mainstream platform and one competing platform optimize their profits by dynamic pricing and bike/ebike rebalancing based on highly dynamic and stochastic demand. Users’ choice is described by a modified nested logit model and the endogenous demand is generated. We develop the tailored double dueling deep Q-network for solving dynamic gaming. A series of experiments are conducted based on the real-world dataset in Shenzhen and several strategy combinations are compared. The results show the win–win situation where both platforms improve profits with a higher market ratio and demonstrate how to introduce and operate ebikes in the system by analyzing detailed strategies in different games.",1366-5545,Not found

This paper presents a two-phase approach for the collaborative optimization of charging schedules and passenger services, aimed at enhancing the operation of on-demand electric bus systems. First, we propose a label-setting dynamic programming algorithm that enables the efficient generation of bus-trips for each bus line in response to passenger requests. Second, we introduce a time–space network optimization model that facilitates integrated multiple bus-trip planning for the transit network, involving multiple bus lines and charging spots. The model selects bus-trips from various time–space arcs, which represent passenger carrying, bus deployment, and bus charging activities. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a case study using real-world data from bus lines in Beijing, China. Computational results demonstrate that our approach can handle on-demand electric bus operations within minutes of solution time, efficiently serving over 2,000 passengers. Practically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in average transit time and effectively reduces the waste of public transit resources.

This study investigates the station location design problem in a BSS with conventional shared bikes and e-bikes. The design problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. The upper-level problem is to determine the optimal station locations with the objective of maximizing social welfare, and the lower-level problem is a multi-period multi-modal network equilibrium problem with pick-up and drop-off constraints. The upper-level problem is solved using the Genetic Algorithm, while the rolling horizon method is used to decompose the lower-level problem into multiple period-specific subproblems.

Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the properties of the problem, illustrate the performance of the solution algorithm, and offer key insights into the planning of BSSs.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal configuration of dynamic wireless charging facilities considering electric vehicle battery capacity,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103376,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Dynamic wireless charging facilities deployed on the road network offer an effective charging method to alleviate the electric vehicle users’ range anxiety and thus facilitate the promotion of electric vehicles. The main benefit of wireless charging is that it extends EV’s driving range by enabling EV en-route recharging, which consequently reduces the required battery size for EVs. Basically, given densely distributed wireless charging lanes on the road network, smaller and less expensive batteries would be able to meet the travel demand. From the societal point of view, the reduction of battery size/capacity is capable of justifying more construction of wireless charging lanes. While previous research works on optimal deployment of wireless charging facilities ignored this benefit, this study aims to explicitly consider the tradeoff between the costs of building recharging infrastructure and manufacturing batteries from the societal point of view in the optimal configuration of dynamic wireless charging facilities. The problem is formulated into a bi-level programming model, wherein the upper-level model seeks to minimize the total social cost, and the lower-level model captures EV drivers’ choices in terms of battery size, travel route, and driving and charging behavior. To handle the problem, we first relax the path cost constraint and apply the linearization techniques to reformulate the problem into a mixed-integer linear programming, from which a lower bound of the problem can be obtained.

Since then, UAVs have quickly gained traction as a feasible option for last-mile operations in transport and logistics. In the context of this research, we construct a mathematical framework aiming to depict the collaborative interaction between trucks and drones in coordinating pickup and delivery tasks with the objective of minimizing operational costs. The drone-assisted pickup and delivery problem (DAPDP) is a variant of the problem in which a single truck departs a depot with parcels and a UAV on board. As the truck picks up packages and makes deliveries, the UAV can also be used to make deliveries to customers near the truck’s position. As the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) embarks on its delivery task, the truck continues on its route, making further deliveries along the way and retrieving the UAV at another customer location different from the launch point. The model is presented as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), and a novel heuristic solution approach based on the classic Clarke–Wright savings heuristic is proposed.

A parallel computing framework for large-scale microscopic traffic simulation based on spectral partitioning,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103368,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This paper introduces a parallel computing framework based on the Spectral Partitioning (SP) method designed to enhance the computational efficiency of large-scale microscopic traffic simulation (LSMTS).

Micro-simulation relies on vehicle information from both preceding and following vehicles to accurately infer the operational states of a vehicle. However, network partitioning can disrupt the flow of vehicle information, resulting in its loss. To address this, the proposed framework incorporates a boundary transmission method to ensure simulation accuracy and precision.

Risk hedging for VaR-constrained newsvendors,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103365,181,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Risk management significantly impacts the efficiency of business operations. We examine the effects of corporate risk preference on optimal ordering and risk-hedging decisions under a value-at-risk (VaR) constraint from short-term (only demand is uncertain) and long-term (both demand and supply are uncertain) perspectives. We find that under the short-term view, the impact of the shortage cost on the optimal order quantity is weaker than that of the unit net residual value. Moreover, managers can achieve a balanced management of profit and risk by using inventory to maximize profit and selecting the right option to hedge risk. Specifically, risk-averse firms can manage risk by selling a sufficient number of put options with a low enough strike price. On the other hand, risk-seeking firms should sell an adequate number of call options with a high enough strike price to meet the VaR constraint. In the long-run, we broaden the scope of applying optimal risk-hedging strategies for firms with different risk preferences. The optimal risk-hedging strategies within a specific range will be consistent with short-term ones. Otherwise, any option that satisfies the VaR constraint can be used to control risk. Our results enrich the literature on profit-risk hedging and ordering decisions based on the newsvendor model with the VaR constraint. They also help firms manage their inventories and control risk simultaneously. It is of great value to firms that are not only interested in short-term benefits but are more focused on the long-term increase in firms’ value.",1366-5545,Not found

Service design under asymmetric service provider competition: Applications of AI services,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103424,182,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Recently, with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology (e.g. ChatGPT), more enterprises are incorporating AI into their customer service to reduce costs. However, the excessive use of AI technology will also reduce consumers’ satisfaction with services, and finding a balance between high-quality human service and cost-effective AI service is crucial for enterprises. To answer this question, this paper establishes a service competition model in which a service integrator (SI) procures services from an AI service provider (ASP) and a human service provider (HSP), and then combines them to offer integrated services to consumers. The findings reveal that, under certain conditions, the introduction of low-cost AI service by SI may result in increased product price. This occurs because ASP tends to set higher price for AI service to ensure its profitability per unit. When the consumer service sensitivity is moderate, SI can generate greater profits by skillfully designing blended service instead of relying on a single service. HSP encourages SI to adopt some of its competitors’ AI service when the consumer service sensitivity is low, while ASP does the opposite. Interestingly, a win–win scenario emerges, where all competing service providers earn higher profits compared to offering exclusive services, and SI profits and consumer welfare are also higher. In addition, service integration is essential to increase revenue for all parties involved, but the revenue increase is the same regardless of which party performs the service integration.",1366-5545,Not found

However, limited academic research exists on how firms should behave under default risk controls and how to improve channel efficiency using equity vendor financing. In this study, we focus on a supply chain consisting of a default risk-controlling supplier and a capital-constrained retailer controlling the risk of losing money. First, we explore the two firms’ decisions in trade credit financing when the default or losing money probabilities are controlled. Our findings show that the retailer reduces its risk by ordering fewer products; the supplier can reduce its risk by increasing the wholesale price or interest rate, where the former maximizes its expected profit while the latter helps distribute more products than the former. However, all these measures decrease supply chain efficiency. Second, to alleviate the negative impact of risk controls, we propose a portfolio by combining debt vendor financing (i.e., trade credit) with equity vendor financing, where a portion of trade credit financing is converted into equity financing. This portfolio can achieve win-win situations and channel coordination, while also meeting each firm’s risk management objectives. Additionally, by extending our model to a case where the wholesale price is determined exogenously, we find that the main conclusions still hold and obtain some complementary results.

By strategically designing the linkage between the two channels based on the cross-channel influences, companies can better handle the demand uncertainty of seasonal products. In this paper, we consider a dual channel e-commerce supply chain with an e-tailer and a manufacturer selling a seasonal product. We analytically examine how the e-tailer can (i) adopt risk pooling by aggregating the demands from both the MA and WS channels and (ii) invest in forecast-enhancement technology (FET) to improve inventory management. We uncover that when the magnitude of cross-channel influences increases, the impacts on the optimal inventory decision vary greatly depending on four different “model cases”; interestingly, it does not affect the optimal FET decision. Considering the impacts of cross-channel influences on the e-tailer’s expected profit, we reveal that the optimal weakening or strengthening strategy, i.e., “creating barriers” or “enhancing linkage” between two channels, depends on the e-tailer’s channel operations models. Then, we find that the optimal weakening or strengthening strategy follows the same pattern as in the basic model when the dual channel e-commerce supply chain is coordinated under a Nash bargaining framework. Last but not least, we study the potential use of blockchain technology to improve the effectiveness of FET investment. We surprisingly find that using blockchain or not does not affect the optimal MA and WS design decisions on weakening or strengthening linkages.",1366-5545,Not found

A two-step approach for deploying heterogeneous vessels and designing reliable schedule in liner shipping services,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103416,182,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Schedule reliability is a crucial metric for measuring liner container shipping service. Due to the inherent uncertainties at sea and ports, schedule delays and unreliable on-time performance have long plagued shipping companies. In practice, the heterogeneity of container vessels also creates challenges for deployment and schedule optimization. To address the problem, we develop a two-step approach with two programming sub-models. In the first step, we tackle the challenges of ship deployment and scheduling by considering heterogeneous vessels and capturing the interarrival time between adjacent ports of call. In the second step, we use the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to address the uncertainty risk avoidance in schedule design. To solve the stochastic programming models, we employ a solution framework based on the outer linear approximation method and the risk measure method, where CVaR is specified as the risk measure. We illustrate the application of our model on a case study concerning a real route operated by COSCO Shipping Lines. The results show that the total cost of liner shipping service with heterogeneous fleet on the route can be reduce by 4.77% compared with homogeneous fleet. And the cost of risk with the reliable schedule can be decreased by 8.04% compared with the ideal schedule. The research conclusions can provide some useful decision-making references for shipping companies to deploy heterogeneous vessels and design reliable schedules.",1366-5545,Not found
Scheduling of automated ore terminal operations based on fixed inflow rhythm,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103411,182,2024-02-01,2024,2,"To facilitate transportation, some mines construct specialized ore terminals for outbound shipments. However, these terminals frequently encounter challenges when synchronizing their schedules with the production plans of the mines. The primary issue arises due to the inherent deviation between vessel demand and mine production schedules. The terminals must efficiently arrange storage positions for diverse cargo types and berthing orders of vessels to reduce the time vessels spend at the terminal and operation time. In this study, we propose a comprehensive two-step model framework that considers various customer priorities to optimize the operational plans for each operation. In the first step, we propose a column-generation approach to generate candidate berth plans. Subsequently, we evaluate the feasibility of berth plans and construct an infeasible CUT to modify the model. We implement the developed framework in real-world case studies to demonstrate its practicality and potential. Computational outcomes underscore the method’s efficacy in resolving coordination challenges between mines and terminals. Furthermore, it exhibits a noteworthy capability to diminish the terminal’s spatial requirements, enhancing its pragmatic value.",1366-5545,Not found
Embracing the power of AI in retail platform operations: Considering the showrooming effect and consumer returns,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103409,182,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This study examines a duopoly market comprising an online retail platform and a physical store, both of them selling experience-based products to consumers who are unaware of the products’ fitness. The platform could introduce artificial intelligence (AI) technology into retail operations to address consumers’ fitness uncertainty and then gain market share, while the physical store could exert a service effort to recapture the market, potentially facilitating showrooming behavior. Operational decisions including pricing, AI application, and service effort exertion are investigated in the cases where consumers are allowed and unallowed to return unsuitable products. We first develop a theoretical model of dual-channel retailing to determine the equilibrium operational decisions for the supply chain members, and then examine the interactions between these operational decisions and consumers’ showrooming behaviors. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to verify the robustness of the theoretical findings. Results indicate that both AI application and service efforts exertion will strengthen consumers’ showrooming effect, especially when the cost of AI application is relatively low. Moreover, regardless of whether the store implements the service effort or not, the platform prefers to apply AI technology when consumers are allowed to return products. Furthermore, the physical store will always exert a service effort, and with the service effort, the application of AI technology in the retail platform operation could effectively mitigate the impact of consumer return on supply chain members.",1366-5545,Not found
Blockchains for SMEs: A Fit-Viability perspective moderated by organizational innovation diffusion for supply chain performance,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103396,182,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This paper empirically examines the suitability of blockchain for improving supply chain performance in small-medium enterprises through the theoretical lens of the fit-viability model against the impact of organisation innovation diffusion level Data gathered from 206 respondents are analysed using partial least square-structured equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The findings of this study show empirically that enhanced supply chain connectivity, information sharing, and supply chain visibility are fit for enhancing supply chain performance. Economics, management support, and technology infrastructure are important for blockchain viability. Further, an organisation’s innovation diffusion level affects the fitness of blockchain for supply chain performance but not viability. The transformational effects of blockchain are mainly centred on its security and trust-enhancing features.

Optimal product and after-sales service decisions considering risk attitudes under price-dependent uncertain demand,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103393,182,2024-02-01,2024,2,"In this paper, we investigate a service-oriented manufacturer that provides fashionable products with after-sales services to customers. Before the selling season, the manufacturer invests in service capacity in advance and then decides on the production quantity and selling price based on updated demand information. Interestingly, it is found that the manufacturer’s production and pricing decisions will not be affected by the unit production cost when the market base exceeds a threshold. We investigate and compare the manufacturer’s decisions in two cases: imperfect and perfect demand information updates. The selling price in the imperfect demand updates case is always set lower than that in the perfect demand updates case when the service capacity is sufficient but may not be under insufficient service capacity. The possibility that the prepared service capacity limits the production quantity may decrease with the unit production cost in the imperfect demand updates case. In contrast, this possibility is invariant with the unit production cost in the case of perfect demand updates. The effects of risk aversion are also investigated. It is found that under the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) criterion, the manufacturer with a higher risk-averse degree establishes a lower service capacity and sets a lower selling price.",1366-5545,Not found

Focusing on the growing use of third-party warehouse services, the paper discusses the creation of a network that can adjust to the needs of businesses to enhance operational flexibility and resource utilization. Moreover, it addresses the challenge of delivery date flexibility where the conventional single-day delivery is replaced with a range of possible delivery dates. Considering these two types of flexibility, we formulate a supply chain network design problem that includes all production, inventory, location, and distribution decisions. We propose a solution approach called the relax-and-restrict matheuristic. This approach iteratively solves three versions of the model: two relaxed versions and a restricted one. Through a series of computational experiments, we highlight the efficiency of the proposed method. Furthermore, managerial insights are presented on the role of flexibility in supply chain network design and how it relates to economies of scale.

Capacity sharing for ride-sourcing platforms under competition,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103397,182,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The practice of capacity sharing among ride-sourcing platforms has significantly gained popularity, yet its full impact remains unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how capacity constraints and sharing affect platform profitability, customer surplus and labor welfare. We propose a Cournot competition model in which two competing platforms simultaneously decide on matching quantities, setting prices and wages to balance supply and demand. Three different capacity scenarios are considered in our analysis: unconstrained, constrained without sharing, and constrained with sharing. By comparing the results of the first two scenarios, we find that capacity constraint would alleviate the price competition, benefiting the platform with sufficient capacity while hurting others facing labor shortage. Moreover, constrained capacity leads to lower customer surplus and labor welfare. Through a comparative analysis of the results obtained from the last two scenarios, we find that under two types of capacity sharing contracts, price competition may get more intense. Additionally, drivers, passengers and the capacity borrower benefit from sharing, while the capacity lender experience reduced profit. We also analyze the effects of model parameters on the equilibrium outcomes, including the revenue-sharing rate, the transfer price of the shared capacity, and the drivers’ retention rate.",1366-5545,Not found
Contract design between relief organisations and private-sector vendors: A humanitarian logistics framework,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103395,182,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Amid increasing threats from natural disasters, the demand for relief supplies is growing quickly. As such, private-sector collaborations have been an efficient way for relief organisations to mitigate the burden of supply procurement and inventory. However, due to the complexity of disasters, such collaboration contracts are not one-size-fits-all. Based on our field investigation and literature review, we summarize two important factors, the relief organisation’s objective and inventory management, which should determine the design of the contract. Each factor has three important elements, so we can build a framework for the corresponding nine kinds of contracts and propose their models. Through a common numerical experiment, we make comparisons and further clarify their characteristics. The results of this analysis may be helpful in determining which kind of contract is most suitable to promote collaboration between relief organisations and private-sector entities in different humanitarian situations.",1366-5545,Not found
Data-driven drone pre-positioning for traffic accident rapid assessment,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103452,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"A rise in traffic accidents has led to both traffic congestion and subsequent secondary accidents. Effectively addressing this issue requires rapid accident investigation and management. In this paper, we aim to improve the efficiency of traffic accident assessment and investigation with the aid of drone technologies. Our approach involves strategically pre-positioning drones, enabling traffic supervisory agencies to dispatch drones immediately upon receiving an accident report. Methodology-wise, we present a data-driven robust stochastic optimization (RSO) model, which encapsulates the uncertainty of traffic accidents within a scenario-wise Wasserstein ambiguity set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that incorporates covariates, i.e., weather conditions, into the Wasserstein ambiguity set with the CVaR metric. We demonstrate that the proposed RSO model can be reformulated into a mixed-integer programming model, allowing an efficient solution approach. Via a real-world dataset of London traffic accidents, we validate the practical applicability of the RSO model. Across various parameter settings, our RSO model exhibits superior out-of-sample performance compared with various benchmark models.

Signaling contracts design for Build–Operate–Transfer roads under asymmetric traffic demand information,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103465,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In a build-operate-transfer (BOT) road project, the government offers a concession contract to a private investor based on traffic demand information. When the government is privately informed about the demand information—namely, the potential traffic demand (PTD)—it might be challenging for the private investor to quantify the project’s prospects, which could diminish its enthusiasm for involvement. In that case, the government has incentive to design a concession contract that acts as a signal of facility demand to the private investor. This study uses a signaling model to develop an incentive-compatible BOT contract when the government possesses an informational advantage concerning PTD. We find that the optimal contract for the government under the high-PTD condition is distorted relative to a symmetric-information contract. However, this distortion comes at the cost of social welfare loss, which can be viewed as signaling cost, and it is affected by PTD variation and the marginal social cost of public funds. In a separating equilibrium, optimal contracts lie in one of four regions whose bounds are determined by PTD variation. We further extend the research by considering the private investor’s risk-averse attitude. We find that the existence of an optimal signaling mechanism is influenced by the extent of risk aversion (ERA). Interestingly, however, a risk-averse attitude does not magnify the distortion of an asymmetric-information contract, and the signaling cost decreases with ERA. The ranges of separating equilibrium outcomes are also influenced by ERA. Based on our findings, we derive some policy insights regarding BOT contracts design.",1366-5545,Not found
Multi-echelon facility location models for the reorganization of the Blood Supply Chain at regional scale,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103438,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Blood and blood products are crucial resources requiring effective management strategies and policies due to the potential severe consequences that could arise from their lack. Over the past two decades, the global healthcare community has recognized the significance of managing the Blood Supply Chain (BSC) efficiently and effectively. This includes policy-making, system design and organization. In this context, the Italian Healthcare Ministry issued a decree aimed at improving the BSC efficiency at regional level while reducing costs by providing several indications and restrictions to be accounted for. To address the need for improved BSC system management and design, we propose a mathematical modeling framework that builds upon and extends multi-echelon facility location and scenario-based mathematical models coming from literature, integrating soft constraints to achieve system aims with a multi-objective viewpoint. The proposed modeling framework has been implemented in two different perspectives: case-based and scenario-based. These two perspectives approaches are conceived to provide a comprehensive solution to the issue at hand, performing sensitivity analysis, and enabling the design of an efficient and effective BSC at the regional level, capable of handling inherent system uncertainty. To this aim, the proposed modeling framework comprises several objectives, including minimizing transportation costs, rationalizing the number and type of facilities, ensuring self-sufficiency, guaranteeing an average accessibility threshold, satisfying imposed restrictions and system constraints, and designing a system robust to varying exogenous and endogenous conditions. Real-world data sets were utilized to test and validate the proposed formulations.

Managing regretful newsvendors and supply chain performance through target-setting,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103444,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The equilibrium order quantity of the regretful newsvendors generally presents the pull-to-center effect, leading to lower profits. This study finds that a target-setting approach which serves as a pervasive mechanism adopted by the manager can effectively counteract this bias. Rich literature finds that the regret bias makes newsvendors worse in practice; however, there is a lack of efficient and costless approaches to solving this issue. This study combines the target-setting with the regret model by considering reference dependence and loss aversion to characterize newsvendors’ utility under target-setting. The two effects are proven to interact with each other and jointly decide whether it turns out to be overordering or underordering. Interestingly, a high profit-margin target or a strong loss aversion may result in an effect opposite to the pull-to-center effect. Excluding selling high-margin products with a stronger aversion to leftover regret, the manager can motivate regretful newsvendors to select the profit-maximizing order quantity through target-setting. We extend our study to the selling-to-newsvendor setting and further verify that newsvendors’ regret bias may benefit the supply chain and can be exploited by the supplier. Significantly, target-setting may even help achieve supply chain coordination under a simple wholesale price. This study provides instructions for managers to avoid firms’ profit loss and achieve the maximum channel profit.",1366-5545,Not found

In this work, some ideas to improve the long-term performance of the rolling horizon strategy are explored. First, three simple modifications to the IRP are tested to improve its long-term performance: using safety stocks, defining minimum inventory levels for the last period of the planning horizon, and using an artificial discount rate in the objective function. We use this improved IRP as a benchmark. Then, a solution strategy is proposed where an approximation is used in the final periods of the planning horizon, which is based on the linear relaxation of the IRP. The algorithm is calibrated and, through simulation, compared to the benchmark on a set of randomly generated instances with up to 30 customers, three vehicles, and 20 periods, and different costs and uncertainty levels. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is, on average, three times faster than the benchmark and generates savings between 1% and 2%. Under favorable conditions (low uncertainty, low inventory cost, and one vehicle), it can generate savings of around 10% in long-term costs.",1366-5545,Not found

Last-Mile logistics with on-premises parcel Lockers: Who are the real Beneficiaries?,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103458,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Researchers have investigated various planning aspects of public Parcel Lockers (PLs), but little is known about the wider benefits of on-premises parcel lockers (OPLs). More recently OPLs have received attention as a solution to address the problem of failed deliveries, as well as to provide a safe and secure delivery experience to customers. Although OPLs provide enhanced convenience for residents, a major impediment towards their adoption is the high capital and ongoing costs. Currently, suppliers of OPLs require individual buildings to fully cover the costs, leading to low uptake among building managers and residents. This study is the first to ruminate that the benefits of such systems expand beyond residents, with carriers and local governments being key beneficiaries. Using a real-world case study and in-field observations, this study provides analytical estimates of the value of OPLs for buildings, as well as carriers and local governments in terms of operational and external cost savings. A probabilistic algorithm is developed to simulate the delivery time components to buildings and measure the benefits for individual stakeholders. We further applied the model to a case study in the City of Melbourne, to evaluate how a carrier’s market share, and building size and practices for managing failed delivery could determine the value of OPLs.

In this paper, we study the stowage problem and consider the storage locations of containers in the yard. A decision framework is proposed to optimize the stowage, which is decomposed into three phases: allocating storage locations to container blocks, the stacking slots of vessel bays, and the stowing sequences through which containers are stowed. We formulate mixed integer programming models to minimize container relocations, the moving distances from blocks to bays, and operation times of containers in the proposed decision framework. An adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm based on heuristic rules is then designed to solve the optimization problem. Numerical experiments with different scales are conducted to verify the models and algorithm. Comparisons of various methods such as CPLEX and particle swarm optimization, also demonstrate the effectiveness of the ALNS algorithm in terms of its solution performance. A sensitivity analysis of the relocation and bay utilization rates is also conducted, which can provide port operators with managerial insights. Robustness is tested by comparing the objective value gaps when encountering deviations in container weight and size between the actual and expected information. There is a small gap of less than 2% in the solutions, which are solved from the models with parameter deviations.

Two financing strategies initiated by the upstream suppliers are widely used to ease buyers' financial distress: trade credit (TC) and supplier-guaranteed financing (SG). We investigate these two financing strategies following the classic selling-to-the-newsvendor paradigm by further incorporating the buyer’s financial constraint. We highlight the role of default and opportunity costs, which are significant financial frictions in practice. We obtain the equilibrium and find that the supplier should offer a risk-free interest rate under TC and provide a full guarantee under SG. Moreover, SG will always be used in equilibrium, while TC can be used only when the supplier’s capital opportunity cost is relatively small. The rationale behind this difference is that the supplier incurs an opportunity cost due to the tied-up working capital with TC. Furthermore, owing to the joint effect of the two friction costs, there is a threshold level of the supplier’s capital opportunity cost, below which the supplier offers TC and above which he offers SG. The buyer and the integrated supply chain also have a similar preference structure dependent on the supplier’s capital opportunity cost. Finally, we extend the model by considering imperfect competition in the credit market and exogenous guarantee proportion.

Integrating equity and efficiency into urban logistics resilience under emergency lockdowns,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103446,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The urban logistics system serves an essential role in providing daily necessities for residents but is vulnerable to resource shortages in disasters. For instance, cluster infections and access restrictions caused by public health emergencies like COVID-19 pose a severe challenge to the resilient operations of urban logistics systems. Especially, the restriction level and the labor shortage always vary a lot on a citywide basis, resulting in a dilemma in handling distributional equity and delivery efficiency. Motivated by this issue, this paper studies the resilience assessment method and enhancement strategy for urban logistics systems under emergency lockdowns with integrated consideration of equity and efficiency. The resilience-oriented capacity reallocation models are developed for quick-response strategies in the case of two disruption types, i.e., closure of distribution centers and capacity degradation of delivery routes. Numerical studies of a real-world case in Shanghai are conducted to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our methods under different disruption levels. The comparison of reallocation schemes with respect to different weights of equity and efficiency is also performed to discuss their impacts on resilience. The results indicate the importance of considering equity in logistics distribution under large-scale disruptions. If distributional equity is highly valued, the service capability can retain up to 74 % of the original level despite half of the distribution centers being shut down. In addition, different concerns on equity and efficiency can lead to variations in system resilience for the same disruption scenario, but the capacity reallocation schemes consistently align with the aim of resilience enhancement.

To gauge the effect of incorporating ChatGPT on participants' values, we introduce technology coefficient parameters, providing a deeper understanding of its impact. In the initial phase of the auction, a sophisticated platform or an impartial third-party appraisal firm is employed. Their task is to collect vital attribute information from potential sellers regarding the waste batteries. Subsequently, this information is carefully matched with interested buyers. To determine the appropriate number of buyers both before and after the auction, we introduce two innovative matching mechanisms. We propose the implementation of a pioneering one-sided affine VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auction, which portrays the affine externality of buyers to other buyers, along with a weighted generalized second-price auction. Additionally, we introduce a ground-breaking mechanism known as weighted multi-unit trade reduction. This inventive process allows successful bidders from the first stage to actively participate in the subsequent auction. Within this paper, we develop auction allocation rules based on the interplay between winning sellers' supply and winning buyers' demand. The outcomes of our numerical studies demonstrate the efficacy of the two-stage auction method in addressing buyers' concerns regarding battery performance. Furthermore, we have found that the utilization of ChatGPT technology proves advantageous for both participants and the platform; if buyers have a positive affine externality on other buyers, then the platform's revenue will be reduced, while social welfare will increase. In the realm of incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balancing, our proposed mechanism stands unwaveringly strong, having undergone rigorous scrutiny and demonstrating commendable performance in numerous numerical experiments. Lastly, we offer practical management insights for stakeholders in the battery recycling market. These invaluable insights are derived from our hands-on experience, providing a fresh perspective for industry managers.",1366-5545,Not found
Does digital finance favor firms in supply chains? Roles of green innovation and bargaining power,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103431,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In the digital economy era, the disruptive technologies have boomed and reshaped firms in supply chains by finance digitalization towards a more sustainable way, while how digital finance (DF) affects firms’ performance in supply chains remains still unclear. Meanwhile, the balance between environmental protection and economic benefits has become pivotal for firms to achieve sustainable development. As an effective means to promote green development, green innovation (GI) can provide opportunities for firms to establish a good image and gain competitive advantages. Besides, bargaining power (BP) determines the firms’ profit allocation ratio in the supply chain. Firms with higher bargaining power can pressure suppliers to improve product quality or reduce wholesale price, and thus enhance corporate profits. Given that these two variables are crucial for stimulating firms’ development in supply chains from a long-term perspective, we aim to investigate how these two variables are affected by DF and the influence mechanisms of DF on firm performance based on the data of Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2018. Results indicate that DF can be regarded as a useful tool for firms to improve corporate performance. We adopt instrumental variable method to solve potential endogeneity concerns, and conduct a series of robustness tests to ensure the reliability of the findings. We also find DF can significantly enhance GI and BP, which in turn improve firm performance in supply chains. This paper advances the literature on innovation and purchasing management by drawing attention to the potential role of DF and by shedding new light on how DF contributes to sustainable development of firms, thus providing managerial insights for governments, firms, financial institutions to develop digital technologies and ensure the healthy development of firms in the supply chains.",1366-5545,Not found
A hybrid scenario-based fuzzy stochastic model for closed-loop dry port network design with multiple robustness measures,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103417,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Dry ports are crucial to marine logistics, providing significant economic, environmental, and social benefits. Effective network design is key to their success, and decisions on location and capacity must consider both objective data and expert opinions to avoid costly long-term consequences. This research presents an integrative framework that combines a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method with fuzzy stochastic chance-constrained optimization, forms an integrated multi-objective model, and solves it using the epsilon-constraint approach. The demands for imports and exports are presented in a scenario-based manner, and in each scenario, demands are expressed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. To guarantee the level of confidence in satisfying demands, a fuzzy chance constraint method has been used and the stochastic objective function has been transformed into a deterministic counterpart using a novel robust optimization technique. The paper is also among the first to consider reverse logistics from inland to seaports through dry ports to highlight their role in marine export. Since the output of the model is highly dependent on the parameter settings, the mechanism of the parameters’ impact on the profit maximization objective function is investigated through a full factorial experiment. The results of the mathematical model proposed in this research, which has been tested on an Iranian case study suggest that high-capacity dry ports should be established in the cities of Sirjan and Tehran, while smaller dry ports should be built in the cities of Isfahan, and Ahvaz. Also, the model suggests that the seaports of Chabahar and Anzali should be connected to Iran’s national railway network so that the transportation of goods from them to dry ports on the hinterlands in Sirjan and Tehran can be done at a lower cost.",1366-5545,Not found
Blockchain adoption for combating remanufacturing perceived risks in a reverse supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103448,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Remanufacturing provides excellent opportunities for socially responsible firms to achieve sustainable operations, benefiting manufacturers, consumers, and the environment. However, the market for remanufactured products faces challenges due to perceived risks, with consumers often expressing concerns about the quality and provenance of remanufactured parts. The advent of blockchain technology offers a promising solution for reverse supply chain players to manage these perceived risks. This study develops a game-theoretical model to investigate the incentives of reverse supply chain players to adopt blockchain technology to mitigate remanufacturing perceived risk. We examine consumer preferences for new and remanufactured products under different blockchain adoption strategies. Our findings indicate that choosing an appropriate blockchain adoption strategy can increase the remanufacturing rate. However, blockchain adoption does not necessarily expand market share. The optimal blockchain adoption strategy is determined by quality distrust and unit blockchain cost. When quality distrust is low and the unit blockchain cost is intermediate, investing in blockchain technology for new products can result in a triple-win outcome for the OEM, the recycler, and the environment. If quality distrust is high and the unit blockchain cost is not excessive, investing in blockchain technology for remanufactured products can also lead to a triple-win outcome. However, when both factors are low, no blockchain adoption strategy benefits the recycler or the environment, and there is a risk of the OEM overinvesting. We further investigate the effects of heterogeneous blockchain adoption costs, government regulations, and endogenized pricing by a third party on triple-win regions. This study offers valuable insights for reverse supply chain players on how to leverage emerging technologies to address remanufacturing perceived risk.",1366-5545,Not found
Revenue-sharing in the alliance of inland river and sea carriers: Formulation and a case study,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103419,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This paper investigates the market dynamics and welfare implications when river and sea carriers may compete and collaborate in an inland river market. A vertical-structure model that considers the interactions among ports, river and sea carriers, and shippers is proposed. The port operator sets port service charges to maximize social welfare of the river-sea transport system. The sea carrier maximizes own profit by determining the inland river ports to collaborate and the waterway freight rates for the river-sea and seagoing transport services. The river carrier maximizes own profit by determining its waterway freight rates for the inland river transport services and the revenue that it shares with the sea carrier. Two cases are considered: (i) the competition case in which the river and sea carriers compete with each other; and (ii) the alliance case in which the river and sea carriers share revenue with each other. The results suggest that there are markets where the alliance between river and sea carriers can make both of them better off (i.e., win–win outcome), which also increases the social welfare of the system. However, port charges may need to be adjusted to balance carriers’ pricing, although the waterway freight rates paid by shippers may not be changed. Due to waterway depth limitation, the win–win outcome tends to be more difficult to achieve in upstream ports with more shallow waterways, whereas increased transfer time at transfer ports favors direct sea-river shipping services. The river and sea carrier alliance has potential to benefit the shipping industry and the public. However, such an alliance may not be feasible to form for all inland ports, and government intervention on port service charge may be justified.",1366-5545,Not found
A spatial–temporal graph-based AI model for truck loan default prediction using large-scale GPS trajectory data,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103445,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"With the increasing uncertainties in freight transportation, truck loans are playing a crucial role in the stability and development of the logistics industry. A pivotal problem to truck loan management is controlling credit risk. Much research has focused on pre-loan default prediction considering applicants’ static personal information. However, few studies concentrate on post-loan risk control, which needs to track customers’ dynamic behaviors to ensure the loans can be recovered. We propose a Spatial–temporal Graph-based AI model for Truck loan Default prediction (SGTD) in post-loan management, which considers spatial and temporal dependencies of customers’ dynamic behaviors using large-scale GPS trajectory data. (1) The spatial dependency is caused by the functional similarity of the trajectories, which is only relevant to people’s travel habits and purposes. Therefore, we detect stay points from the nationwide trajectories and represent them with point-of-interest (POI) information as POI nodes. Then, we learn the latent vectors of POI nodes in a heterogeneous network through metapath learning, which are utilized to initialize vectors in modeling the temporal dependencies. (2) To learn temporal dependencies, we split the long trajectory into period sequences according to the cyclical nature of truck loans. Then we model each sequence with graph neural networks to capture the short-term closeness and period dependencies. Finally, we introduce LSTM networks to learn the long-term trend dependency and predict the default probability. The outcomes of extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SGTD in AUC, KS, accuracy, and F1-score, as well as the practical economic contribution. The results also implicate that GPS data can contribute to learning drivers’ socioeconomic information, and the proposed method is applicable to other transportation scenarios.",1366-5545,Not found
The strategic analysis of collection delivery points network sharing in last-mile logistics market,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103423,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In last-mile delivery, due to its efficiency advantage over home delivery, collection delivery points (CDP) strategy is adopted widely by express companies but implemented in different modes: some express companies build CDP networks by themselves but some other cooperate with third-party CDP networks. In recent years, a new business-to-business sharing mode has emerged: express companies with CDP networks share them with those without. Motivated by this phenomenon, to examine express companies’ CDP network sharing strategy, we consider a competitive express service market comprising one express company with CDP network (CDP provider) and one without (CDP receiver). We find that the CDP network sharing always benefits CDP provider. However, interestingly, it hurts CDP receiver when CDP strategy’s efficiency advantage is large. Therefore, CDP provider can lower the usage fee charged to stimulate CDP receiver to accept the sharing offer. Consequently, CDP provider can always reach an agreement on CDP sharing with CDP receiver. Furthermore, we examine the impact of CDP sharing on market potential. More interestingly, CDP sharing leads to a double-win outcome in certain situations, even though it has some negative impact on market potential. Our findings provide implications for express companies having options to participate in CDP network sharing.",1366-5545,Not found
The evasion strategy options for competitive ocean carriers under the EU ETS,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103439,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"To cut pollution at sea, The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) plans to include the shipping industry. Carriers may evade EU ETS by adding a non-EU port-of-call as their first port-of-call to EU ports. In this context, we develop a game model to analyze the incentives of two competing carriers to adopt the port-of-call strategy and the effect of EU ETS. Moreover, based on the European line, an empirical study is carried out to explore potential ways to improve the effect of the EU ETS. We show that carriers have a stronger incentive to adopt the port-of-call strategy when the carbon quota price is high. It is observed that a win-win situation arises when both carriers adopt the port-of-call strategy, which represents the Pareto-optimal choice. Conversely, if both carriers opt for the direct access strategy, it will result in a lose-lose situation similar to the typical Prisoner's Dilemma. Interestingly, we also find that EU ETS is not always effective in reducing emissions and may, in some cases, even increase carbon emissions.",1366-5545,Not found
Elastic-demand bi-criteria traffic assignment under the continuously distributed value of time: A two-stage gradient projection algorithm with graphical interpretations,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103425,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In this paper, we study the elastic-demand bi-criteria traffic assignment problem under the continuously distributed value of time, referred to as the ED-CBiTA problem for simplicity. Specifically, the origin and destination (O–D) demand of ED-CBiTA is endogenously guided by the expected generalized travel time aggregated from all efficient paths, and the consideration of user heterogeneity regarding the tradeoff between time and toll is accomplished by incorporating a continuously distributed value of time. We present a variable demand formulation and an equivalent excess demand reformulation for the ED-CBiTA problem. Based on two types of Gauss–Seidel decomposition schemes, we propose a novel two-stage gradient projection (TSGP) algorithm, which implicitly delivers visual interpretations to depict the interplay of supply and demand interactions. The first stage, called demand equilibration, aims to adjust O–D demand and all efficient path flows “vertically upward or downward” based on the level of network congestion. The second stage, namely boundary equilibration, is to perform the boundary movements and adjust adjacent efficient flows “horizontally forward or backward”, to achieve exact positions along the Pareto frontier. Numerical results on a small network show TSGP’s features and confirm that TSGP significantly outperforms two link-based benchmark algorithms. For instances of practical network size, TSGP consistently promises to obtain high-quality solutions with a rather smaller CPU time.",1366-5545,Not found
Quality disclosure strategy with asymmetric demand information in food supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103427,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The effects of food product quality disclosure on enhancing food quality transparency have drawn wide attention to food supply chain management. However, demand information asymmetry in the vertical direction of food supply chains hinders the supplier’s quality disclosure due to the fact that the supplier is uncertain whether the profits brought by quality disclosure can offset the disclosure costs. To overcome this challenge, this paper analyzes the information interaction in food supply chains including one leading supplier who provides consumers food with uncertain quality information and two following retailers who own demand information privately; the supplier provides preservation service for the food to stimulate the demand and makes the quality disclosure decision based on the profit trade-off between disclosure and not disclosure. Our research shows that cost-effective preservation service can stimulate two retailers to share information. To avoid high information leakage, two retailers will face the prisoner’s dilemma when they achieve the final equilibrium under certain conditions. If the supplier discloses information about food with high quality, it will deepen the information leakage. Higher preservation service efficiency can avoid the retailers’ prisoner’s dilemma, whereas information disclosure of high-quality products may make the prisoner’s dilemma worse. The numerical example shows that more accurate information signals and more intense competition urge the supplier to disclose quality information. A subsidy mechanism is designed for the supplier to motivate the retailers to provide information, which enables supply chain members to gain more profits.",1366-5545,Not found
Pareto truck fleet sizing for bike relocation with stochastic demand: Risk-averse multi-stage approximate stochastic programming,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103418,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Bike-sharing systems play an important role in the multimodal transit system. This study investigates the truck fleet sizing problem for bike relocation that integrates strategic and tactical decisions taking into account the stochastic nature of demand. We develop a multi-period bike relocation model at the tactical level and derive the bike shortage formulation coupling relocation decisions with midterm demand. Based on this thorough analysis, the objective of spatial fairness of bike shortage is explicitly measured. The problem is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic programming model to capture the demand uncertainty, in which bike relocation decisions relating to station inventory are integrated with decisions that determine the truck fleet size. We develop a data-driven multi-stage scenario tree generation approach that can incorporate midterm demand spatial and temporal dependence. To prevent the loss of information and mitigate the “curse of dimensionality”, we propose a novel “multi-stage approximate stochastic programming” by integrating the traditional multi-stage stochastic programming and Response Surface Methodology. A conditional value-at-risk criterion ( CVaR ) is introduced into each decision node to capture the service provider’s risk aversion and make more informed decisions (and thus the risk-hedging ability of the solution). To work with this nonconvex model, we develop a fast and effective hybrid metaheuristic algorithm. The modeling approach and algorithm are tested on a large-scale case in New York. Results show that there is a trade-off between total cost minimization and bike shortage equilibration. We also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our stochastic model and discuss practical implications relative to the deterministic model.",1366-5545,Not found
Handling uncertainty in train timetable rescheduling: A review of the literature and future research directions,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103429,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"External and internal factors can cause disturbances or disruptions in daily train operations, leading to deviations from official timetables and passenger delays. As a result, efficient train timetable rescheduling (TTR) methods are necessary to restore disrupted train services. Although TTR has been a popular research topic in recent years, the uncertain characteristics of railways have not been sufficiently addressed. This review first identifies the primary uncertainties of TTR and examines their impacts on both TTR and passenger routing during disturbances or disruptions. It finds that only a few uncertainties have been investigated, and the existing solution methods do not adequately meet practical requirements, such as considering the dynamic nature of disturbances or disruptions, which is crucial for real-world applications. Therefore, the review highlights problems associated with TTR uncertainties that need urgent attention and suggests promising methodologies that could effectively address these issues as future research directions.

"Managing evacuation of multiclass traffic flow: Fleet configuration, lane allocation, lane reversal, and cross elimination",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103430,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Multiclass traffic dynamic evacuation is a challenging task considering heterogeneous populations and traffic congestion. Based on a novel objective function of minimizing evacuation network clearance time (ENCT), this paper proposes a multiclass traffic dynamic evacuation planning (MTDEP) model, which determines both fleet demand and road supply management strategies, including multiclass vehicles configuration, lane allocation, lane reversal, and cross-elimination intersections. In this model, a road network is discretized into a multi-size cell network to load multiclass traffic, and the vehicle-holding problem of the relaxed cell transmission model (CTM) is eliminated by adding the penalty term. Then, we linearize the proposed model into a mixed-integer linear program, and develop a Kriging surrogate-based optimization (KSBO) algorithm. We test our proposed model and algorithms on both a six-link network and the Sioux-Falls network. Numerical results indicate that (a) the evacuation efficiency of using multiclass vehicles is better than using a homogeneous fleet of vehicles in a certain evacuation demand range; (b) while the collaborative management strategies could improve evacuation efficiency, they also take into account the ENCT gap of multiclass vehicles; and (c) the vehicle-holding problem does not affect ENCT but increases the total travel time of all evacuees, which should be eliminated.",1366-5545,Not found
Effects of product substitutability and power relationships on performance in triadic supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103422,183,2024-03-01,2024,3,"With the development of the retail industry and the increasing complexity of the power relationship between common retailers and manufacturers, research on product substitutability has become increasingly critical for operational management and decision-making regarding substitutable products. We investigated the effects of product substitutability on retail prices, profits, and social welfare for a triadic supply chain comprised of a retailer and two competing manufacturers. We then extended our analysis to the Nash bargaining game to evaluate the impact of product substitutability and bargaining power on equilibrium in a multiunit bilateral negotiation. The findings revealed that product homogeneity can harm the profits of manufacturers and the overall supply chain. In contrast, product substitutability’s impact on the profits of retailers depends on the inter-firm power relationship. Moreover, the retailer’s profit was found to consistently increase with respect to substitutability in a manufacturer Stackelberg model, but not so in the vertical Nash and retailer Stackelberg models. We also explored the effect of power structure on supply chain performance.

In this study, we construct a game-theoretic model of competitive heterogeneous ports. The research conclusions indicate that the adoption of AI technology by heterogeneous ports can enhance port profits. Unfortunately, simultaneous adoption exacerbates homogenized competition, posing a threat to profit realization. Furthermore, while the hub port can leverage AI-empowered capabilities to strengthen own competitiveness, it can undermine the performance of competitors and society at large.

Gate appointment design in a container terminal: A robust optimization approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103495,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Gate congestion is a main challenge faced by container terminals worldwide. In the scenario of gate congestion, the long waiting line of container trucks can block the traffic into the terminal, leading to disrupted terminal operations and unsatisfactory operating efficiency. In this paper, we study a gate appointment design problem that aims to manage the number of trucks allowed to a container terminal over time, so as to minimize the length of the truck waiting line and alleviate gate congestion. To optimize the gate appointment strategy, the truck service plans need also be devised, which involve the decisions for assigning trucks to yard blocks for container transhipment. We develop a two-stage robust optimization model for the problem by taking into account the uncertain service capacities of the yard blocks. Our model considers two decision stages, where the first-stage decision allocates slot capacities for the appointment slots, whereas the second-stage decision designs truck service plans with observed yard service capacity. We solve the two-stage robust model using an adapted column-and-row generation algorithm. In each iteration of the adapted column-and-row generation algorithm, the second-stage decision is generated by means of a pseudo-polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm, while the first-stage decision is generated by a tailored scenario decomposition method. We test the computational performance of the proposed solution method on instances generated from real terminal operation data, and reveal managerial insights that would inspire terminal operators in the management of truck appointment for gate congestion mitigation.",1366-5545,Not found

Our findings revealed that the e-SQ of LSCs has a significant positive impact on the e-satisfaction (e-SA) and e-LY of their customers. Additionally, we observed that trust plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between e-SA and e-LY. Through benchmark analysis, we found that for small-scale shippers, virtually no slack exists between their benchmark and actual perception. However, the slack increased as the scale of the shipper increased, implying that LSCs have provided an e-SQ that exceeds the expectations of their large-scale customers. Meanwhile, it’s crucial for LSCs to pay attention to specific aspects such as the architecture of e-commerce platforms and privacy protection because the slacks of these e-SQ items are relatively small. Furthermore, the large slacks in e-LY for large-scale shippers imply that their e-LY leaves much room for improvement compared with that of small-scale shippers. Overall, our study underscores the importance of maintaining or elevating e-SQ standards to reinforce e-LY while considering the mediating and moderating effects of e-SA and trust in the context of the e-commerce platforms provided by major LSCs.",1366-5545,Not found

A multi-objective optimization model for medical waste recycling network design under uncertainties,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103492,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Transporting medical waste (MW) generated by medical institutions (MIs) is a process that poses potential threats to the environment and public safety. Therefore, it is vital to find a safe and efficient way to transport this type of waste to disposal centers (DCs). However, there are challenges in the transportation of MW due to random factors such as the generation of waste in an unpredictable manner and unforeseen travel times. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization model to minimize site selection costs, transportation costs, time-window penalties costs, and transportation risks under uncertainties. The concepts of “loading reliability”, “travel time reliability” and “transportation risk” are adopted in the proposed optimization model. The simulated annealing algorithm (SA) is employed to address the optimal location problem (Upper level), which involves minimizing the construction cost, transportation cost (DC-CP-DC), and transportation risk (estimated using Bayesian method). To tackle the capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem considering transportation risk and time window penalties (Lower level), we propose an improved genetic algorithm named harmony search algorithm (IHSGA). Subsequently, the results from the lower level are looped back to the upper level, fostering mutual influence between the two stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed model and algorithm using S city in China as an illustrative example. Furthermore, a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of various factors.

Motivated by new flexible buses and ride-sharing services, this paper explores a flexible airport bus service that integrates ride-sharing services for passengers traveling from bus stops to their destinations. This problem entails integrated decisions involving bus stop selection, passenger assignment to drop-off bus stops, as well as bus and ride-sharing routing. Accordingly, this problem presents more challenges in decision-making than traditional flexible bus or ride-sharing routing problems. We first develop an arc-based mixed-integer linear programming model. Subsequently, we design a double decomposition math-heuristic algorithm that builds upon logic-based Benders decomposition and column generation algorithms to obtain a near-optimal solution within practical computation time limits for practical-scale instances. Additionally, we implement an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm to evaluate the solution quality of this math-heuristic algorithm and to solve large-scale instances. To validate the effectiveness of both the model and the algorithms, we conduct numerical experiments using instances derived from Shenzhen airport bus lines. The experimental results demonstrate that the flexible service mode offers significant advantages in reducing both passenger ride time and vehicle mileage over traditional airport bus or taxi modes.",1366-5545,Not found
A scenario-based robust approach for joint planning of multi-blood product logistics and multi-casualty type evacuation,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103493,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This paper presents a two-stage hybrid robust programming model that integrates multiple blood products scheduling and multiple casualty types evacuation under facility disruptions risk and casualty number uncertainty. The model seeks to maximize the rescue efficiency and minimize the total operations cost. Under a set of disruption scenarios, we adopt a scenario-based robust method to address disruption risks at temporary medical centres and two robust uncertainty sets to deal with uncertain casualty numbers. We propose a proximal bundle algorithm to solve large-scale instances of the proposed hybrid robust model approximately. Extensive numerical experiments show that: (i) the trade-off between model robustness and solution robustness can help the decision-makers determine an appropriate risk-aversion weight; (ii) compared with the corresponding stochastic and scenario-based robust models, the hybrid robust model can obtain more robust solutions with a slight increase in cost; (iii) the proximal bundle algorithm can produce near-optimal solutions within reasonable computational times; (iv) some model parameters have significant impact on the total cost, which can help decision-makers set the appropriate parameters to achieve the desired outcome.

Synchronizing crowdsourced co-modality between passenger and freight transportation services,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103490,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This study introduces a synchronized passenger and freight co-modality problem (SPFCP), exploring a crowdsourced co-modality transportation mode where passengers, viewed as an external crowd, volunteer to participate in logistics activities in exchange for compensation. In SPFCP, decision-makers have the option to utilize both crowdsourced passengers (CPs) and self-operated professional couriers (PCs) for deliveries. We formalize the problem and employ a population-based variable neighborhood search to solve it. Our findings indicate that the availability of CPs crucially enhances delivery capacity and efficiency, with the system benefiting from a larger pool of CPs and a higher variability in their travel distances. However, challenges arise from extreme average parcel distances, necessitating precise matching for short distances and extensive crowdsourced resources for long distances. The study underscores the viability of integrating crowdsourced logistics into urban transport systems, suggesting a strategic balance between leveraging crowdsourced solutions and managing logistical complexities.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimizing bike rebalancing strategies in free-floating bike-sharing systems: An enhanced distributionally robust approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103477,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Bike-sharing systems are important components of urban transportation systems that facilitate short-distance travel. In recent years, free-floating bike-sharing systems have become popular. However, a major problem in such systems is the increasing number of idle bikes due to their spatial dispersion, which leads to a loss of demand and difficulty in bike rebalancing. To overcome these drawbacks, operators reserve parking areas, and laborers are incorporated into the bike rebalancing operation. We propose a novel dynamic bike rebalancing strategy based on trucks and laborers for free-floating bike-sharing systems. This strategy combines bike collection by laborers and bike transportation by trucks for rebalancing operations. In addition, we consider broken bike detection by laborers and user dynamics in two extension models. Because of the demand uncertainty in bike-sharing systems, we employ an enhanced distributionally robust optimization (EDRO) approach to protect against uncertainty. A target-level constraint is added to the general distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model to further improve the out-of-sample performance. An adaptive robust strategy is also employed to avoid overly conservative solutions. Furthermore, a linear decision rule is adopted to reformulate the EDRO model into a mixed-integer programming model, which guarantees computational tractability. The results of numerical experiments show that the EDRO model outperforms other benchmark models on a series of measures. Moreover, we verify the value of laborers in dynamic rebalancing operations and explore the effect of different bike supply levels and several other parameters on the value of laborers. We also test how the target-level parameter affects the model performance.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimizing consolidated shared charging and electric ride-sourcing services,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103484,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The shortage of charging facilities under the trend of transportation electrification brings a significant challenge to electric ride-sourcing operations. As a component of sharing economy, flourishing shared charging consolidates idle charging resources, providing a promising solution to this problem. We propose a shared charging program where the ride-sourcing platform acts as an intermediary and rents shareable charging posts from private post owners to facilitate the charging demand of ride-sourcing drivers. A utility-based modeling framework is established to dissect the intricate behavioral interactions among post owners, drivers, and riders. The analytical results reveal that supply and demand monotonicity with respect to shared charging fee and commission rate varies with different returns to scale of riders' waiting time functions. Then, we mathematically derive the first-order optimality solutions of the joint decisions on shared charging (i.e., rental fee, and charging fee) and ride-sourcing (i.e., commission rate, and price) sectors under monopoly optimality and social optimality, respectively. The platform can adopt a relatively high shared charging fee and low rental fee to gain more profit when the rider demand is insensitive to the commission rate. If the government focuses more on the private post owner surplus, it should ensure relatively high price elasticity under optimal pricing to better protect their welfare. Finally, we numerically discuss how potential shared charging posts impact the market states and compare the outcomes between ride-sourcing-only and shared charging programs. It is found that the shared charging service improves the platform profit, social welfare, rider surplus, and driver surplus, while inducing higher commission rates and prices. The economic analysis gains insights into shared charging for electric ride-sourcing services and highlights the potential of sharing solutions in promoting sustainable urban mobility services.",1366-5545,Not found

Based on the method of successive averages, an improved bi-loop algorithm is designed to solve the model.

Pricing and inventory strategies for perishable products in a competitive market considering strategic consumers,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103478,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In recent years, the rapid development of information technology has not only given rise to the precise implementation of dynamic pricing but also enabled consumers to strategically time their purchases to pay less. This study explores how sellers counteract the adverse effects of strategic consumer behavior and examines the pricing and inventory strategies of two sellers who sell perishable products from regular selling season to clearance season. Each seller uses one of the two pricing strategies, namely dynamic pricing and price commitment. If both sellers use the dynamic pricing strategy, they may set larger inventories to avoid direct competition in the regular selling season. If a seller can make a credible price commitment, a discounted price slightly lower than the regular price will be pre-announced, by which they are more likely to charge higher prices. If both sellers use the price commitment strategy, they have to commit to lower discounted prices owing to intense price competition. A simultaneous pricing strategy game, in which both sellers can strategically choose dynamic pricing or price commitment, is then conducted. The results show that, in contrast to most existing studies, price commitment may not perform well in a competitive market. By contrast, dynamic pricing demonstrates its benefits to sellers, especially when the loss in product value is insignificant.",1366-5545,Not found
Pricing strategy and platform competition with partial multi-homing agents: When the aggregation platform exists in ride-sharing market,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103483,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"As the platform of Ride-Sharing Platforms (RSPs), the Aggregation Platform (AP) integrates resources from RSPs which provide an on-demand car-sharing service by matching suitable passengers and drivers.

Research findings include whether RSP accesses the aggregation, the single-homing or multi-homing on the agents does not affect the agent fees both platforms charged. The multi-homing on agents makes the platform accessible to agents if the RSPs are not integrated into the aggregation platform. The multi-homing on agents makes the RSP subsidize agents, and AP charges higher fees to agents when RSP accesses the aggregation. Furthermore, under single-homing or multi-homing on the agents, the RSP with access to the aggregation will permanently harm its service providers but benefit AP and social welfare in specific conditions.

Platform vs. 3PL financing: Strategic choice of lending model for an e-tailer under operational risk,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103459,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In addition to providing logistics services, third-party logistics (3PL) firms (e.g., S.F. Express) have recently started extending financial services to capital-constrained e-tailers (referred to as 3PL financing (LF)). Another novel financing mode available for e-tailers is platform financing (PF), in which online platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba provide loans to e-tailers on their platforms. Both LF and PF facilitate trade in a capital-constrained supply chain. However, in the presence of an e-tailer’s operational risk, the lenders are exposed to credit risk, which can negatively impact the whole supply chain. Moreover, when both financing modes are available, the e-tailer must develop an optimal borrowing strategy. Multiple factors, such as bankruptcy cost, referral fee, and shipping fee, can significantly influence players’ financing decisions. Therefore, this paper examines supply chain members’ optimal operational and financing decisions under LF and PF. We study a three-tier supply chain in which an e-tailer, exposed to operational risk, procures a product from a supplier via the 3PL firm and resells it to end customers through the online platform. The e-tailer obtains the working capital either through LF or PF. We find that at low (high) levels of operational risk, the e-tailer chooses LF (PF). Surprisingly, the 3PL firm and the platform do not always benefit from the LF and PF. We recommend a decision support framework for the e-tailer’s optimal financing strategy for different product categories based on its operational risk. We show that for products with a low (moderate and high) referral fee, LF (PF) achieves a win-win-win outcome under low (high) operational risk. Further analysis shows that the e-tailer’s initial working capital, logistics, and product costs can alter the players’ financing decisions.",1366-5545,Not found
Explainable train delay propagation: A graph attention network approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103457,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Explaining train delay propagation using influence factors (to find the determinants) is essential for transport planning and train operation management. Due to high interpretability to train operations, graph/network models, e.g., Bayesian networks and alternative graphs, are extensively used in the train delay propagation/prediction problem. In these graph/network models, nodes represent train arrival/departure/passage events, whereas arcs describe train headway/running/dwelling processes. However, previously proposed graph/network models do not have edge weights, making them incapable of apperceiving the diverse influences of factors on train delay propagation/prediction. The train dwelling, running, and headway times vary over time, space, and train services. This potentially makes these factors have diverse strengths on train operations. We innovatively use the Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model the train delay propagation. An attention mechanism is used in the GAT model, allowing the GAT model to have arcs with diverse weights (learned from data). This enables the GAT model to discern the nodes’ diverse influences; thus, with the learned importance coefficients, the model can be distinctly explained by the influencing factors. Further, the model’s accuracy is expected to be improved, because the GAT model (with the attention mechanism) can pay more attention (represented by the learned weights) to the significant factors/nodes. The proposed GAT model was calibrated on operation data from the Dutch railway network. The results show that: (1) the influence factors contribute diversely to the delay propagation, and the train headway is the determinant of train delay propagation; (2) the accuracy of the proposed GAT model is significantly improved (because of the attention mechanism), compared against other state-of-the-art graph/network models. In a word, the proposed GAT method improves the interpretability of delay propagation and the accuracy of delay prediction.",1366-5545,Not found
Equilibrium analysis for on-demand food delivery markets,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103467,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"With the popularity of smartphones and the mobile internet, on-demand food and grocery delivery services have experienced rapid development in recent years. A food delivery platform dispatches crowd-sourced drivers to pick up meals at merchants, e.g., restaurants and grocery supermarkets, and then deliver the meals to customers. Apart from setting the delivery price paid by customers and the wage offered to drivers, the platform can also adjust the number of customers’ orders assigned to one driver in each batch (denoted as assignment factor) to affect the market equilibrium and achieve certain objectives. This paper develops a mathematical model to characterize the equilibrium state of an on-demand food delivery market, and investigate the platform’s optimal operating strategies in terms of the delivery price, wage and assignment factor for maximizing the platform profit or social welfare. In particular, we consider two market scenarios depending on whether the meals are ready before the drivers arrive at the merchants’ locations to pick them up. It is interesting to find that the platform will choose a strategy that leads to the scenario in which the meals are ready as the drivers arrive at the merchants.

A ridesharing routing problem for airport riders with electric vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103470,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This paper proposes a ridesharing routing problem for airport riders motivated by a practical application. This problem designs routes for electric vehicles owned by an airport to provide pickup and delivery service for riders both departing from and traveling to the airport. To maintain a high quality of ridesharing service, it is assumed that drivers should ensure that all riders on board from the airport are completely delivered before they pick up new riders to the airport. The departure time from the airport and the return time to the airport of electric vehicles are affected by the flight schedules of riders. Additionally, due to the limited driving range of electric vehicles, the partial recharging at the airport is considered. The proposed ridesharing routing problem is formulated as a trip-based mixed integer linear programming model. An efficient method is proposed to enumerate all non-dominated feasible trips to form a trip-based graph for the model. A branch-and-price algorithm is developed to solve the proposed problem, in which a tailored labeling algorithm with feasibility checking process is designed to solve the pricing subproblem. The numerical experiments indicate that the trip-based model is more efficient compared with the rider-based model, and the proposed branch-and-price algorithm could solve large scale instances efficiently.

Optimising modular-autonomous-vehicle transit service employing coupling–decoupling operations plus skip-stop strategy,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103450,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Modular autonomous vehicles (MAVs) have enormous potential to accommodate spatio-temporally imbalanced demand by coupling and decoupling flexibly in operation. The existing work in the literature on MAV service mode design is focused on the matching between supply and demand not at the bus-stop level but at the bus-route level. To fill the gap, this work proposes a novel MAV service mode that incorporates coupling–decoupling operations en route plus skip-stop strategy and simultaneously determines the number of MAVs and headways required for each trip, MAVs’ coupling and decoupling scheme, and each MAV’s skip-stop scheme. A mathematical programming formulation is devised to minimize the total cost of a transit service to the operator and to the passengers by using a trip-extended network approach while environmental impacts of energy consumption savings are considered with the operation of coupling multiple MAVs as a platoon. A case study of a real-world bus line in Dandong, China, shows that, compared with the prevailing service modes with no coupling–decoupling operation at intermediate stops or a skip-stop strategy, the mode designed in this work reduces the total cost of the transit system by 9.87 % – 32.09 % and the passenger travel cost by 17.92 % – 38.54 % .",1366-5545,Not found
A decomposition approach for robust omnichannel retail operations considering the third-party platform channel,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103466,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In recent years, third-party platforms (3PPs), such as Amazon, have attracted considerable interest from omnichannel retailers as a sales channel option. Even though omnichannel retailers have their own offline and online channels, they have participated in the fulfillment service of 3PPs to absorb additional demand from the 3PP channel. To the best of our knowledge, no existing study has addressed the robust omnichannel retail operations utilizing the channel of 3PPs as one of a retailer’s sales channels. To fill these research gaps, this paper formulates omnichannel retail operations with the 3PP channel into a multi-period stochastic optimization model. The proposed model involves the supply chain networks of the retailer and 3PP and also the production capacity constraint, which restricts replenishment quantity depending on the production capacity of each supplier. Unfortunately, the existence of the 3PP channel and the production capacity constraint increases the computational complexity; thus, the problem cannot be solved within an acceptable computational time by using the existing approach (i.e., a two-phase approach (TPA) based on robust optimization). To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel decomposition approach called DECOM. DECOM has a distinct advantage in that it can decompose the proposed problem into two small problems, one for the retailer’s supply chain and the supply chain of the 3PP. We evaluate the performance of DECOM by comparing it with the TPA on a set of experiments carried out in various experimental settings. Both DECOM and TPA could provide high-quality solutions, but DECOM outperformed TPA in terms of computational efficiency. In particular, we observed that DECOM was scalable to large-scale instances. Furthermore, we explored the advantages of utilizing omnichannel retail operations and the 3PP channel by performing a sensitivity analysis. In particular, we showed the cost-saving effect resulting from the introduction of the 3PP channel in omnichannel retailing.",1366-5545,Not found

In an automated container terminal with a parallel layout, artificial intelligence robots of transportation (ARTs) and external trucks (ETs) are critical vehicles that connect the quayside, yard side, and hinterland. The operational management of ARTs and ETs is complex because of various factors affecting their operational performance, such as vehicle congestion, limited handover point capacity, limited crane operation capacity, and intersection of ARTs and ETs. This study considers the ART and ET scheduling problem, which involves the task assignment of ARTs and the sequencing of all operations for ARTs and ETs. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to minimize the delay time for all ART and ET tasks. However, since the problem is NP-hard, the MILP model cannot be efficiently solved for realistic-scale instances. Therefore, we reformulate the original model into a route-based model and propose a tailored branch-and-price heuristic algorithm to solve the new formulation.

The design of a park-and-ride system depends on its role in regards to the broader transportation network. Reconfigurable park-and-ride systems aim to provide complementary shared mobility services in the context of varying travel demand scenarios, such as special events, network maintenance operations or non-recurrent perturbations. The design of reconfigurable park-and-ride systems involves the location of access and egress hubs for shared mobility services. We study an extended version of this hub location problem with integrated fleet assignment decisions. We consider stochastic scenarios representative of varying travel demand and traffic conditions on the network and propose a two-stage stochastic integer programming hub location formulation for this problem. First-stage variables represent hub location decision while second-stage variables represent both scenario-based transportation flows and fleet assignment decisions. The latter represent shared mobility service vehicles and they are modeled as integer variables. We develop solution methods to solve this two-stage stochastic integer programming hub location formulation. Exact approaches based on the L-shaped method are proposed with single- and multi-cut configurations. Valid inequalities along with a tight lower bound for the generation of optimality cuts are presented. We also develop a matheuristic to solve larger problem instances.

The planning horizon is divided into two stages, with the endogenously determined switching time between the two happening when a predefined capacity threshold is reached. We characterize the optimal decisions in both stages and provide a series of numerical illustrations varying the model’s parameter values. Our main findings are as follows: (i) the price decreases when switching from the first to the second stage; (ii) emissions are above the industry standard during the first stage, while they are considerably below it in the second stage; (iii) the higher the capacity threshold for emissions reduction technologies, the larger the time it takes to reach it, which is costly in terms of reputation; (iv) although the consumers judge the manufacturer’s environmental performance in relative terms with respect to the industry standard, we get that an increase in this standard has a small effect on the switching date.

Inventory management with actual palletized transportation costs and lost sales,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103462,184,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Pallets are widely used for bulk shipping in the United States and Europe. In response to the call for more comprehensive research on inventory management that incorporates practical freight rates, this study investigates optimal inventory replenishment decisions by explicitly considering palletized shipping rates and lost sales in multi-product multi-period inventory system facing stochastic demand. We first introduce a stepwise transportation cost function that accurately captures real-world palletized less-than-truckload (LTL) and truckload (TL) shipment costs by accounting for both pallet quantity and truck capacity. We then formulate two novel inventory models that consider palletized freight transportation costs and the coexistence of LTL and TL shipments, with one model excluding lost sales and the other specifically incorporating lost sales. We apply both models to a wholesaler based in the Midwest, U.S., and analyze the effects of varying shipping rates and lost sales on inventory decisions. Our results show that the inclusion of lost sales in the inventory replenishment model can potentially reduce total costs for the company. Interestingly, our findings contradict prevailing industry practices of maximizing truck capacity, revealing that filling up the “free” space on a truck may increase total logistics costs. This holds true even when shipping rates are relatively high and lost sales are considered. Furthermore, our results suggest that joint optimization of transportation and inventory decisions may not be necessary when shipping costs are small relative to inventory costs and lost sales are not considered. However, as shipping rates increase and lost sales are factored in, a joint optimization that accounts for all factors can yield much greater savings.",1366-5545,Not found

We concentrate on the order timing decisions of retailers. If a retailer opts to delay the order, he/she may suffer from second-mover disadvantages, but he/she can obtain demand information. If not, he/she may gain first-mover advantages. We study the impact of downstream relative tax rate on transfer price and analyze the trade-off among first-mover advantages, second-mover disadvantages, and information value, to obtain the equilibrium results about the order timing of both retailers. We find that both the affiliated and non-affiliated retailers do not delay the order, when demand fluctuation and transfer price (downstream relative tax rate) are small under exogenous (endogenous) transfer price. This implies that they might be trapped in the “prisoner’s dilemma”. Also, the MNF is not able to maximize the profit in that region. Hence, the “prisoner’s dilemma” leads to a “lose-lose-lose” situation. To deal with that, we suggest that the governments should adjust the corporate income tax rates to assist MNFs in avoiding the “prisoner’s dilemma”.",1366-5545,Not found

However, these operators often have their own local networks and are hesitant to cede control to a centralized platform. Instead, they prefer to share limited information in a coordinated manner to achieve a common goal without sacrificing their own benefits. This paper proposes a coordinated mechanism for global synchromodal transport planning, in which a global operator proposes incentives to local operators to select the most efficient modes and routes for shipping containers from one continent to another. An augmented Lagrangian relaxation approach is developed for the global operator to generate incentives, and a heuristic algorithm is designed to address the computational complexity of the optimization problems faced by local operators. We incorporate the proposed approaches with a rolling horizon framework to handle dynamic shipment requests received from spot markets and with a buffer strategy to address travel time uncertainties. The coordinated mechanism is tested on a real network between Asia and Europe, and results show that it can significantly increase total profits, reduce request rejections, and reduce infeasible transshipments compared to decentralized global transportation plans currently in use, particularly under scenarios with higher degrees of dynamism and uncertainty.",1366-5545,Not found
"Assessing macro effects of freight consolidation on the livability of small cities using vehicle routing as micro models: The case of Bergen, Norway",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103521,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"This paper provides guidance for local authorities in small cities by equipping them with tools to comprehend and quantify freight consolidation within their urban areas, enabling them to integrate this into their regulatory decisions for enhanced city livability. Rather than advocating specific regulatory measures to facilitate consolidation, which is a political decision and can change over time, the paper establishes a basis for making informed policy decisions concerning consolidation. In this context, we focus on the perspective of authorities and, through an analysis of diverse market structures characterized by different degrees of consolidation, identify what is important to achieve in order to enhance city livability, measured by driven distance as well as the number and duration of stops. To this end, we propose a policy guidance framework tailored for authorities in small cities, adopting vehicle routing models as micro models to evaluate macro consolidation impacts for authorities. We apply the framework to a case that represents parcel distribution in Bergen, a small medieval city in Norway with a complicated street pattern and lack of parking, based on real maps and real demand patterns. Our findings suggest that small carriers take up a substantial space in the city, and increase the duration of stops while parking at various locations for parcel delivery. In this context, the city would benefit greatly from a market scheme, in which small carriers cannot deliver goods to end-customers, far more than moving between complete consolidation and a few reasonably large carriers.",1366-5545,Not found
Promoting intelligent IoT-driven logistics through integrating dynamic demand and sustainable logistics operations,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103539,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Developing a more convenient and sustainable logistics delivery operation model has become a consensus need for both academics and practitioners. However, the existing literature has focused on the impact of dynamic features of IoT customers on the distance cost of vehicles (DCV) and quantity cost of vehicles (QCV) in the field of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). Moreover, only a few application scenarios have been considered. This paper focuses on the perspective of intelligent logistics development to research the impact of IoT customers’ dynamic demand on the VRPTW. A mathematical model is established to respond to the dynamic demands of IoT customers with the goal of minimizing the distance cost. A strategy for solving the dynamic VRPTW (DVRPTW) based on time slices is developed, and an improved tabu search (I-TS) optimization algorithm is proposed to solve a given delivery business case. In simulation experiments, the proposed I-TS solution and another known best solution (namely, Solomon) are compared, and the results show the superior performance of the I-TS algorithm in reducing the DCV and QCV. Furthermore, the case study explores the relationship between the degree of dynamism (DoD), DCV and QCV under two scenarios (responding and not responding to dynamic demands of IoT customers). It is concluded that fluctuations of the DoD in a certain range affect only the DCV and not the QCV. Large-capacity vehicles can improve the robustness of the route scheme to dynamic demands. In addition, decomposing dynamic issues in space through time slicing effectively reduces the complexity of the DVRPTW solution. This research also aims to assist practitioners in better formulating dynamic delivery routes as well as policy makers in developing intelligent delivery operation models. Finally, limitations and future research directions are discussed.",1366-5545,Not found
Predictive analysis of sell-and-purchase shipping market: A PIMSE approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103532,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Estimating second-hand ship prices in the highly uncertain and cyclical ship trading market is a challenge due to its volatile nature. In this study, we propose a novel and highly interpretable model termed as the parsimonious intelligent model search engine (PIMSE), to investigate the relationship between key supply variables and the prices of second-hand oil tankers. Through empirical evaluation using a time series dataset spanning from 2002 to 2020, encompassing three types of oil tankers (VLCC, Suezmax, and Aframax), we assess the effectiveness and performance of PIMSE. The results demonstrate the superior performance of PIMSE compared to other estimation models in terms of its accuracy and stability. It can effectively address abrupt structural change and capture trend and seasonal variations in the time series data. Moreover, the high interpretability of PIMSE provides valuable insights into the factors that influence second-hand ship prices, empowering stakeholders in the shipping industry to make well-informed investment decisions. By leveraging PIMSE, decision-makers can gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics and navigate the complexities of the ship trading industry.

These delays infiltrate the air transportation network, precipitating disruptions to schedules and negatively impacting operational efficiency, passenger satisfaction, environmental considerations, and economic performance. Over the years, numerous methods have been developed for modeling flight delay propagation; however, a systematic review that encapsulates and synthesizes these approaches remains absent. This paper endeavors to examine the literature pertaining to flight delay propagation modeling, culminating in salient observations for future research potential.

Manufacturer blockchain technology adoption strategies for different sales channels in an e-commerce platform supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103507,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Blockchain technology (BT) adoption in a platform supply chain can provide consumers with reliable product information traceability, thus meeting consumer needs and improving product image, but bringing high BT adoption costs to the supply chain members. This work focuses on a dual-channel e-commerce platform supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and two platforms, i.e., a reselling platform and an agent platform, both with established blockchain systems. All four strategies for the manufacturer to adopt and not to adopt BT on the two platforms are examined. The results show that intuitively the manufacturer should (not) adopt BT in the two platforms when its BT adoption cost is low (high). Interestingly, the commission rate charged by the agent platform affects the manufacturer BT adoption decision when the BT adoption cost is moderate, and the manufacturer should adopt BT only in the channel with the agent (reselling) platform if the commission rate is low (high). Counterintuitively, adopting BT in the e-commerce platform supply chain does not necessarily increase product demand.

Implications of unobservable promotion on distribution channel strategies in a retail platform,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103502,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Besides distribution services, retail platforms are beginning to provide unobservable promotion services to enhance traffic and demand. Thus, suppliers are incentive to consider the impact of platform promotion on distribution channel strategies. Hence, considering a retail platform supply chain in which the supplier uses an outcome-based contract to incentivize the retail platform’s hidden promotion effort, this paper investigates the implications of unobservable platform promotion on the supplier’s distribution channel strategies. We develop a Stackelberg game model to examine the equilibrium outcomes of reselling and agency selling under unobservable promotion action and find that the retail platform may volunteer to promote in both channels when the market potential difference is large. Interestingly, voluntary promotion may motivate the supplier to increase the wholesale price. Furthermore, we derive conditions under which the supplier prefers reselling and agency selling. When the market potential difference is small, the distribution channel strategy is a threshold policy of the commission rate, below which agency selling is preferred, and reselling is preferred otherwise. It is counterintuitive that when the market potential difference is large, the commission rate will not influence the preference of channel selection and the reselling channel is always preferred by the supplier. Interestingly, the impact of platform promotion on the threshold of distribution channel strategies is non-monotonic in the increment probability of high market potential and market potential difference. Specifically, platform promotion induces the upstream supplier to select the reselling channel suppose the increment probability of high market potential is moderate, while induces the supplier to select the agency selling (reselling) channel when the market potential difference is moderate (large) suppose the increment probability of high market potential is high. Moreover, we find that enhancing the increment probability of high market potential benefits the supplier more, but only moderate increment probability of high market potential makes the retail platform better off.",1366-5545,Not found
Dynamic joint strategy of channel encroachment and logistics choice considering trade-in service and strategic consumers,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103528,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"As Internet technology develops rapidly, consumers’ consumption habits gradually shift from offline to online, and they are growing more strategic. In order to cater to strategic consumers, offline durable goods firms providing trade-in service are faced with practical issues of making dynamic strategies about whether establishing online channels and adopting which logistics service between self-logistics and third-party logistics (TPL) to deliver online orders. To tackle these problems, this study considers three scenarios and analyzes dynamic joint strategy of channel encroachment and logistics choice for a durable goods firm who owns an offline channel and offers trade-in service to strategic consumers via constructing a two-period game model. Results show that the firm’s dynamic joint strategy of channel encroachment and logistics choice will be affected by fixed operating cost, logistics service level difference and self-logistics cost. Moreover, trade-in service will have huge impacts on channel encroachment and logistics choice strategy. At last, when considering cap-and-trade policy, the service level of self-logistics and the cost of shipping used products, the optimal dynamic joint strategy of channel encroachment and logistics choice remains viable.",1366-5545,Not found
A real-time synchronous dispatching and recharging strategy for multi-line electric bus systems,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103516,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Improving the sharing rate is critical for electric bus systems to achieve their goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing system efficiency. This study presents a real-time synchronous dispatching and recharging strategy for multi-line electric bus systems to mitigate the adverse effects of operational randomness. The strategy integrates recharging requirements into real-time control decisions by synchronously determining dispatching and recharging plans for each bus based on continuously updated operational data. To implement this approach, models for bus operational state evolution and an objective function for minimizing passenger waiting time are formulated. These models are then solved using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique that combined clipped double Q-learning with soft actor-critic (SAC).

Cash flow dynamics in the supply chain during and after disruptions,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103526,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Supply chain resilience and the ripple effect have been widely studied, mostly focusing on material flow-related practices. The financial flow adjustments to cope with supply chain disruptions have received much less attention. We contribute to the literature by examining the impact of adapting payment terms during and after disruptions. In particular, we perform a discrete event simulation analysis in anyLogistix for a complex supply chain network to investigate the impact of adjusting payment terms on supply chain cash flows. Our results suggest that collaboratively adjusting payment terms is an effective strategy for coping with disruptions. In contrast, ad hoc adjustments and immediate returns to pre-disruption payment schemes do not yield visible improvements. Positive effects on cash and loans are observed if an adjustment of payment terms occurs proactively and in a coordinated manner, especially when expediting payments downstream and payment slowing down upstream. The results from our sensitivity analysis on the impact of accelerating/decelerating cash conversion cycles favour shorter cycles when coping with disruptions.

Manage morning commute for household travels with parking space constraints,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103504,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Parking has always been a thorny problem in urban transport systems. Parking availability and parking reservation management may have a significant influence on the travel behavior of household travelers. This paper explores the morning commute for household travels by considering parking space constraint and the parking reservation mechanism in a two-mode transport system. Household travelers depart from home to their children’s school by car or by rail and then go to work alone. For household travelers who drive, some household travelers have reserved parking spaces while other household travelers must compete for public ones on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis. When household travelers do not have a parking spot, they use rail transit for their commute. We derive ten equilibrium departure patterns based on the school-work time difference, the number of parking spots and the ratio of reserved parking spots. With these equilibrium departure patterns, we thoroughly discuss the impact of school-work time difference on the total travel cost of auto travelers and parking reservation ratio. It is found that, given the school-work time difference, appropriate parking reservation allocation can minimize the total system travel cost. Then, the system performance, including total system travel cost and total congestion cost, is examined by regulating the parking supply, the parking reservation allocation and the school-work time difference. We found that there is a unique optimal parking supply to minimize the total system travel cost, and appropriate staggering policy can alleviate traffic congestion and thus improves social welfare. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to verify the findings, and the Pareto frontier for system performance is analyzed. Traffic authorities can select the optimal solution based on the preferences of traffic indicators to develop effective strategies to manage morning commuting of household travels with parking space constraint. The study demonstrates that implementing reasonable staggering policy and efficient parking management can effectively promote efficiency of urban morning commuting systems and reduce social costs for household travelers.",1366-5545,Not found

The proposed framework also accounts for other methodological challenges underlined by literature such as spatial autocorrelation, selectivity and representativity issues, and possible anticipation effects.

Platform channel strategy of selling format: Effect of asymmetric service information,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103508,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"In platform-based retailing settings, product related services, e.g., product promotion, consulting service, fast order fulfillment, logistics service and even gift wrapping, may be offered by the upstream supplier or the downstream online platform, depending on whether the platform is operating under the agency or reselling format. Such service information may be asymmetric, which highly affects how and whether the online platform chooses the selling format. A platform’s optimal strategies of selling format selection and information sharing with asymmetric service information are explored in this work. We show that whether the reselling or agency format is adopted highly depends on which player can offer a high-type service. Specifically, when the platform can offer a high-type service and the service level difference is sufficiently large, it will prefer the reselling format, but the agency format otherwise. It is found that the optimal selling format selection directly affects the selling player’s information sharing strategy in the supply chain. In particular, the platform will always choose to share the asymmetric service information when it adopts the reselling format, but the supplier does not always do so when adopting the agency format.",1366-5545,Not found

A mixture of random and greedy partial charging scheduling strategies is used to find feasible charging schedules under the synchronization constraints. The algorithm is tested on instances with up to 100 customers and 49 bus stops/meeting points. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within less one minute on average compared with the best solutions found by a mixed-integer linear programming solver set with a 4-hour computation time limit.

A reinforcement learning-based hyper-heuristic for AGV task assignment and route planning in parts-to-picker warehouses,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103518,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Globally, e-commerce warehouses have begun implementing robotic mobile fulfillment systems (RMFS), which can improve order-picking efficiency by using automated guided vehicles (AGVs) to realize operations from parts to pickers. AGVs depart from their initial points, move to a target rack position, and subsequently transport racks to picking stations. The AGVs return the racks to their original positions after the workers pick them up. When all tasks are completed, the AGVs return to their starting point. In this context, the main challenge is the task assignment and route planning of multiple AGVs to minimize travel times. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with valid inequalities to solve small problem instances optimally. We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL)-based hyper-heuristic (HH) framework to solve large instances to near-optimality. A typical HH framework comprises two levels: high-level heuristics (HLH) and low-level heuristics (LLH). The framework starts from an initial solution and improves iteratively through LLHs, while the HLH invokes a selection strategy and an acceptance criterion to generate a new solution. We propose a novel selection strategy based on the improved Multi-Armed Bandits algorithm called Co-SLMAB and Exponential Monte Carlo with counters (EMCQ) as the acceptance criterion. The corresponding collision avoidance rules are then formulated for different conflicts to construct a conflict-free traveling route for AGVs. Besides testing the proposed framework’s effectiveness in real-life warehouse layouts, we perform extensive computational experiments and a thorough sensitivity analysis. The results show that (i) the proposed valid inequalities aid in obtaining better lower bounds and significantly speed up the solution process; (ii) the Co-SLMAB-HH framework is quite competitive compared to CPLEX, outperforming the other tested hyper-heuristics and the problem-specific heuristic regarding convergence and computation time; and (iii) a pool of LLHs consisting of a wide range of different operators is advantageous over a limited set of simple operators while solving problems using hyper-heuristics.",1366-5545,Not found

The multidepot vehicle routing problem with intelligent recycling prices and transportation resource sharing,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103503,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The increasing focus on environmental regulations and the economic advantages of recycling has spurred interest in the design of multidepot reverse logistics networks (MDRLNs). In these networks, the growing use of intelligent recycling bins (IRBs) has been beneficial for both product recycling and standardizing recycling product pricing. Furthermore, collaboration and resource sharing enhance the efficiency of resource utilization and recycling. This study proposes a multidepot vehicle routing problem with time windows that incorporates intelligent recycling prices (IRPs) and transportation resource sharing (MDVRPTW-IRPTRS). Initially, a linear function is developed to define the relationship between the volume of returned products and IRPs. Subsequently, the problem is expressed as a mathematical model aiming to minimize total operating costs and maximize total recycling profits. Additionally, a hybrid algorithm that combines a three-dimensional (3D) k-means clustering algorithm with a self-adapting genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization (SGA-PSO) is devised to determine the optimal solution for MDVRPTW-IRPTRS. The 3D k-means clustering algorithm is utilized to categorize IRBs within an MDRLN. The SGA-PSO algorithm incorporates elite preservation and self-adaptive update mechanisms to enhance the solution quality and algorithm convergence. A transportation resource sharing (TRS) strategy is integrated into the SGA-PSO, facilitating the allocation of shared vehicles to alternative recycling routes. A comparative analysis of SGA-PSO against other algorithms, including a hybrid genetic algorithm, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, and a hybrid genetic algorithm with variable neighborhood search, demonstrates its superiority in solving the MDVRPTW-IRPTRS.

Hub interdiction problems are modeled as attacker-defender problems to identify a set of r critical hubs from a set of p hubs, which when attacked, causes maximum damage to network restoration activities of the defender. In this work we consider that in addition to the routing cost, the defender also aims to minimize the congestion cost. Incorporating the congestion cost in the problem introduces non-linearity in the objective function of the interdiction problem, which makes the problem challenging to solve. To address this, we propose two alternate exact solution approaches. The first approach is an inner-approximation-based approach (IBA), which overestimates the convex non-linear objective function and provides an upper bound. A lower bound is obtained from solving the lower-level problem exactly corresponding to the upper bound solution. The upper bound is tightened using improved approximation with new points generated in successive iterations.

Recursive logit-based meta-inverse reinforcement learning for driver-preferred route planning,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103485,185,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Driver-preferred route planning often evaluates the quality of a planned route based on how closely it is followed by the driver. Despite decades of research in this area, there still exist nonnegligible deviations from planned routes. Recently, with the prevalence of GPS data, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) has attracted much interest due to its ability to directly learn routing patterns from GPS trajectories. However, existing IRL methods are limited in that: (1) They rely on numerical approximations to calculate the expected state visitation frequencies (SVFs), which are inaccurate and time-consuming; and (2) They ignore the fact that the coverage of GPS trajectories is skewed toward popular road segments, causing difficulties in learning from sparsely covered ones. To overcome these challenges, we propose a recursive logit-based meta-IRL approach, where (1) We use the recursive logit model to capture drivers’ route choice behavior so that the expected SVFs can be analytically derived, which substantially reduces the computational efforts; and (2) We introduce meta-parameters and employ meta-learning techniques so that the learning on sparsely covered road segments can benefit from that on popular ones. When training our IRL model, we update the rewards of road segments with the expected SVFs by solving several systems of linear equations and update the meta-parameters through a two-level optimization structure to ensure its fast adaption and versatility. We validate our approach using real GPS data in Chengdu, China. Results show that our planned routes better match actual routes compared with state-of-the-art methods including the recursive logit model, Deep-IRL and Dij-IRL: the F1-Score increases by 4.17% with the introduction of the recursive logit model and further increases to 5.19% after meta-learning is employed.

An exact algorithm for multiple-equipment integrated scheduling in an automated container terminal using a double-cycling strategy,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103565,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The integrated scheduling of quay cranes, automated guided vehicles, and yard cranes is key to achieving efficient performance for an automated container terminal.

Furthermore, a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to minimize the makespan of multiple-equipment. And simultaneously, an enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm is designed to solve the problem and several accelerating measures are developed to accelerate the convergence speed. The computational results indicate that (i) the schemes obtained from the model are superior to the current terminal schemes in terms of makespan, waiting time and setup time; (ii) the proposed enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm outperforms the GUROBI and existing method; and (iii) the double-cycling strategy is more efficient than the first come first serve strategy and single-cycling strategy, with 10.65% and 10.34% reductions, respectively, in makespan.",1366-5545,Not found
Bus dwell time estimation and overtaking maneuvers analysis: A stochastic process approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103577,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The precise estimation of bus dwell time (BDT) is immensely important as it directly impacts the reliability of bus schedules and the accuracy of arrival time predictions. Various factors—such as the behavior of buses merging into the main traffic flow, uneven distribution of passengers on board, and frequent bus queues—jointly lead to a high variability of the BDT. To achieve an accurate estimation of BDT across various stop types, a comprehensive BDT model is developed in this paper. First, based on berth occupancy, probabilistic models are constructed for different bus arrival scenarios, which are then used to study corresponding bus queuing times. Second, the Bureau of Public Roads function is employed to characterize the obstruction effect occupants on the bus impose on boarding passengers. Combined with this function, a bus service time model is proposed considering the bus opening doors more than once and in-vehicle crowding. Third, the bus merging process is discretized to cope with the volatility of the time interval required for a bus to leave the bus bay. A Markov chain model is designed to calculate the time buses have to wait before merging. Case studies conducted in Qingdao, Chongqing and Beijing, China, demonstrate the effectiveness of the comprehensive model both during off-peak and peak periods. Furthermore, this paper incorporates overtaking rules into the comprehensive model to examine the influence of bus overtaking willingness and various overtaking policies on bus queuing times. Through numerical analysis, the key link is between willingness to overtake, service time and the likelihood of bus overtaking is disclosed.",1366-5545,Not found
International multimodal transport connectivity assessment of multimodal transport from mainland China to Europe,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103564,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"In this study, we propose a novel International Multimodal Transport Connectivity (IMTC) index and assess the IMTC of multimodal transport from mainland China to Europe. We first present the definition of IMTC, which represents the ease of transporting export cargoes from a domestic origin to an overseas destination by an international multimodal transport network. Second, we propose two kinds of IMTC indexes and then give detailed measurement methods by considering the main modes (i.e., railway express and maritime shipping) in the international multimodal transport process. One is the monetary-based IMTC measured by the monetary cost shippers must pay for transporting export cargo to an overseas region. The other is the time-based IMTC, which is measured by the time cost of the international multimodal transport process and incorporates the time value of different export cargo categories and transport time uncertainty. Third, we assess the IMTC of the international multimodal transport from mainland China to Europe and we mainly compare the monetary-based and the time-based IMTCs via the CR Express or maritime shipping in the pre- and post-COVID years. The results indicate that monetary-based IMTCs from China to Europe via CR Express are significantly lower than those via maritime shipping in the pre-COVID year, while the trend reverses in the post-COVID year, and the monetary-based IMTCs via CR Express are much higher than those via maritime shipping. Moreover, in both the pre-and post-COVID years, the time-based IMTCs from China to Europe via CR Express were significantly higher than those via maritime shipping for all nine cargo categories. Our study offers a new perspective for assessing the convenience of international multimodal transport with the novel IMTC index and provides policy and managerial implications (e.g., real-time cargo tracking technology with blockchain, unified price control mechanism and subsidy strategy, and expansion of the CR Express capacity) to guide policymakers in improving the resilience of international multimodal transport.",1366-5545,Not found
UAV-rider coordinated dispatching for the on-demand delivery service provider,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103571,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Fast response is critical to the success of the on-demand delivery service providers. Recently, more and more on-demand delivery service providers have started trying to use UAVs/drones to cope with the increasing challenges due to delivery service-sensitive demand. In this study, we propose a novel UAV-rider coordinated on-demand delivery model from the perspective of the on-demand delivery service provider. The objective aims to provide cost-effective delivery solutions by introducing the UAV/drone fleets into the current rider-only on-demand delivery system. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to solve the problem, which is verified by the solver Cplex. To further analyze the impacts of the integration of UAVs on the riders’ deployment in practice, we develop a modified adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm to solve real business large-scale instances. The mechanism of how to improve the operational efficiency of the delivery service provider by integrating UAVs and the best-coordinated mode between UAVs and riders is discussed by conducting real-data-based numerical experiments. The results show that, for the case with a small number of orders in a dispatch cycle, the pure UAV model is best for the on-demand delivery service provider. When there are a large number of orders received in one dispatch cycle, the UAV-rider coordinated model is the best one to achieve cost-effective solutions.

We are considering a zone-based operation, meaning that the on-demand minibus is restricted to picking up or dropping off passengers within a single zone for each trip, and the minibus does not stop in other zones. For this zonal electric minibus system, we plan the service level for each zone, the construction of dedicated charging piles in each zone, and the optimal size of the bus fleet. To model the planning problem, we propose a mixed-integer nonlinear second-order cone program. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive discretization algorithm to expedite the problem-solving process. Our numerical tests illustrate the planning for the on-demand minibus system in Manhattan. Furthermore, these tests underscore the benefits of the proposed on-demand minibus system. The most important findings of this study are: (i) the proposed mode replaces more trips with cars, thus reducing the traffic flow and alleviating traffic congestion; (ii) the service zone division, the setting of the fare, and the number of seats in minibus play an essential role in the revenue of the on-demand minibus system; (iii) considering endogenous zone selecting, number of dedicated charging piles, and mode choice in each zone is essential to the planning of the on-demand minibus system.",1366-5545,Not found
Data-driven approach for port resilience evaluation,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103570,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"As pivotal nodes in international trade, ports have faced unprecedented challenges, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hybrid risk-averse location-inventory-allocation with secondary disaster considerations in disaster relief logistics: A distributionally robust approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103558,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"This paper addresses facility location, inventory pre-positioning and allocation of emergency supplies in disaster relief logistics by taking into account both primary and secondary disasters. To characterize the uncertainty associated with post-disaster demand and resource allocation cost, this paper constructs the statistical-distance-based ambiguity sets of possible probability distributions with the Wasserstein metric, which is utilized to measure their distances from the empirical distribution. Armed with the Wasserstein ambiguity set, this paper develops a hybrid risk-averse three-stage distributionally robust chance-constrained (TS-DRCC) model for the considered problem, which measures the risk from both quantitative and qualitative aspects. When the Wasserstein metric uses the l 1 -norm, this paper reformulates the proposed TS-DRCC model as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) based on the strong duality theory, which can be efficiently solved via CPLEX, thereby enabling decision-makers to use it. Theoretically, this paper also proves that the proposed TS-DRCC model converges to stochastic programming (SP) model as the size of historical data approaches infinity. Finally, this paper conducts a computational study of hurricane threat in the US to indicate the superiority of our proposed TS-DRCC model in terms of demand satisfaction and out-of-sample performance compared to the model considering only primary disasters and the conventional SP model, respectively.

An efficient heuristic for very large-scale vehicle routing problems with simultaneous pickup and delivery,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103550,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The paper discusses two variants of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), in which each customer to be visited can require both pickup and delivery, or only either pickup and delivery but not both. These problems are referred to, respectively, as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD) and as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Pickup and Delivery (VRPMPD). Both VRPSPD and VRPMPD are particularly relevant in practical logistics distribution scenarios, especially when dealing with a substantial number of pickup and delivery locations. The aim of this work is to provide an algorithm which extends, through a variety of specializations, the FILO framework, originally proposed and specifically designed for the CVRP.

A risk-averse distributionally robust optimisation approach for drone-supported relief facility location problem,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103538,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Drone-supported last-mile humanitarian logistics applications play a crucial role in the rapid and efficient delivery of essential relief items, such as medicine, blood, and vaccines, during disaster and emergency situations. This paper explores a novel drone-supported relief facility location problem (DSRFLP) aimed at establishing an effective drone-supported last-mile humanitarian logistics system. The problem involves making joint decisions for both pre-disaster and post-disaster phases while considering the characteristics of drone-based delivery operations and uncertain demands. In the pre-disaster phase, we make the decisions regarding the locations of drone-supported relief facilities, inventory prepositioning of relief items, assignment of drones to the opened facilities, and allocation of drones to disaster demand sites. In the post-disaster phase, we make decisions related to delivery quantities. To tackle the challenge of incomplete demand distribution information in chaotic disaster environments, we establish a distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) model to handle the uncertainty of demands. This model adopts worst-case mean Conditional Value-at-Risk as the risk measurement, reflecting the risk-averse attitude of humanitarian organisers. In this paper, three ambiguity sets (box, ellipsoidal, and polyhedral) are considered to describe the ambiguity distributions of demands. To overcome the computational challenge, we reformulate the DRO model under three ambiguity sets into two mixed-integer linear programming models and one second-order cone programming model, which can be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Furthermore, we validate our proposed DRO model through a small-scale example and a large-scale case study based on the Lushan earthquake in China. The computational outcomes underscore the superior performance of the proposed DRO model to mitigate the impact arising from incomplete probability distributions. We propose managerial implications and insights to support the decision-making of humanitarian organisations based on the experimental results.

Bi-scale car-following model calibration based on corridor-level trajectory,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103497,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The precise estimation of macroscopic traffic parameters, such as travel time and fuel consumption, is essential for the optimization of traffic management systems. Despite its importance, the comprehensive acquisition of vehicle trajectory data for the calculation of these macroscopic measures presents a challenge. To bridge this gap, this study aims to calibrate car-following models capable of predicting both microscopic measures and macroscopic measures. We conduct a numerical analysis to trace the cumulative process of model prediction errors across various measurements, and our findings indicate that macroscopic measures encapsulate the accumulation of model errors. By incorporating macroscopic measures into vehicle model calibration, we can mitigate the impact of noise on microscopic data measurements. We compare three car-following model calibration methods: MiC (using microscopic measurements), MaC (using macroscopic measurements), and BiC (using both microscopic and macroscopic measurements)—utilizing real-world trajectory data. The BiC method emerges as the most successful in reconstructing vehicle trajectories and accurately estimating travel time and fuel consumption, whereas the MiC method leads to overfitting and inaccurate macro-measurement predictions.

Integrated charging scheduling and operational control for an electric bus network,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103549,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The last few years have seen the massive deployment of electric buses in many existing transit networks. However, the planning and operation of an electric bus system differ from that of a bus system with conventional vehicles, and some key problems have not yet been studied in the literature. In this work, we address the integrated operational control and charging scheduling problem for a network of electric buses with a limited opportunity charging capacity. Operational control is carried out through speed control of the vehicles and bus holding at the terminal. We propose a hierarchical control framework to solve this integrated problem, where the charging and operational decisions are taken jointly by solving a mixed-integer linear program in the high-level control layer. Since this optimization problem might become very large as more bus lines are considered, we propose to apply Lagrangian relaxation in such a way as to exploit the structure of the problem and enable a decomposition into independent subproblems. A local search heuristic is then deployed in order to generate good feasible solutions to the original problem. This entire Lagrangian heuristic procedure is shown to scale much better on transit networks with an increasing number of bus lines than trying to solve the original problem with an off-the-shelf solver. The proposed procedure is then tested in the high-fidelity microscopic traffic environment Vissim on a bus network constructed from an openly available dataset of the city of Chicago. The results show the benefits of combining the charging scheduling decisions with the real-time operational control of the vehicles as the proposed control framework manages to achieve both a better level of service and lower charging costs over control baselines with predetermined charging schedules.",1366-5545,Not found
A dynamic system optimal dedicated lane design for connected and autonomous vehicles in a heterogeneous urban transport network,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103562,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Numerous contemporary studies have posited that connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold the potential to enhance traffic safety and augment efficiency substantially. One widely discussed approach to optimize CAV operations within urban traffic networks involves the implementation of dedicated lanes (DLs). This study aims to assist system planners in optimally deploying DLs within heterogeneous urban traffic networks of CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). In pursuit of this objective, we have introduced a multi-class dynamic traffic assignment framework that enhances network performance and offers insights into traffic dynamics. Additionally, our methodology considers dynamic routing behaviour while devising DLs, formulating and approximating the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The resulting strategy delineates the temporal and spatial aspects of the deployment of DLs for CAVs, specifying the quantity and locations of these lanes. Subsequently, we assessed our framework using test-bed networks of varying sizes and demand profiles, evaluating the solution’s quality and the model’s adaptability to diverse traffic conditions. Our findings indicate that implementing DLs for CAVs can bolster vehicular throughput across the network while neglecting dynamic capacity variation in mixed traffic may yield misleading outcomes.",1366-5545,Not found
Impacts of selling models: Who should offer trade-in programs in e-commerce supply chains?,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103524,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Although some prior studies have examined the optimal trade-in providers in supply chains, the impacts of alternative online selling models like reselling and agency selling that are widely adopted in the e-commerce environment are under-explored. Traditionally, both the manufacturer and retailer have incentives to offer trade-in programs to consumers in a supply chain. However, this is no longer true when an agency selling model is implemented. In this paper, we investigate the equilibrium “trade-in provider” under the two selling models respectively in a stylized e-commerce single-manufacturer single-e-tailer supply chain. Our findings show that different selling models do have distinct influences on the two firms’ preferences of who should provide the trade-in program. Particularly, under the reselling model, there is always a conflict between the two firms regarding who should provide trade-ins, which is consistent with the findings in related literature; however, under the agency selling model, there are some win-win cases under which the two firms possess consistent preferences on the trade-in format. Furthermore, the “boxed pigs game” equilibrium may appear under agency selling, where either of the two firms has to provide the trade-in program, although this is not their most preferred trade-in format. The robustness of our main results has been well verified by extending our study to consider (i) the case where the e-tailer can be delegated to implement trade-ins, (ii) the case where the e-tailer is the first-mover in determining whether to provide trade-ins, and (iii) the reselling and agency selling models co-exist.",1366-5545,Not found
Planning of electric vehicle charging stations: An integrated deep learning and queueing theory approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103568,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"This study presents a hybrid solution for the charging station location-capacity problem. The proposed approach simultaneously determines the location and capacity of charging stations (i.e., number of charging piles), and assigns piles to electric vehicles based on their level of charge. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to minimize the total cost of establishing charging stations together with the average customers’ waiting time. The proposed solution combines queueing theory with mathematical modelling to estimate the average waiting time. A deep learning algorithm is then developed to enhance the precision of waiting time estimation. Another contribution is involving a deep neural network model in improving NSGA-II algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted in Halifax, Canada to assess the performance of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the strong predictive performance of the deep learning algorithm and highlight the limitations of traditional queueing models in estimating waiting times in charging stations (i.e., 99.8% improvement in computation time, as well as accuracy improvement of time estimations from 13% to 1.6% deviation). Several valuable insights are obtained to improve the operational performance of charging stations such as achieving a significant (i.e., 61.5%) drop in the average waiting time across the network by a modest (i.e., 29.2%) increase in the initial investments. Also, it reveals that the variability of service rate significantly impacts the average waiting time (i.e., a 50% increase in the variability of service rate causes a substantial 950.56% surge in the average waiting time). The findings underscore the need to control service rate fluctuations to reduce wait times and boost driver satisfaction. The improved NSGA-II algorithm shows 12.77% improvement in the Pareto front solutions. Finally, the proposed prioritization strategy based on the charging level of vehicles could reduce the average waiting time and cost compared to the first-come-first-served strategy.",1366-5545,Not found
Fighting against de-pooling effect of airport advertising spaces: A supply chain perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103527,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Being a scarce resource, airport advertising spaces/billboards have a fixed capacity and the demand largely depends on the firm’s marketing efforts.

By splitting the capacity into two channels, the airport advertising firm encounters a capacity de-pooling effect and it forms into a competition and collaboration relationship with the agencies. In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to fight against the de-pooling effect from a supply chain perspective. Specifically, we study the interactive decisions between an airport advertising firm and an agency firm. The airport advertising firm determines the maximal capacity to sell to the agency firm, and then the two firms compete on marketing efforts with the objective of maximizing their respective profits.

Real-time scheduling and routing of shared autonomous vehicles considering platooning in intermittent segregated lanes and priority at intersections in urban corridors,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103546,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Anticipating the forthcoming integration of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) into urban networks, the imperative of devising an efficient real-time scheduling and routing strategy for these vehicles becomes evident if one is to maximize their potential in enhancing travel efficiency. In this study, we address the problem of jointly scheduling and routing SAVs across an urban network with the possibility of platooning the vehicles at intersections to reduce their travel time. We argue that this is especially useful in large urban areas. We introduce a novel vehicle scheduling and routing method that allows a specific number of SAVs to converge at the intersections of urban corridors within designated time intervals, facilitating the formation of SAV platoons. Dedicated lanes and signal priority control are activated to ensure that these platoons go through the corridors efficiently. Based on the above concept, we propose a linear integer programming model to minimize the total travel time of SAVs and the delays experienced by the conventional vehicles due to SAV priority, thereby optimizing the overall performance of the road network. For large instances, we develop a two-stage heuristic algorithm to solve it faster. In the first stage, leveraging an evaluation index that manifests the compatibility of each vehicle-to-request combination, we allocate passenger requests to a fleet of SAVs. In the second stage, a customized genetic algorithm is designed to coordinate the paths of various SAVs, thus achieving the desired vehicle platooning effect. The optimization method is tested on a real-world road network in Shanghai, China. The results display a remarkable reduction of 15.76 % in the total travel time of the SAVs that formed platoons. The overall performance of the road network could be improved with the total travel time increase of conventional vehicles significantly smaller than the reduction observed in SAVs’ total travel time.",1366-5545,Not found

E-scooters are equipped with swappable batteries managed by staff who visit each scooter and replace depleted batteries with charged ones. The e-scooters in this system are free-floating; they can be located anywhere without having to be returned to designated stations. Due to this characteristic of the scattered location of e-scooters, operation decisions with associated staff routing are more challenging than station-based services. Thus, it is critical to implement the efficient management of e-scooter redistribution and charging decisions with proper staff routing to successfully prepare for user demand within a limited operation time while minimizing the total operating cost. To this end, we introduce a battery swapping and vehicle rebalancing problem with staff routing for e-scooter sharing systems, formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model. To derive solutions efficiently for a large-scale instance in practice, we propose a clustered iterative construction approach where the problem is decomposed into two phases. The first phase clusters regions using an approximation of intra-region and inter-region operation costs with the minimum spanning tree approach. The second phase efficiently derives multiple candidate regional sequences by our partial permutation procedure and following the sequences, iteratively solves a significantly reduced size of the problem to construct operation assignments.

To advance knowledge on product deletion decisions, we consider competitive concerns on upstream and downstream supply chain actors and their interplay with the focal firm’s strategic product deletion decisions. Specifically, we analyze a vertically differentiated market where firms decide whether to delete products from their portfolio. We consider various scenarios where competitors decide whether products should be deleted. Whether made by an individual or both firms, product deletion decisions will affect relative competitiveness and profitability measures. These findings provide managerial insights for managing supply chains. Product deletion should not be considered just a single organizational decision but an inter-organizational decision where supply chain interactions with upstream and downstream stakeholders affect organizational competitiveness. This study sets the stage for more comprehensive collaborative strategic planning in multi-tier supply chains using product deletion as a linkage. Theoretical and managerial implications provoke new avenues for future study.",1366-5545,Not found
Vehicle dispatching and routing of on-demand intercity ride-pooling services: A multi-agent hierarchical reinforcement learning approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103551,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The integrated development of city clusters has given rise to an increasing demand for intercity travel. Intercity ride-pooling service exhibits considerable potential in upgrading traditional intercity bus services by implementing demand-responsive enhancements. Nevertheless, its online operations suffer the inherent complexities due to the coupling of vehicle resource allocation among cities and pooled-ride vehicle routing. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a two-level framework designed to facilitate online fleet management. Specifically, a novel multi-agent feudal reinforcement learning model is proposed at the upper level of the framework to cooperatively assign idle vehicles to different intercity lines, while the lower level updates the routes of vehicles using an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. Numerical studies based on the realistic dataset of Xiamen and its surrounding cities in China show that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the supply and demand imbalances, and achieves significant improvement in both the average daily system profit and order fulfillment ratio.",1366-5545,Not found
Velocity-based rack storage location assignment for the unidirectional robotic mobile fulfillment system,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103533,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Nowadays, the robotic mobile fulfillment system (RMFS) has been increasingly used by online retailers. Compared with traditional picker-to-parts warehouses, the racks of RMFS do not have to return to the same location after picking, thus we can dynamically change their locations, which brings great potential to efficiently fulfill orders. Aiming at minimizing the sum of rack travel distances, the key question is how to reassign a rack to an unoccupied storage location after picking items from the rack. However, the issue involves two challenges for unidirectional RMFS, one is that huge differences may exist between the classical Manhattan distance estimation and the actual distance for the unidirectional aisles in RMFS, and the other one is that we need to account for the frequency of rack moving for multi-item orders. We thus first propose closed-form formulas to optimally estimate the cycle travel distance for each rack. Then, by overcoming the repeated counting issue for multi-item orders, we propose a novel SKU (Stock Keeping Units)-correlation-based algorithm to choose high-velocity racks, which can better fulfill multi-item orders. Finally, embedding the cycle travel distance and SKU-correlation-based velocity, we propose a Velocity-based Rack Storage Location Assignment method (VRSLA) to solve the rack storage location assignment problem by assigning high-velocity racks to the nearest storage locations. Collaborating with a large online retailer in China, we demonstrate the performance of VRSLA by using both small-scale and large-scale datasets. The computational results show that VRSLA not only can achieve near-best solutions compared with an integer programming model solved by Gurobi, but also outperforms four state-of-the-art assignment methods in literature (random, velocity-based class, shortest path, and sale-based) by reducing the rack travel distance up to 43.32%. We also found that the stronger the correlation between SKUs on the racks or the larger the size of the RMFS, the shorter the rack travel distance by the proposed VRSLA method.",1366-5545,Not found
Green transport fleet renewal using approximate dynamic programming: A case study in German heavy-duty road transportation,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103547,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Governments and manufacturers are starting to enforce the European transport industry’s transition to sustainable mobility. Meanwhile, transport companies have begun to set their own emissions goals. To achieve these sustainably, they must develop efficient policies to renew their fleets with alternative-fuel vehicles. However, since future trends in relevant parameters are highly uncertain, fleet managers struggle to make informed decisions. We formulate fleet renewal as a sequential optimization problem, considering multiple technologies and operational clusters. Vehicle purchase, sales, depreciation, fuel, carbon, and electric battery prices are modeled as stochastic variables. We propose approximate dynamic programming to calculate fleet renewal policies that achieve emissions goals while optimizing total costs of ownership. This approach is tested in a case study of a German logistics service provider. We investigate optimal timings of purchases and sales for a heavy-duty truck fleet, considering four drivetrain technologies. Our approach can guide decision making in various fleet renewal settings. By applying it to the case study, we derive important managerial implications. The mobility transition will significantly increase transport fleets’ total cost of ownership. To minimize costs, companies should not move prematurely to low-emissions technologies, but hold vehicles for as long as possible to benefit from fewer purchases and sinking prices. The optimal policy depends on the distance driven. For short-distance operations, diesel trucks will remain the dominant technology in the next years, but will be replaced by battery electric trucks in the medium term. In the far future, trucks powered by electricity and hydrogen will be equally important.",1366-5545,Not found
Scrubber installation of inland container ships: Discrepancy between government and carriers,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103543,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Scrubbers are the commonly used green technologies for a ship to reduce sulfur emissions. Various speed adjustment behaviors would distort the cost and desulfurization efficiency of scrubbers for ships, which causes a discrepancy between the government and the carrier to install scrubbers. This paper addresses the issue by considering three speed adjustment behaviors: rigidity, partial flexibility, and full flexibility. Under rigid behavior, the carrier maintains a constant sailing speed when adopting low-sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) and installing a scrubber. Partially flexible behavior only involves speed adjustments when adopting LSFO, while fully flexible behavior includes speed adjustments when adopting LSFO and installing a scrubber. Our analysis indicates that scrubber installation consistently precedes adopting LSFO in speed. Full flexibility behavior is the least costly speed adjustment behavior, while partial flexibility behavior results in the lowest emissions. The investment discrepancy on scrubbers between the carrier and the government would occur on whether or not to install a scrubber and which level of the scrubber’s quality since the two parties are concerned about the sulfur emissions and cost, respectively. Government subsidies address these discrepancies, leading to improved emission reduction.",1366-5545,Not found
Post-earthquake building damage assessment: A multi-period inspection routing approach for Gaussian process regression,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103548,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"In the wake of seismic events, prompt and accurate building damage assessment is crucial to inform post-disaster interventions and recovery efforts. This paper advances a novel multi-period planning strategy for post-earthquake building inspections, conceptualizing the task as a multi-period orienteering problem (MPOP). In this framework, each building selected for inspection hosts a specific reward indicating its informative value for damage assessment. The objective is to design inspection routes that maximize damage information acquisition while adhering to time constraints. After data collection, we utilize a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model to estimate the damage in uninspected buildings. To validate our approach, we conduct an earthquake simulation with realistic building information from San Francisco. The experimental outcomes reveal that our multi-period damage assessment framework maintains robust performance across diverse scenarios and consistently surpasses conventional period-by-period inspection strategies, yielding enhanced damage information acquisition and greater precision in damage estimation. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of our proposed method in strengthening post-earthquake damage assessment and improving recovery planning.",1366-5545,Not found
Airline price responses in the face of demand shocks: European lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103537,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"We exploit the exogenous demand shock in the aviation sector that resulted from the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate how airlines responded in terms of pricing strategies. By using monthly fare data for flights operated within the EU-27 member states over the period 2017–2022 and by quantifying the intensity of pandemic cycles through a stringency index, we estimate price regressions at the route–airline level. Our findings reveal that the demand drop has prompted lower fares and increased intertemporal price dispersion. Furthermore, we show that fare cuts are not explained by airlines operating fewer flights. By analyzing heterogeneous price responses to the demand shock as determined by various route and airline characteristics, we find a stronger reaction on international markets and greater resilience of low-cost airlines. We also show that the regulations in the form of public service obligations and state aid programs for airlines helped the beneficiaries but not travelers.",1366-5545,Not found
Mass evacuation planning for disasters management: A household evacuation route choice behavior analysis,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103544,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"This paper presents a multi-methodological approach to analyzing household evacuation route choice behaviors and the related decision-making for mass evacuation planning in disaster management. Specifically, the proposed multi-methodological approach integrates a syncretic risk perception conceptual model with a household-based group utility evolution model. The dynamics of household evacuation route choice are explored in two stages, namely the individual utility initiation and accommodation. The unique feature of the proposed approach is that it links individual risk perception, survival psychology, and group behavioral dynamics together to characterize household decision-making about choosing the evacuation routes. An empirical study coupled with experiments is conducted to help validate the proposed household evacuation route choice behavior model. Through various designed disaster scenarios, the applicability and strengths of the proposed model for mass evacuation planning and management are demonstrated. Particularly, the mean relative prediction errors of the proposed model with respect to household-based evacuation route switching probability and path flow splits are 3.79% and 6.88%, respectively, all within an acceptable range of ±10 %. This demonstrates that the proposed model and analytical results align closely with household choice behavior.",1366-5545,Not found

"Returns policy, in-store service, and contract strategies in the presence of customer returns",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103520,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Returns policies and in-store retail service are widely used strategies for managing customer returns. In this paper, we consider a supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the retailer should decide its returns policy strategy by choosing between a no-refund policy (NR) or a money-back guarantee policy (MBG), as well as deciding whether to provide in-store service. We identify the retailer’s optimal returns policy and in-store service strategies. We find that while the net salvage value of a returned product is a key factor influencing the retailer’s decision on its optimal returns policy, the retailer’s in-store service strategy is dependent on its chosen returns strategy. We show that offering an MBG policy can expand the market coverage of the supply chain, while providing in-store service does not yield the same effect. The retailer’s optimal returns policy and in-store service benefit the manufacturer. However, there are cases where providing in-store service is not optimal for the retailer, but the manufacturer can benefit from it. In such circumstances, the manufacturer can use a contract to incentivize the retailer to provide in-store service. We also discuss extensions of the model to examine the impact of a non-zero residual value of the unsatisfactory product under an NR policy on the retailer’s decisions, and where the retailer endogenously determines its service level through numerical exploration.",1366-5545,Not found
A machine learning based sample average approximation for supplier selection with option contract in humanitarian relief,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103531,186,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The humanitarian relief plays an important role in reducing the impact of disasters and avoiding humanitarian crises. As one of the essential activities, selecting a series of proper suppliers is particularly helpful for a successful and efficient disaster response to provide victims with necessary supplies. To optimize the benefits of the relief agency, victims, and suppliers, this paper proposes a supplier selection problem with consideration of the option contract, in which all-unit quantity and incremental quantity discounts are integrated. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective stochastic programming model with the objectives of minimizing the cost of the relief agency and maximizing the profit of suppliers, which are two conflict objectives, and also reducing the shortage risk for victims. Moreover, a machine learning based sample average approximation (SAA) is designed to solve the proposed model in large-scale cases. Specifically, stratified random sampling is integrated into K-means++ to improve quality of samples. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed strategy can achieve a win–win situation for the relief agency, victims, and suppliers. It also justifies the efficiency of applying the machine learning method to enhance SAA for solving large-scale stochastic programming models.",1366-5545,Not found
Modeling and managing an on-demand meal delivery system with order bundling,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103597,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"This paper proposes an analytical framework for an on-demand meal delivery market that features order bundling and courier sharing among restaurants. The proposed model consists of (i) a physical model describing the delivery process with order bundling, and (ii) an aggregated market equilibrium model characterizing the demand and supply interactions, which enables us to generate managerial insights without knowing the operational details. We analyze the impacts of demand and supply levels as well as the platform’s pricing and wage strategies on the system equilibrium. We outline a regime, which effectively defines a “healthy” state, optimizing the system’s service capacity to its fullest extent. The results demonstrate that a higher maximum bundle size enables a higher throughput capacity, resulting in improved energy efficiency for the system, lower service prices for customers, increased service opportunities for couriers, and higher turnover for restaurants. In comparison to the single-order delivery mode, the bundling delivery mode mitigates a substantial surge in prices during peak service hours. However, an excessive maximum bundle size is not advised for the platform oriented either toward service quality or profit due to the increasing Click-to-Door time and reduced marginal profit.",1366-5545,Not found
Joint optimization of product service system configuration and delivery with learning-based valid cut selection and a tailored heuristic,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103578,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Most previous work on product service system configuration aims to meet the functionality need or ensure a cost-effective delivery separately, overlooking the mutual impact between the configuration and delivery procedures. In contrast to that, we jointly optimize the configuration scheme and the delivery plan to increase the customer satisfaction through a two-stage decision framework. However, this integration significantly heightens the model’s complexity due to the interdependence of the two stages. To address this challenge, we introduce an exact algorithm for finding globally optimal solutions, as well as an efficient two-stage heuristic aiming at enhancing the efficiency. The exact algorithm is built upon the branch-and-bound algorithm which, however, becomes less efficient as the problem size increases. To counteract this, we devise a series of valid cuts to boost the convergence. Additionally, recognizing that the optimal bundle of valid cuts may vary depending on the specific case, we adopt artificial intelligence techniques to adaptively select valid cuts. This can lessen unnecessary search efforts when tackling new cases and further enhance the computational performance. Despite this, efficiently handling large-scale cases in real-world applications remains a challenge. To mitigate this, we customize an efficient two-stage heuristic to assure a practical applicability. In the first stage, an effective local search is used to identify an appropriate configuration scheme, which then serves as a hyperparameter for the second stage, inspired by the machine learning. The second stage focuses on optimizing the delivery plan. To obtain this plan, we dedicate a modified adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm, equipped with tailored operators and selection methods to enrich search capabilities. Furthermore, a feasibility protection procedure is specialized to rectify the infeasible solutions and secure the diversity of the solution pool simultaneously. Our numerical experiments underscore the importance of the two-stage optimization framework, demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive valid cut selection, and highlight the superiority of our heuristic in handling complex optimization tasks.",1366-5545,Not found
Dynamic container slot allocation with empty container repositioning under stochastic demand,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103603,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Container slot allocation represents a critical operational decision-making challenge within the liner shipping industry, which necessitates making decisions on the transportation of loaded containers and the repositioning of empty ones under stochastic demand.

In this paper, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming (DP) model to optimize the slot allocation decision for maximizing the expected total revenue over the planning horizon. To solve this model, we design an efficient allocation policy that makes slot allocations at each stage based on current empty container stocks, realized demand, and the mean demand at future stages.

Modelling and analyzing the stacking strategies in automated container terminals,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103608,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Stacking strategies determine which yard block to allocate the container and which bay and column in the block to stack the container. They play an important role to ensure yard efficiency and reduce vessel berthing time and truck waiting time. This paper models and analyses the impact of stacking strategies on the container terminal operations by a two-stage approach. We consider common stacking rules including random stacking rule and distance-based priority assigning rule. In the first stage, the individual operations of handling equipment are modelled by travel time models considering uncertainty in operations. The effects of stacking rules on individual operations, such as Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) traveling times, landside yard crane operation times and seaside yard crane operation times, are estimated. In the second stage, we use a semi-open queuing network to model the interactions between individual operations, and the results of the first stage are used as inputs in the second stage network. We analytically examined the handling times of the relevant equipment under different stacking strategies and their sensitivity to yard density. Finally, we use simulation method to verify the effectiveness of the results of our model.

"Estimating the potential for optimized curb management to reduce delivery vehicle double parking, traffic congestion and energy consumption",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103574,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"We model an optimized curb parking reservation system and characterize conditions under which such a system can reduce delivery vehicle double parking, congestion and energy consumption. We implement an optimization model leveraging integer linear and mixed-integer linear programming parking slot assignment formulations to minimize double parking and build a queuing model to estimate lane obstruction congestion and energy effects. Using delivery data from Aspen, CO and Pittsburgh, PA, we find that, when arrival times are known at the start of the day, a single-space reservation system can eliminate 1–2 min of double parking per hour, on average, increasing 3–4 times when drivers have ± 5 minutes of arrival time flexibility. Scenarios involving up to seven co-located spaces show diminishing returns but suggest reservation systems can provide the equivalent of additional parking capacity in some cases. When arrival times are uncertain and buffers are used between reservations, we find that curb reservation systems reduce congestion in high-demand, moderate uncertainty scenarios with short duration reservations but increase congestion in scenarios with high uncertainty and long duration reservations, with estimated annual congestion and emissions externality cost savings ranging from -$100,000 to +$300,000 for a single space.

Resource shuffling in global supply chains under the Clean Competition Act,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103591,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The US Clean Competition Act (CCA) aims to tackle significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in global supply chains. Under the CCA, the foreign supplier (outside the U.S.) exports carbon-intensive materials (e.g., aluminum) to the home manufacturer (within the U.S.) whose production is imposed an environmental charge on the basis of the level that exceeds the U.S. carbon intensity standard. Given this policy, this study examines the operations in global supply chains where the foreign supplier decides to distribute the same or differentiated materials to the home and foreign manufacturers with the CCA. Differentiated materials can refer to resource shuffling, that is, the foreign supplier exports low-carbon materials to the home market and sends higher-carbon ones to his own country’s market. Our results show that the size difference between the two markets is critical in foreign suppliers’ decisions. Specifically, resource shuffling is preferable for the foreign supplier when the foreign market size is sufficiently small or large, and vice versa. Implementing the CCA can reduce carbon emissions in the U.S. and the global market. It can also achieve an all-win outcome for all supply chain members, consumers, and the environment (i.e., higher profit and consumer surplus, and lower carbon emissions) under resource shuffling when the foreign and home markets follow specific market size structures. Moreover, our study sheds light on the managerial insights into the impacts of the CCA on global supply chains. Specifically, as the implementation time of the CCA continues, in the long run, resource shuffling is more likely to be efficient in carbon emission reduction in the U.S. but less likely to be efficient in carbon emission reduction in the global market. Thus, policymakers should evaluate the efficiency of implementing the CCA yearly and consider adjusting the policy if the efficiency is not satisfied.",1366-5545,Not found
Manufacturers' emission-reduction investments in competing supply chains with Prisoner's Dilemma: The economic and environmental impacts of Retailer(s) capital Constraint(s),10.1016/j.tre.2024.103602,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"We establish a game model in the setting of competing supply chains, where either supply chain contains a manufacturer (leader) and a potentially capital-constrained retailer (follower). Our work endeavors to pursue an economic-environmental coexistence of manufacturers’ equilibrium emission-reduction investment strategies, and considers a realistic issue of retailer(s) capital constraint(s) leading to three scenarios: no retailers/only one retailer/both retailers financing (trade credit/bank credit). To comprehensively discuss the environmental performance of manufacturers’ investments, the unit-emission index (UEI) and total-emission index (TEI) are introduced together. We find that manufacturers’ investment strategies mainly depend on the product’s original carbon emission, and retailers’ financing decisions rely on the carbon tax rate. From the economic perspective, compared with retailers having no capital constraints, retailer(s) having capital constraint(s) can promote the emission-reduction investments of both manufacturers. From the environmental perspective, investments can inevitably reduce emissions if UEI is implemented, whereas investments possibly increase emissions if TEI is implemented because terminal demand is enlarged by the green sensitivity of consumers. Surprisingly, there exists a “Prisoner’s Dilemma” if both manufacturers employ investments at a particularly low carbon tax rate. Admittedly, despite both manufacturers resorting to abandoning investments can crack prisoner’s dilemma, such a crack shrinks the economic-environmental coexistence of manufacturers’ investments, and hence manufacturers complying with prisoner’s dilemma might result in “a fault on the right side.”",1366-5545,Not found

Efficiency and equity analysis on parking reservation,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103606,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Parking reservation, as an on-demand mobility service, can effectively address parking challenges. This paper examines the efficiency and equity of three parking reservation strategies: first-reserved-first-served (FRFS), auction and a hybrid strategy that combines both FRFS and auction. In the hybrid strategy, residents are given priority to make auction reservations initially, while the remaining spaces are allocated through FRFS reservations. Ultimately, a proportional allocation of spaces is achieved for both FRFS and auctions.Expected social cost minimization models are developed to determine the optimal parking quota for these strategies (FRFS, Auction and the hybrid strategy) and the optimal proportion allocated to the FRFS and auction in the hybrid strategy. Based on these works above, the solution properties of the proposed models are analytically explored. In addition, the Gini coefficient is used to investigate the equity of the above three reservation strategies. It is found that the auction strategy is the most efficient, but also the least fair. FRFS is the fairest but also the least efficient, and the hybrid is in the middle. The optimal parking quota increases with the value of time, the quality of road and parking services, but decreases with the quality of public transport services. In the hybrid strategy, increasing the allocation proportion to FRFS may lead to an increased or a decreased expected social cost, depending on the bidding price and FRFS price of parking spaces. The auction strategy is not always the most efficient for allocating parking spaces. In fact, it will become the worst strategy when the parking quota exceeds a certain critical value. Raising the lower bound of residents’ incomes would narrow the gap between rich and poor, increase parking quotas, and generate higher parking revenues. The FRFS is more attractive to low-income residents, while the auction strategy favors higher-income residents.",1366-5545,Not found
Ridesharing user equilibrium model without the en-route transfer: An OD-based link-node formulation,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103599,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"As an emerging and sustainable mode of traffic, the widespread ridesharing programs can fully utilize existing vehicle resources and reshape traffic flow distribution. The study aims to explore the spatial distribution of mode-split traffic flow and appraise the impact of ridesharing services on urban traffic conditions. To achieve these goals, by constructing a three-layer extended network to visually depict mode choices and employing the link-node modeling approach, a ridesharing user equilibrium (RUE) model in terms of OD-based link flows is first established to formulate travelers’ mode and route choice behavior in the traffic network with ridesharing programs, which avoids the path enumeration and storage required by path-link modeling approaches. By relaxing the same origin and same destination assumption, the RUE model is reformulated to suit a more general scenario, where ridesharing drivers can pick up multiple passengers along their routes. Compared with other link-node modeling approaches in terms of origin-based or destination-based link flows, the unreasonable phenomenon that a ridesharing passenger needs to sequentially ride multiple ridesharing vehicles for a single trip (i.e., en-route transfers) is avoided. Moreover, we prove the conditions that the path flow of travelers can be derived from the OD-based link flow, which implies that we can know the travelers’ path selection under some mild conditions.

To illustrate the framework, we find the optimal number of battery-electric energy tender cars in 22,501 freight markets (origin–destination pairs and commodities) for U.S. Class I railroads. The results display heterogeneity in optimal configurations with lighter, yet more time-sensitive shipments (e.g., intermodal) utilizing more battery tender cars.

Supplier encroachment strategies in a retail platform with strategic inventory holding behavior,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103582,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Practice has witnessed that the retail platform usually withholds strategic inventory in the reselling channel to improve channel efficiency.

Thus far, the existing literature leaves the influence of strategic inventory holding behavior on supplier encroachment in the retail platform supply chain unexplored. In this paper, we build a two-period dynamic model to explore the connection between supplier encroachment and the retail platform’s strategic inventory withholding behavior. Results show that without encroachment, the retail platform’s strategic inventory decisions hinge on the holding cost, with encroachment, the retail platform’s strategic inventory decisions are moderated by the commission rate when the holding cost is intermediate. Moreover, the supplier’s optimal encroachment strategies are jointly moderated by the commission rate and slotting fee. Importantly, the retail platform’s strategic inventory withholding behavior mitigates supplier encroachment from a qualitative and quantitative perspective, and supplier encroachment narrows the region of the strategic inventory holding. Interestingly, supplier encroachment could bring all-win outcomes, however, low inventory holding cost induces a small region of all-win outcomes.",1366-5545,Not found
From disruption to innovation: The importance of the supply chain leadership style for driving logistics innovation in the face of geopolitical disruptions,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103583,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The intricate global supply chains and logistics operations have been acutely vulnerable to recent geopolitical conflicts and resulting disruptions. Meanwhile, research shows that the choice of an appropriate leadership style is pivotal for organisations striving to thrive in dynamic business environments and foster innovation. However, the current literature lacks a theory-driven empirical model that delves into the complex interplay between geopolitical disruptions and logistics innovation, as well as the influence of different leadership styles on this interplay. We address this knowledge gap by cross-pollinating logistics management and leadership literature. Drawing upon the strategic contingency theory and analysing 247 responses from manufacturing and distributing firms, our research reveals a multitude of compelling findings. Specifically, we ascertain that geopolitical disruptions exert a significant detrimental impact on logistics innovation performance. At the same time, we uncover the substantial mitigating effects of crises, participative, and transformational supply chain leadership styles on the negative influence of geopolitical disruptions on logistics innovation performance. That is, firms with supply chain leaders exhibiting higher levels of these three leadership styles experience a diminished negative impact compared to their counterparts. Interestingly, contrary to our initial expectations, the directive leadership style does not demonstrate any discernible effect in alleviating the adverse consequences of geopolitical disruptions on firms' logistics innovation performance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics at play and provide valuable insights for organisations seeking to navigate and overcome the challenges posed by geopolitical disruptions in their pursuit of logistics innovation.",1366-5545,Not found
"The multi-fleet delivery problem combined with trucks, tricycles, and drones for last-mile logistics efficiency requirements under multiple budget constraints",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103573,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"In the increasingly competitive urban logistics delivery business field, enhancing last-mile logistics efficiency with constrained budgets is crucial for logistics companies. With the increasing adoption of emerging vehicles in last-mile logistics, neglecting the capacity of traditional vehicles may be uneconomical. This paper introduces the multi-fleet delivery problem combined with Trucks, Tricycles, and Drones (MFDP-TTD) for last-mile logistics efficiency requirements under multiple budget constraints, which represents a novel variant of the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem. Compared to the truck-drone mode, truck-tricycle mode, and the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem, by adding the collaboration of an emerging delivery vehicle (drones) and a traditional delivery vehicle (tricycle), the MFDP-TTD improves the speed of delivery of last-mile logistics more cost-efficiently. To tackle this intricate issue, this paper devises a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, taking into account fixed cost-related budgets and operating cost-related budgets. The model allows for the integration of diverse numbers of tricycles and drones across various fleets, with larger vehicles accommodating smaller ones to moving. In addition, some valid inequalities based on the properties of the problem are presented to accelerate the solution process. To solve this problem efficiently on a large scale, the paper proposes a multi-start improved adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (MS-IALNS) that combines the advantages of an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm and an ant colony algorithm. In addition, four fast feasibility-checking strategies designed based on valid inequalities are proposed. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the validity of the MILP model and valid inequalities and the advantages of the MS-IALNS. Compared to the multi-fleet delivery problem with Trucks and Tricycles, the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem, the two-echelon city delivery mode with mobile satellites, and other potential multi-fleet collaborative delivery modes, the MFDP-TTD exhibits clear advantages in integrated time costs under same multiple budget constraints. In addition, a balanced mix of numbers of tricycles and drones within the fleet, an appropriate increase in the fixed cost-related budgets, and retrofitting of trucks and tricycles to accommodate smaller vehicles and to carry batteries for replacement are recommended.",1366-5545,Not found
Original equipment manufacturer with remanufacturing: Outsourcing strategy and organizational structure,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103575,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"We consider an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) with two divisions: one manufacturing and selling new products, and the other remanufacturing used products for sale. The OEM can choose between centralizing or decentralizing its manufacturing and remanufacturing divisions. The OEM’s product contains a key component that cannot be reused in the remanufactured product. Each unit of the new/remanufactured product requires one unit of this new component. The OEM may either produce this component in house or outsource its production to a supplier. By developing game-theoretic models, we investigate the impact of the OEM’s internal organizational structure on its outsourcing decision, and the impact of the OEM’s outsourcing strategy on its choice of internal organizational structure. For a given internal organizational structure, we show that the levels of the supplier’s cost advantage and the cost saving from remanufacturing are the primary drivers in the OEM’s outsourcing decision. Moreover, the OEM’s internal organizational structure has significant implications for its choice of outsourcing strategy. Specifically, when the cost saving from remanufacturing is moderately low or sufficiently high, the decentralized OEM is more likely to choose outsourcing, while the centralized OEM is more likely to outsource when the cost saving from remanufacturing is moderate. For a given outsourcing strategy, we show that the OEM’s choice of internal organizational structure is significantly influenced by its outsourcing strategy. While the insourcing OEM always prefers a centralized structure, the outsourcing OEM may strategically decentralize its internal organizational structure, depending on the level of cost saving from remanufacturing and the degree of consumer acceptance of the remanufactured product.",1366-5545,Not found
A new biform game-based coordination mechanism for a carbon complementary supply chain under hybrid carbon regulations,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103592,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Cap-and-trade, Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) and Renewable Energy Consumption Obligation (RECO) are three regulatory instruments used by governments to decarbonize supply chains. Integrating these mechanisms creates a Carbon Complementary Supply Chain (CCSC), in which traditional energy manufacturers (TMs) with high emissions can offset their carbon footprint by trading CERs with renewable energy manufacturers (RMs) who develop the CER projects, and compete with RMs. In the downstream, retailers are incentivized to procure more renewable energy products to avoid RECO penalties. Given that all the CCSC members tend to cooperatively invest in the CER project, this paper proposes a novel biform game-based coordination mechanism combining noncooperative and cooperative games to promote CCSC’s synergy. The findings show that this mechanism can induce CCSC members to cooperate, achieving Pareto improvement in social welfare, economic performance, and individual profits under specific regulatory intensity thresholds compared to the noncooperative scenario.

How to leverage blockchain to react to consumer reference effects and develop a distribution strategy in online retailing?,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103579,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"False marketing on online platforms may distort consumer perceptions of product quality and exacerbate the negative impact of the reference quality effect (RQE). Blockchain technology (BCT) enables credible quality disclosure and is seen as a critical tool for brand manufacturers to combat false marketing. This article focuses on a platform-based supply chain comprising one brand manufacturer and one online retail platform. In this case, the brand manufacturer defines the product quality strategy and BCT implementation strategy, and the platform is responsible for online marketing and developing the distribution strategy. This paper clarifies when the manufacturer should implement BCT and how BCT affects the platform’s distribution strategy when both RQE and reference price effect (RPE) are considered. The analytical results reveal four effects of BCT implementation: the decision motivation effect, marketing leverage effect, positive externality effect, and collaboration-enhancing effect. In addition, previous studies have suggested a negative impact of the RQE and RPE. We confirm that this occurs when online marketing is efficient and brand goodwill dominates demand. Counterintuitively, the two reference effects show positive impacts when online marketing is inefficient or the RPE dominates demand. The interaction between the two reference effects is further strengthened by BCT. Regarding the platform’s distribution strategy, we confirm that the main results of previous studies occur when online marketing is efficient. Counterintuitively, when online marketing is inefficient, the platform will choose reselling at both lower and higher commission rates. Besides, agency selling is employed at moderate commission rates. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that BCT helps supply chain members reach stable and long-lasting cooperation on more product categories.",1366-5545,Not found
A hybrid deep reinforcement learning approach for a proactive transshipment of fresh food in the online–offline channel system,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103576,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"To reduce the waste of fresh foods, one of the e-commerce companies in South Korea utilizes lateral transshipment in the network of online platforms and offline shops, which is called the online–offline channel system (OOCS). Even though the OOCS has achieved success in real practice, there is room for further study on this system with regard to deriving a transshipment policy. For this reason, this study aims to develop a solution approach that could derive a promising policy and analyze the impacts of transshipment in the OOCS. The main contributions are summarized as follows. First, we propose a model to deal with the proactive transshipment of perishable products in the OOCS. In particular, this is the first study that introduces the concept of the heterogeneous shelf life considering different properties of online and offline channels. Second, we develop the hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach by combining the soft actor–critic algorithm with two novel acceleration methods. The developed method could obtain a promising policy without assumptions about demand distribution and mitigate computational burdens by reducing action spaces. On a set of experiments carried out on real-world demand data, the transshipment policy derived from the hybrid DRL approach could obtain the best profit compared to existing algorithms. Third, we examine the impacts of transshipment by differing types of demand and varying the unit transshipment cost parameter. We find that transshipment substantially reduces the outdating cost by allowing the offline channel to make good use of the old products that will be discarded in the online channel, which is new to the literature.",1366-5545,Not found

The traditional methods used mathematical programming (MP) to analyse either 1) a deterministic allocation with a flight range limitation or 2) a stochastic allocation using a choice model without a range constraint. We combine the two methods by adopting a recently proposed eUnit choice model in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to consider the interaction between travel choice behavior and travel cost incurred by skyport locations and their linkages in the random utility maximization framework. Three schemes of the multiple allocation incomplete p-hub location problem are provided, including revenue maximization, profit maximization, and profit maximization with pricing strategy.

However, the logistics decisions in the vending machine service industry are challenging, coupled with complex constraints, considering the machine deployment location, product selection, shelf display allocation, and the elasticity of demands and spaces. This paper presents a bi-layer optimization model addressing the challenges associated with deployment location, product selection, and shelf display for a vending machine system consisting of more than ten thousand vending machines. The upper layer model selects appropriate locations for machine deployment, while the lower layer model considers product selection and shelf display in individual machines.

This study focuses on a novel battery electric bus (BEB) charging scheduling problem involving solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage facilities. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to schedule BEB charging and control solar PV energy simultaneously. The model handles a range of realistic considerations, including heterogeneous BEBs regarding battery capacities, peak net charging power costs, flexible charging powers, and multi-route-multi-depot scheduling. A key point of our model is the introduction of variable charging power decisions designed to align BEB charging demands with solar PV production. The optimization objective is to minimize the sum of charging costs, carbon emission costs, energy storage costs, and revenue (negative cost) from solar PV energy sales. The model empowers public transport agencies to swiftly generate daily BEB charging schedules given daily solar and weather variations.

Operational design for modular electrified transit in corridor areas,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103567,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"In urban corridor areas, profound congestion creates a pressing need for public transit to deliver efficient, flexible, and sustainable “door-to-door” services. This paper introduces a modular electrified transit system tailored for urban corridor areas (MET-CA), with a primary focus on enhancing transportation efficiency and reducing electrical energy consumption. The MET-CA system comprises two core components: mainline transit, dedicated to providing rapid services along the corridor, and feeder transit, catering to individual service zones. Seamless en-route transfers are facilitated through designated docking sections along the corridor. To rigorously address the system’s optimization, we formulate it as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on a time-expanded network. Subsequently, an inter-transit iterative heuristic with a problem-customized rolling method is developed within a bi-level framework to address the large-scale complexity. Its performance is validated through extensive numerical experiments, substantially compared to exact solutions obtained from the Cplex solver, showcasing an impressive average computation time savings of 49.7% with a minimal quality decrease of 0.18%.

Gray marketing phenomena in global supply chains: Can pricing strategies help?,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103541,187,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Nowadays, gray marketing is a critical issue in global supply chain management. In this paper, we analytically study how authorized incumbent retailers can use pricing to prevent unauthorized parties from entering and establishing gray markets. We consider the case in which an authorized retailer can choose from three pricing strategies, namely: myopic, proactive, and reactive. The authorized incumbent retailer in the high-end market faces consumers with higher willingness to pay (WTP). We investigate the entry conditions for an entrant retailer to establish a gray market under the three pricing strategies and provide a succinct analytical framework to segment the high-end market explicitly in terms of entry conditions. We identify the deterrence outcomes in each segmented market, and determine when each pricing strategy is optimal in the segmented markets. We theoretically reveal that whether deterring or allowing unauthorized entry is optimal depends on the entrant retailer’s purchasing cost and the degree of consumers’ WTP differentiation between the authorized and unauthorized products. When consumers have a high WTP in the high-end market and the incumbent retailer has a high purchasing cost, the entrant retailer is more likely to enter the high-end market. Although the reactive pricing strategy is the most flexible one, followed by the proactive and myopic pricing strategies, the adoption of a relatively flexible pricing strategy cannot always completely deter unauthorized entry. Counterintuitively, ignoring the threat of unauthorized entry by adopting a myopic pricing strategy is the optimal choice for the incumbent authorized retailer, followed by the proactive and reactive pricing strategies. In addition, our results highlight that the choice to adopt a more flexible pricing strategy to deter unauthorized entry may lead to a “winner’s curse” instead of a “winner-takes-all” outcome. Moreover, allowing unauthorized entry into the supply chain is by no means a “win–win” game. To show the robustness of findings, various extended analyses are conducted.",1366-5545,Not found
Path-choice-constrained bus bridging design under urban rail transit disruptions,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103637,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Although urban rail transit systems play a crucial role in urban mobility, they frequently suffer from unexpected disruptions due to power loss, severe weather, equipment failure, and other factors that cause significant disruptions in passenger travel and, in turn, socioeconomic losses. To alleviate the inconvenience of affected passengers, bus bridging services are often provided when rail service has been suspended. Prior research has yielded various methodologies for effective bus bridging services; however, they are mainly based on the strong assumption that passengers must follow predetermined bus bridging routes. Less attention is paid to passengers’ path choice behaviors, which could affect the performance of the bus bridging services deployed. In this paper, we specifically take passengers’ path choice behaviors into account and address the bus bridging optimization problem under urban rail transit disruptions. Incorporating a PS-logit model to estimate the probabilities of passenger path choices, we propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to simultaneously determine the selection of bus bridging routes and vehicle deployment on selected bridging routes, with the objective of minimizing the cost associated with passenger travel time and unsatisfied demand. To solve this computationally challenging large-scale nonlinear model, we design a customized variable neighborhood search algorithm framework. A case study based on the Shanghai rail transit system is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of the proposed approach. The results indicate that our approach can provide an effective bus bridging scheme that considers passenger path choice, which facilitates rapid response to rail disruptions. Our scheme substantially outperforms the current bridging designs that do not consider passenger path choice behaviors by significantly reducing the number of unserved passengers.",1366-5545,Not found
Mobility heterogeneity of urban freight areas: Geospatial evidence from shared logistics dynamics,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103657,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Amid rising mobility services in cities, the logistics sector plays a crucial role in envisioning daily services for local neighborhoods. Previous research has primarily identified key freight areas (KFAs) in small-scale regions using traditional census and travel survey data. However, differing from KFAs, other areas with distinct freight patterns remain largely unexamined, and there is a lack of comprehensive indicators to evaluate the travel behaviors of large-scale freight vehicles. This study introduces a data-driven geospatial framework to characterize and understand the patterns exhibited by different freight areas through freight dynamics data collected in cities. To analyze key aspects of freight mobility within spatial units, a set of areal indicators is developed using GPS trajectories of shared freight vehicles in Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics illustrate the inherent differences across various areas and their spatial distributions. A hierarchical clustering approach groups all areas based on proposed indicators, providing a quantitative evaluation of collective spatial patterns. The analysis also explores the non-linear relationships between different categories of freight activities and the local built environments and socioeconomic conditions. The results suggest a strong spatial heterogeneity in the areal mobility profile of Hong Kong. Loading and unloading behaviors are frequently observed in districts such as Eastern Kowloon, Kwai Chung, and the Airport, highlighting prevalent freight trip origins and destinations. In contrast, areas with high transit times are mostly found in suburban regions, particularly on the periphery.

An enhanced variable neighborhood search method for refrigerated container stacking and relocation problem with duplicate priorities,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103643,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Due to the stringent timeliness requirements of temperature-controlled cargoes and distinctive storage operations of refrigerated container (RC), it is imperative to optimize the storage process of RCs in terms of reducing relocations and delays. Aiming to manage RC storage more efficiently, this paper addresses an integrated problem of refrigerated container stacking and relocation problem (RCSRP) with unique characteristics, including various storage modes (i.e., RC block and cold storage), concurrent stacking and retrieving tasks, and duplicate handling priorities. A new virtual stack concept is introduced to develop a new binary formulation of RC block configuration, enabling simultaneous handling of stacking and retrieving tasks. Based on the new binary formulation, a mixed integer programming (MIP) model is developed and incorporates novel constraints related to RC operations and duplicate handling priorities. To improve solvability, a decomposition strategy is proposed to make it possible to solve large-scale problems. An enhanced variable neighborhood search (EVNS) algorithm is developed to solve the decomposed model iteratively. A handling sequence and stacking and relocation scheduling (HSSRS) heuristic is designed to solve sub-problems. With the implementation of the decomposition strategy and tailored EVNS framework, both the solvability and solving efficiency of the original integrated MIP model are significantly improved. The decomposed model can be optimally solved by CPLEX under the EVNS on small-scale instances. On medium-scale instances, the proposed approach can also obtain extreme high-quality solutions with an average gap of less than 0.1%, while the solving efficiency is increased more than 30%. On large-scale instances, the decomposed model is still worked, while the original MIP model cannot be solved. Besides, by applying the HSSRS, the EVNS can also optimally solve small-scale instances, and yields satisfactory solutions with an average gap below 3.2% on medium and large-scale instances. Meanwhile, the computing efficiency is significantly higher than CPLEX and general genetic algorithm. The computational experiments results indicate that, the proposed decomposition strategy can effectively improve the solvability of the original MIP integrated model. Benefit from the unique characteristic of the RCSRP, the tailored EVNS framework and HSSRS heuristic significantly improve the solving efficiency of the decomposed model, while ensuring the solution quality and convergence. The proposed approach can help port operators to manage RC storage in a more effective manner.

An efficient solution methodology grounded in Lagrangian relaxation and valid inequalities is developed to deal with the inherent complexities of the proposed model. Real data from the UK’s transportation system is employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The case study exemplifies the application of the proposed model in generating practical insights for transport managers and policymakers to help them identify where to prioritize investments across the transport network. Most notably, we find that allocating a mere 0.4% of the total cost to preparedness and recovery initiatives can yield a substantial reduction of approximately 4.7% in total costs.

Strategic analysis of vertical integration in cross-border e-commerce logistics service supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103626,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The boom in cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) brings opportunities and challenges to its logistics. Integrated logistics service providers (ILSPs) are becoming increasingly important in the CBEC industry by offering cost-effective integrated logistics services. We construct a three-echelon supply chain consisting of one ILSP, one CBEC platform, and one functional logistics service provider (FLSP), and consider three scenarios, namely, no integration (VD), vertical integration dominated by ILSP (VI-L), and vertical integration dominated by platform (VI-P). This study aims to find out which vertical integration strategy is more effective in mitigating the double marginalization problem in supply chain, what the influencing factors are, and how these factors affect vertical integration performance. The results show that higher channel power does not always result in greater profits for the ILSP but does for the CBEC platform. With low logistics cost performance, mode VI-L is optimal for the ILSP and becomes the equilibrium strategy in which increased logistics cost investment benefits the ILSP but harms the platform. With high logistics cost performance, mode VI-P is optimal for all parties and generates the highest logistics service level, in which the increased logistics cost investment benefits the platform but harms the ILSP, resulting in the equilibrium strategy evolving from mode VI-P to mode VI-L. The FLSP’s preference aligns with the improvement of logistics service level when the market size is small or moderate. We also extend our model to encompass more scenarios and find that the exogenous logistics service price or service level can exacerbate the profit conflict between the ILSP and the platform, resulting in no strategic equilibrium for mode VI-P. Additionally, it is not always the best choice for CBEC platforms to self-build logistics systems to directly integrate FLSP’s services, compared to taking the lead in vertical integration with a professional ILSP.",1366-5545,Not found
Owner-operator experience and violations in trucking: The mixed role of perceived justice,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103642,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"There is a growing interest in understanding unsafe truck driving due to the increased likelihood of accidents and fatalities caused by speed and load violations. As independent contractors, truck owner-operators have the freedom to engage in exchange relationships with service buyers in a subcontracting supply chain, yet they face operational constrains that lead them to cut corners. In light of this, we present procedural justice (PJ) and distributive justice (DJ), drawing on social exchange theory, as a means of reducing the likelihood of violations by truck owner-operators. We examine these roles in the context of owner-operator experience, which is critical to understanding their behavior with respect to exchange processes and outcomes. Based on a sample of 260 truck owner-operators in South Korea, our analysis reveals a positive relationship between owner-operator experience and trucking violations. Our analysis also shows that perceived PJ is negatively associated with speeding but not with overloading. However, for interaction, experience with PJ reduces overloading but not speeding. Conversely, experience with DJ is negatively associated with overloading but not with speeding. Surprisingly, we find a positive interaction effect of DJ and experience for both overloading and speeding. In summary, our study provides a fine-grained view of the mixed role of perceived justice in the relationship between owner-operator experience and violations in trucking.",1366-5545,Not found
Transitioning from gasoline to electric vehicles: Electrification decision of automakers under purchase and station subsidies,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103640,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Promoting the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) is inseparable from the electrification of gasoline vehicle (GV) automakers. However, transitioning from GVs to EVs may confront challenges posed by the high costs of EV production and charging station construction. To address this issue, governments often offer purchase subsidies to consumers and/or station subsidies to automakers. This study investigates how these subsidies affect the decision of a monopoly automaker to enter the EV market and exit the GV market. Our analytical model incorporates factors including costs, subsidies, and competition, yielding several key findings. First, fierce product competition between GVs and EVs may keep the automaker from entering the EV market, whereas the automaker always has the opportunity to start EV production under weak competition. Second, the automaker may achieve electrification directly from GV to EV production as EV production costs decline, bypassing the strategy of entering the EV market first and subsequently exiting the GV market. Third, although both purchase and station subsidies can incentivize the automaker to enter the EV market, they may inadequately motivate (or potentially discourage) the automaker to exit the GV market, even if it is cost-effective to produce EVs and build charging stations. Last, our primary findings maintain qualitative robustness when considering price decisions, public charging stations, and asymmetric cases. Additionally, we extend our analysis to cover scenarios involving endogenous subsidies or duopoly competition.",1366-5545,Not found

Second, a comprehensive evaluation method is proposed to measure the performance of the FS methods based on stability, predictive performance improvement, and statistical tests.

To this end, the headway-dependent fundamental diagram (HFD) and headway-dependent double queue model (HDQ) are developed to model the effect of dynamic headway on roads, and a dynamic network model is built. It is rigorously proved that the minimum headway could always achieve SO-DTA, yet the optimal headway is non-unique. Motivated by these two findings, this study defines a novel concept of maximin headway, which is the largest headway that still achieves SO-DTA in the network. Mathematical properties regarding maximin headway are analyzed and an efficient solution algorithm is developed. Numerical experiments on both a small and large network verify the effectiveness of the maximin headway control framework as well as the properties of maximin headway. This study sheds light on deriving the desired solution among the non-unique solutions in SO-DTA and provides implications regarding the safety margin of AVs under SO-DTA.",1366-5545,Not found
Shore power for reduction of shipping emission in port: A bibliometric analysis,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103639,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Shore power not only reduces ship emissions and noise in berthing but also has shown practical implications for maritime competitiveness. However, the existing literature and industry reports reveal that a limited number of ships have access to shore power. This highlights the need for research into the constraints faced by the sector and the development of solutions to enhance its adoption. Addressing these issues will enable the port and shipping industries to enjoy the associated benefits. Currently, existing research on shore power remains dispersed, yet it fully addresses such questions and lacks an integrated framework, making it challenging to extract pivotal insights. This paper aims to conduct a state-of-the-art review of shore power by the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases as a pivotal solution to shipping emissions reduction in ports and advancing the maritime sector towards carbon neutrality. This analysis is grounded in a bibliometric analysis of existing literature on this topic, with a focus on the need to devise robust strategies to fully harness the potential of shore power for carbon neutrality. The valuable findings are revealed, including (i) The adoption of shore power by ports is predominantly propelled by regulatory mandates and incentives, inclusive of government subsidies in leading regions such as China, the U.S., and Europe; (ii) Due to the implementation of Emission Control Areas and carbon neutrality regulations, an increasing number of port operators in Europe are turning to shore power to fulfil both the governmental or industrial requirements, especially regarding cruise ships; (iii) The literature on shore power primarily delves into four main research areas: the inherent features of shore power, emission inventory assessments, practical applications of shore power, and energy management strategies; and (iv) Emerging directions in shore power research include cooperative optimisation among stakeholders, integration of new technologies into shore power, a holistic evaluation of the multifaceted advantages of diverse emission reduction strategies, and critical examinations of any unintended consequences stemming from shore power adoption. They offer invaluable insights on enhancing the adaptation and effectiveness of shore power.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal shore power adoption decisions with government regulation considering port competition,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103629,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"With the shipping industry’s focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, shore power (SP) emerges as a pivotal yet underutilized solution. The existing literature, based on the inappropriate assumption of ports adopting SP fully, focuses solely on the influence of subsidies on SP adoption. By comprehensively considering the impacts of various regulations, we construct a game model to explore the optimal SP adoption rates of competitive ports, treating regulations as exogenous factors. Considering ports’ service quality differences and government regulations, we find there is a positive correlation between the SP cost and SP adoption rate of the port with low service quality. Specifically, the low-quality port can strategically increase adoption of SP to gain a competitive edge. We suggest a balanced approach to regulations, advocating targeting ports with extreme government regulations coefficients, and focusing on shipping companies with moderate coefficients. A key insight is the setting of the emissions standards at a level between the emissions of competing ports. Importantly, we uncover a nonlinear relationship between the SP adoption rate and emissions reduction effectiveness, highlighting the complexity of the environmental impact. Our findings provide reference for SP adoption decision-making at ports and formulating government regulations.",1366-5545,Not found
Platform-based stable truck matching problem with trailer-swapping mode,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103638,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This study investigates the platform-based stable truck-matching problem with trailer-swapping mode (STMP-TSM). The TSM is a novel collaborative transportation approach in which trucks participate in trailer swapping, significantly decreasing the rate of empty trucks and reducing transportation costs. In the STMP-TSM, a platform delivers a trailer-swapping scheme that satisfies all participating trucks. Correspondingly, an integer linear programming model is developed to maximize the total truck utility of the STMP-TSM. A specific preference list based on a chain-data structure is meticulously constructed to obtain a stable matching scheme. The preference list enables more generalized truck matching. In addition, a series of acceleration strategies is proposed to expedite the generation of a preference list while effectively reducing its length. An iterative preference-list-trim heuristic algorithm is designed, which strategically trims chains in the preference list to solve the STMP-TSM efficiently. As a benchmark, an integer linear programming model is developed based on the preference list to solve the truck-matching problem using the TSM. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, assess the practicality of the TSM, and analyze the influences of the key parameters.",1366-5545,Not found
Tackling the crowdsourced shared-trip delivery problem at scale with a novel decomposition heuristic,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103633,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This paper presents a set-partitioning formulation and a novel decomposition heuristic (D-H) solution algorithm to solve large-scale instances of the urban crowdsourced shared-trip delivery (CSD) problem. The CSD problem involves dedicated vehicles (DVs) and shared personal vehicles (SPVs) fulfilling delivery orders, wherein the SPVs have their own trip origins and destinations. The D-H begins by assigning as many package delivery orders (PDOs) to SPVs as possible, where the D-H enumerates the set of routes each SPV can feasibly traverse and then solves a PDO-SPV-route assignment problem. For PDO-DV assignment and DV routing, the D-H solves a multi-vehicle routing problem with time-window, tour duration, and capacity constraints using an insertion heuristic. Finally, the D-H seeks potential solution improvements by switching PDOs between SPV and DV routes through a simulated annealing (SA)-inspired procedure. The D-H outperforms a commercial solver in terms of computational efficiency while obtaining near-optimal solutions for small problem instances. The SA-inspired switching procedure outperforms a large neighborhood search algorithm regarding run time, and the two are comparable regarding solution quality. Finally, the paper uses the D-H to analyze the impact of several relevant factors on city-scale CSD system performance, namely the number of participating SPVs and the maximum willingness to detour of SPVs. Consistent with the existing literature, we find that CSD can substantially reduce delivery costs. However, we find that CSD can increase vehicle miles traveled. Our findings provide meaningful insights for logistics practitioners, while the algorithms illustrate promise for large real-world systems.",1366-5545,Not found
Designing manufacturer's new product technology for a closed-loop supply chain with consumer context effect,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103634,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"As commonly believed, without consumer context effect, manufacturers facing horizontal competition from independent remanufacturers/refurbishers may reduce the remanufacturability of new products. Nevertheless, given the retailer’s refurbishment capability, we examine how a manufacturer’s product design, as measured by the technology level of the new product, is influenced by vertical competition from a retailer and consumer context effect. We consider three scenarios: (1) a vertical supply chain where the retailer lacks refurbishment capability, (2) a closed-loop supply chain involving a retailer with refurbishment capability, and (3) a closed-loop supply chain with consumer context effect which implies that retailer-refurbished products positively influence the perceived value of the manufacturer’s new products. We propose a game-theoretical model to determine the manufacturer’s optimal product technology level and pricing strategy, as well as the retailer’s pricing and refurbishment decisions. We show that, with the retailer’s refurbishment capability, although refurbished products of the retailer will cannibalize new products of the manufacturer, the manufacturer may design a low technology level instead of a high one. Our analysis also reveals that, under certain conditions, the profits of the manufacturer, retailer, and supply chain can increase with the emergence of the retailer’s refurbishment capability, compared to the scenario where the retailer lacks this capability. Furthermore, our findings suggest that in the presence of consumer context effect, even if refurbished products positively impact the perceived value of new products, the manufacturer may design a higher technology level to alleviate the vertical competition.",1366-5545,Not found
Mixed-fleet operation of battery electric bus and hydrogen bus: Considering limited depot size with flexible refueling processes,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103630,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Electrified transit is crucial for promoting zero-emission transportation in metropolitan cities. However, this initiative faces considerable challenges in Hong Kong due to limited space available for parking and refueling bus fleets. Despite the inexpensive operational costs of battery electric buses (BEBs), plenty of space is required to park and refuel BEBs. Hydrogen buses (HBs) can partially address the space issue with a longer driving range and shorter refueling time compared to the BEBs, whereas more operational costs must be spent. Therefore, a mixed fleet with BEB of HB tends to be a more cost-effective solution. In consideration of the distinctive characteristics of BEBs and HBs, this study develops an integrated vehicle scheduling and refueling of mixed fleets with multiple depots (IVSR-MFMD) restricted by the limited depot size (i.e., space provided for bus parking and bus refueling), where flexible refueling processes, allowing for uncertain refueling start times and refueling amounts, are endogenously incorporated into the operational cycle. The speed-up techniques are further used to reduce problem dimensions and reformulate the model. A two-route-two-depot example and a real-world case in Hong Kong are used to verify the model. The results demonstrate that adopting HB can efficiently reduce depot size and achieve lower operational costs when routes consume massive energy. Additionally, it is found that flexible refueling processes lead to lower operational costs, and the customized speed-up techniques can significantly improve computational efficiency.",1366-5545,Not found
Reliable lifelong planning A*: Technique for re-optimizing reliable shortest paths when travel time distribution updating,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103635,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Re-optimization technique is an efficient approach for solving the shortest path problem in dynamic deterministic networks, where link travel times are updated in real-time. However, existing re-optimization techniques, built on the assumption that link travel times are deterministic, cannot be used to solve reliable shortest path problems in real road networks with noticeable levels of travel time uncertainties. This study proposes a novel re-optimization technique, named reliable lifelong planning A* (RLPA*), for re-optimizing reliable shortest path finding results in dynamic stochastic networks, where link travel time distributions are updated in real-time. The proposed RLPA* technique can efficiently determine the optimal solution in dynamic stochastic networks by reusing path search results produced in the previous time instance. The proposed RLPA* technique is further utilized to solve the K reliable shortest paths problem, which is regarded as a series of reliable shortest path searches in a dynamic stochastic network. To validate the proposed algorithms, a comprehensive case study using real traffic data is conducted.

Synchronizing order picking and delivery in e-commerce warehouses under community logistics,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103631,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The interplay between inbound order picking and outbound delivery operations is imperative. Nevertheless, these two operations are generally studied in a separate manner, and most existing studies on inbound order picking do not consider the influence of picking operations on downstream delivery operations. This paper addresses the order picking problem in e-commerce warehouses from a new perspective, i.e., towards achieving picking and delivery synchronization. We define a Dynamic Order Picking Problem with Delivery Decisions (DOPP-DD), where picking decisions are dynamically determined, given periodically received community logistics (CL) delivery decisions, to minimize vehicle waiting time at loading docks. The DOPP-DD is modeled as a Markov Decision Process and a selective order picking (SOP) policy is proposed to solve it, leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict near-future delivery decisions. Our numerical study showcases the CNN’s high accuracy toward predicting the CL delivery decisions. We compare the performance of the SOP against three benchmark policies across 23 instances. The results reveal that the SOP policy outperforms the others in instances with limited picking capability and demonstrates higher robustness toward limited picking resources, highlighting its potential to alleviate overstock issues and foster a more synchronized workflow in order picking and delivery operations.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal trade-in programs for quality differentiated recycled products,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103617,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Prior research mostly focuses on traditional trade-in programs where there is no up-front fee. Motivated by recent industrial practice that firms implement quality differentiated trade-in programs with up-front fees (TF programs), we investigate three types of TF programs: only recycling low-quality old products, only recycling high-quality old products, and recycling low- and high-quality old products. Compared with the traditional trade-in model, the firm sets a lower selling price in TF models. Specifically, when the consumers’ value discount for used products is low, the selling price in the TF model that recycles low- and high-quality old products is the lowest; when the value discount is high, the selling price in the TF models that recycles low- and high-quality old products or only recycle low-quality old products may be the lowest. Interestingly, we find that all types of TF programs lead to lower trade-in rebates for replacement consumers than the traditional trade-in program. The firm with the TF program that recycles low- and high-quality products serves most consumers and charges the highest recycling quantity. Finally, we extend the models and verify the robustness of our main conclusions.",1366-5545,Not found
Effects of information asymmetry on green advertising for remanufacturing within a closed-loop supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103618,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Manufacturers invest in Green Advertising for Remanufacturing (GAR) to attract consumers by promoting the eco-friendly benefits of their remanufacturing. Despite this, the production of remanufactured products is often influenced by Third-Party Collectors (3PCs) which handle the collection of used products. Unfortunately, market responsiveness to GAR levels is undisclosed due to proprietary information, which leaves 3PCs to unreasonably set pricing and collection quantities, potentially leading to profit loss. To explore how a two-part tariff (TPT) contract menu facilitates 3PCs in acquiring information regarding the manufacturer’s GAR effectiveness, a closed-loop supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one 3PC is taken into consideration. The optimal decisions are analyzed in three distinct decision-making scenarios: the centralized scenario, the complete information scenario, and the asymmetric information scenario. The research findings suggest that in the presence of information asymmetry, manufacturers with high GAR effectiveness (H-type manufacturers) are inclined to masquerade as manufacturers with low GAR effectiveness (L-type manufacturers). Consequently, H-type manufacturers gain additional profits due to information asymmetry. However, for the 3PC, information asymmetry leads to reduced expected profit when the manufacturer has high GAR effectiveness and increased expected profit when the manufacturer has low GAR effectiveness. Finally, our analysis demonstrates that information asymmetry does not consistently hurt consumer surplus.",1366-5545,Not found
"Modelling supply chain Visibility, digital Technologies, environmental dynamism and healthcare supply chain Resilience: An organisation information processing theory perspective",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103613,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The healthcare sector is a complex and critical industry that requires a resilient supply chain to ensure patients receive the care they need. However, the pandemic and geopolitical crises have highlighted the need for a more comprehensive understanding of healthcare supply chain resilience. To address this, healthcare providers and policymakers increasingly recognise the importance of digital technology in enhancing their supply chain resilience. Despite this recognition, there is a lack of empirical studies that have explored the relationship between supply chain visibility, digital capabilities, and environmental dynamism in the healthcare sector. Therefore, our study aimed to fill this gap by utilising organisational information processing theory (OIPT) to explain the relationship between these factors. Our analysis of 137 survey responses revealed that supply chain visibility is a foundational resource for digital capabilities. Moreover, digital capabilities are vital in enhancing healthcare supply chain resilience in highly turbulent environments. Our research expands the concept of the OIPT to offer a more comprehensive explanation of how supply chain visibility is a crucial factor for the effective functioning of digital technologies, particularly in highly uncertain environments.

The battery allocation optimization problem is reduced to a ranking problem with respect to SOC and integrated into the prediction model. The rank of SOC is determined from both pairwise and listwise perspectives. Considering the inherent characteristics of rankwise regression, such as missing parameters and infinite number of optimal solutions, a geometric analysis is conducted. A model enhancement approach is then proposed to ensure the accuracy of both prediction and optimization models. This enhancement facilitates optimal decision-making while preserving the interpretability of predicted values. A case study is conducted using the real-world data of Nanjing, China.

Financing a capital-constrained supply chain: Equity or debt,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103614,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Many retailers are small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with limited access to capital to finance their operations. Here, we consider a supply chain consisting of a capital-constrained retailer and a manufacturer and examine the effect of equity and debt financing schemes on their operational decisions. Using a game theoretical approach, for the risk-neutral scenario, we take expected profit maximization as the participants’ objective to examine the equilibria of their operational and financing decisions. We also examine the condition under which the manufacturer and retailer adopt equity or debt financing to earn additional profits. We find that when the retailer is highly capital-constrained, she benefits from either financing scheme, but the manufacturer prefers to offer equity financing over debt financing. Otherwise, if the retailer is less constrained, debt financing is preferable. We also extend our analysis to risk-averse participants using the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) criterion. We show that the decreasing monotone property of the order quantity in the wholesale price, known in the risk-neutral setting, no longer holds. Indeed, the relationship depends on the participants’ risk aversion level; if the manufacturer is highly risk-averse, it chooses to provide equity financing to enhance its CVaR performance; otherwise, it offers debt financing. Our findings provide implications for decision-makers in choosing the optimal financing options and making the associated operations and financing decisions when considering risk attitudes.",1366-5545,Not found
Passenger social rerouting strategies in capacitated public transport systems,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103598,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Services of many public transportation systems are regulated by static timetables. Tactical decisions to improve operations are usually limited to supply-side measures that fail to quickly react to short-term changes in passenger demand and disturbances. Where the realized level of service (LoS) might be substantially different from what was expected, demand management measures, such as advising travelers to use specific routes in the interest of congestion and travel time of the entire population (social rerouting), can be implemented alongside supply-side measures to improve the LoS over different timescales. In this study, we introduce multi-modal social rerouting strategies, considering trains, buses, and trams running with predefined timetables, to improve the LoS of capacitated public transport networks by asking a portion of the passenger demand to change departure time, line, or service. In fact, we aim to balance network load by rerouting passengers using a centrally-coordinated information strategy. The strategy anticipates feedback effects due to failed boardings and discomfort because of overcrowding by incorporating behavioral responses to advice over different timescales. We explore theoretical and practical challenges by evaluating the effectiveness and performance of strategies using real-world data from the Zürich and Twente public transport networks. Numerical experiments reveal that (1) system efficiency can already be improved with the compliance of a small portion of passengers to the social rerouting advice; (2) with 20%–50% steerable passengers, the improvement gradient of system efficiency is at a maximum; (3) targeting a certain level of system efficiency, a smaller detour tolerance requires the compliance of more travelers, and a larger detour tolerance allows fewer travelers to comply with the detour.",1366-5545,Not found
Freemium design: Optimal tier differentiation models for content platforms,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103612,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The freemium business strategy has been widely embraced by content platforms. We develop an analytical model to explore the optimal freemium strategy for a monopolistic content platform. We identify three common strategies for releasing freemium: differentiation only by content (OC model), differentiation only by advertising (OA model), and differentiation by both content and advertising (CA model). Under OC, consumers can access limited content in the free tier and full content in the paid tier while being required to view ads in both tiers. Under OA, consumers can access full content in both tiers but do not see ads in the paid tier. Under CA, consumers can access full content and remove ads in the paid tier while only being able to access limited content and being required to view ads in the free tier. Consumers are heterogeneous in the amount of content they want to consume and in the nuisance cost they perceive from viewing ads. Several factors, such as the ad revenue rate and the proportion of consumers with a high nuisance cost, have crucial effects on the optimal design of the freemium strategies. When the ad revenue rate is moderate, the equilibrium advertising intensity, subscription fee, and the amount of content in the free tier show nonmonotonic changes.",1366-5545,Not found

This requires attention to technology investment and market competition at the different stages of robotaxi development. This study aims to reveal the changing rules of R&D investment and market competition for robotaxi services at various stages, considering subsidies, passenger preferences (i.e. walking aversion, safety, additional convenience), and the volatility of benefits from congestion reduction. We developed models to capture the competition between robotaxis and traditional taxis in the three phases of market development — namely, introduction, development, and dominance. The results of this study show that the optimal level of R&D investment is affected by factors such as R&D subsidies, passenger preferences, and the volatility of congestion reduction benefits and that it decreases during the development phase and may further decline during the dominance phase. Additionally, government R&D subsidies should be maintained at a reasonable level to avoid potential strategic conflicts with companies in technology investment and adoption of robotaxi services during the introduction phase. The transition from R&D subsidies to usage subsidies will depend on reaching the perceived safety threshold for robotaxi services. Reducing congestion can play a role similar to the deployment of usage subsidies to promote robotaxi services during the development phase, and can promote R&D investment, robotaxi services, and firm profits in the dominance phase. However, these benefits may be reduced by the volatility of congestion reduction.

Due to the ability of CAVs to share information and coordinate in real-time, the design of autonomous vehicle (AV)-exclusive lanes has received much attention as it is expected to improve traffic flow characteristics. This study proposes an AV-exclusive lane design problem (ALDP) for the road network. The ALDP is formulated as a bi-level programming model. The upper-level model deploys the optimal design of AV-exclusive lanes to reduce the total comprehensive cost. The lower-level problem describes the mixed routing equilibrium (MRE) travel behavior of CAVs and HDVs. Specifically, CAVs and HDVs follow the user equilibrium principle in general lanes, and CAVs on the exclusive lanes are controlled by the system to adopt the system optimum principle. To deal with large-scale scenarios, a heuristic nested algorithm is developed for solving the lower-level MRE traffic assignment problem. Two acceleration strategies, namely the technology-based strategy and the sensitivity analysis-based strategy, are developed to speed up the solution process. Besides, a kriging surrogate-based optimization algorithm is designed to solve the bi-level ALDP. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the nested algorithm achieves high-precision solution with fast computational speed when solving the MRE problem in real-world traffic networks. Additionally, the implementation of the AV-exclusive lanes design scheme significantly improves the overall performance of the network in terms of total system travel time.

Enhancing the evacuation efficiency through the two-step optimization of train timetable and response vehicles during metro disruptions,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103605,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Train timetable rescheduling and bus bridging service are two common measures in metro disruption management. Existing literature on train timetable rescheduling typically does not address the issue of transporting stranded passengers, and the use of a fixed operational mode in bus bridging services can lead to a loss in transport capacity. In this paper, we present a two-step optimization model that involves train timetable rescheduling and response vehicle scheduling. In the first step, the train timetable rescheduling (TTR) model aims to minimize the interests of both metro operators and passengers. Stranded passengers are distributed based on the platform holding capacity at each station, and three rescheduling strategies (cancellation, short-turning, and adjustment of the train departure time) are also adopted. In the second step, the response vehicle scheduling (RVS) model aims to provide flexible auxiliary transportation service for stranded passengers, with the goal of transporting them to their destinations as quickly as possible. Both models are coordinated to ensure the effective transport of passengers during the disruption period. Furthermore, we develop a decomposition-based heuristic framework that performs well for solving our models. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to test the validity of the models and algorithms. The results show that: (1) the combined rescheduling strategies can decrease the passenger waiting time and alleviate the platform pressure at each station; (2) compared with the standard bus bridging service, the response vehicle performs better in reducing both passenger total travel time and vehicle empty driving.",1366-5545,Not found
Building resilience or maintaining robustness: Insights from relational view and information processing perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103609,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Drawing upon the relational view and information processing perspective, we investigate how supply chain integration (SCI) comprising supplier integration and customer integration influence supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices embracing supply chain (SC) resilience and supply chain (SC) robustness, and subsequently influence supply chain (SC) performance.

BDA-enabled agility complements supplier integration while substitutes customer integration to improve SC resilience and SC robustness. Besides, our results reveal that SC resilience and SC robustness both improve SC performance, and SC robustness mediates the relationship between SC resilience and SC performance.",1366-5545,Not found
Improved Benders decomposition for stack-based yard template generation in an automated container terminal,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103607,188,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Automated container terminals have become popular solutions to the growing need for container handling. We propose a two-stage mathematical model to design an efficient yard template for automated container terminals, using stacks as the allocation unit. In the first stage, a bi-objective model is developed to optimize landside and seaside operations in the terminal. A Benders decomposition algorithm is designed to solve the model. The proposed algorithm is improved by several acceleration strategies, including valid inequalities, pareto-optimal cuts, and ε −optimal approach. Drawing upon the solution derived from the first stage, the second stage assigns containers to specific bays, which is partitioned into multiple subproblems by capitalizing on the structure of it to enhance solvability. Numerous numerical experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In addition, scenario analysis demonstrate that the stack-based yard template is more efficient than a cluster-based yard template for automated container terminals with multiple targets.",1366-5545,Not found
Is ignorance bliss? Centralized and competitive newsvendor models with product availability effect,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103670,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This paper addresses newsvendor problem by endogenizing product availability effect on consumer demand. Specifically, we consider two retailers that sell a same product under a centralized or a decentralized market. The consumers are heterogeneous in their search costs, and make strategic choices based on the probability of product availability of different retailers. Building a game-theoretic model, we show that in addition to a symmetric Nash equilibrium, there may exist asymmetric equilibriums to the inventory competition game in the decentralized market. Nevertheless, the symmetric equilibrium is stable to maximize the total profit of two competing retailers. Then, we find that the retailers’ inventory decisions exhibit a “pull-to-center” bias when they ignore the product availability effect on consumer demand. In particular, for a small (large) product valuation, a retailer that ignores this effect will stock more (less) quantities and provide a higher (lower) fill rate than the benchmark optimum, thus pulling the inventory policy upward (downward). More interestingly, we show that such ignorance can be bliss in the decentralized market. Benefiting from the weakened competition, the retailers might perform better than the benchmark when they ignore the product availability effect. The welfare implications for both consumers and whole society are explored in the meantime. The findings also reveal some novel insights into the behavioral newsvendor research.",1366-5545,Not found
A stochastic ridesharing user equilibrium model with origin-destination-based ride-matching strategy,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103688,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Ridesharing, as an emerging mode of modern urban transportation, has gained widespread popularity due to its ability to improve convenience and reduce the expenses in daily travel. To capture its impact on the network-wide traffic flow pattern, this paper develops a new variational inequality (VI) formulation for modeling the stochastic ridesharing user equilibrium (SRUE) problem considering an origin–destination (O-D) -based ride-matching strategy. The proposed SRUE problem is formulated based on a hierarchical logit choice model to depict the multi-stage decision-making (i.e., role choice, ride-matching, and route choice) of the ridesharing travelers. The SRUE model also reflects a two-sided market equilibrium considering the interaction effect between the ridesharing market and the road traffic equilibrium market. The logit choice model captures the ride-matching problem between the drivers and the passengers traveling on the same/different O-D pairs. Moreover, the lower- and upper-bound constraints for a ridesharing driver picking up passengers are established at the O-D level. For solving the SRUE model with O-D-based ride-matching constraints, the Lagrangian dual method (LDM) is adopted by incorporating the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step size to update the dual variables, which accelerates the convergence of the LDM. Three numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the features of the proposed SRUE model and demonstrate the performance of the solution algorithm.",1366-5545,Not found
A method of time-varying demand distribution estimation for high-speed railway networks with user equilibrium model,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103679,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Time-varying demand distribution (TDD) is a critical input data for operation and management in HSR systems. This paper proposed a bi-level model to estimate the TDD with the ticket booking date and using the schedule-based User Equilibrium (UE) assignment. The up-level aims to determine the TDD with maximum entropy value and minimal error between the path flow (ticket booking volumes) and the corresponding equilibrium flows (determined from lower-level); the lower-level is a schedule-based UE assignment with rigid capacity constraints to reflect the interactions of ticket booking choices behaviors between different OD pairs in the HSR networks, and further, the advance booking cost is considered endogenously as a part of passenger choice equilibrium. The bi-level model is converted into a single-level model through equivalent complementary constraints. Then, based on linear relaxation, the single-level model is transformed into a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP). Furthermore, in order to improve the computational efficiency of the MIQP, the approach of reducing the calculation size of our problem is proposed. By solving the MIQP we get the information about the upper and lower bounds of our original problem, and then a global optimal solution algorithm with four piecewise interval strategies is proposed.

Travel time models for compact automated parking systems using two I/O points and the point of service completion dwell point policy,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103682,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Modern cities encounter challenges related to parking scarcity arising from limited land space and congested traffic. Compact automated parking systems (CAPS) have gained increasing popularity in addressing this issue. These systems store cars in a multi-tier configuration and use a crane with a shuttle at the centre of the system to transport cars. The system throughput primarily relies on the configuration design and the control mechanisms of the crane and shuttle, which are established during the design phase and daily operations, respectively. Our study focuses on the dwell point, where the shuttle remains after completing a transaction, and the input/output (I/O) point. In contrast to existing studies, this paper considers two I/O points and the point-of-service-completion (POSC) dwell point policy. In this configuration, we develop both single-command (SC) and dual-command (DC) travel time models for CAPS with single and dual shuttles, respectively. Simulation is carried out to verify the accuracy of these models. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed policies and optimise the shape of CAPS. In addition, we numerically compare the retrieval time of single and dual shuttle systems, considering SC and DC. Our results show a critical ratio of shuttle travelling speed to the crane rotating speed exists. Beyond this ratio, the performance of single shuttle CAPS is better than that of dual shuttle CAPS, and the DC outperforming the SC in single shuttle CAPS. The results also indicate that DC always performs better in dual shuttle CAPS. Moreover, we compare our operating policies with those from previous studies and investigate the cost performance of our system. The results show the superiority of our policies and suggest their suitability for addressing diverse customer demands.

Unlocking efficiency: End-to-end optimization learning for recurrent facility operational planning,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103683,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This paper studies a general facility operational planning problem, which involves managing a network of facilities or infrastructures (such as road sections or tolls) to serve customers or users while considering their decentralized behaviors. The objective is to optimize the service plans for each facility, taking into account that customers aim to minimize their own costs or disutilities. This problem possesses a wide array of practical applications in operations management and transportation systems. Mathematically, it is often formalized as a bilevel programming model. Due to the inherent complexity introduced by the bilevel (sometimes, hidden bilevel) structure, the resulting model is NP-hard in general. As customer demand exhibits spatial–temporal variations in real-world scenarios, service plans often necessitate re-optimization, sometimes on a rather frequent basis, to adapt to changing demand levels. This poses computational challenges due to the complexity of solving the problem, making it difficult for companies to update service plans with high quality under tight time constraints. To address this challenge, we introduce an end-to-end optimization learning framework that combines offline optimization, machine learning techniques, and customized data generation schemes. Once the learning models are developed and trained, they can directly generate near-optimal service plans using demand information as input features, without invoking external solvers/algorithms. Through computational experiments, we demonstrate that this framework delivers outstanding performance. In most cases, it can produce solutions with optimality gaps of less than 0.11% in minimal execution times. We also provide computational insights into the role of learning models during algorithm development and their impacts on different problem classes.",1366-5545,Not found

A novel parallel computing framework for traffic assignment problem: Integrating alternating direction method of multipliers with Jacobi over relaxation method,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103687,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Traffic assignment plays a crucial role in transport system analysis, and the user equilibrium model is a very essential tool. It is however highly challenging to efficiently solve the user equilibrium model, especially for large-scale networks. Taking the deterministic user equilibrium (DUE) model as a representative, this paper aims to harness parallel computing to tackle its high computing burden. A novel parallel computing framework is proposed, drawing from the frontier alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method. This algorithmic framework takes a good balance between the convergence rate and the additional communication costs. Specifically, the paper incorporates insights from the Jacobi over-relaxation (JOR) iteration method into the framework of the ADMM method, improving the convergence rate by utilizing more information during the iteration process while striving to reduce the side effects it brings, thereby developing a novel parallel computing framework, named ADMM-JOR. Subsequently, convergence of the proposed algorithm is rigorously proven under an analytic framework of contractive-type methods. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive strategy for adjusting the relaxation factor in ADMM-JOR, guided by the principle of objective function value decline, which aims to further improve the convergence performance of ADMM-JOR, with minimal additional computational cost in a fully parallel setting. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed ADMM-JOR significantly reduces computation time while retaining the excellent parallel performance of the original ADMM method and significantly improving its convergence rate.",1366-5545,Not found
Control of dynamic ride-hailing networks with a mixed fleet of autonomous vehicles and for-hire human drivers,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103680,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This study examines a ride-hailing platform that employs a mixed fleet of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human drivers to offer on-demand ride-hailing services across a network over a finite planning horizon. In the mixed fleet, AVs have a fixed fleet size and are centrally managed by the platform, while human drivers can dynamically enter and exit from the ride-hailing market based on the prospective earning opportunities at various time periods. We introduce a game-theoretic model that encapsulates the strategic behavior of human drivers, passengers, and the ride-hailing platform. In this model, passengers choose between ride-hailing and alternative transportation options by considering fares and waiting times. Human drivers schedule their working hours in response to potential earnings and strategically relocate to maximize passenger pickups, while the platform adjusts pricing and AV repositioning strategies to maximize its profit. The solution is characterized as a Nash equilibrium within a two-player game, with one player representing the ride-hailing platform, and the other as a virtual representative of the collective human drivers. To address the non-convex nature of the game, we employ a convex relaxation technique to ascertain a near-optimal solution framed as an ϵ -Nash equilibrium, with ϵ accurately characterized. The proposed model and solution algorithm are validated in a case study for Manhattan, New York City. The simulation results underscore that the distribution of human drivers is closely aligned with the immediate, minute-to-minute fluctuations in passenger demand, enabling them to effectively meet the surge during peak demand windows. Conversely, the deployment patterns of AVs are more attuned to the extended, daily cycles of passenger movements throughout different city zones, from daytime to nighttime. We further compare the mixed fleet model with scenarios where the platform exclusively utilizes human drivers or AVs, respectively. The comparison show that the mixed fleet model excels in balancing the supply and demand over space and time, thereby leading to shorter wait times and reduced travel cost for ride-hailing passengers, as well as improved profit for the ride-hailing platform.",1366-5545,Not found

Planning electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL)-based package delivery with community noise impact considerations,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103661,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The rapid development of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) in recent years suggests a promise to use electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs) for package delivery in metro areas. While eVTOL manufacturers and logistics service providers are actively developing prototype eVTOLs and exploring their potentials for moving freight, a system thinking about the suitability and ways to operate an eVTOL-based package delivery system remains scarce. A key aspect of the system thinking is the noise impact of eVTOL operations on surrounding communities. In this study, we provide an operation planning framework that aims to prepare AAM to be both economically efficient and community friendly for package delivery. We first develop a method to quantify the community noise impact of an eVTOL operation, using a “population exposure” measure which is based on the level of sound generated and accounts for both the number of people impacted and duration of the impact. Then, a bi-objective integer programming model is formulated which simultaneously optimizes total shipping cost and community noise impact of eVTOL operations. The optimization takes into consideration operational constraints including maximum distance for local delivery, latest package departure time from the warehouse, and eVTOL fleet size and carrying capacity. A tailored solution algorithm which augments non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA2) with compact solution representation, guided generation of initial population of solutions, and customized local search heuristics is devised. The model and the algorithm are implemented in a case study in the Chicago metro area. Numerical results reveal the trade-off between the minimization of shipping cost and community noise impact. Several operational insights about eVTOL-based package delivery are obtained. The computational efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm are also demonstrated in comparison with alternative solution methods.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal pricing for on-demand service platforms with heterogeneous customer demand frequencies,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103676,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"On-demand service platforms (ODSPs), which act as mediators between customers and independent service providers, commonly adopt pay-per-service and membership pricing schemes. The pay-per-service scheme charges customers a fee for each service completion. In contrast, the membership scheme charges customers a periodic fee and allows them to make unlimited service requests for a certain period without any extra payment. In this paper, we develop a model framework to explore the optimal pricing strategy for an ODSP with heterogeneous customer demand frequencies, which turns out to be critically affected by the discrepancy between the patience of the ODSP and users (customers and service providers) regarding cash flow. Specifically, the ODSP is expected to adopt the membership scheme only when users are more patient than the ODSP, and the more patient users are, the more the ODSP prefers the membership scheme. In the extreme case when users are patient enough, the ODSP should forego the pay-per-service scheme altogether. Moreover, we investigate a more flexible pricing scheme, the two-part tariff scheme, that combines the per-service and membership fees. Interestingly, this scheme cannot generate more profit for the ODSP than the pay-per-service or the membership schemes, so it is not a wise strategy for the ODSP. Finally, the impacts of cross- and within-group network effects on the ODSP’s decisions are identified. Our analysis reveals that when the cross-group (resp., within-group) network effect is strengthened, the ODSP should raise (resp., reduce) the service fees and wage paid to providers.",1366-5545,Not found

In this aspect, the zero-emission transportation modes development (ZETMD) has received growing interest from policymakers and researchers across the globe. However, developing zero-emission transportation modes is a complex task, as numerous challenges exist in real-life scenarios that must be addressed. Additionally, the identification and modeling of challenges related to ZETMD considering large-scale uncertainty are absent in the literature. Therefore, this study uniquely contributes to the existing literature by identifying and analyzing the critical challenges of ZETMD by offering an integrated and novel decision support method that combines Interval Type-2 Trapezoidal Fuzzy Set (IT2TrFS) Pareto and a generalized IT2TrFS weighted averaging (GIT2TrFSWA) operator-based IT2TrFS-Best-Worst Method (BWM) with lower defuzzification (LD).

Modeling the evacuation behavior of subway pedestrians with the consideration of luggage abandonment under emergency scenarios,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103672,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"As subway systems play a central role in connecting various modes of transport, such as trains and airplanes, passengers with luggage cases have become common sight in subway stations. During emergency situations such as fires or earthquakes, passengers carrying luggage are likely to abandon their luggage to escape. However, the impact of abandoned luggage on evacuation remains unclear. Current research does not analyze the forces on pedestrians carrying luggage on a physical level and lacks knowledge of the interaction mechanism between luggage and pedestrians. Therefore, this paper constructs a comprehensive model based on an improved social force model that considers pedestrians carrying luggage cases, ordinary pedestrians, and abandoned luggage cases. It simulates a complete situation where pedestrians carry to discard luggage during an emergency. Through the simulation of Qingdao Station, we explore the impact of discarded luggage cases on pedestrian evacuation in subway bottlenecks and the interaction mechanism between luggage cases and pedestrians. The results show that strategies that involve the removal of luggage in areas of bottlenecks such as stairs, escalator entrances, and gateways have a significantly negative impact on the efficiency of evacuation. The key factors affecting evacuation efficiency are the appearance and dissipation of blockages due to accumulated luggage. The luggage carrying rate and abandonment rate are primary determinants for the occurrence of blockages. When blockages cannot be resolved, discarding luggage cases helps in evacuation. The removal of luggage cases increases the individual speed but decreases the overall evacuation speed. Compared to scenarios without luggage abandonment, the arching effect formed in those with discarded luggage cases is more complex and unstable.",1366-5545,Not found

Our findings demonstrate that under a laissez-faire policy, platforms impose higher prices for green ride services and lower prices for basic ride services, whereas an active intervention policy leads to higher prices for basic ride services upon exceeding a policy standard threshold. Furthermore, in the absence of policy intervention, platforms lack the incentive to facilitate the transition from fuel vehicles (FVs) to electric vehicles (EVs) when the proportion of EVs on the platform is low.

Coordinating inland river ports through optimal subsidies from the container shipping carrier,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103671,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The inland waterway system plays a critical role in the domestic transport and logistics systems of many countries and also feeds and receives cargo flows to and from the international freight system. Nevertheless, the inland waterway transportation system involves several transportation modes and many stakeholders including shippers, land transport operators, river ports, and the shipping carriers, resulting in excessive competition and inefficient cooperation. This paper considers an inland waterway system consisting of shippers along a linear freight corridor in the hinterland, two competing river ports, and a waterway shipping company. Different from existing studies focusing on the subsidy scheme design for ports or governments, this study faces the reality of the central and dominant role of a shipping company in an inland waterway system, and designs two subsidy schemes for the shipping company to coordinate the whole transport system: (a) distance-based and (b) fixed-rate subsidies. The optimal subsidies from the shipping carrier to attract the cargoes of shippers to the desired river port are analytically derived, and the benefits of this coordination with subsidies from the shipping company are theoretically revealed through comparison with an uncoordinated decentralized transport system and an ideal centralized transport system.

A multimodal data-driven approach for driving risk assessment,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103678,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Real-time assessment and short-term warning of driving risks are critical for AI-assisted vehicles to significantly improve the safety and reliability of mobility. However, existing methods do not comprehensively consider these factors, making it difficult to achieve more accurate risk assessments. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a new driving risk assessment framework by integrating multimodal data. First, based on naturalistic driving experiments, we collected multimodal data encompassing human-vehicle–road factors. Then, using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, we identified three risk levels based on driving behavior features: normal driving, longitudinal risky driving, and lateral risky driving. To better understand the spatiotemporal importance of multiple factors, a spatiotemporal dual-channel neural network based on a multi-layer attention mechanism (MLA-DCNN) is developed. This model has a spatiotemporal dual-channel structure, which can integrate “low-level” historical sequences and “high-level” extract statistical features of multiple features. In addition, it adopts three layers of attention mechanism, respectively used to capture the differences of features in temporal, spatial, and extracted-level dimensions. Results reveal that the LDA model is more effective than traditional clustering methods in uncovering latent patterns of driving risk. The proposed model achieved an impressive accuracy of 91.04%, demonstrating higher risk assessment capabilities than the other alternative models. In addition, the multilayer attention enhances the interpretability of the model and is able to capture the spatiotemporal importance of different factors across various road environments. This method can be applied to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) using multimodal natural driving data collected by in-vehicle sensors. It enhances the risk warning capabilities of driving assistance systems, and the multidimensional importance analysis also supports decision-making for traffic management authorities.",1366-5545,Not found
Sentiment as a shipping market predictor: Testing market-specific language models,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103651,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This paper applies language models to the shipping market for the first time and studies the impact of changes in shipping market sentiment on freight rates. First, based on language models and Clarksons’ commentary reports, this paper proposes the sentiment indices for the entire shipping market and the sub-markets for bulk ships, tankers, and container ships. Second, empirical results indicate that, apart from the container shipping market sentiment index, all other shipping sentiment indices including the total shipping market sentiment index, the dry bulk shipping market sentiment index and the tanker shipping market sentiment index serve as positive predictive indicators for shipping freight rate indices. Third, this paper investigates the interaction between the shipping sentiment index and market prices through a vector autoregressive model and the Granger causality test. We find that the total shipping market sentiment index is the Granger cause of the Baltic Dry Index and the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index. The dry bulk shipping market sentiment index and the container shipping market sentiment index are the Granger causes of the Baltic Dry Index and the China Containerized Freight Index, respectively. Last, this paper compares the shipping sentiment index constructed by market-specific language models and lexicon-based sentiment analysis. It is evident that language models significantly outperform the lexicon-based approaches for sentiment analysis and are expected to be useful for analyzing textual sentiment in the field of asset pricing research.",1366-5545,Not found
Resilience assessment of intercity transport in a two-city system,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103654,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"For resilience analysis, studies in the transport field have focused on the short term, while attention in the spatial and economic field has been paid to the long term. No resilience assessment framework has thus far combined the two fields and investigated the differences between short-term and long-term resilience to support tactical and strategical transport policies. To fill this gap, this study proposes a resilience assessment framework for a multimodal congested intercity transport system between two linear monocentric cities. Based on an extended spatial equilibrium model, the integrated assessment framework considers households’ long-term spatial and economic competitions, short-term travel mode choice behaviors, and their different effects on resilience. Analysis results reveal that (i) long-term capacity constraints and reductions of intercity transport limit intercity mobility, which leads to a decrease in travel costs, incomes, and land rents but has little effect on the overall utility; (ii) intercity railway has better resilience over the intercity roadway under the same capacity reductions in the short term but the difference is negligible in the long term; and (iii) from the perspective of utility, the short-term resilience is much weaker than the long-term counterpart under the same disruptions, while from the perspective of incomes, the long-term disruptions cannot be neglected. The resilience assessment outcomes depend on both the length of time frame and the selected indices, emphasizing the need for differentiated local emergency management tactics and comprehensive farsighted transport strategies.",1366-5545,Not found
Entire route eco-driving method for electric bus based on rule-based reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103636,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Electric bus (EB) has gradually become one of the main ways of transportation in cities due to the low energy consumption and low pollutant emissions. As battery endurance is easily affected by various factors such as external temperature, vehicle load, and driving habits, the anxiety for the endurance of EB has become a concern for researchers. To bridge the gap, an eco-driving method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to achieve the entire route energy-saving. Firstly, the significant factors including the dynamic passenger load and air conditioner is considered for the energy consumption model of the EB. Secondly, a rule-based reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized for optimizing the driving speed and strategy, which can accelerate the convergence of the proposed model and improve the average reward of the reward function. Thirdly, by adjusting the reward function of reinforcement learning algorithm, three eco-driving modes of EB, namely efficiency priority mode, energy-efficiency balance mode and energy saving priority mode under various operational states are proposed. Finally, the results indicate that the efficiency priority mode achieves about an 8% increase in traffic efficiency and a reduction of approximately 20% in energy consumption compared to the baseline model. With the energy-efficiency balance mode, the model attains a 34.05% reduction in energy consumption with almost the same traffic efficiency. Under the energy saving priority mode, the proposed model exhibits a minor reduction in traffic efficiency within an acceptable limit but decreases energy consumption by 40.69%, achieving the optimization goals.",1366-5545,Not found
Multi-period quality and pricing decision in production-focused and market-focused supply chains: How to manage a long-term contractual relationship,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103662,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This study investigates the effect of the long-term contract on multi-period decisions regarding product quality and sales price in a production-focused supply chain (PSC) and a market-focused supply chain (MSC). By introducing cumulative quality investment over time as in practice and comparing long-term supply chain performance, we reveal that the relationship between supply chain players is the key factor impacting long-term performance. To enhance the supply chain’s long-term profit performance, we find the contract condition should be more advantageous to the supplier responsible for product quality than to the buyer deciding on the sales price, regardless of supply chain types and environmental changes. We also reveal that the MSC can outperform the PSC in the long run. However, it should be noted that the contract condition needs to be more advantageous to the supplier in the MSC than in the PSC. We provide new and significant guidelines for practicing managers by revealing that long-term decisions should differ from single-period decisions.",1366-5545,Not found
Saving energy with eco-friendly routing of an electric vehicle fleet,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103644,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This paper fills the research gap between theoretical vehicle routing algorithms and practical solutions in the field. We use commercially developed prediction algorithms for the energy consumption of vehicles and solve for the energy-efficient routing and charging strategies of an electric vehicle fleet to visit a given set of destinations using meta-heuristics. Then we validate the energy saving performance of the efficient routing solutions with real-world vehicle measurements in a real traffic network. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis via simulation to explore some critical factors in reducing energy consumption. Current literature on vehicle routing problems is limited because they do not validate the energy consumption or the travel time of the solution in the field. This opens questions regarding the routing performance, which faces significant uncertainty from a real traffic network. Also, the travel costs in the network, such as energy consumption and travel time, have been predicted with simple or physics-based models in the theoretical studies, which are limited in capturing the complexity of a real traffic network. Our contributions are as follows. First, we develop a comprehensive framework for routing and charging an electric fleet, integrated with a high-precision prediction algorithm of energy and travel time based on learning a large driving data set. Second, we validate our routing performance in the San Francisco East Bay area with an energy consumption reduction of up to 31% compared to a baseline. Third, we conduct a sensitivity analysis via simulation on some critical constraints of vehicle routing. We observe that relaxing the limitation on operation duration and battery size on the vehicle fleet can expand the solution’s feasible space and reduce the optimal energy consumption; however, the benefits diminish as constraints are relaxed to a certain point.",1366-5545,Not found
Resolving the information reliability issue in live streaming through blockchain adoption,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103652,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"With live streaming becoming an integral part of a seller’s business strategy, a retailer can choose an influencer from a multi-channel network (MCN) to attract consumers. However, since the MCN may benefit from exaggerating the influencer’s historical live sales data, information asymmetry between the retailer and the MCN exists. This may lead the retailer to misestimate the influencer’s demand-enhancing capability (DEC), and then suffer loss. As the usage of blockchain in providing trust becomes more common, an MCN can apply blockchain technology to signal its data reliably to a retailer. However, conditions for MCN to adopt blockchain and its impact on retailer’s influencers choice has not been investigated so far. To fill this gap, we built a signaling model in which an MCN knows the actual information reliability whereas the retailer does not. We find that the retailer opens a live-streaming channel only if the operating cost is low but the retailer will use its own staff in the live streaming rather than an influencer from MCN if the commission is high. This makes the MCN to refrain from adopting blockchain technology. Meanwhile, the blockchain adoption decisions of the MCN and its impact on the retailer’s influencers choice not only depend on the adoption cost but also the commission. Specifically, when the adoption cost is low, a high-reliability MCN benefits more from adopting blockchain technology, which incentivizes the retailer to choose a high-DEC influencer; as the adoption cost increases, retailers become unable to judge the MCN’s information reliability, especially when the commission level is too low or too high; when the adoption cost increases to a moderate range, multiple equilibria co-exist, indicating that an MCN’s willingness to adopt blockchain technology depends on the retailer’s belief. We find that all equilibria survive the intuitive criterion, but, from both types of MCN’s perspectives, the equilibrium without blockchain adoption is always Pareto-dominant. When the adoption cost is high, an MCN has no incentive to adopt blockchain technology.",1366-5545,Not found
Investigating consumers’ usage intention of contactless logistics services: A learning-based score fusion approach to coping with uncertainty of perception,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103660,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Contactless logistics services, including contactless shopping and delivery, have garnered great attention from the public, and questionnaire survey is an effective way to understand consumers’ intentions of using these services. However, previous studies have not paid much attention to the uncertainty of evaluation scores in such survey. To this end, this study aims to address the following two questions: first, what are the key factors contributing to the consumers’ usage intention; and second, how to cope with the uncertainty. Therefore, this study proposes a score fusion approach which can measure the uncertainty more precisely and better reflect consumers’ ground-truth attitude. The approach innovatively encapsulates the following three methods: 1. A multivariate fuzzification method to quantify the uncertainty of the elements in a reference set based on probability membership function; 2. A fusion method that fuses the information represented by continuous random variables in the context of Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory; and 3. an evaluation criterion powered by machine learning (ML), which is employed to assess fuzzification and determine the parameters of the probability membership functions. In a case study, the approach is applied on a survey dataset of consumers’ intentions on using contactless logistics services in the COVID-19 pandemic. The results manifest that the uncertainty of the elements in a reference set with 9-point Likert scale may not be the same with each other. The approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on measuring uncertainty and reflecting consumers’ ground-truth attitude, providing a solid basis for better identifying the key factors. Several interesting findings regarding the key factors are interpreted, offering valuable insights to suppliers of contactless logistics services.

An incentive strategy for the retention of impatient passengers in ride-sourcing markets,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103645,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"A prominent problem plagued the ride-sourcing service providers is the instantaneous real-time demand–supply imbalance. This entails a terrible user experience and causes adverse sustainable results such as customer churn for the platform, which will damage both drivers’ income and the platform revenue. To reduce passenger cancellation caused by extended wait times, we propose an incentive-based queue management strategy —a discount method— to enhance the waiting experience and encourage passengers to stay in a post-peak period . We formulate the waiting process for a ride-sourcing service as an M/M/c+M queue system with impatient passengers, and model passengers’ reneging behaviors by characterizing the impact of discounted trip fare and updated queue information on their travel utilities. Based on such a behavior model, we can analyze the effect of the discount strategy on the queueing process, which allows us to maximize the platform’s profit growth by tailoring the discount strategy. Our result shows that the discount strategy can effectively increase the platform’s profit. Under the specific condition of the discount strategy, the earlier the strategy is implemented in the post-peak period, the higher platform profit can be achieved. Moreover, we explore the impact of queueing system parameters on the performance of the discount strategy and gain some interesting insights.",1366-5545,Not found
"Optimal reserve policies for emergency medical supplies: Joint consideration of reserving safety stocks, production capacity, and capital",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103653,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The tragic consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic highlight to governments the importance of keeping sufficient medical supplies. Given that the physical stocks are subject to considerable obsolescence risk, existing studies have considered combining holding safety stocks with keeping production capacity or capital reserve. Pioneering the exploration of keeping all three resources of safety stocks, production capacity, and capital in reserve, we derive closed-form optimal reserve policies under different scenarios. One crucial insight is that the optimal reserve policies should be determined by considering both the cost and utilization efficiency, e.g., solely adopting safety stocks is optimal when the utilization efficiency of safety stocks exceeds that of production capacity and capital reserves, and when the expected benefit of utilizing safety stocks outweighs the cost. Additionally, we find that the optimal safety stocks level is impacted by the combination of demand uncertainty and epidemic outbreak probability, i.e., the optimal safety stocks level decreases (resp., increases) with demand uncertainty in case with a sufficiently low (resp., high) epidemic outbreak probability, whereas the optimal levels of production capacity and capital always increase with demand uncertainty. We show that coordinating the three resources brings extra benefits compared with keeping fewer resources. By exploring the practical scenario where the government faces multiple potential epidemics, we find that below a threshold, a lower outbreak probability of a large-scale epidemic leads to more capital and production capacity reserves.",1366-5545,Not found
Behavior-Adaptive Sync-Flow Framework: Integrating frequency setting and passenger routing in oversaturated urban rail transit networks,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103659,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Urban rail transit (URT) networks serve a large amount of travel demand in metropolitan areas. One of the fundamental challenges in URT demand management is the dynamic interaction between train frequencies and passenger routing behaviors, which becomes even more complicated in oversaturated scenarios. Introducing the behavior-adaptive sync-flow (BASF) framework, this study holistically addresses the tactical frequency settings (train flows) for URT networks and the responsive route choice behaviors of passengers (passenger flows). The proposed integrated model incorporates a schedule-based passenger assignment within space–time networks to model passengers’ routing behaviors based on time-dependent route travel costs. In addition to travel time, the often-overlooked factors such as in-train congestion, number of passengers being left behind, and number of transfers are considered as components influencing travel costs and, consequently, routing behaviors at an individual level. A gradient descent-based heuristic iterative solution approach is developed to address the integrated model by dividing it into three sub-problems. In this iterative process, passengers respond according to a logit-based route choice model based on time-dependent route travel costs, while frequencies are updated using a gradient descent-based strategy. Central to the proposed BASF framework are the mutual adaptations between URT line frequencies and passenger route choices. Numerical examples and a case study of the Beijing URT network highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the model framework in tackling complex, large-scale URT networks, particularly in oversaturated conditions, thus revealing the significance of supply–demand matching.",1366-5545,Not found
Coordinative dispatching of shared and public transportation under passenger flow outburst,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103655,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"In the passenger flow outburst area (e.g., metro emergency, dispersal of sporting events, and concerts), passengers put forward large demand for ride-sourcing services. Insufficient ride-sourcing supply of the area induces increasing matching time, and the ride-sourcing influx from outside picking up passengers leads to heavier road traffic congestion in the flow outburst area. To solve this problem, we propose a novel coordinative dispatching method of ride-sourcing and multi-modal transit, in which subsidies and buses are provided for passengers in flow outburst areas to encourage taking other public transportation to low passenger flow areas first and then taking ride-sourcing to their destinations. In this paper, there are two options for passengers: (a) wait for ride-sourcing to pick them up; (b) take other public transportation first and then take ride-sourcing. To obtain the optimal dispatching and subsidy schemes, we develop a bi-level mixed integer programming model based on network flow theory and design the corresponding iterative algorithm to solve it. Considering the high uncertainty of ride-sourcing demand in the area, we further develop a robust optimization model to obtain more reliable schemes. Case studies based on a real-problem-scale dataset are conducted. The results demonstrate that our approach can be carried out in real time, and encouraging passengers to take multi-modal transit shows great potential in reducing affected users’ delays. The robust optimization model offers a more reliable and competitive solution when demand varies widely. Our method offers a win–win–win way for passengers, ride-sourcing service providers, and public transportation systems.",1366-5545,Not found
Green premium and the role of financial investors in sustainable investment in container shipping,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103658,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Sustainable investment in tangible shipping assets is important for understanding investor behaviour and promoting sustainable development in the industry and the global economy.

A Generalized Structural Equation Modelling is employed to investigate the relationship among variables, including vessel value, eco-ships, investor categories, age, size, and others.

Our research shows that the information sharing helps induce the SB encroachment in the reselling mode but contributes to deterring it in the agency selling mode. Furthermore, the platform’s information sharing decision is quite different under the two selling modes. Specifically, when the SB’s fixed encroachment cost is high or low, the platform prefers to retain information in the reselling mode; whereas, information sharing is preferred in the agency selling mode unless both the fixed introduction cost and the commission fee are relatively low. Interestingly, when the fixed encroachment cost is intermediate, the SB encroachment may reverse the platform’s information sharing preferences, that is, the platform is inclined to disclose information in the reselling mode but not in the agency selling mode. Furthermore, information sharing may harm both the manufacturer and the platform.",1366-5545,Not found
Roles of AI: Financing selection for regretful SMEs in e-commerce supply chains,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103649,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Businesses are rapidly incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into operations, particularly to manage regret bias. Based on a game with three financing options (bank financing, guarantee financing and direct financing), we investigate how AI influences financing preferences among e-commerce supply chain participants, which involve one capital-constrained and regretful SME, one e-commerce platform, and a bank. Firstly, our findings reveal that the impact of AI is not a clear-cut matter. AI may not consistently boost platform profitability under guarantee financing, platform needs to consider the production scale effect brought by AI against the potential default risk. Similarly, in direct financing, SME must strike a balance between the increase in output resulting from AI development and the potential impact of platform adjusting interest rates. Secondly, from the perspective of financing strategy space, it’s evident that AI can be a positive force in encouraging all supply chain participants to enjoy platform financing services. Specifically, SME prefers direct financing over guarantor financing when the unit regret bias cost and production cost is low but the commission fee is high. Platform is more inclined to provide direct financing if unit production cost is low and unit commission fee is high. Otherwise, bank financing is preferred. As regret bias cost diminish, the strategy space for bank financing contracts. For the whole supply chain, all three types of financing may be options. Guarantee and direct financing gradually become more popular as SME uses AI at higher levels. Moreover, conclusions remain robust when SME is fully credit-constrained or platform is fully financially constrained. These results not only underscore the critical role of AI in regret bias and financial management but also shed light on the innovative possibilities in financing within the e-commerce supply chain.",1366-5545,Not found
The k-th order mean-deviation model for route choice under uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103646,189,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This study introduces the k-th order mean-deviation model for optimizing route choice within large, stochastic, and time-variant networks. This model addresses the limitations of the traditional mean-standard deviation approach by better handling extreme outcomes in travel times. It features an objective function called the “travel time budget”, which combines the average path travel time with a safety margin. This margin is defined by a trade-off coefficient and a selected deviation measure (total or semi) of the travel time. The model is divided into three variations: 1) The mean-total deviation (MTD) model for symmetric travel time distributions, 2) The mean-upper-semi-deviation (MUSD) model for asymmetric distributions prioritizing upper semi-deviations, suitable for risk-averse travelers, and 3) The mean-lower-semi-deviation (MLSD) model for asymmetric distributions focusing on lower semi-deviations, preferred by risk-prone individuals. We explore these models’ alignment with the stochastic dominance (SD) rule and develop a solution methodology based on SD principles.

Moreover, we find that country and firm characteristics associated with less severe uncertainty and information asymmetry concerns weaken the negative impact of logistics performance on IPO underpricing. The association between logistics performance and underpricing is stronger for industries that are more dependent on the logistics infrastructure and during the Global Financial Crisis. Our findings highlight how operational and valuation uncertainty brought on by a country’s logistics infrastructure affects the cost of capital for growth-oriented ventures seeking capital to increase competitiveness.",1366-5545,Not found
A Queue-SEIAR model: Revealing the transmission mechanism of epidemics in a metro line from a meso level,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103716,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected communities worldwide. The metro, an essential means of public transportation in many cities, is particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus due to its limited space and complex passenger flow structure. As the basis of quick and effective management decision-making, it is very important but intractable to accurately and quickly capture the transmission mechanism of epidemics in the metro line. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a meso-level Queue-SEIAR model. The Queue-SEIAR model integrates a feedback queuing network model, which captures the nonlinear stochastic effect of the congestion propagation on passenger mobility dynamics in the metro line, with an extended SEIAR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Asymptomatic, and Recovered) epidemic model in multiple-subgroups situations. The risk of infection within a metro line is measured using the Total Number of Newly Exposed Travelers (TNNET). The Euler’s method is used to solve the Queue-SEIAR model, with time complexity that is independent of passenger volumes and station and train capacities, making it suitable for the analysis and decision-making of large-scale metro lines. The Queue-SEIAR model is validated versus the micro-level agent-based simulation. Numerical experiments reveal some interesting findings: (1) The gap between the Queue-SEIAR model and the benchmark Macro-level Epidemic Model (MEM) in terms of TNNET will become larger with congestion; (2) From the Queue-SEIAR model, low-demand and low-risk stations may become high-risk because of the congestion propagation, while MEM does not reveal such a pattern; (3) There exists a moderate allowed entering proportion, train dwell time, and social distance to minimize the TNNET; (4) The optimal social distance increases as the train headway or travel demand increases; and (5) The epidemic prevention effectiveness of side platforms surpasses that of island platforms.",1366-5545,Not found
Remanufacturing in global supply chains: Self-operating or licensing?,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103708,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Nowadays, globalization and decarbonization have emerged as new normals for supply chains worldwide. In this paper, we investigate remanufacturing strategies within a global supply chain, aiming to provide managerial insights through the research to assist businesses in better integrating into the new normals. Within the global supply chain, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) located in the home country sells its products to a foreign country through a local retailer. To establish a closed-loop supply chain, the OEM faces two strategic choices, i.e., self-operating remanufacturing in its home country (Strategy A) or licensing remanufacturing to a local remanufacturer (LR) in the foreign country (Strategy B). Utilizing game-theoretical models, our study first explores the operational decisions regarding quantities and prices made by the OEM, the retailer, and the LR. The analysis reveals that a higher cost disparity between the new and remanufactured products or lower cross-border recycling costs for used products can potentially stimulate firms’ incentives for recycling and remanufacturing. Second, upon comparing the equilibrium profits under the two strategies, we demonstrate that lower cross-border recycling costs consistently encourage the OEM to opt for self-operating remanufacturing. Interestingly, we find that the impact of the production cost disparity on the OEM’s strategic choice is non-monotonic; that is, either a low or high disparity of cost can incentivize the OEM to choose licensing remanufacturing, whereas a moderate cost disparity leads to self-operating remanufacturing. We also explored the impact of remanufacturing strategies on sustainability. Furthermore, we have examined governmental preferences regarding firms’ adoption of remanufacturing strategies. Our findings indicate that both countries can benefit from the OEM’s self-operating remanufacturing, providing an explanation as to why cross-border recycling and remanufacturing are not entirely prohibited by governments worldwide.",1366-5545,Not found
Flexible yard crane scheduling for mixed railway and road container operations in sea-rail intermodal ports with the sharing storage yard,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103714,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"The sea-rail intermodal port, serving as the “cornerstone” supporting the seamless connection of landside and quayside transportation, plays a crucial role in determining the service level of the container multimodal transport through port’s operational organization efficiency. With on-dock rails, the physical integration between railways and water transport is smoothly achieved. However, within the port, the diversity in container flows adds complexity to operational organization and decision-making. In this paper, we formulate a flexible crane scheduling model to reduce the mutual interference during the mixed operations of railway containers and road containers in the sharing yard. The model addresses the time window constraints of railway containers required by train schedule, and the uncertain scenarios of external truck arrivals. To solve this problem, we design a two-stage approach that encompasses a task reassignment phase and a sequential decision-making phase. Furthermore, we test the model and algorithm performance through various experiments of different scales. Our results show that the designed algorithm designed solves instances of 20 tasks in 18.7 s, compared to 3600 s for the model solver. It efficiently handles real-world instances with over 200 tasks and 100 scenarios. Finally, sensitivity analysis is carried out to capture the influence of railway container ratio, truck arrival patterns, and train time windows on yard operations. Under intensive operation, we find that road containers, following a uniform arrival pattern, are least affected by railway container operations when the proportion of railway containers in the sharing block ranges from 70% to 80%. We also observe that the flexibility of crane service increases as the time window for railway container operations becomes more lenient.",1366-5545,Not found

However, there exists a discrepancy between consumers’ stated preferences and their actual purchasing behaviors. Accordingly, firms may overestimate market demand from environmentally conscious consumers, leading to ‘green optimism’ bias. We develop a stylized model to investigate how a manufacturer’s green optimism influences firms’ green investments and subsequent profits in a supply chain comprising a manufacturer and a retailer, both of whom can invest in greening. We consider two scenarios based on the leadership in the supply chain: retailer-led and manufacturer-led. Conventional wisdom suggests that optimism regarding the environmental demand could motivate firms to increase green investment but may harm profits due to biased decisions. Surprisingly, however, our analysis reveals that within a supply chain context, manufacturer’s green optimism may discourage green investment of the optimistic manufacturer and also the retailer. Moreover, green optimism bias may increase the profit of the optimistic manufacturer and lead to a win–win situation in a supply chain. We characterize the conditions under which such counter-intuitive results occur and explain the underlying mechanisms. In doing so, we also identify two distinct roles played by a retailer, ‘bias-reducing’ and ‘bias-intensifying’, depending on the supply chain leadership.",1366-5545,Not found
Multidimensional container shipping alliance decisions among competitors: Impact of capacity constraints and market competition,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103694,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Over the past decade, intensified competition in the global market has led to unprecedented changes in the structure of shipping alliances. To explicate the underlying motivation and extensive implications of such changes, this study utilizes a multi-player competitive game theory framework and examines two types of shipping lines based on their heterogeneous shipping capacities. The post-alliance entity competes for volume on the same route with the remaining shipping lines based on their respective capacities. We deduce individual alliance preferences and equilibrium alliance structures by examining a range of distinct market conditions. Our analysis shows that active super-alliance is likely to transform into a passive mode if smaller shipping lines increase their capacity, and in such circumstances, they tend to create a mixed-alliance structure by pursuing partnerships with smaller shipping lines. Although shipping alliances are often formed to create benefits for members, competitive market conditions reshape alliance intentions, theoretically reducing the number of direct competitors, but paradoxically intensifying the rivalry among the alliance members. Additionally, the homogeneity in members’ capacity within such alliances can precipitate a transformation from a mutually advantageous “win–win” situation to a contentious “win-lose” situation, and even a misguided “lose-lose” situation. Our findings demonstrate that in contexts where the small shipping line functions with constrained capacity, the mixed-alliance structure is beneficial to increase consumer surplus and social welfare.",1366-5545,Not found

To address this challenge, our study addresses the stochastic and robust truck-and-drone routing problems with deadlines, aiming to minimize service delay risk under uncertainty. We leverage the sample average approximation (SAA) and robust optimization (RO) approaches to handle uncertainty in scenarios involving both big and small datasets. Benders decomposition (BD) algorithms are developed to solve the SAA and RO truck-and-drone routing problems efficiently. Numerical experiments showcase the algorithms’ effectiveness and reveal interesting insights. These findings suggest the importance of tailoring the approach to data availability for optimizing truck-and-drone delivery under uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed model formulations and algorithms are generalized to address truck-and-drone routing problems under more complex scenarios, such as that with uncertainty of service time, or with nonlinear objective functions.",1366-5545,Not found
Reinforcement learning for electric vehicle charging scheduling: A systematic review,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103698,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"As climate change and environmental concerns have become increasingly pressing issues, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a viable and environmentally-friendly alternative to their traditional gasoline-powered counterparts. With the growing popularity of EVs, it is widely recognized that scheduled EV charging is of vital importance in enhancing users’ satisfaction, improving the profitability of charging stations, and ensuring the secure operation of power grids. Therefore, effective charging scheduling is crucial to achieve EV integration into modern mobility and further promote mass EV adoption. However, EV charging scheduling problems (CSPs) present a significant challenge to conventional methods owing to the complex nature of the decision environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained considerable attention for addressing various CSPs with a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation. This paper aims to conduct a systematic review of existing studies that utilize RL to tackle CSPs. Firstly, we present a summary of the state-of-the-art CSPs and RL algorithms, followed by a review of previous research studies and a discussion of the current challenges in this field. Finally, several unresolved issues and possible future research topics are identified based on our review findings.",1366-5545,Not found
To walk or not to walk? Designing intelligent order picking warehouses with collaborative robots,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103696,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Order picking is a physically demanding, time-consuming, and costly process in most warehouses. To make the process more efficient, recently, ride-on autonomous robotic order pick trucks (collaborative robots or cobots) have been introduced, that assist the order picker. The order picker can ride on the cobot to travel large distances, but when picking, the cobot behaves as a robot and moves autonomously to the next stop location. The question is where the order picker should get on the cobot (step-on location) to ride further. Using traditional low-level order pick trucks, the order picker rides to every stop location and steps on the truck every time immediately after depositing the picked item on the pick pallet or roll cage. Although riding the truck may be faster than walking, stepping off/on the truck is time-consuming and also demanding for order pickers as it puts much pressure on the knee joints. The cobots allow reducing both travel time (compared to walking only) and knee flexion (compared to riding only). We determine the benefits of choosing optimal step-on locations by formulating an optimization model to minimize total time, including a penalty on the number of knee flexes of the order picker. Since the problem is computationally intractable for large-sized problems, we propose a dynamic programming approach which finds the shortest path of subproblems in each aisle. We find that the optimal collaboration strategy will decrease total travel time, as well as knee flexion of the order picker. Based on Monte Carlo simulation, our results indicate time savings up to 27.9% for one-block and 26.5% for two-block warehouses compared to a heuristic from practice. Based on the data and working practice we obtained from a retail warehouse, the optimal collaboration strategy can improve current practice between 14.5% and 24.1%.",1366-5545,Not found
On the value of distribution tail in the valuation of travel time variability,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103695,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Extensive empirical studies show that the long distribution tail of users’ travel time in transportation systems and the corresponding unexpected delay can have much more serious consequences than expected or moderate delay. However, the unexpected delay has received limited attention in recent studies of the valuation of travel time variability. As a complement to current valuation research, this paper proposes the concept of the value of travel time distribution tail, which quantifies the value that travelers place on reducing the unexpected delay for hedging against travel time variability. Methodologically, we define the summation of all unexpected delays as the unreliability area to quantify travel time distribution tail and show that it is a key element of two well-defined measures accounting for unreliable aspects of travel time. We then formally derive the value of distribution tail, show that it is distinct from the more established value of reliability (VOR), and combine it and the VOR in an overall value of travel time variability (VOV). We prove theoretically that the VOV exhibits diminishing marginal benefit in terms of the traveler’s punctuality requirements under a mild condition. This implies that it may be economically inefficient for travelers to blindly pursue a higher probability of not being late. We then proceed to develop the concept of the travel time variability ratio, which gives the implicit cost of the punctuality requirement imposed on any given trip. Numerical examples reveal that the cost of travel time distribution tail can account for more than 10 % of the trip cost, such that its omission could introduce non-trivial bias into route choice models and transportation appraisal more generally.",1366-5545,Not found
When should capital-constrained swap service providers partner with battery lessors?,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103692,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Battery swapping provides a quick electric vehicle (EV) replenishment solution to time-sensitive consumers. To meet the growing demand, a significant investment in establishing swap stations is needed, and fund shortage becomes a bottleneck for swap service providers. To cope with this issue, a swap service provider may partner with a battery lessor, and such a new financing strategy deserves a close look. Compared with traditional bank credit as the benchmark strategy, asset leasing through battery lessors is more flexible and less burdensome. This study establishes a game-theoretical model of a three-tier market comprising one battery supplier at the producer level, one battery lessor and one swap service provider at the vendor level, and heterogeneous end-users at the consumer level. The model compares the swap service provider’s profit across bank credit and asset leasing strategies to determine when the battery lessor should be involved. It also examines the impacts of asset leasing on swap station establishment, other stakeholders’ profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Numerical analyses assess the effectiveness of asset leasing strategy together with four types of incentives: swap operation, station establishment, battery procurement, and battery recycling. Concerning the sustainable development of the EV market, the findings yield managerial implications for supply chain members as well as helpful insights for policymakers.",1366-5545,Not found
A model for agribusiness supply chain risk management using fuzzy logic. Case study: Grain route from Ukraine to Poland,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103691,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In order to establish new logistics routes, it is necessary to address several technical and organizational issues, among others. One of the most important criteria for evaluating the performance of a supply chain is the delivery time, proactive consideration of potential hazards and associated uncertainties that may occur along the route. However, the existing solutions are often passive and reactive, based on statistics, thus not leaving much room for proactive risk mitigation measures. Therefore, there is a need for a foreseeing modern approach to account for the impact of anticipated hazards on delivery time. The aim of this study is to develop a model for determining delivery time considering expected risk factors (RF), based on mathematical tools of fuzzy logic and actual background knowledge elicited from the literature and experts. The paper identifies primary technical and operational hazards that occur during loading and transport and converts them into risk factors. The risk factors are then quantified and fed into a fuzzy model developed with the Matlab Fuzzy Logic Toolbox and assembled in the Simulink environment. The application of the model is demonstrated in three case studies reflecting three potential grain supply chains (SC) from Ukraine to Poland: classical transport by rail grain hoppers (SC1); transport by containers on railway platforms (SC2); transport by bulk grain trucks (SC3). The resulting travel time for the analysed SCs is between 49 and 71 h for SC1, between 45 and 62 h for SC2 and between 42 and 62 h for SC3. In addition, the outliers of the travel time values beyond the 1.5 quantiles were defined according to the uncertainty band. The results of the fuzzy model were compared with the results of the deterministic approach in the concurrent validation and a good agreement was found. This proves the appropriateness of the fuzzy model calculations and the possibility of using alternative SCs in grain delivery. The main benefit of the proposed model is a new universal tool based on a holistic and active approach to risk assessment using fuzzy logic.",1366-5545,Not found
Bus fleet decarbonization under macroeconomic and technological uncertainties: A real options approach to support decision-making,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103690,190,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Fleet owners deal with various and critical uncertainties while planning bus fleet replacement, encompassing macroeconomic and technological factors, such as fuel and electricity prices, energy consumption, purchasing costs of electric batteries and powertrains, and bus salvage value upon resale. This paper proposes a Real Option-based framework to evaluate investment choices in different bus technologies over time (diesel, hybrid electric, compressed natural gas, and full-electric), where the proposed options usually involve replacing existing diesel fleets with alternatively powered buses. In particular, we provide a multi-option least squares Monte Carlo simulation to help fleet owners in making cost-effective investment decisions, resulting in potential cost savings of up to 10% of the annual total cost of ownership. By applying the proposed approach to different bus route types (inner-city, urban, suburban, commuter), the results show how the optimal investment choices for fleet replacement change over time. Initially, diesel buses or, at most, compressed natural gas buses are more cost-effective compared to electric technology. However, as electric technology becomes increasingly competitive, internal combustion buses are phased out. Inner-city and urban routes are better suited for the electric transition, whereas the transition may progress more slowly on other route types. Finally, we show that, under technological and macroeconomic uncertainties, the duration of contracts can strongly affect the investment decisions, in absence of specific guarantees on the new fleet.",1366-5545,Not found
A choice-driven service network design and pricing including heterogeneous behaviors,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103740,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The design and pricing of services are two of the most important decisions faced by any intermodal transport operator. The key success factor lies in the ability to meet the needs of the shippers. Therefore, making full use of the available information about the demand helps to come up with good design and pricing decisions. With this in mind, we propose a Choice-Driven approach, incorporating advanced choice models directly into a Service Network Design and Pricing problem. We evaluate this approach considering both deterministic and stochastic choice models. To reduce the computational time for the stochastic instances, we propose a predetermination heuristic. The proposed models are compared to a benchmark, where shippers are solely cost-minimizers. Results show that the operator’s profits can be significantly improved, even with deterministic models. The stochastic versions further increase the realized profits: in particular, considering shippers’ heterogeneity allows a better estimation of the demand.",1366-5545,Not found
Dynamic resilience analysis of the liner shipping network: From structure to cooperative mechanism,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103755,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Liner shipping networks play a vital role in global and regional trade. However, they are susceptible to damage from unexpected interruptions, which can trigger dynamic cascading failures and undermine the system’s resilience. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cascading failure model for liner shipping networks that considers the characteristics of the network structure and port functions. First, we design two load redistribution methods that rely on network topology and employ a cooperative mechanism for coordination. This cooperative mechanism aims to balance the benefits for carriers and shippers by effectively controlling losses. Subsequently, we develop three metrics—network congestion rate, failure rate, and shipper loss—to assess the resilience of the network during cascading failures. To verify the impact of the cooperative mechanism, we apply the proposed methods to the China-Europe liner shipping network. Through simulations involving various port failures and resistance levels, we analyze the effectiveness of the cooperative mechanism. The results demonstrate that redistributing the load to downstream ports within the network effectively mitigates deep cascading failures. Additionally, the implementation of a port cooperative mechanism enhances resilience in the face of uncertainties by safeguarding crucial ports within the network and significantly reducing shipper losses. When port resistance is low, the cooperative mechanism reduces shipper losses by nearly half and lowers the average congestion rate. Although port reserve capacity can resist cascading failures, it falls short in the face of severe disruptions. In such cases, the cooperative mechanism compensates for capacity shortages, enhancing port resilience at a low cost. This study contributes to combating and minimizing cascading congestion in liner shipping networks, offering valuable insights for risk prevention and management strategies for ports and shipping companies. It also has implications for yield management and policy decisions from a network perspective.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimal advertising structure in the presence of a platform owner's entry,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103745,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"As consumer demand for mobile electronic items (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, or wearables) rises, advertising competition among electronics manufacturers becomes more intense. Moreover, platform owners that offer platforms for electronics manufacturers may use private labels to enter the manufacturers’ market, which further prompts the manufacturers to advertise in response to platform entry. We study how a platform owner’s entry affects advertising and price competition for a strong manufacturer and a weak manufacturer who are differentiated in production costs and advertising efficiency, and reveal the impacts of platform entry and two typical revenue models on the optimal advertising structures of supply chain members in the platform-based market. In the absence of entry, we discover that a relatively larger production cost advantage induces only the strong manufacturer to advertise while a relatively higher advertising efficiency advantage induces only the weak manufacturer to advertise in the wholesale model. In the bundling model, we show that the platform is always beneficial from the advertising of the manufacturer who can generate higher marginal revenue. With entry, our analysis reveals how the production cost of the platform and the differences in advertising efficiency between the manufacturers affect the optimal advertising structure. In particular, we find that as the production cost increases, the platform first prefers only the weak manufacturer to advertise and then both manufacturers to advertise. In practice, our findings have significant managerial implications for platform owners and electronics manufacturers engaged in advertising competition.",1366-5545,Not found
An efficient parking-sharing program through owner cooperation with robust slot assignment and incentive revenue distribution,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103697,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This article introduces an intra-owner-cooperation mechanism for parking-sharing programs, which assigns private parking slot owners to use other owners’ parking slots within a community and compensates them in the meanwhile. This mechanism extends the availability of some shared slots for external drivers. To ensure practicality, this study addresses two crucial issues: (i) robust assignment of parking slots to mitigate parking conflicts caused by user unpunctuality and (ii) revenue allocation encouraging owner participation through truthful report of inconvenience costs coefficient for using others’ slots. To address the first issue, we propose a distributionally robust approach that leverages a data-driven method to estimate potential conflicts in parking schedules. For the second issue, we introduce an equitable owner-Pareto-optimal core-selecting payment rule under a cooperative game setting, which prevents collusion among owners and encourages owners to truthfully report the inconvenience cost coefficients for satisfying compensation. An efficient algorithm with core constraint generation is further developed to calculate the payments within a reasonable computational time. Several practical extensions are also presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed mechanism significantly outperforms the existing matching approach without owner cooperation in terms of parking slot utilization, fulfillment ratio of demand, and platform income. This paper demonstrates the performance of intra-owner-cooperation mechanism, which ultimately enhances the overall system welfare jointly enjoyed by slot owners, drivers, and the platform.",1366-5545,Not found
Assessment of equilibrium accessibility for import/export containers in hub-and-spoke transport network: Impact of international land-sea trade corridor,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103747,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"In Asia, the international land-sea trade corridor (ILSTC) is undergoing significant expansion, notably through the China Railway Express (CR-Express) and the export tax rebate at the departure port with Port of Yangpu as gateway. This expansion plays a pivotal role in shaping the accessibility for import/export containers in the hub-and-spoke transport network (A-IEC-HSTN). This paper delves into analyzing the ILSTC’s impacts and introduces an approach assessing the equilibrium accessibility for import/export containers in the hub-and-spoke transport network (EA-IEC-HSTN), tailored to consider the impact of emerging policies like ILSTC. To examine how ILSTC affects transport accessibility and shapes stakeholder behaviors, a tri-level model is developed which synergistically combines the port investment decision model, liner shipping schedule design model, and multinomial logit model (MNL), all enriched by the incorporation of a gravity model. This tri-level model is combined with a classic transport accessibility framework to quantify EA-IEC-HSTN in the context of ILSTC when no stakeholders can gain more profit through changing their activities. This study offers a comprehensive examination of the EA-IEC-HSTN, the strategic investment of the Port of Yangpu, the liner shipping schedule and the associated incremental export freight demand.

Joint optimization of order picking and delivery in ergonomic picking systems with due dates for sustainability and resilience,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103727,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"E-commerce platforms, driven by consumer demand for same-day or even half-day delivery, face challenges such as high order volumes with varying due dates, multiple picking stations, and multiple delivery regions. These challenges may lead to order tardiness and decreased efficiency and responsiveness of warehouse logistics. This study jointly optimizes order picking and delivery in ergonomic picking systems by addressing order assignment, sequencing, picking, and delivery operations while considering due dates and minimizing order tardiness and delivery costs. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated, and an improved knowledge-guided fruit fly optimization algorithm with the shortest waiting time rule (IKGFOA-SWT) as a heuristic solution procedure is developed to solve the problem. The IKGFOA-SWT comprises three modules including an order assignment and sequencing module using IKGFOA, an order picking module employing the SWT rule, and a batch delivery module balancing the delivery and tardiness costs. Computational experiments are conducted to validate the MIP model and evaluate the performance of IKGFOA-SWT. The benchmark experiment underscores the importance of integrating order picking and delivery operations within a unified scheduling framework rather than treating them as independent optimization tasks. The small-scale experiment verifies the effectiveness of IKGFOA-SWT in finding optimal solutions. The large-scale experiment demonstrates the superiority of IKGFOA-SWT in generating high-quality solutions. This study provides valuable managerial insights and practical tools for the optimization of warehouse logistics operations, and contributes to the new norms of supply chain sustainability and resilience.",1366-5545,Not found

The latter can be measured by the port congestion situation so the mitigation of congestion helps improve customers’ experience. We observe that smart ports are widely built and many local governments are promoting port integration to ease competition and reduce congestion. One immediate question is: Are the two strategies really effective that further enable the improvement of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) performance? In this study, by taking the do-nothing strategy as the benchmark, we examine how smart port and port integration strategies work in port congestion reduction and ESG improvement. We reveal that the smart port strategy brings the Matthew effect that the large port obtains a larger market share and the smaller port worries about the win-lose situation. We also reveal that smart port can make each port and the entire port system more congested, resulting in the investment dilemma. Differently, the port integration strategy can effectively reduce congestion but hurt social welfare. We further discuss a mixed strategy where both strategies are implemented. Interestingly, under the mixed strategy, the risk of falling into the investment dilemma can be reduced and social welfare can be increased. We compare the ESG performances under three strategies and highlight that the mixed strategy achieves the highest system profit, the smart port strategy yields the highest social welfare, and the port integration strategy may outperform the other strategies in terms of environmental sustainability.",1366-5545,Not found

The integration of strategic network design and operational routing decisions has been widely studied in the literature as the location-routing problem (LRP). However, the LRP does not consider the differences in the planning horizon of each sub-problem, nor have geospatial elements been included in the distribution of demand. This paper aims to redesign the conceptual modelling of the last mile to inform strategic network design problems. A continuous multi-scale approach (CMA) is proposed by taking elements from the districting problem (DP) and continuous approximation (CA). This approach includes stochastic demand in the analysis and the effects of time windows and failed deliveries. The validation of CMA in a case of rural parcel deliveries in Belgium shows an estimate of the distance travelled similar to traditional routing algorithms in scenarios with high demand density. Likewise, the effects of time windows on the spatial configuration of multi-scale districting are explored. This approach provides insights for decision-making in strategic and tactical planning, such as sonification, differentiated services to satisfy consumer preferences, and fleet management.

Corridor-based logistics systems facilitate the exchange of freight between two distinct regions, usually involving industrial and logistics clusters. In this context, we introduce the dynamic stochastic temporal bin packing problem. It models the assignment of individual containers to carriers’ trucks over discrete time units in real-time. We formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP). Two distinguishing characteristics of our problem are the stochastic nature of the time-dependent availability of containers, i.e., container delays, and the continuous-time, or dynamic, aspect of the planning, where a container announcement may occur at any time moment during the planning horizon. We introduce an innovative real-time planning algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method, to allocate individual containers to eligible carriers in real-time. In addition, we propose some practical heuristics and two novel rolling-horizon batch-planning methods based on (stochastic) mixed-integer programming (MIP), which can be interpreted as computational information relaxation bounds because they delay decision making.

An operator gradually expands its route system to avoid risks from inconsistency between designed routes and actual travel demand. At the same time, observed information is archived to update the knowledge that the operator currently uses. Three learning policies are compared within the algorithm: multi-armed bandit, knowledge gradient, and knowledge gradient with correlated beliefs. For validation, a new route system is designed on an artificial network based on public use microdata areas in New York City. Prior knowledge is reproduced from the regional household travel survey data.

An integrated non-convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) approach was proposed to enhance airline connectivity, considering different combinations of traffic flow direction and connecting times. To verify the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed model, a comprehensive case study has been undertaken with real-world scheduling data from Air China, which was solved by a novel problem-specific Selective Simulated Annealing (SSA) algorithm.

We find that the NEV manufacturer typically adopts a skimming pricing scheme in DR strategy, while a penetration pricing scheme in SR strategy. The choice between SR and DR strategy hinges on the government’s calculation criteria for NEV credits, product upgrade speed, and vehicle environmental performance improvement. When the calculation criterion for NEV credits is moderate, or when it is low, coupled with fast product upgrade speed and marginal improved environmental performance of the new vehicle, SR strategy is beneficial to the NEV manufacturer to avoid the cannibalization between new and old vehicles. In contrast, the NEV manufacturer can benefit from DR strategy through price discrimination between new and old vehicles to attract consumers from different market segments. However, stricter calculation criteria for NEV credits do not always result in higher social welfare.",1366-5545,Not found
Communication is computation: A privacy-protecting routing protocol for Physical Internet,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103710,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Logistics research has been emphasising the importance of interconnectivity for better resource utilisation and real-time response against disruptions. However, lack of trust has become a significant obstacle in the business world, blocking the way to building an open information system and, thus, more effective route-finding protocols. This paper proposes a decentralised routing protocol for multimodal transportation in a new logistic paradigm named Physical Internet (PI), performing under a privacy-protecting information-sharing policy. We seek the possibility of building a system to connect entities in a trustless environment that strictly limits data usage to the embedded services at a structural level. In the proposed protocol, the only service is to find the shortest path while minimising unnecessary data-sharing, with the potential to plug in more services. If no party initiates the routing, the entities remain in the equivalent state of disconnected. This routing protocol avoids sharing over 90% of the information in a simple scenario. In addition, a numerical experiment is performed to justify the quality of routes planned by the protocol.",1366-5545,Not found
"Equilibrium anti-counterfeiting strategies with deceptive counterfeits: Proactive, reactive, or instantaneous?",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103721,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This papers studies anti-counterfeiting strategies with deceptive counterfeits. We develop a model to study the interactive anti-counterfeiting and counterfeit hiding decisions between the genuine brand company and a deceptive counterfeiter. Facing deceptive counterfeits, the genuine brand company can choose to adopt a proactive, instantaneous, or reactive anti-counterfeit strategy. We first examine these strategies and then characterize the equilibrium outcomes. Surprisingly, we reveal that the genuine brand company does not necessarily benefit from heavier penalty and the counterfeiter is not necessarily worse off with more costly counterfeit hiding efforts. Interestingly, the counterfeiter’s hiding effort decreases with heavier penalty when the genuine brand company’s anti-counterfeit and the counterfeiter’s hiding decisions are sufficiently efficient. Besides, higher levels of counterfeit imitation or penetration can either hurt or benefit the genuine brand company. Whether the counterfeiter is better off with deeper counterfeit penetration depends on the status quo. Furthermore, the counterfeiter exerts fewer counterfeit hiding efforts when the genuine brand company exerts more anti-counterfeit efforts, while the anti-counterfeit effort increases with the counterfeit hiding effort, regardless of the anti-counterfeiting strategies. Finally, for decision makers and policy makers, we discuss the implications for anti-counterfeiting strategies in practice.",1366-5545,Not found
Competing buyers’ investment and ordering strategies under supply disruption,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103723,191,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Supply chain disruptions can be costly and disruptive, and reducing supplier uncertainty through investments can be an effective strategy for mitigating these risks. In this study, we explore ordering and investment strategies in a downstream competitive environment, considering supply uncertainty. We consider two buyers ordering from a single supplier and competing in a Cournot market. Buyers must balance investment benefits against costs when making investment decisions. We find that without downstream competition, a relatively low investment proportion can yield a “win-win” outcome. Under downstream competition, an increased number of investors does not necessarily lead to higher supplier reliability. When both buyers invest at a high ratio, the significant decline in order quantities may results in lower supplier reliability. When there is only one investing buyer in the market, even though the competitor may benefit from spillover reliability enhancement — free-riding, the buyer may also be willing to provide an investment subsidy to improve the supplier’s reliability. When both buyers invest at a moderate ratio, downstream competition may benefit all supply chain members. Moreover, increasing wholesale price differentiation and endogenous investment ratios can effectively reduce free-riding behavior of the non-investing buyer. These findings have practical implications for supply chain managers aiming to reduce supply risks and allocate investment resources efficiently.",1366-5545,Not found

Two-stage optimal acquisition and remanufacturing decisions with demand and quality information updating,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103823,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Remanufacturing activities in reverse logistics hold significant theoretical and practical value for their obvious economic and environmental benefits. However, the ever-changing market demand and the uncertain quality of returned items make the management of remanufacturing production highly challenging. Previous studies have mainly focused on determining the optimal remanufacturing decisions based on static market demand and full knowledge of cores quality, while overlooking the dynamic changes in demand information and the imperfect estimation of quality distribution case. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage acquisition and remanufacturing method with demand and quality information updating. In the first stage, the remanufacturer formulates acquisition and remanufacturing decisions based on predicted demand and estimated quality distribution. According to updated market demand and the results of the first-stage, the remanufacturer adjusts the optimal decisions for the second stage to maximize profit. In light of this, a two-stage nonlinear mathematical model is established for the acquisition and remanufacturing problem. Based on the scenario analysis method and multivariate optimization theory, optimal strategies for each stage are obtained. To assess the effectiveness of the method put forward, numerical experiments, sensitivity analysis of parameters, and comparative analysis with single-stage acquisition and remanufacturing method are conducted. The results show that the two-stage acquisition and remanufacturing method that accounts for demand and quality information updating can demonstrate greater adaptability to external changes. Compared to the single-stage method, the remanufacturer adopting the two-stage method can achieve an expected profit growth of 6 %∼11 %. Additionally, the effectiveness of the two-stage method is significantly influenced by the reorder point, and there exists an optimal reorder point to maximize the total profit of the remanufacturer. Our research contributes to the uncertainty research in reverse logistics, providing new insights for operational decision-making in remanufacturing enterprises.",1366-5545,Not found
Selling format selection in the presence of rebate provision,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103791,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper investigates the sellers’ optimal rebate provision strategies in a supply chain setting wherein two competing sellers offer substitutable products via a common platform, and can choose whether to provide rebates to boost their respective sales. We consider two selling formats: wholesale format and agency format (with exogenous commission rate) to capture the interaction between the sellers and platform. We show that the sellers always choose to provide rebates under wholesale format, while only doing so under agency format when the commission rate is low. With either selling format, the sellers target both rebate-sensitive and rebate-insensitive consumers when the ratio of sensitive consumers is low enough, otherwise targeting only rebate-sensitive consumers as a means to explore the benefits derived from the offer of a rebate. With certain conditions, intensified competition will hurt the platform under wholesale format while benefit it under agency format, a result differs from when there are no rebates provided. The preferences of the sellers and the platform over two selling formats are jointly determined by the commission rate and the composition of consumers. When the ratio of rebate-sensitive consumers increases, sellers’ preference for the agency format first decreases and then increases. When this ratio is sufficiently high, charging a high commission rate will reduce the platform’s profit under agency format, making the wholesale format more preferable. We also consider an alternative scenario wherein the commission rate is endogenous and show that the results remain qualitatively intact.",1366-5545,Not found

The translation heuristic first constructs a rough solution and then improves the solution by solving a linear program. Numerical tests are conducted on simulated instances.

Integrated optimal planning of multi-type lanes and intersections in a transportation network with mixed HVs and CAVs,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103814,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"In a prolonged transitional period, the urban transportation infrastructure is expected to accommodate two different types of vehicles. One type of vehicle is the human-driven vehicle (HV) and the other is the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV). Nevertheless, the conflict between HVs and CAVs in the mixed traffic scenario significantly impedes the efficiency-improvement benefit of implementing emerging CAV technologies. To harness the full potential of CAVs in enhancing traffic efficiency and network performance, multi-type lanes (i.e., regular lanes, dedicated CAV lanes, and CAV/toll lanes) and multi-type intersections (i.e., conventional signalized intersections, novel signalized intersections with an exclusive phase and exclusive approaches, and smart signal-free intersections) are proposed to efficiently manage the heterogeneous traffic flow on roads and at intersections, respectively. From the perspective of traffic planners, in this research, the integrated planning problem of multi-type lanes and intersections (IPPLI for short) in the mixed transportation network is suggested and tackled, where the route selection behavior and the cross-group externalities of heterogeneous travelers are considered according to the user equilibrium principle. It aims to minimize the overall travel cost by making decisions on the spatial layout of multi-type lanes and intersections in the network, the toll level of CAV/toll lanes, the number of exclusive approaches at novel signalized intersections, time intervals of the cycle and green signal for each phase at both conventional and novel signalized intersections. Then, the IPPLI is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model based on the link-node modeling method without time-consuming path enumeration and memory-consuming path storage. As a mathematical problem with complementarity constraints, it is solved by an improved evolutionary algorithm-based approach, which consists of two modules cooperating with each other. After introducing the concept of the accessibility of HVs, a heuristic technique is proposed to accelerate algorithm convergence by continuously repairing unreasonable solutions. Finally, experiments are performed on two distinct networks to showcase the properties of the problem and assess the effectiveness of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model consistently performs outstandingly across a range of CAV penetration rates. Our model achieves maximum improvements of 25.71% and 4.84% in reducing travel costs compared to models that only plan multi-type lanes and multi-type intersections, respectively. Additionally, the improved evolutionary algorithm-based approach reduces the convergence time by 20.51% and 26.81% compared to the classical evolutionary algorithm and the genetic algorithm provided by MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox.",1366-5545,Not found

Physics-informed neural network for cross-dynamics vehicle trajectory stitching,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103799,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"High-accuracy long-coverage vehicle trajectory data can benefit the investigations of various traffic phenomena. However, existing datasets frequently contain broken trajectories due to sensing limitations, which impedes a thorough understanding of traffic. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-based method for stitching broken trajectories. The proposed PINN-based method enhances traditional neural networks by integrating physics priors, including vehicle kinematics and boundary conditions, aiming to provide information beyond training domain and regularization, thus increasing method accuracy and extrapolation ability for cross-dynamics scenarios (e.g., extrapolating from low-speed training data to reconstruct high-speed trajectories). Two publicly available vehicle trajectory datasets, NGSIM and HighSIM, were adopted to validate the proposed PINN-based method, and four biased training scenarios were designed to assess the PINN-based method’s extrapolation ability. Results indicate that the PINN-based method demonstrated superior performance regarding trajectory stitching accuracy and consistency compared to benchmark models. The dataset processed using our proposed PINN-based method has been made publicly available online to support the traffic research community. Additionally, this PINN-based approach can be applied to a broader range of scenarios that include physics-based priors.",1366-5545,Not found

In response to the uncertainty caused by information asymmetry, a robust optimization approach is used to model the risk-averse behavior of the enterprises in the game. We incorporate an information transmission mechanism by which the dominated enterprise would obtain partial private information contained in the decision of the dominant enterprise through information inference. We explore the interaction between decision timing and inference, then investigate full and partial information sharing strategies to reveal the critical roles of information flow in supply chain operations. The results illustrate the impact of demand and cost information gaps on enterprise operations, where the information gap is defined as the difference between the worst-case bound and the actual value of the demand and the cost, respectively. In addition, enterprises may not prefer sharing information when the difference between the two information gaps is large or the demand is small. Hence we propose some subsidy strategies for inducing information sharing which can achieve win-win situations. Moreover, moving first and not sharing information is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in most situations when not considering inference. We illustrate how the equilibrium can be changed through subsidy and inference, then provide mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for specific situations. The results also indicate moving first is not always advantageous in the game. This depends on the follower’s information gap, inference level, and information sharing strategy. Finally, in an extension, we discuss information inference costs and the impact of channel encroachment, and we validate our results based on a signaling game.",1366-5545,Not found
Contracting and advertising for e-commerce platforms with private-effectiveness information,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103808,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"In online sales, e-commerce platforms commonly employ marketplace and reselling modes. Motivated by this industry practice, this study investigates which sales mode a platform should choose and how the platform should contract with a manufacturer in each mode. We consider that advertising effectiveness is the platform’s private information. A game-theoretic model is developed to explore the advertising and pricing decisions of three contracts within these modes. We also explore whether and how a platform can signal its private information to the manufacturer. Our analysis reveals significant differences in the informational role of advertising among the three contracts. In marketplace mode, the platform can signal its effectiveness through the advertising level. A proportional-fee contract is more efficient in signaling than a fixed-fee contract. Specifically, when the fixed-fee contract is employed, the platform with low effectiveness must distort its advertising level downward and thus incur signaling costs if the effectiveness uncertainty is low. In contrast, when the proportional-fee contract is employed, signaling is always costless. In reselling mode (wholesale-price contract), although the platform is unable to signal its effectiveness, the information asymmetry does not affect the manufacturer’s wholesale price decision. Moreover, we show that the effectiveness uncertainty and ex-ante decisions of fixed rent and wholesale price significantly affect the mode choice and the relevant decision-making. This study provides valuable insights for e-commerce platform managers on choosing sales mode, concluding contracts with upstream manufacturers, and conducting advertising activities under asymmetric information.",1366-5545,Not found
Sustainability versus exclusivity in the sharing economy: Should leftover luxury fashion products be destroyed?,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103759,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"In the luxury industry, fashion brands like Burberry and Cartier are reported to destroy leftover products at the end of the selling season (Scenario BC). This helps to maintain products’ exclusivity image but creates a loss of goodwill because consumers in the market commonly value sustainability and responsibility. In the sharing economy, luxury fashion brands can sell their leftover products to certain platforms and generate revenue (Scenario PL), but doing so reduces the image of product exclusivity. In this paper, we establish stylized models and analytically investigate this operational problem. In the basic model, we consider the case in which the luxury fashion brand can choose between Scenarios BC and PL with deterministic leftover-product-handling effects. We find that Scenario PL outperforms Scenario BC in terms of both benefit and profit risk (i.e., mean–variance dominating) when (i) the inventory service level in Scenario PL is sufficiently small and (ii) either the demand volatility is sufficiently large or the loss of goodwill cost is sufficiently large. In the extended models, we first generalize the two-period model to a multiple N-period model. We then explore another case in which the leftover-product-handling effects brought by Scenarios BC and PL are stochastic, and we highlight the impacts of the associated uncertainties. Finally, we consider a third scenario in which leftover products are donated for charity. We find that the main insights derived from the basic model remain robust in all of the extended models. In short, in the sharing economy, with an alternative way of using the product leftovers and consumers commonly treasure sustainability, we argue that luxury brands should no longer destroy product leftovers. Our proposal is also in line with the current measures imposed on the luxury brands by European Union in which it is no longer legal for luxury brands to “burn” the product leftovers.",1366-5545,Not found

Assuming economies of scale in rental duration, vessel capacity, and voyage distance, we conduct theoretical analysis to deduce the necessary conditions and solution properties for optimal resolutions to the fleet sizing problems.

Stochastic route optimization under dynamic ground risk uncertainties for safe drone delivery operations,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103717,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The rise of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for urban drone delivery introduces significant risks, particularly the potential for crash-induced fatalities on the ground. A crucial strategy to address this challenge is through risk assessment and mitigation of flight routes that consider the stochastic nature of urban populations. Traditional strategies treat drone flight route approval and execution independently, which fall short in such a dynamic risk environment where plans deemed safe at the strategic approval stage may later prove hazardous, and vice versa. To address these intricacies, this paper introduces a novel two-stage stochastic optimization model that integrates strategic route feasibility assessment with tactical route selection and timing adjustments. A unique aspect of our model is the implementation of a risk penalty that effectively bridges decisions between the two stages, thereby reducing the likelihood of decision errors caused by stochastic variations. Through extensive simulations within Singapore’s urban context, our model demonstrates a risk reduction by an average of 36.13%, which significantly outperforms traditional methods. This performance consistency across 100 simulated urban scenarios proved the robustness and broad applicability of our model. Furthermore, our model shows an 18% improvement in resolving potential decision errors, with the stochastic solution further affirming a notable risk decrease of 27.18%.

One possible solution to address those issues is Smart Loading Zones (SLZs), equipped with advanced technologies to optimize curbside use. Yet, the real-world impact of SLZs on traffic flow is unclear due to a lack of real-world data and rigorous studies investigating SLZ’s causal effect on traffic speed. With granular speed data and real-world implementations of SLZs from Pittsburgh, PA, this study applies the regression discontinuity design method to rigorously examine the causal impact of SLZs on traffic speed in the downtown network. The results showed that the introduction of SLZs could enhance the traffic speed of the nearby road segments by 4.5%, while controlling for the underlying trend of speed and multiple influential factors such as time, weather, and road characteristics. In addition, SLZs with a short length could statistically improve traffic speed but those with a long length exert no significant effect. These heterogenous effects might be attributed to the weak enforcement at the time of SLZ deployment in Pittsburgh. The results confirmed the overall positive impact of SLZs on improving congestion. However, policies such as effective dimension planning and robust enforcement policies are essential to maximize the benefits of SLZs.",1366-5545,Not found

We focus on exploring the impacts of manufacturers’ risk attitude, encompassing factors like the degree of loss aversion and reference dependence, the cap-and-trade policy, and heterogeneous characteristics on optimal decisions and their expected utilities. The main findings are as follows. First, loss aversion and reference dependence have completely opposite effects on manufacturers’ production and emission reduction decisions. Specifically, production quantity will become more conservative. Interestingly, the investment to reduce emissions may actually become more aggressive. In addition, setting a lower reference level presents an opportunity for firms to generate greater profits compared to the risk-neutral scenario. Second, affected by loss aversion and reference dependence, manufacturers’ sustainable investment may decrease with carbon trading price, which is different from the conclusion of the existing research. Third, the total expected utility of heterogeneous manufacturers decreases with the difference of loss aversion and reference dependence. Finally, we extend our analysis to the impacts of sustainable investment, initial carbon emissions associated with emission reduction and heterogeneous market prices. This paper enriches the research on carbon emission reduction and loss aversion with reference dependence, and provides some managerial insights for practice from the perspective of government and enterprise operation.",1366-5545,Not found
Reverse logistics for electric vehicles under uncertainty: An intelligent emergency management approach,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103806,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The frequency and intensity of global disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and wildfires, are increasing, necessitating effective emergency logistics management. Climate change significantly contributes to these events, emphasizing the importance of limiting human and environmental impacts. The transportation sector, particularly the automobile industry, ranks second in global carbon emissions, highlighting the need to adopt electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce emissions and minimize the impact of climate change. However, this has led to an increase in demand for lithium-ion batteries. During emergencies, end-of-life (EOL) battery management through reverse logistics is essential because recycling EOL batteries can recover valuable raw materials, decrease landfill waste and costs, and support environmental sustainability. This study proposed a two-phase method for intelligent emergency EV battery reverse logistics management. The first phase employed machine learning to address unpredictable battery demands, whereas the second phase proposed a multi-objective model to minimize carbon emissions through efficient order allocation during uncertain emergencies. The model considers carbon emissions and defect rates as sources of uncertainty, current regulations, and customer environmental awareness. The model is solved using the weighted sum and ε-constraint methods, resulting in non-dominant solutions. The findings indicate that combining the selection of third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs) with optimal order allocation for recycling old batteries during emergencies effectively minimizes environmental impacts and combats climate change.",1366-5545,Not found
Dynamic collaborative truck-drone delivery with en-route synchronization and random requests,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103802,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Coordinated truck and drone delivery is gaining popularity in logistics as it can greatly reduce operation costs. However, existing studies on related operations management problems typically ignore the following important features: (i) the random appearance of requests, which require operators to dynamically respond to the requests; and (ii) the decisions of optimal launch and retrieval locations for trucks and drones instead of fixed to customer locations, which can significantly impact the overall time costs. To tackle these challenges, this study investigates the dynamic collaborative truck-drone routing problem with randomly arriving requests and synchronization on routes. We model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solve the MDP via a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The proposed RL approach determines: (i) whether each request should be serviced upon arrival, (ii) which truck or drone should be assigned for the request, and (iii) the optimal en-route take-off and landing positions for paired trucks and drones. We further employ a framework of decentralized learning and centralized dispatching in RL to increase performance. Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the proposed solution approach on instances generated based on both the Solomon dataset and real-world operational data of a logistics operator in Singapore over several benchmark algorithms under various battery endurance levels of drones and distinct transportation scenarios including node-based dynamic collaborative truck-drone routing problem, dynamic non-collaborative truck and drone routing problem, and dynamic vehicle routing problem. The results show that our RL solution outperforms the benchmark algorithm in total profit by an average of 28.03 %, and our en-route takeoff and landing scenario outperforms the benchmark scenarios in total profit by an average of 8.43 % in multi-day instances. Additionally, compared to the traditional node-based landing scenario, employing our en-route takeoff and landing strategy can save 0.9 h/(drone*day) of waiting time on average.",1366-5545,Not found
Reverse channel selection in a dynamic stochastic closed-loop supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103774,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper investigates reverse channel selection within a closed-loop supply chain, emphasizing the dynamic characteristics and potential stochastic disturbances inherent in the collection process. We construct three stochastic differential games to model scenarios where the manufacturer, retailer, and third-party each manage the collection of used products, deriving the corresponding equilibrium control strategies. Through comparative analysis, we investigate the impact of different collection channels on price, return rate, demand, and member profits. Our findings reveal that when the conditions across three collection channels are uniform, manufacturer collection emerges as the most effective reverse channel, challenging the conventional wisdom in static settings where retailer collection is typically considered optimal. Moreover, we extend our models to incorporate two critical factors: the collection cost coefficient and the collection logistics cost, which introduce differences across the collection channels. Under these differentiated conditions, our results suggest that third-party and retailer collections can also be optimal reverse channel solutions, particularly when the third-party collector has greater collection capacity, or the retailer benefits from lower reverse logistics costs.",1366-5545,Not found
Demand cannibalization during product rollovers in the presence of strategic customers,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103785,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper studies how different types of demand cannibalization take place during product rollovers and their effects on a firm’s profitability. Due to continuous product upgrades, demand cannibalization among various generations of products has become a common practice, raising interesting investigations from professionals and academics. Within this context, we model firms’ and customers’ decision-making as a two-period sequential game and derive equilibrium results under a dual rollover strategy, with and without a trade-in program. We find that demand cannibalization is essentially caused by customers’ strategic comparison of available purchase options. Our analysis further reveals that both the cannibalization effect and the postponement effect resulting from customers’ waiting for upgraded products are necessary for firms to improve profits. On the contrary, the postponement effect due to waiting for a discount is entirely detrimental to the firm. We propose effective launch strategies to avoid unfavorable demand cannibalization under different conditions. In addition, offering trade-in programs helps not only suppress strategic waiting, but also foster demand for an upgraded product. These strategies are particularly effective when the firm holds a greater quantity of inventory or when the degree of incremental innovation is high.",1366-5545,Not found

Agricultural product harvest equilibrium with transportation bottleneck and random disasters,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103804,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The decentralized planting practices of farmers often result in non-cooperative harvesting and transportation of agricultural products. The high concentration of harvesting demand can cause transportation and processing bottlenecks, resulting in queuing congestion, which in turn affects farmers’ decisions on harvest timing. Thus, the fully competed decision-making process leads to a game equilibrium. To solve this harvest equilibrium problem, a nonlinear equation model with transportation bottleneck capacity constraints is developed. Assumptions to be made are that the value of the pre-harvest product is a non-negative continuously differentiable strictly concave function about the harvest time, and that post-harvest losses are a linear increasing function of queuing time. Subsequently, the model is further extended to incorporate the effects of random natural disasters. Additionally, this paper derives optimal harvest schedules for comparison. A numerical example is used to analyze how the related parameters and the probability of disasters influence farmers’ harvest decisions and the unit benefits of agricultural produce. The analysis results show that a larger total volume of agricultural products prompts earlier harvesting and reduces unit benefits in both equilibrium and optimal harvesting scenarios. Expanding bottleneck capacity allows farmers to harvest closer to the optimal time and increases unit benefits, although the marginal increase diminishes at the margin as bottleneck capacity increases. Increasing the queuing penalty within a range leads to an earlier harvest and reduces the unit benefits in equilibrium and optimality until a critical value is reached, beyond which it has no effect. A higher probability of natural disasters will incentivize farmers to harvest earlier, which in turn will reduce unit benefits.",1366-5545,Not found
"Effects of high-speed rail on intercity travels, utility and social welfare in urban agglomerations: A game-theoretic perspective",10.1016/j.tre.2024.103800,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper investigates the effects of newly built high-speed rail on urban performances in terms of intercity travels, utility and social welfare by extending the two-city system into a representative urban agglomeration system consisting of a hub city and two peripheral cities. A framework based on the Cournot model with three interacted games is developed to characterize competitions among HSR operators in the system. Introducing HSR between peripheral cities decentralizes the intercity travel demands from the hub city to peripheral cities, and it does not always induce more that for the urban agglomeration. We find that “weight” on social welfare, substitutability, gross benefits ratio, HSR accessibility and frequency would differentially impact the hub and peripheral cities. Numerical examples and a case study incorporating all factors based on Central Plains Urban Agglomeration in China are conducted to illustrate the model, together with some policy implications.",1366-5545,Not found
Modeling and regulating a ride-sourcing market integrated with vehicle rental services,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103797,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"With the popularity of on-demand ride services worldwide, ride-sourcing platforms must maintain an adequate fleet size and cope with growing travel demand. Recently, platforms have attempted to provide vehicle rental services to drivers who do not own cars, then recruited them to provide on demand ride services. This helps lower the entry barrier for drivers and offers another profitable business for platforms. From the government’s perspective, however, it is challenging to coordinately regulate a ride-sourcing business and vehicle rental business. This paper proposes a bi-level optimization model to investigate how the government regulates the ride-sourcing market integrated with vehicle rental services. Specifically, how the government designs regulatory policies for minimum driver wage and maximum vehicle rental fee at the upper level, and how a monopoly profit-oriented platform optimizes riders’ price, drivers’ wage, and vehicle rental fee at the lower level. We derive an analytical phase diagram for the two policies and present the government’s decisions in five mutually exclusive regions with respect to regulatory effects, i.e., ineffective region, minimum-driver-wage-effective region, maximum-rental-fee-effective region, coordinated policy region, and infeasible region. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that the government should precisely coordinate the two policies to achieve higher total social welfare, i.e., the weighted sum of rider surplus, driver surplus, and platform profit. We also prove that if the weights of all stakeholders in social welfare are equal, the platform’s vehicle rental business will achieve zero profit when the total social welfare is maximized. The proposed model and analytical results generate managerial insights and provide suggestions for government regulation and platform operations management in the ride-sourcing market integrated with vehicle rental services.",1366-5545,Not found
Store brand entry with asymmetric cost information,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103790,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This study conducts research on a dominant retailer’s establishment strategy of a store brand in a supply chain, in which the retailer possesses private knowledge of the store brand’s product cost, while the manufacturer is only informed about the distribution of this cost information. The store brand entry with asymmetric information initiates a signaling game between the chain members. Through comparing equilibrium outcomes, we find that the pooling equilibrium consistently prevails as the dominant equilibrium, suggesting that the informed retailer is reluctant to reveal the cost information to her national brand cooperative manufacturer. We also explore the influence of a retailer’s store brand entry on the national-brand manufacturer’s performance. The findings reveal that, with asymmetric cost information, mutually beneficial outcomes for all parties involved can be achieved by the establishment of a store brand. Furthermore, we delve into how the asymmetric cost information affects the performance of the chain members. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that asymmetric cost information may be desirable not only for the retailer, but also for the less informed manufacturer under specific circumstances. This suggests the possibility of supply chain members reaching a mutual agreement on the structure of asymmetric cost information.",1366-5545,Not found
Robotic warehouse systems considering dynamic priority,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103779,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The research proposes a new methodological framework based on dynamic priority to handle different order classes in robotic warehouse systems. Traditional static priority methods in facility logistics may cause low-priority orders to experience excessive delays and fail to ensure fairness. Our dynamic priority approach addresses this fairness issue by adjusting priorities over time to fulfill orders within promised times, ensuring both high-priority orders and long-waiting low-priority orders receive timely attention. We present stochastic models of dynamic priority queueing networks to describe warehouse systems and estimate throughput times. Experiments validate the analytical stochastic models, and experimental results indicate that the dynamic priority model achieves shorter delay times than the static priority model and the FCFS model. We propose design insights based on experimental results and provide an approach to select the optimal robot number. Furthermore, by employing a fairness index, we develop a new decision support tool for determining warehouse configurations with requested performance objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that dynamic priority can ensure fairness across a wider range of scenarios.

Investigating the impact of late deliveries on the operations of the crowd-shipping platform: A mean-variance analysis,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103793,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Accompanying the booming of e-commerce, crowd-shipping (CS) service has gained much attention recently. It outsources shipping tasks to the crowd with app-based platform technologies, which largely increases shipping capacities. Despite its merits in providing flexible options for consignees, CS services often face difficulties in delivering packages on time due to several reasons such as crowdshippers’ unprofessional skills, which can be regarded as one of the risks in the CS platform’s operations. Motivated by this, we adopt a mean–variance (MV) approach to characterize the CS platform’s behaviors towards late deliveries, in which two kinds of risk-related behaviors, i.e., risk-neutral and risk-averse attitudes, are incorporated. To identify the impact of late deliveries on the CS platform’s operations, we propose two MV-based risk models, i.e., the risk-neutral and risk-averse models. Equilibrium results concerning the shipping price, the service level, the platform’s expected profit, the consignees’ surplus, and social welfare can be derived from the two models. Results show that late deliveries will negatively affect the CS platform’s profit but positively affect the CS market demand. Policy implications concerning offsetting the negative impact of late deliveries are further proposed and discussed.",1366-5545,Not found
Collaboration and resource sharing in the multidepot time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103798,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Concerns about energy conservation and emission reduction have highlighted the importance of environmentally sound logistics networks in urban areas. These networks are deeply intertwined with urban traffic systems, where variations in transit speeds can significantly increase the energy consumption and carbon emissions of delivery vehicles, compromising the environmental sustainability of urban deliveries. To address this, we propose a multidepot time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows, enhancing route planning flexibility and resource configuration. Our approach begins with a route spatiotemporal decomposition method to estimate vehicle travel times and emissions based on varying vehicle speeds. We then develop a multiobjective mixed integer linear programming model that aims to minimize total operating costs, the number of vehicles, and carbon dioxide emissions. A hybrid heuristic algorithm combining spectral clustering, multiobjective ant colony optimization, and variable neighborhood search is proposed to solve the model. This algorithm incorporates collaboration and resource sharing strategies, a pheromone initialization mechanism, a novel heuristic operator that accounts for time dependency, and a self-adaptive update mechanism, enhancing both solution quality and algorithm convergence. We compare the performance of our algorithm with that of the CPLEX solver, multiobjective ant colony optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-Ⅲ, and multiobjective particle swarm optimization. The results demonstrate the superior convergence, uniformity, and spread of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we apply our model and algorithm to a real-world case in Chongqing, China, analyzing optimized results for different time intervals and vehicle speeds. This study offers robust methodologies for theoretically and practically addressing the multidepot time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows, contributing to the development of economical, efficient, collaborative, and sustainable urban logistics networks.",1366-5545,Not found
Designing a carbon-trading incentive scheme for mode shifts in multi-modal transport systems,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103789,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions triggers the imperative for efficient travel demand management. Previous studies have explored budget-based and aggregated incentive programs, which place a significant financial burden on governments and tend to be limited in contributing to effective behavior change in practice due to budget issues. This study proposes a personal carbon trading travel incentive (PCTTI) mechanism, to encourage private car commuters shifting to using public transit. The incentive budget for PCTTI is sourced from the revenue generated through selling carbon emission reductions resulting from commuters’ travel mode shifts. To determine the optimal incentives, we developed an incentive scheme optimization model based on the Stackelberg game model. Numerical analysis reveals the significant potential of the PCTTI to reduce carbon emissions and travel costs across various scenarios within a multi-modal transportation system. This potential is evident amidst changes in the fixed costs of car travel, carbon trading prices, the use of different travel modes, the value of time, and the prevalence of electric vehicles. The advantages are most pronounced when the carbon trading price exceeds 40 CNY/ton, and when the usage of public transit, the value of time, and the proportion of electric vehicles each fall below 0.4, 50 CNY/hour, and 0.4, respectively.",1366-5545,Not found
Learning-based Pareto-optimum routing of ships incorporating uncertain meteorological and oceanographic forecasts,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103786,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"In modern shipping logistics, multi-objective ship route planning has attracted considerable attention in both academia and industry, with a primary focus on energy conservation and emission reduction. The core challenges in this field involve determining the optimal route and sailing speed for a given voyage under complex and variable meteorological and oceanographic conditions. Typically, the objectives revolve around optimizing fuel consumption, carbon emissions, duration time, energy efficiency, and other relevant factors. However, in the multi-objective route planning problem involving variable routes and speeds, the extensive solution space contains a substantial number of unevenly distributed feasible samples. Traditional heuristic optimization techniques, such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which serve as the core component of optimization programs, suffer from inefficiencies in exploring the solution space. Consequently, these algorithms may tend to converge toward local optima during population iteration, resulting in a solution set characterized by sub-optimal convergence and limited diversity. This ultimately undermines the potential benefits of routing optimization. To address such challenging problem in route planning tasks, we propose a self-adaptive intelligent learning network aiming at capturing the potential evolutionary characteristics during population iteration, in order to achieve high-efficiency directed optimization of individuals. Additionally, an uncertainty-driven module is developed by incorporating ensemble forecasts of meteorological and oceanographic variables to form the Pareto frontier with more reliable solutions. Finally, the overall framework of the proposed learning-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is meticulously designed and validated through comprehensive analyses.

Safety aware neural network for connected and automated vehicle operations,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103780,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Contemporary research in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) operations typically segregates trajectory prediction from planning in two segregated models. Trajectory prediction narrowly focuses on reducing prediction errors, disregarding the implications for subsequent planning. As a result, CAVs adhering to trajectories planned based on such predictions may collide with surrounding traffic. To mitigate such vulnerabilities, this study introduces a holistic safety-aware neural network (SANN) framework, representing a paradigm shift by integrating trajectory prediction and planning into a cohesive model. The SANN architecture incorporates prediction and planning layers, leveraging existing neural networks for prediction and introducing novel recurrent neural cells embedded with car-following dynamics for planning. The prediction layers are regulated by the CAV trajectory planning performance including safety, mobility, and energy efficiency. A key innovation of the SANN lies in its approach to safety regulation, which is based on actual, rather than forecasted, traffic movements. By applying time geography theory, it assesses CAV motion feasibility, setting limits on speed and acceleration for safety in line with actual traffic patterns. This feasibility analysis results are integrated into the neural loss function as a penalty factor, steering the optimization process towards safer CAV operations. The efficacy of the SANN is enhanced by employing the sequential unconstrained minimization technique, which enables the fine-tuning of penalty weights, thereby producing more robust solutions. Empirical evaluations, comparing the holistic SANN with conventional segregated models, demonstrate its superior performance. The SANN achieves substantial enhancements in safety and energy efficiency, with only a marginal compromise on mobility. This success underscores the significance of integrating machine learning with domain knowledge (operations research and traffic flow theory) for safer and more environmentally friendly CAV operations.",1366-5545,Not found
Pricing and unauthorized channel strategies for a global manufacturer considering import taxes,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103784,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Global manufacturers face a pricing dilemma: setting higher prices in foreign markets to offset import taxes may lead to unauthorized cross-border channels; while narrowing price differences between domestic and foreign markets to block these channels increases the tax burden. To address this challenge, we develop Stackelberg game models to investigate the pricing and unauthorized channel strategy for a global manufacturer. Our findings indicate that an unauthorized channel can benefit the manufacturer by providing a means to avoid import taxes and potentially increasing overall demand in the foreign market. When the impact of an unauthorized channel on brand reputation is low, the manufacturer should widen the price difference between domestic and foreign markets to allow it. Conversely, when facing high brand reputation risks, the manufacturer must consider the import tax in the foreign market. If the import tax is high, the manufacturer should narrow the price difference between domestic and foreign markets to block the unauthorized channel; otherwise, simply ignore the threat of the unauthorized channel and maintain regular prices. We also examine the effects of consumer acceptance of gray market products and import tax incentives for cross-border e-commerce. We find that an increase in the two factors enhances the manufacturer’s inclination to allow an unauthorized channel. Our results remain robust across varying import tax structures, production costs, consumer valuations, and exchange rates, as well as when there are differences in market potential and consumer valuation between domestic or foreign markets.",1366-5545,Not found

These systems must generate real-time assignments that meet the expectations of service providers, customers, and couriers. In this study, we designed a time-driven simulation–optimization framework that addresses the dynamic heterogeneous order-courier assignment problem and incorporates order-vehicle restrictions. The framework efficiently manages real-time order arrivals, courier movements, and positional updates while considering dynamic factors such as traffic congestion and regional speed limits for various vehicle types. Extensive testing using literature instances demonstrated the framework’s ability to satisfactorily address the defined problem.

Supply chain planning with free trade zone and uncertain demand,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103771,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Our research is inspired by the subcontracting problem at a major oil field services company in North America.

The FTZ receives raw materials in full containers from various suppliers, and then the company ships them to various plants (e.g. oil excavation sites) frequently via subcontractors. This allows the company to focus on managing only the inbound transportation and inventory at the FTZ. The demand for each raw material is stochastic. We derive an algorithm running at polynomial time for the stochastic programming formulation and perform μ − regret Robust Optimization to handle the demand uncertainty.

Blockchain technology adoption in a supply chain: Channel leaderships and environmental implications,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103788,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Blockchain technology (BT) is widely implemented in businesses, yet its adoption within distinct channel leaderships in a supply chain has not been well studied. Following real-world practices, we build analytical models to study two strategies in which the manufacturer leads BT adoption (MLB) and the retailer leads BT adoption (RLB). Our results show that BT adoption does not necessarily create extra supply chain profits. Higher profits can be obtained when consumers show a strong preference for traceability or when the leader shares sufficient costs otherwise. Raising leaders’ cost-sharing proportions does not necessarily benefit followers, and the cost burden may motivate leaders to reduce the traceability level, thereby decreasing overall benefits. Interestingly, cost-sharing is not a “zero-sum” game for supply chain members, and sharing more costs as followers may help create mutual benefits. A comparison of the strategies of MLB and RLB reveals that the product price, traceability level, and carbon emissions in MLB can either be higher or lower than those in RLB. From an environmental perspective, we show that the carbon tax has a nonmonotonic effect on product retail prices. For the supply chain, it is possible to increase profits but simultaneously reduce emissions in each strategy, and a superior strategy that improves both economic and environmental performance exists. By modelling the regulator’s participation in BT adoption, we further show that emission taxes and BT subsidies are not concomitant, and surprisingly, we find that the emission tax may either increase or decrease with product emission intensity. Moreover, our extension shows that regular operational costs for BT may impact the economic performance of BT adoption but other key findings remain robust.",1366-5545,Not found
Outsourcing vs. authorization remanufacturing and differential vs. uniform pricing: A supply chain perspective,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103777,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"We study a three-tier closed-loop supply chain in which a supplier sells un-remanufacturable key components to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a third-party remanufacturer (TPR). The supplier has two options to price the key components: the uniform pricing policy and the differential pricing policy. Additionally, the OEM has the choice to either outsource or authorize the remanufacturing business to the TPR. Using a game-theoretic framework, we analyze the equilibria of multiple games that the two pricing policies and the two remanufacturing modes are available. Among other findings, we show that compared with the authorization remanufacturing mode, the outsourcing remanufacturing mode is a win–win solution for the supplier, the OEM, the consumers, and the society, but it may be detrimental to the TPR. Compared with the uniform pricing policy, the differential pricing policy may lead to win–win situation for the supplier, the TPR, and the consumers, but it hurts the OEM and the society. We also show that price discrimination can motivate remanufacturing and improve environmental benefits under certain conditions. The analysis of social welfare and environmental impacts provides timely managerial insights for governments considering relaxing anti-price discrimination laws.

Bi-directional information fusion-driven deep network for ship trajectory prediction in intelligent transportation systems,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103770,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Accurate ship trajectory prediction (STP) is crucial to realise the early warning of ship collision and ensure maritime safety. Driven by advancements in artificial intelligence technology, deep learning-based STP has become a predominant approach in the research field of ship collision avoidance. This paper, based on a state-of-the-art survey of the existing STP research progress, aims to develop a new bi-directional information fusion-driven prediction model that enables the achievement of more accurate STP results by addressing the drawbacks of the classical methods in the field. In this context, a cascading network model is developed by combining two bi-directional networks in a specific order. It incorporates the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and the Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network into a single three-layer, information-enhanced network. It takes advantage of both networks to realise more accurate prediction of ship trajectories. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model is comprehensively evaluated using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from three water areas representing traffic scenarios of different safety concerns. The superiority of the proposed model is verified through comparative analysis with twenty other methods, including the state-of-the-art STP in the literature. The finding reveals that the new model is better than all the benchmarked ones, and thus, the new STP solution in this paper makes new contributions to improving autonomous navigation and maritime safety.",1366-5545,Not found
Planning two-dimensional trajectories for modular bus enroute docking,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103769,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Modular buses (MBs), which can physically dock and separate, offer enhanced flexibility and potential cost savings in urban transportation. Despite advances in scheduling, trajectory planning for the docking process of MBs is less developed. This paper addresses the two-dimensional trajectory planning for MB docking. We introduce a hierarchical docking planning model based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The upper-level model optimizes docking time and speed, while the lower-level dynamically updates trajectories. Our models integrate Frenet and Cartesian coordinates with a precise obstacle avoidance model to ensure safety and smoothness under diverse traffic conditions. We employ segmented Lagrange interpolation for discretizing the continuous NMPC model, enhancing planning accuracy with fewer points and improving solving efficiency. Additionally, a multi-task network adaptively adjusts discretization orders based on environmental data. Extensive testing demonstrates our method’s superior accuracy and efficiency in real-time performance, offering marked improvements in safety and operational smoothness compared to existing approaches.",1366-5545,Not found
Energy harvesting for automated storage and retrieval system with sustainable configuration of storage assignment and input/output point,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103781,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The warehouse automation market has experienced significant growth due to the necessity for quick responses to customer needs. The adoption of Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS) aims to enhance operational efficiency and expedite order fulfillment, although environmental considerations are frequently overlooked. This study introduces the implementation of energy harvesting using Regenerative Braking System (RBS) on AS/RS to minimize the carbon emission impact. The best configuration of storage assignments and Input/Output (I/O) points is examined to improve travel time, response time, and carbon emission as sustainability indicators. This study employs a discrete-event simulation mimicking the AS/RS and warehouse environment under uncertainty. Simulation-based experiment was performed under 96 different scenarios and the result was assessed through statistical tests revealing the main and interaction effects between factors to performance indicators, including the trade-off between them. The result reveals that the implementation of RBS in AS/RS can result in 13% energy saving on average or equal to additional travel range of 28,800 m indicating the suitability adoption towards green operation. However, the lowest carbon emission is followed by higher travel time and response time. Thus, metamodel-based optimization was also performed via desirability function analysis. The optimization result reveals that the sustainable AS/RS configuration is obtained with a single-side for I/O point, non-class for storage classification, closest open location with column-order for slot selection, and closest open location with row-order for retrieval selection.",1366-5545,Not found
Location analysis of parcel locker Network: Effects of spatial characteristics on operational performance,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103776,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Parcel lockers are automated self-collection stations commonly used for e-commerce deliveries. It has emerged as a promising solution that overcomes the operational and sustainability challenges arising from Last-Mile Delivery. In collaboration with a major Singapore-based parcel locker operator and using their nationwide operational data, we study the implications of parcel locker’s spatial accessibility on their operational performance, namely demands and users’ time-to-pickup. Instead of measuring spatial accessibility by straight-line distances, we extend the concept by incorporating a more comprehensive set of spatial factors with the adoption of the 5Ds walkability framework. The framework systematically depicts the interplay between spatial factors and individuals’ walking behaviors that are directly related to their parcel locker usage. Positive correlations between population size, street connectivity, availability of living amenities, and bus stops in proximity of parcel lockers versus the demands are observed. In a similar vein, significant correlations between availabilities of living amenities and transit facilities versus consumers’ time-to-pickup are noted. The findings support the positive contribution of trip comfort to parcel lockers’ demands, while also demonstrating the paradoxical effects of trip-chaining convenience, which boosts demand but delays the pickup process. The study contributes to the literature by establishing linkage between spatial measurements and operational performance of parcel lockers with real-life operational data, which complements prior research that primarily relies on survey data. Besides, the study is the first to characterize the time-to-pickup, a critical parameter for network design and delivery operations.",1366-5545,Not found
Shipment policy and its impact on coordination of a fashion supply chain under production uncertainty,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103778,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The fashion industry grapples with volatile demand, characterized by two short-selling sessions, creating an avenue for a fashion firm to receive items through single or dual shipment strategies. Single shipment brings economies of scale and reduces stockout risks. Conversely, dual shipment avoids excessive inventory buildup. To exacerbate the problem, a fashion supply chain faces uncertainties in production marked by launching-failure and order fulfillment risks and has to contend with product obsolescence. Additionally, these factors have distinct impacts on the supply chain members, which can cause inefficiencies across the entire chain. Our study aims to propose an appropriate contract for fashion chain members by considering the impact of shipment policies (single vs. dual). By comparing the benchmark cases, we first address the policy-level dilemma of a vertically integrated fashion firm. We offer a decision matrix for the optimal shipment policy. This matrix weighs production uncertainty, product obsolescence, and associated holding costs. Using the findings of the benchmark case, we investigate the effectiveness of traditional wholesale price and quantity discount contracts. We find these contracts fail to address issues pertaining to flexibility and equitable risk-sharing mechanisms. Finally, we propose a novel risk-sharing quantity discount contract to address these shortcomings. We extend our models by understanding the impact of different levels of launching-failure and order fulfillment risks on ordering decisions and analyze the impact of discounting structures and nonlinear design costs.",1366-5545,Not found
Optimizing multi-attribute pricing plans with time- and location-dependent rates for different carsharing user profiles,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103760,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"One of the main challenges of one-way carsharing systems is to maximize profit by attracting potential customers and utilizing the fleet efficiently. Pricing plans are mid or long-term decisions that affect customers’ decision to join a carsharing system and may also be used to influence their travel behavior to increase fleet utilization e.g., favoring rentals on off-peak hours. These plans contain different attributes, such as registration fee, travel distance fee, and rental time fee, to attract various customer segments, considering their travel habits. This paper aims to bridge a gap between business practice and state of the art, moving from unique single-tariff plan assumptions to a realistic market offer of multi-attribute plans. To fill this gap, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming model and a solving method to optimize the value of plans’ attributes that maximize carsharing operators’ profit. Customer preferences are incorporated into the model through a discrete choice model, and the Brooklyn taxi trip dataset is used to identify specific customer segments, validate the model’s results, and deliver relevant managerial insights.

Green subsidy Strategies and fairness concern in a Capital-Constrained supply chain,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103693,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This study investigates a decentralized capital-constrained green supply chain consisting of a capital-constrained manufacturer and a retailer, wherein the manufacturer is dependent on the retailer by funding his operations and invests in green technology development to manufacture green products. To enhance the degree of product greening, the retailer may launch a subsidy to incentivize the manufacturer. We specifically consider three widely adopted green subsidy strategies by the retailer, namely, price-increasing strategy (Strategy PI), interest-reducing strategy (Strategy IR), and cost-sharing strategy (Strategy CS). Our results reveal that the preferred strategy for the retailer and manufacturer is either Strategy CS or IR, while Strategy PI cannot be the dominant strategy. In specific, when the interest-reducing proportion is low, both the manufacturer and retailer prefer Strategy CS; otherwise, Strategy IR will be preferred by both the retailer and manufacturer. Our study further studies the scenario in which the retailer has a fairness concern. The results indicate that such a concern can weaken the manufacturer’s incentive to improve the degree of product greening and strengthen the retailer’s incentive to embrace Strategy CS. More interestingly, the fairness concern can enhance the performance of the entire supply chain under certain conditions. Specifically, when the level of fairness concern is low, fairness concern is detrimental to the entire supply chain. However, when the level of fairness concern is high, fairness concern is beneficial for the entire supply chain.",1366-5545,Not found
The interaction between manufacturer's showroom deployment and online selling formats,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103773,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Many manufacturers selling through online retail platforms are deploying physical showrooms to facilitate consumers’ learning about their products. To uncover the effects of the manufacturer-deployed showrooms on participants in a platform-based distribution channel, we establish a game-theoretic model wherein a manufacturer sells through an online retailer under either agency selling or wholesale selling, and consumers decide sequentially on showrooming and purchasing. We find that, firstly, despite the merits of showrooms in resolving consumers’ valuation uncertainty, the deployment of showrooms may unexpectedly engender more product returns (i.e., return exacerbation effect), which hurts the retailer under wholesale selling when the consumers’ travel cost is moderate. Second, the manufacturer under each selling format tends to benefit (suffer) from showrooms in the case of low (high) travel cost; in addition, the decrease in commission rate boosts the gain from showroom deployment, making the manufacturer under agency selling more likely to deploy showrooms, especially when the travel cost is moderate. Third, in anticipation of the manufacturer’s (not) deploying showrooms and the corresponding profit impacts, the channel members may adopt varying preferences for the selling format. Notably, they have aligned preferences for agency selling with medium low commission rate, while neither prefers agency selling with relatively high commission rate and travel cost. This study sheds light on the flourishing practice of manufacturer-deployed showrooms, clarifying their impacts on the platform-based distribution channel.",1366-5545,Not found
Manufacturers’ efforts and platform's demand information sharing in eco-friendly actions,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103775,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"More and more consumers have an awareness of environmental protection, and platforms and manufacturers invest in eco-friendly operating and manufacturing to stimulate demand and fulfill their social responsibilities. Our paper investigates whether the platform should share her private demand information with two manufacturers in the reselling or agency selling. The manufacturers offer consumers two substitutable products through the platform. By incorporating eco-friendly efforts into our game-theoretic model, we show that information sharing always benefits manufacturers when the platform serves as a reseller. However, hiding information is preferable for the platform, considering the low efficiency of eco-friendly investment. For the platform, she is willing to disclose information to one or both manufacturers with relatively high efficiency. Nevertheless, the platform is willing to disclose information to both manufacturers (only one manufacturer) when the efficiency is low (high) in the agency selling. Moreover, when manufacturers compete more intensely on eco-friendly levels, the platform is more likely to disclose information to one or both manufacturers in the reselling, but more intense competition for eco-friendly levels prevents the platform from disclosing information to more manufacturers in the agency selling. Furthermore, both manufacturers’ eco-friendly levels always respond positively to the demand signal. Finally, we consider the disparity in carbon emissions between green and non-green manufacturers in the extension. We find that disclosing the demand information to both manufacturers is more efficient in reducing carbon emissions than sharing with only one manufacturer.",1366-5545,Not found
A bi-level approach for optimal vehicle relocating in Mobility-On-Demand systems with approximate dynamic programming and coverage control,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103754,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"For Mobility-on-Demand systems, the imbalance between vehicle supply and demand is a long-standing challenge, leading to losses of orders and long waiting times. Relocating idle vehicles to high-demand regions can enhance system efficiency, thus improving the quality of service. Enforcing vehicle relocation via either link-node or grid-based representation makes it hard to capture the interrelated dynamics with private vehicles while being computationally intensive. The macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) provides a powerful tool to model the interrelated dynamics while individual vehicle details may be absent in the regional-level representation. Therefore, we propose a bi-level rebalancing scheme to maximize the served orders in the system. The urban area is first partitioned into several subregions. For the upper level, the interrelated dynamics of private vehicles and on-demand vehicles are modeled based on the MFD. Then a stochastic programming problem is formulated and solved using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) to determine the number of desired vehicles in each subregion and cross-border. For the lower level, a Voronoi-based distributed coverage control algorithm is implemented by each vehicle to obtain position guidance efficiently. The bi-level framework is evaluated on a simulator of the real road network of Shenzhen, China.

Parking policy design for managing morning commute with dedicated autonomous vehicle lane,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103746,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with self-parking capability puts forward new requirements for parking policy and management. In a transportation system with both general and dedicated AV lanes, this work aims to examine and compare the effectiveness of different parking policies on the morning commute. To be specific, three policies of parking space allocation, namely, first-come-first-service (FCFS), advanced reservation (AR), and their combination (CB), are proposed to guide the commuters’ travel choices. Commuters can drive regular vehicles (RVs) alone on the general lane or ridesharing shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) on the dedicated AV lane. The occurrence conditions and the resultant SAV penetration rates for various scenarios under three parking policies are revealed. The area division for various scenarios with respect to two key parameters is presented, and the typical departure patterns are plotted as well. The numerical results clarify that the CB policy always has a better effect on the total travel cost than FCFS and AR policies. The optimal CB policy is quantified in terms of the optimal amount of all parking spaces and the proportion of unreserved parking spaces.

Given the projected increase in the shipping sector’s contributions to climate change, understanding the emerging research challenges for enabling net-zero shipping is critical. We address this research need by outlining key techno-economic and policy research priorities for achieving effective and equitable net-zero shipping. We use a three-step approach to achieve it. We begin by translating contemporary media issues to techno-economic and policy research challenges, followed by corroborating these identified research challenges with academic literature, and finally prioritizing them by consulting an array of maritime experts in policy, technology, fuel, and infrastructure fields. Our results delineate eleven overarching themes, among which the top four prioritized research challenges based on expert input are: (i) cost-benefit analyses of port initiatives aimed at facilitating maritime climate action; (ii) the investment and techno-economic aspects of onboard carbon capture and alternative shipping fuels, along with green shipping corridors’ potential to facilitate alternative fuel adoption, and (iii & iv) the complex interaction of climate, economic, and socio-political factors in shipping carbon pricing implementation as part of ongoing negotiations at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and shipping’s inclusion in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

Freight train line planning for large-scale high-speed rail network: An integer Benders decomposition-based branch-and-cut algorithm,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103750,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper aims to study and address the problem of completely re-scheduling high-speed freight train line plans under the conditions of a large-scale network, particularly for direct freight trains between central network nodes. First, we constructed a line pool of candidate trains. Then, considering constraints such as flow balance, station capacity, and train transport capacity, we formulated an integer programming model with 0–1 variables. The objective is to minimize train operation costs and freight transfer fees, determining the origin and destination stations and the operating frequency of freight trains. To address the structural characteristics of the model, an integer Benders decomposition-based branch-and-cut algorithm (IBD-BCA) is proposed. This algorithm, within the framework of branch-and-bound, solves the master problem decomposed by Benders and adds two sets of integer Benders cuts to achieve the optimal solution of the model.

The Share-a-Ride Problem with mixed ride-hailing and logistic vehicles,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103758,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"An extension of the Share-a-Ride Problem is proposed, which explores the coordination of ride-hailing vehicles (RVs) and logistic vehicles (LVs) for integrated passenger and parcel service. The goal is to investigate the extent to which RVs can increase profits and logistic companies can reduce operational costs, via information sharing and vehicle coordination. A new optimization problem, termed the Share-a-Ride problem with ride-hailing and logistic vehicles (SARP-RL), simultaneously determines the LV fleet size and passenger/parcel request assignment, assuming that passenger requests can only be served by RVs while parcel requests can be served by both RVs and LVs. The goal is to maximize the total RV profits while minimizing logistic costs. An exact solution framework is proposed by (1) generating all trips for the entire set of passenger and parcel requests via an efficient enumeration method; and (2) finding Pareto-optimal solutions of the bi-objective problem via an ɛ -constraint method.

Improved ADMM-based approach for optimizing intercity express transportation networks: A novel dual decomposition strategy with partial retention of coupling constraints,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103756,192,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The rapid expansion of express delivery volume necessitates the development of logistics centers and the optimization of parcel transportation routes between cities within an extensive express transportation network. This study addresses the intercity express transportation network optimization problem (IETNP), which integrates the hub location problem with the multi-commodity flow problem. An integer linear programming model is introduced to represent the IETNP. To leverage the decomposable structure of the IETNP model, an improved Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm is developed for solving the IETNP. A novel dual decomposition strategy is proposed to mitigate the negative effects of numerous coupling constraints on achieving high-quality upper-bound solutions. This strategy, incorporating penalty-term-reduction and multiplier-replacement methods, diminishes the number of penalty terms and the search space, thus enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining solution quality. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR)-based algorithm is employed to generate lower-bound solutions that assess the quality of the upper-bound solutions. Auxiliary constraints are integrated into the dualized formulation to enhance these lower-bound solutions. The effectiveness and efficiency of the improved ADMM-based algorithm are validated using over 100 artificial instances with 10–500 nodes and a realistic instance involving 338 cities. Comparative analysis with an off-the-shelf solver and existing ADMM- and LR-based algorithms reveals that the improved ADMM-based algorithm reduced the upper-bound values by 11.44% on average and by up to 22.09%.",1366-5545,Not found

However, an often-overlooked aspect in prior research is that travelers can easily acquire information about the route choices of other travelers within the same OD pair. The presentation of route flow information, combined with the influence of travelers’ herd behavior, results in novel and intriguing conclusions distinct from conventional equilibrium models. Specifically, this study demonstrates that by considering the influence of the herd effect in route choice within the stochastic user equilibrium model, it is possible to address three critical problems that remain inadequately resolved in the literature: (1) The stability of stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) in the presence of route flow information. (2) The existence of meaningful link tolls capable of steering the SUE flow pattern toward system optimum (SO). (3) The design of a trial-and-error congestion pricing scheme with disequilibrium observed network flow patterns. To tackle these problems, we present a logit SUE flow evolution process with herd effect and propose a corresponding trial-and-error congestion pricing scheme.

For large-scale instances, the algorithm achieves a 50.2% reduction in makespan compared to the scheduling methods currently used in an actual warehouse. Keeping the number of robots fixed and increasing the buffer positions of the robots can lead to a substantial makespan reduction, up to 55.4%. Intriguingly, we find that augmenting the number of workstations does not proportionally decrease the makespan once the capacity of put wall at each workstation surpasses five order boxes.

Motivated by these practices, we investigate a first-mile ridesharing problem incorporating passenger service quality preferences. This problem involves intricate decisions about the match between requests and vehicles, vehicle routing, and route schedules. To solve this problem, we first develop an arc-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for this problem.

Computational experiments based on real-world road networks and randomly generated instances confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches, demonstrating that the proposed matheuristic finds near-optimal solutions within 40 s for all instances.
