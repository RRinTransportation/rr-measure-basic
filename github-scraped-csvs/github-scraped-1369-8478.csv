The impacts of varying survey design on reported trip satisfaction,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.003,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Research has shown that the way in which a question is asked or the order in which it is received can influence the answer of respondents. Surveys are frequently used by transport professionals to better understand the psychology behind travelers’ level of satisfaction and derive policies. An awareness of how survey design impacts individuals’ responses to satisfaction-related questions is vital for any future policy analysis and development. This study uses travel data collected through a university travel survey, which was carried out during the fall and winter of 2017/2018, to examine the effects of seasonality, question wording, and question order on travel satisfaction. To test for question wording and seasonality, respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with their last trip and satisfaction with their typical commute to work or school under either “warm and sunny” or “cold and snowy” conditions, depending on season of survey completion. To test the effect of question order, respondents were randomly assigned one of two survey versions in which the order of the two aforementioned trip satisfaction questions were switched. Our results confirm the presence of question order and wording effects on reported satisfaction levels, and to a lesser degree, differences in trip satisfaction due to seasonality. Results of this study highlight the need to practice caution when designing travel surveys, particularly with respect to how transport survey respondents are impacted by seasonality, question wording and order.",1369-8478,Not found
T-junction priority scheme and road user's yielding behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.009,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Four studies investigated yielding behavior in yield-controlled T-junctions that differed for two priority schemes. In one case road users in the intersecting arm had to give way to road users in the straight arm (priority to straight arm). In the other case road users in the straight arm had to give way to road users approaching from the intersecting arm (priority to intersecting arm). In two studies, yielding behavior was assessed with approaching speed and gaze behavior to the critical areas of the intersection. Two additional studies monitored road users’ speed and eye movements approaching the intersection. The results of the two behavioral studies showed a significant speed reduction and an increase of driver’s visual inspection to the intersection area in the priority-to-straight-arm condition in comparison to the priority-to-intersecting-arm condition. The eye movement analysis showed that total fixation time towards the intersection critical area and horizontal eye movements were significantly higher in the priority-to-straight-arm condition. The results emphasize the importance of considering perceptual affordances and expectations for priority in intersection design to increase drivers’ compliance to yielding rules.",1369-8478,Not found

Uncovering early adopter's perceptions and purchase intentions of automated vehicles: Insights from early adopters of electric vehicles in California,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.010,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Research on vehicle automation is one of the most current topics in transportation. Some of the questions plaguing the research community include design, cost, and adoption. Many of these questions will remain unanswered until automated vehicles are available to the consumer. In this study, we use a sample of California new electric vehicle buyers to understand if and how current adopters of new vehicle technologies will adopt automated vehicles. We find that many respondents are interested in purchasing an automated vehicle but indicate that they only have average knowledge of the technology. Using an ordinal logit model, we model the interest in purchasing a fully-automated vehicle and find that younger men who purchase higher cost vehicles are more interested in purchasing a fully-automated vehicle. Above all else, those who perceive automated vehicles as being safer than non-automated vehicles have an interest in purchasing an automated vehicle.",1369-8478,Not found
Traffic safety education for child pedestrians: A randomized controlled trial with active learning approach to develop street-crossing behaviors,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.021,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Child Pedestrians are among the most-at-risk populations for road traffic injuries. Our aim in the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of an active learning-based educational intervention on street-crossing behaviors of seven-year-old children. In this randomized controlled trial, 149 first-grade students were selected from two male elementary schools in Mehriz City, Iran, to participate in the study. The participants were randomly assigned into two experimental groups (n = 103, Active-Learning based training group [A.L] (n = 52) and Active-Learning based training with Parental Involvement group [P.I & A.L] (n = 51) and a control group (n = 46, without training group). The instructional program was based on active learning theory and parental involvement approach. Street-crossing behaviors of the students were assessed in an actual traffic environment in three phases: before training, one week after training, and six months after training. The behaviors of students in the experimental groups were significantly improved within one week, and later the six month time frames. Their performance was linearly improved by time (looking for vehicles on the street: F = 3.35P < 0.01; crossing from safe places: F = 10.5, P < 0.0001). No behavioral difference was found among the students in the control group. After six months, there was a better improvement (P = 0.0001) in the street-crossing behaviors of children in the P.I & A.L groups, compared to the A.L group. Our results confirmed the positive effects of active learning-based education with parental involvement approach on improving the street-crossing behaviors of 7-year-old children. Parental involvement is recommended as a useful strategy while designing active learning-based educational programs aiming at the improvement of street-crossing behaviors among school-aged children.",1369-8478,Not found
SeeMe at the crosswalk: Before-after study of a pedestrian crosswalk warning system,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.003,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"SeeMe is a pedestrian crosswalk warning system with automatic pedestrian detection that is mounted on crosswalk signs. Amber flashing lights are activated when pedestrians are approaching or crossing the crosswalk. The aim is to attract motorists’ attention, to improve yielding behavior and to reduce conflicts. A before-after study with a matched comparison group has been conducted in the Norwegian municipality of Trondheim. Video observations were made at eight crosswalks (four of which were equipped with SeeMe in the after period) of 1825 pedestrian-motorist interactions. On average, yielding rates at SeeMe equipped crosswalks increased by 14% (statistically significant) when changes at the comparison sites are taken into account. However, the results are inconsistent between crosswalks. At two of the crosswalks with SeeMe in the after period, yielding rates increased by 39% (statistically significant), while they decreased by 4% at the other two crosswalks (not statistically significant). There were several differences between crosswalks with increased and unchanged yielding rates: Initial yielding rates (below vs. above 80%), placement of crosswalk signs (immediately at vs. at some distance from the crosswalk) and false alarm rates (30% vs. 57% on average). These factors may have affected the effect of SeeMe on yielding rates, but the number of crosswalks included in the study is too small to generalize the differences between different types of crosswalks. The results do not indicate that SeeMe has negatively affected pedestrian behavior or provoked conflicts. It is concluded that SeeMe may be effective in increasing motorist yielding rates at crosswalks with similar characteristics as in the present study - two-lane roads in residential areas with moderate motor vehicle volumes and speed limits of 50 kph or below - and that high initial yielding rates and high rates of false alarms may limit its effectiveness.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of music on vehicular performance: A meta-analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.007,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Various studies offer insightful perspectives on the potential impact of music-listening on driving performance. These studies, however, present conflicting views on the effect of music as either hindering or enhancing driving performance and advance inconclusive claims regarding how and to what extent specific music parameters affect vehicular performance. In this study, therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies. First, we identified experimental studies that measured the effects of music-listening on driving performance through database searches using multiple variants including “car”, “driv*”, “perf*”, and “music*”; of the 118 publications reviewed, 12 met the inclusion criteria for the current meta-analysis. Second, we coded independent variables—i.e., tempo, volume, instrumentation, familiarity, musical style, the music’s source, and whether music was selected by the researchers or the drivers—and dependent variables—i.e., vehicular longitudinal and lateral control, driver reaction time, traffic signal violations, collisions, and driving scores. Third, we ran mixed-effects and random-effects models to identify both general tendencies and more particular trends related to the effect of music-listening on driving performance—driving performance is here understood as the combination of vehicle manipulation and road navigation. Consistent with anecdotal evidence, the results of this meta-analysis show that music-listening has a statistically significant detrimental effect on driving performance, specifically for collisions and longitudinal control. In contrast with anecdotal evidence, however, the results of this meta-analysis show a detrimental effect associated with music-listening at soft volumes and no significant difference in driving performance associated with tempo. The study’s findings contributed to the development of a process model, and the concluding discussion offers suggestions for future empirical investigations related to music and driving.",1369-8478,Not found
The role of car ownership in attitudes towards public transport: A comparative study of Guangzhou and Brisbane,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.005,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Car ownership has often been linked to a strong commitment to car use and a tendency to undervalue alternative transport modes, thereby potentially biasing people away from using more environmentally friendly transport modes such as public transport. Although a considerable body of research has shed light on the attitudinal dimensions of car ownership and usage, few have investigated the potential influence of car ownership on attitudes towards alternative transport modes from an international comparative perspective. Across cities with distinct mobility cultures and economic backgrounds, car ownership may have differentiated influences on how people view various transport modes, yet little research exists in this area. This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between car ownership and attitudes towards public transport in two vastly different metropolises, Guangzhou, China and Brisbane, Australia, while taking account of environmental concerns, past behaviour and socio-demographic characteristics. Drawing on two survey data sets, we derived measurements that directly compare the perceived difference between bus transit and cars, and constructed latent attitudinal variables based on loose-matching and strict-matching criteria to enable a more robust test of hypotheses. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), our analysis shows that car ownership appeared to contribute significantly to the perceived disparity between public transport services and car use in Guangzhou, but less so in Brisbane. Furthermore, environmental concerns were found to have a stronger influence on transport-mode attitudes in Brisbane. Recommendations are developed to inform local policies to promote more sustainable urban transportation.",1369-8478,Not found
Should I take over? Does system knowledge help drivers in making take-over decisions while driving a partially automated car?,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.016,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Partially automated car systems are expected to soon become available to the public. However, in order for any of the potential benefits of automated driving to arise, the driver and car need to establish effective, efficient and satisfactory interactions. Otherwise, the driver may rely too much on the automated car system, leading to dangerous situations or not relying on the system at all, making the automation pointless. This study studied whether the current method of providing information on (automated) car systems to drivers, which is mainly through owner’s manuals, can bring the driver’s mental model in accordance with the car’s capabilities. A total of 28 participants took part in a video- based driving simulator experiment. The participants were split into two groups: the first received no information about the system while the second did receive specific information about functionalities and system limitations. Each participant was seated in a driving simulator and experienced a partially automated car driving in city situations by means of videos projected on the outer screen. Participants were asked to indicate through the push of a button on the steering wheel if they felt that the car could no longer cope with the situation, and would take back control from the car if they were driving it on the real road. Each video was categorized as ‘requires a take-over’ or ‘does not require a take-over’ before the experiment, based on the system descriptions the participants received. Overall, the system information did not appear to support the participants in correctly deciding whether to take over or to rely on the system. The mental models of the participants did not seem to (sufficiently) change through the system information. Owner’s manuals may not be sufficient for future systems to provide drivers the necessary tools to be able to decide whether it is necessary to take back control of the car. In-vehicle support, tuned to the driver and the specific situation may be needed to safely guide this process.",1369-8478,Not found
Can our phones keep us safe? A content analysis of smartphone applications to prevent mobile phone distracted driving,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.017,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Mobile phone use while driving is a pervasive problem that continues to increase, notwithstanding the large crash risk this behaviour constitutes. A number of phone applications have been developed with the intention of utilising the technology to prevent dangerous phone behaviours while driving. Despite the potential these applications have in preventing crashes associated with distracted driving, research is yet to explore these emergent applications. Therefore, this study provided a review of the current smartphone applications developed to prevent distracted driving. A content analysis was conducted to identify the smartphone applications targeted at stopping, preventing or reducing phone use behaviour while driving. Their functionality was determined based on the ecosystem of smartphone applications: application-mobile phone interaction, application-driver interaction, and application-context interaction. A total of 29 relevant applications in English language were identified. Most of these applications focused on blocking specific phone functions (e.g. texting or calling) while allowing more desirable driving phone functions to be accessed (e.g. music applications and GPS functions). The specific functions which are blocked or allowed varied greatly between applications. Out of the different application interactions, the function which sends an automatic text message to a contact who texts the driver (associated with external communicator interactions) was the most common feature. A major limitation of the applications was their reliance on blocking specific phone functions as opposed to managing workload while driving or simplifying specific phone tasks to be more compatible with driving. Simply blocking phone functions may not be attractive to drivers who view their phone as a necessity. As such, these drivers are unlikely to use these voluntary applications at all while driving. Smartphone applications designed to prevent phone use while driving show potential for playing a large role in a systemic intervention to prevent mobile phone distracted driving, yet there is a substantial need for further development of these applications.",1369-8478,Not found
"Working together to develop interventions for young drivers, pre-crash, pre-offence, and pre-licence: A pilot multi-agency collaboration",10.1016/j.trf.2018.09.023,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Background Young drivers persist as a major public health problem due to their over-involvement in road crashes in which they and other road users are injured. In 2013 a multi-agency collaborative working group was created in the Sunshine Coast region of Queensland, Australia, to improve road safety more generally, and to improve young driver road safety specifically. Funding for a four-stage project was generated, with the aim of elucidating how to identify high risk young drivers (HRYD) – pre-offence, pre-crash – so that early intervention may prevent problematic on-road behaviour. This manuscript summarises the findings of the four-stage pilot project. Method Stage 1 was a comprehensive literature review of profiling problematic youth (e.g., HRYD). Stage 2 operationalised focus groups with stakeholders. Stage 3 was the development of the HRYD model through the integration of the findings of Stages 1 and 2. Stage 4 was a two-step cluster analysis of de-identified police records of n = 2973 Sunshine Coast youth aged 17–25 years with offence data from the age of 14 years. Results The HRYD model comprised on-road (e.g., offences) and off-road (e.g., community behaviour) behaviours/characteristics. Cluster analysis identified four groups: cluster 1 (21.4% of sample) and 3 (23.8%) comprised non-injury and injury crashers, cluster 2 (40.1%) comprised HRYD, cluster 4 (14.7%) comprised substance users. Discussion and implications The multi-agency collaboration developed a HRYD model and tested it in a real-world sample of youth with road and non-road offences detected by police from the age of 14 years. The largest gains in the short-term relate to ‘picking the low hanging fruit’, with technology such as automated number plate recognition able to identify problematic youth, for example, through the detection of expired vehicle registration. Premised on the notion that ‘prevention is better than the cure’, the next project will test the veracity and robustness of the model in two populations in Queensland (one larger rural region, one large city region). The findings will inform the development, application, and evaluation of multi-agency interventions targeting young drivers more generally (e.g., non/injury crashers), potential substance-affected drivers (e.g., users of illicit drugs, alcohol), and potential HRYD before they offend, before they crash, and indeed before licensure.",1369-8478,Not found
Effectiveness and user acceptance of infotainment-lockouts: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.001,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Lockout is a system-initiated distraction mitigation strategy that renders certain features of in-vehicle information systems (IVISs) non operable while the vehicle is in motion. The aim of this driving simulator study was to examine the influence of lockouts on driving performance and user acceptance. Overall, 52 participants performed six tasks with fully unlocked, partially locked, and completely locked IVIS. Within a repeated-measures design, we assessed user acceptance. As participants were free to decide where to conduct a secondary task, we could only analyse driving performance of 26 drivers. After each driving section, the participants rated the respective system with respect to acceptance. Driving performance with regard to lateral control was better when the system employed partial or complete lockouts as compared to the unlocked system. In contrast, longitudinal control did not benefit from a lockout. User acceptance decreased with an increasing number of disabled system functions while driving. Thus, lockout as a distraction mitigation strategy comes at the price of reduced user acceptance. To improve acceptance, one could attempt to make the secondary tasks less attractive (e.g., by public campaigns) rather than prohibit them through lockout. In addition, human-machine interfaces in the vehicle could be improved in order to reduce their demands on attentional resources.",1369-8478,Not found
The generation and development of road rage incidents caused by aberrant overtaking: An analysis of cases in China,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.002,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Based on 32 cases that occurred in China, this paper analyzes the generation and development of road rage incidents caused by aberrant overtaking. Those cases caused by aberrant overtaking can be categorized into five development modes: harmful behavior caused by verbal abuse or discourteous acts (for example, honking or blocking); struggles caused by verbal abuse and disputes; repeated overtaking and cutting off the other car followed by a dispute or struggle; extreme irritation leading to immediate harm; and being forbearing and conciliatory in the face of provocation from others. The factors influencing the generation and development of the modes of each incident and the resulting injuries are analyzed. Moreover, controllable factors and strategies that can be used to prevent such incidents are discussed. Most of the offenders are males, and females are usually victims of the incidents. Additionally, most of the incidents develop through the exchange of verbal abuse. Road rage caused by aberrant overtaking is a momentary incident and does not last long; therefore, injury can be avoided if drivers can keep calm and be forbearing and conciliatory when confronting provocation from others.",1369-8478,Not found
"Non-driving-related tasks, workload, and takeover performance in highly automated driving contexts",10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.015,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This study investigates the influence of non-driving-related task (NDRT) on takeover performance in a highly automated driving (HAD) context and the effect of workload on driver’s takeover performance. A driving simulator was used to evaluate how well a driver resumes control of a vehicle after being in a HAD situation during which they performed a NDRT. For both the visual performance and takeover capability, there was a significant difference based on the task carried out; however, the reaction times when reaching for the steering wheel did not differ among the tasks. The result on workload demonstrate that NDRT type has significant effect while a positive correlation between the performance dimension and takeover was found. In addition, takeover performance for interaction with the entertainment console exhibits a significantly positive correlation, whereas watching a video or interacting with a smartphone exhibits mostly a significantly negative correlation with workload dimensions. These results provide implication on the effect of tasks desired and enabled to be performed by drivers in HAD and its influence on the transition of control.",1369-8478,Not found
"Automated driving reduces perceived workload, but monitoring causes higher cognitive load than manual driving",10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.006,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Driver mental workload is an important factor in the operational safety of automated driving. In this study, workload was evaluated subjectively (NASA R-TLX) and objectively (auditory detection-response task) on Dutch public highways (∼150 km) comparing manual and supervised automated driving in a Tesla Model S with moderators automation experience and traffic complexity. Participants (N = 16) were either automation-inexperienced drivers or automation-experienced Tesla owners. Complexity ranged from an engaging environment with a road geometry stimulating continuous traffic interaction, and a monotonic environment with lower traffic density and a simple road geometry. Perceived and objective workload increased with traffic complexity. When using the automation, automation-experienced drivers perceived a lower workload, while automation-inexperienced drivers perceived their workload to be similar to manual driving. However, the detection-response task indicated an increase in cognitive load with automation, in particular in complex traffic. This indicates that drivers under-estimate the actual task load of attentive monitoring. The findings also highlight the relevance of using system-experienced participants and the importance of incorporating both objective and subjective measures when examining workload.",1369-8478,Not found

Fifty-one non-offenders and 41 offenders completed a Pictures of Facial Affect test (Ekman & Friesen, 1976) wherein photographs of prototypical facial emotional expressions were presented. Results show differences between the groups in response time to all emotions whether answers were correct or incorrect.

An eye-tracking study on the road examining the effects of handsfree phoning on visual attention,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.013,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"One well documented source of distraction in traffic is phoning. The negative effect of phoning is not only attributed to the effects of operating the device, but it is also caused by the division of attention between driving and the conversation. Therefore, one could argue that handsfree phoning is not per se safer than handheld phoning. Indeed, a number of studies has indicated that handsfree phoning and handheld phoning produce the same performance deficits. In the present study, we examine the effects of handsfree phoning on eye-movement patterns while driving in traffic. Thirty participants made two consecutive trips of about 14 km on a three-lane highway. During one of these two trips, they received a phone call on a handsfree device in the vehicle. The analysis of the eye-tracking variables indicate that road signs, other vehicles, and the speedometer are fixated less. At the same time, the visual scan pattern suggests a wider spatial distribution of eye fixations during a handsfree phone call. Taken together, these findings seem to suggest that during handsfree phoning, the gaze behavior is determined to a lesser degree by the driving task; drivers seem to fixate less on traffic related information. However, future research is needed to provide further evidence to confirm this conclusion and to investigate if (or under which conditions) these differences will actually result in less safer driving when phoning handsfree.",1369-8478,Not found
Behavioural culpability for traffic accidents,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.004,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This study presents a description of the concept of behavioural culpability, a step-by-step manual for using it, and an empirical test of a suspected mis-classification of culpability. Behavioural culpability is defined as whether the driver’s actions contributed to a crash and that non-culpable crashes are not caused by any specific behaviour and can only be predicted from exposure. Drivers with non-culpable crashes are therefore a random sample of the population. However, if the criteria for culpability and/or the individual judgements are not reflective of the principle of behavioural culpability, no fault drivers will not be a random sample of the driving population. To test the predictions from the definition of randomness in a sample assumed to have sub-optimal coding, the categorization of crash involvement undertaken by a British bus company was tested for associations between at fault and no fault crashes, age and experience. As predicted from the low percentage of at fault accidents in the sample, correlations between the variables indicated that a fair percentage of at fault crashes had been coded as no fault of the bus driver, suggesting a too lenient criterion. These results show that within fleet-based companies, culpability for a crash is probably allocated for legal reasons, which means that the predictability of accident involvement taking into account individual differences is not fully utilized. The aim of behavioural culpability coding is to increase effect sizes in individual differences in safety research and to improve our capability of predicting accident involvement.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors related to the intention to buy an e-bike: A survey study from Norway,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.008,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The electric bicycle (e-bike) is a newly emerging transport option that brings several environmental and individual benefits.

A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to investigate the predictors of intentions to buy an e-bike. Results showed that increasing age, higher perceived benefits, both subjective and descriptive norm in favor of e-bikes, and familiarity with e-bikes were positively, whereas perceived barriers related to usability and safety were negatively related with the intention to buy an e-bike. In addition, compared to e-bike users, non-users had lower scores on the benefits related to mobility, symbolic and health aspects of e-bikes and higher scores on the barriers related to usability and safety of e-bikes.

However, single voice commands are longer and more complex and may be difficult for older drivers to use. The current study examined the glance behavior, workload, and driving performance of drivers age 20–66 years when they placed a call using their hands or voice with the Chevrolet MyLink or Volvo Sensus information system during highway driving. In general, as age increased, drivers took longer to complete phone calls, reported greater workload when using voice commands, and made significantly more off-road glances lasting longer than two seconds when placing calls relative to younger drivers. Both the voice-command systems of MyLink and Sensus increased the proportion of time that drivers were looking at the road when calling compared with manual phone calling, but the relative increase was greater when using MyLink’s single-voice-command system compared with the multiple-command system of Sensus, and this advantage grew as drivers aged. The findings indicate that placing calls while driving using voice commands helps drivers of all ages keep their attention toward the road better than doing so manually, and that, contrary to expectation, using a single-command system like MyLink’s worked better than a multiple-command system like Sensus for older drivers as well as younger ones.",1369-8478,Not found
Bus drivers who leave; were they more crash-involved?,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.014,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Turnover is usually considered to be a safety problem for companies, but can also be an advantage, if those who leave are less safe than those who stay. This problem has rarely been investigated for bus drivers, where the financial and human costs of crashes are high. This study tested whether bus drivers who left their jobs had more crashes than those who remained, using company records. Several analyses were run, using crashes per number of days worked, the absolute number of crashes in a specific time period, as well as the ratio of culpable to non-culpable crashes. Drivers who left the company, except those who retired, had forty percent more crashes than those who stayed, but were also less experienced, which explained part of the difference. Results were similar regardless of analysis performed. Turnover may be a problem for bus companies due to the costs of recruitment and training, but this study suggests that there are benefits for turnover too. Fleet-based companies would probably gain more by improving driver selection methods than trying to retain drivers with a high crash rate, as a natural selection process seems to lead to the safest drivers staying with the company.",1369-8478,Not found

Pedestrian violations are an important traffic safety problem, especially in low and middle-income countries. The problem would be better understood and solved by theory-based research on pedestrian violations. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the prototype willingness model (PWM) are two leading decision-making frameworks that are applied to a wide range of behaviors. These theories address the reasoned and social reactive components in decision-making. The current study aimed to compare the TPB and the PWM in pedestrian violations using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results revealed that the TPB, the PWM, and the integrative model of the TPB and the PWM were relevant models in understanding pedestrian violations and violation intentions. However, the explanatory power of the PWM and integrative models were higher than the TPB. These findings indicate that pedestrian violations happen mostly in a social reactive way (through willingness) rather than deliberate (intentional) way.

Pedestrian smartphone distraction: Prevalence and potential severity,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.011,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"To better understand the incidence and potential severity of pedestrian smartphone distraction in a city location, a non-invasive observational study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia. Video recordings of pedestrians crossing roads at eight city sites were undertaken during daytime conditions. Data were analysed both for pedestrian use of different smartphone functions such as hand-held calls, and for ‘critical events’ such as crossing the road at a prohibited time. The results found that, on average, 20% of pedestrians were using their smartphones when crossing roads, significantly more critical events occurred with smartphone users compared to non-smartphone users, and that the pattern of critical events was different for smartphone and non-smartphone users. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of further research and potential countermeasures to minimise the occurrence, or impact, of pedestrian distraction.",1369-8478,Not found
“You're a great driver/Your driving scares me”: Reactions of older drivers to family comments,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.022,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Background and objectives Age related changes often compromise the ability to drive safely. Some elders report that they listen to others’ advice, but there have been no studies that have examined how much influence families have on their driving decisions. This study fills this gap by exploring older drivers’ perceptions of how family members affect their driving decisions. Research design and methods A quasi-experimental ranking task was used to examine the expected influence that 48 hypothetical statements, drawn from related literature, have on a convenience sample of 37 adults, age 70–96 years. Analysis was conducted by gender and by habit strength for driving. Results Four domains of influence were identified from the literature, representing family aims to influence the elder to: (1) continue driving, (2) modify driving, (3) reduce driving, and (4) stop driving. Statements aimed at supporting the driver to continued driving (62%) and to reduce driving (62%) were found to have the most influence, with slightly less support for statements aimed to influence them to stop driving (58%) or modify their driving (52%). Women rated statements supporting them to continue driving as having the highest influence on them, whereas men reported that they were more influenced by statements encouraging them to reduce their driving. In addition, participants with high habit strength for driving were less likely to rate family statements as having a high influence on them. Discussion and implications This study contributes new understanding of the influence of families on the driving decisions of older adults. These findings may be used to support families, in addition to informing the development of effective programs aimed at older driver safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Comparable rates of simulator sickness in Huntington's disease and healthy individuals,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.007,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Objective Investigating driving competence with a simulator provides a controlled setting and has a high reproducibility. In addition, there is less risk of physical harm compared to on-road tests. A disadvantage of using simulators is the occurrence of simulator sickness, which is comparable to symptoms of motion sickness. The aim of this study was to examine whether patients with Huntington’s disease (HD) are more susceptible to develop simulator sickness compared to healthy individuals. Further, we investigated if the clinical symptoms of HD, such as motor disabilities and cognitive deterioration, might increase the occurrence of simulator sickness. Methods Eighty-three participants (54 HD, 29 controls) drove in a driving simulator that included urban and motorway scenarios. All participants were still active drivers. Motor, cognitive, and oculomotor assessments were administered. Participants completed a questionnaire after the driving session to report possible symptoms of simulator sickness. Results Fifty-eight (70%) participants completed the driving session, while 25 (30%) participants dropped out due to simulator sickness. The most reported symptoms of simulator sickness by dropouts were difficulties concentrating, dizziness, nausea, sweating, and vomiting. Dropouts were significantly older and more often female compared to completers. Decreased smooth ocular pursuit was predictive of dropout due to simulator sickness. The number of HD participants and controls in the dropout group was comparable. There was no significant difference in cognitive performance and motor functioning between completers and dropouts. Conclusions HD participants did not have a higher chance of developing simulator sickness while driving in a simulator compared to controls. Female gender, older age, and smooth ocular pursuit were associated with increased simulator sickness, whereas cognitive and motor functioning were unrelated to dropout due to simulator sickness.",1369-8478,Not found
"Exploring the influence of attitudes, social comparison and image and prestige among non-cyclists to predict intention to cycle in Mexico City",10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.009,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"People face a number of different barriers when choosing to cycle for commuting purposes. This study examined the role of psycho-social factors predicting the intention to cycle to commute in Mexico City. An extended version of the theory of planned behaviour was developed and utilized with a sample of 401 infrequent and non-cyclists in Mexico City. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was applied, and after identifying five factors, a structural equation model was estimated to find the relationships among the variables. The results indicated that cycling attributes, attitudes to cycling, social comparison and social image and prestige were the most important factors influencing intention to cycle. The results show positive attitudes towards cycling characterized by evaluations of cycling to commute such as considering it good, enjoyable or beneficial were more likely to demonstrate an intention to commute by bicycle. The same effect on intention was found when cycling is considered important as a mode for commuting. They also show that affective motives combined with attitudes explained 33.5% of the variance (adjusted R2 0.335) in intention to cycle. Social image increased the explanation of the intention to cycle by just 1%, (adjusted R2 0.346). Examination of the individual means for social comparison orientation items showed strong beliefs linking bicycle use with other people thinking they are poor nonetheless the findings for social comparison should be treated with caution as the strength of this model construct was very low. Although the results from this study are specific to Mexico City, they indicate areas of interest to transportation planners in other regions, especially in those cities where intention to cycle is linked to its perceived image and there is political ambition to instigate positive cycling cultures.",1369-8478,Not found
Road sign vision and driver behaviour in work zones,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.005,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The effectiveness of roadwork signs on drivers’ safety is a poorly investigated topic. The present study examined visual fixations of 29 participants to work zone signs, while driving 27 km along rural roads. The drivers’ visual fixations on the work zones signs were recorded with an eye tracking device, synchronized to a GPS recorder that collected kinematic data. The routes crossed 23 roadwork zones, including a total of 69 vertical work zone signs. Visual behaviour to roadwork signs were compared to visual behaviour to permanent vertical signs. The results revealed that drivers glanced at both temporary and permanent signs along the roadwork areas with a similar 40% frequency. In addition, they glanced at single roadwork signs more often and for longer than at multiple-roadwork signs. The main findings of this paper lead to conclude that driver behaviour, investigated by comparing instant speed and visual fixations, is frequently unsafe.",1369-8478,Not found
Move closer and get active: How to make urban university commutes more satisfying,10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.001,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"By making commuting more enjoyable, workplaces, schools, and communities can become more attractive and competitive. We applied quantitative and qualitative methods to explore changes in commute satisfaction reported in the Fall 2017 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) Campus Travel Survey. Among the 2715 respondents who reported satisfaction scores for both their current commute to UWM and their previous commute to a different work or school location, 30% were more satisfied and 47% were less satisfied with their current commute. Binomial logistic regression identified several sociodemographic variables associated with increased satisfaction. In addition, respondents who had a shorter commute to UWM than their previous work or school location were 5.3 times more likely to report increased satisfaction. Respondents who shifted from a motorized mode to walking or bicycling were 2.5 times more likely to be more satisfied. Open-ended responses suggested that satisfaction with active commuting is likely due to benefits such as physical and mental health, social interaction, and being able to express values such as environmental protection and self-reliance. Importantly, active modes avoid the hassle and cost of automobile parking. Urban universities can frame strategies to promote active and sustainable travel modes as a means to support more enjoyable commute options.",1369-8478,Not found
"Measurement validity of retrospective survey questions of bicycling use, attitude, and skill",10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.002,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Though panel data have substantial advantages over cross-sectional data in the study of travel behavior change, it also introduces logistical and methodological challenges for researchers. Retrospective surveys have the advantage of addressing many of these challenges, though the measurement validity of recalled answers remains an important concern. In this study, I assess the measurement validity of recalled characteristics related to bicycling: usual use of a bicycle to commute, bicycling attitude, and bicycling skill. I statistically compare data collected prospectively in the 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, and 2015–16 UC Davis Campus Travel Surveys (CTS) with corresponding data collected retrospectively in the 2016–17 CTS. I find that prospective answers are strongly associated with recalled responses, that the passage of time has a weak, uncertain influence on recollection, and that present-day attributes attenuate the relationship between prospective and retrospective answers. I conclude that the recalled answers display a sufficient degree of correspondence to prospectively-collected response to have faith in analyses using retrospective survey data regarding traits within the past five years or less. Further research should be done on the measurement validity of retrospective travel survey data to contribute to the knowledge base on this important methodological topic.",1369-8478,Not found
Electric vehicle drivers use better strategies to counter stereotype threat linked to pro-technology than to pro-environmental identities,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.031,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) could play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Much research has examined the practical barriers to large-scale BEV uptake, but very little has examined the psychological barriers. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by investigating the effects of stereotype threat on BEV drivers. This psychological predicament occurs when an individual imagines or experiences being judged in terms of negative stereotypes about their social group. Qualitative thematic analysis of interview data revealed three distinct stereotypes that the BEV drivers imagined or reported other people to hold: eccentric, low-status environmentalists; hypocritical, high-status environmentalists; and geeky technophiles. With regard to the first and second stereotypes, drivers tended to use individualist defence strategies by downplaying their pro-environmental attitudes and dissociating themselves from the undesirable environmentalist groups. With regard to the third stereotype, they tended to use more constructive, group-level defence strategies by perceiving their BEV driver ingroup as superior on the innovative technology adopter dimension compared to their non-BEV driver outgroup. Suggestions are made for countering the psychological barrier of stereotype threat, such as promoting images of BEV drivers as future-shaping market leaders and treating them as members of an influential and desirable consumer group.",1369-8478,Not found
A simulator study of the effect of incentive on adoption and effectiveness of an in-vehicle human machine interface,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.030,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Introduction Rapid developments in transportation technologies, such as in-vehicle human-machine interfaces (HMI), have the potential to improve driving behaviour. However, the use of such approaches is typically voluntary and there are numerous barriers to their widespread implementation. The aim of the current paper is to evaluate the impact of monetary incentive combined with competition with other drivers on adoption and effectiveness of an eco-safe in-vehicle HMI. Moreover, this research assess intentions to use and willingness to purchase the in-vehicle HMI, both of which play crucial roles in sustained voluntary uptake of in-vehicle HMIs. Method Forty drivers participated in a driving simulator experiment and questionnaires. Three variations of an eco-safe driving in-vehicle HMI were evaluated (advice only, feedback only, combined advice and feedback), followed by an incentive-based condition. Results The findings revealed the 4.7% reduction in fuel consumption with an addition of incentive and competition with other drivers associated with the use of in-vehicle HMI on eco-safe driving behaviour. Moreover, there was some evidence to suggest that a range of extrinsic and intrinsic incentives may be beneficial for increasing intentions to use such a system. Conclusions We conclude that the addition of incentives may be more effective in encouraging greater intentions to use the in-vehicle HMI, compared to improving eco-safe driving behaviour associated with system use. Practical applications This research provides valuable knowledge towards enhancing the current understanding of the nature and features of eco-safe in vehicle HMIs. Such information provides a foundation for the design and development of novel in-vehicle systems, incorporating the influence of competition with other drivers and incentives to enhance the motivation to use in-vehicle systems and consequently, improve drivers’ fuel efficiency and safe driving behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found

"Effects of driver work-rest patterns, lifestyle and payment incentives on long-haul truck driver sleepiness",10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.028,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The aim of the study is to identify and model the role of payment incentives, driver work-rest patterns and other lifestyle habits influencing the drowsy driving behavior among long-haul truck drivers. To achieve this aim, this study targeted two main objectives: (1) to examine the significant differences between the groups of drowsy and non-drowsy drivers based on the opportunities of monetary incentives and (2) to examine the role of different factors: driver demographics, work-rest patterns, lifestyle and occupational characteristics particularly incentives associated with driving in causing driver sleepiness among Indian truck drivers. The study is based on interview responses from 453 long-haul truck drivers approached in three Indian cities – Mumbai, Indore and Nagpur. Initial principal component analysis of the responses related to financial incentives (occupational characteristics) resulted into two correlated factors: (i) willingness to earn extra payments if offered (WEP) and (ii) incentives available in the current driving experience (ICD) that influence driver work-rest patterns and alertness while driving. Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference among the groups of sleepy and non-sleepy drivers due to these factors (WEP and ICD). Finally, a logistic regression model showed that long driving duration, working days per week, rest patterns, insufficient sleeping hours and history of violations were found significantly associated with drowsy driving among the long-haul truck drivers. Increase in consumption of caffeine and tobacco indicated reduction in driver alertness. According to the model results, the odds of drowsy driving were 77% less for drivers between 46 and 55 years compared to the young drivers (<25 years). Driving under the influence of financial incentives was observed to increase the odds of falling asleep by 1.58 times among the truck drivers. This was apparently the most interesting and intriguing result of the study indicating the need for further research on the influence of financial or socio-economic motivations to sleepiness.",1369-8478,Not found

In this study the effects of median refuge island and “Yield here to pedestrians” flashing vertical sign on pedestrian crossing conspicuity were assessed with a before–after analysis of both speed and visual behaviour of drivers approaching to crosswalks. The elements of the pedestrian crossing that were more salient and how drivers’ visual behaviour was related to speed were assessed analysing drivers’ eye movements. The intervention significantly increased the fixation time to the zebra markings and the addition of the flashing light increased conspicuity and fixation time to the vertical sign. The median refuge island was glanced by 60.7% of the drivers. Distance of first-fixation of the crosswalk increased by 44.7%.

Conceptualization of aggressive driving behaviors through a Perception of aggressive driving scale (PAD),10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.032,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Research on traffic safety has highlighted the importance of studying and intervening in aggressive driving in order to reduce crashes and accidents. The main objective of this work is to describe the perception of what people consider an aggressive behavior, and their perception of which are the most aggressive acts performed when driving. The sample was composed of 1079 Spanish drivers aged over 14. They participated in a national telephone survey, completing a questionnaire which gathered socio-demographic data and information on the drivers’ profiles, containing a “Perception of aggressive driving Scale (PAD)”. The unifactorial ANOVA test for repeated measures of the General Linear Model (GLM) with α = 0.05 procedure was used for the comparison of mean values. Results show that drivers tend to make higher valuations regarding the aggressive character of the PAD (M = 7.86 SD = 0.05). The situation that most concerned Spanish drivers was “To produce damage to other people with some type of object or weapon” (M = 9.47 SD = 0.05), which does not necessarily correspond to the driving context. Differences in perception were found depending on socio-demographic variables. Women, drivers over 29 years old, low-middle social classes, and drivers who had suffered two accidents, tended to evaluate PAD as more aggressive. These findings suggest that differences in the perception of aggressive behaviors depend on social situations and on the driver’s personal features. Finally, the findings of this research will help road safety researchers understand the concept of aggressiveness under different perspectives, and take into account the existing differences between dangerous and punishable behaviors. Moreover, these outcomes showed the necessity to deepen the research on those behaviors that Spaniards perceive as aggressive, and to develop knowledge on why the perception of aggressiveness changes according to the characteristics of the population, and how this perception is reflected in people’s attitudes and behaviors towards road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Validating the Satisfaction with Travel Scale as a measure of hedonic subjective well-being for commuting in a U.S. city,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.029,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The relationships between transportation and well-being are of increasing interest to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Stakeholders seeking to improve quality of life and traffic safety require valid and reliable ways of gauging the emotional states of travelers. Psychological scales exist for measuring subjective well-being (SWB), but these instruments have rarely been applied to the travel domain. The Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS) is a nine-item measure of travel-related hedonic SWB, capturing core affect (emotions) and cognitive evaluations of overall satisfaction associated with personal transportation. Although the STS has been used in an increasing number of studies, questions remain regarding its structure and validity. This research utilized a survey of 654 commuters in the Portland, Oregon, area to investigate the measurement properties of a slightly modified version of the STS. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a three-factor structure—composed of positive deactivation, positive activation, and cognitive evaluation—that matches some previous results and SWB theory; a model with a single second-order factor also fit the data. Tests of measurement invariance across three travel modes (automobile, transit, and walk/bicycle) found that the STS exhibited configural and perhaps weak factorial invariance; non-motorized commuters tended to have more positive scores. Future research can continue to refine the STS items and wordings, test the scale in various geographic and travel contexts, and examine relationships between SWB and travel behavior.",1369-8478,Not found
Public education messages aimed at smartphone use among young drivers: A mixed methods exploration of their effectiveness,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.027,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The main aim of this study was to concept test nine public education messages; with three different messages targeting each of three salient underlying beliefs in accordance with the Step Approach to Message Design and Testing (SatMDT) framework. The underlying beliefs were: (1) believing you are a good driver would encourage a young driver to monitor/read and respond to social interactive technology while driving; (2) slow-moving traffic would encourage a young driver to monitor/read and respond to social interactive technology while driving; and, (3) friends and peers would approve of a young driver monitoring/reading and responding to communications on their smartphone. Consistent with the SatMDT, the testing aimed to establish which three messages (each targeting a different underlying belief) young drivers reported as being the most effective. A mixed methods approach was utilised to provide an in-depth examination of individuals’ thoughts and feelings about the messages, with such responses assessed via an individual self-report survey and focus group discussions/interviews.

The results of the quantitative and qualitative analyses were integrated to identify three messages that were deemed the most effective, one for each of the three underlying beliefs. Each of these three messages elicited positive emotion and modelled positive behaviour. This research highlights the importance of concept testing message content with the target audience.

Collision risk management of cognitively distracted drivers in a car-following situation,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.011,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Mobile phone distraction has been recognized as an adverse factor that degrades drivers’ performance on road. Although research showed that drivers take various compensatory strategies to minimize the risk in distracted driving, little consensus has been achieved regarding the actual change in collision risk because of compensatory behaviours. This study aims to investigate the impact of mobile phone use and drivers’ compensatory behaviours on the collision risk in a car-following situation. By using a high-fidelity driving simulator, 37 participants completed the simulation experiment in three mobile phone use conditions: no phone (baseline), hands-free and hand-held. Cluster analysis was adopted to classify the final collision risk into different levels. Two logit regression models were developed to examine the relationships between drivers’ characteristics, mobile phone use, collision avoidance performances and their involvement in the collision risk. Results show that compared to no phone and hands-free, drivers using hand-held phone had a longer brake reaction time and also an increased likelihood of being involved in a high risk group. Drivers compensated to reduce the likelihood of safety-critical events through a simultaneous control of car-following speed and distance (i.e. Time-to-collision (TTC)) in distracted condition. Additionally, the results also indicated that female drivers and non-professional drivers were more likely to be involved in high risk group than male drivers and professional drivers. The study provided a systematic method to quantify the impact of mobile phone distraction and drivers’ compensation behaviors on collision risk. The effectiveness of compensatory strategy by controlling TTC also shed light on the development of intelligent transport systems to help distracted drivers avoid safety-critical situations.",1369-8478,Not found
Bicycle helmets and risky behaviour: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.026,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"A long-standing argument against bicycle helmet use is the risk compensation hypothesis, i.e., increased feelings of safety caused by wearing a helmet results in cyclists exhibiting more risky behaviour. However, past studies have found helmet wearing is not associated with risky behaviour, e.g., committing a traffic violation was positively associated with a lower frequency of helmet use. There is a lack of consensus in the research literature regarding bicycle helmet use and the risk compensation hypothesis, although this gap in knowledge was identified in the early 2000s. This is the first study to carry out a systematic review of the literature to assess whether helmet wearing is associated with risky behaviour. Two study authors systematically searched the peer-reviewed literature using five research databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, COMPENDEX, SCOPUS, and WEB OF SCIENCE) and identified 141 unique articles and four articles from other sources. Twenty-three articles met inclusion criteria and their findings were summarised. Eighteen studies found no supportive evidence helmet use was positively associated with risky behaviour, while three studies provided mixed findings, i.e., results for and against the hypothesis. For many of these studies, bicycle helmet wearing was associated with safer cycling behaviour. Only two studies conducted from the same research lab provided evidence to support the risk compensation hypothesis. In sum, this systematic review found little to no support for the hypothesis bicycle helmet use is associated with engaging in risky behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of complex traffic situations on route choice behaviour and driver stress in residential areas,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.023,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"If more reliable traffic information was available, in some situations it would be an option for drivers to go through residential areas to save travel time and avoid standing at traffic lights on main roads. However, on side roads drivers face complex traffic regulations like ‘right before left’ or limited speed zones with slow traffic participants such as bicyclists. Thus, the potential gain in travel time and driving freely is counter-balanced by more complex traffic situations and slower driving. This paper examines the trade-off between these different gains and losses in the context of route choice, while also assessing driver stress and satisfaction with the route. To this end, route choice scenarios were implemented in a driving simulator with a fixed main road and a side road with traffic situations of varying complexity. A total of 60 drivers (29 women) participated and passed 16 scenarios. Preferences for the side road were mainly influenced by the variation in travel time and less by the increasing complexity of the traffic situation. However, driver stress was higher when driving highly complex side roads. Behavioural explanations and transfer to real traffic are discussed as residential areas have special protection in traffic planning.",1369-8478,Not found
Car sharing as a means to raise acceptance of electric vehicles: An empirical study on regime change in automobility,10.1016/j.trf.2018.09.005,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Facing the dangers posed by climate change, the mobility sector needs to undergo a transition towards sustainability. One way of reducing emissions in traffic is to establish the use of electric vehicles. However, given current market shares in Germany, the envisaged regime change from traditional combustion to electric engines seems rather unlikely, triggering the search for new options for dynamic market growth. Recent research has shown consumers’ insufficient knowledge and high uncertainty towards electric vehicle (EV) technology. To overcome such acceptance barriers, this study hypothesises that experience in using car-sharing services—especially EV car sharing—can lead to higher acceptance of EV technology, entailing higher market diffusion. Using the Technology Acceptance Model, a quantitative survey with car-sharing users and non-users was conducted to assess the impact of car-sharing experience on acceptance of EVs. Furthermore, five possible predictors of EV acceptance were tested: mobility, car ownership, urbanity, ecological awareness and technophilia. Car-sharing users rated perceived EV usefulness higher than people without car-sharing experience. They also show a higher intention of buying EVs than non-users. Intention to use EVs in car-sharing schemes is positive amongst both groups. Identifying predictors of EV acceptance, results show that urbanity, ecological awareness, technophilia and car-sharing experience generally increase EV acceptance. Study results indicate that greater EV acceptance could be achieved by addressing highly mobile individuals living in urban areas, especially by having users of traditional car sharing switch to EV car sharing. Promoting EV car-sharing services and pushing a modal shift—in terms of reducing car ownership and raising individual mobility—in urban areas can serve as a policy instrument to push the mobility regime change towards EV technology.",1369-8478,Not found
Cognitive function and driving: Important for young and old alike,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.024,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Younger drivers and older drivers have comparably high ‘crash risks’. Research into individual cognitive domains responsible for this high crash risk has been widely investigated in both groups, however research into the examination of overall cognitive functioning for younger drivers is limited. Furthermore, comparative research between the two groups is needed to determine if the same relationships between overall cognitive functioning and driving performance can account for the comparatively high crash risk for both populations. The overall aim of this research was to investigate and compare this relationship in both older and younger drivers. Fifty-two (64.7% female) first year psychology students aged between 17 and 23 years formed a sample of younger drivers. Thirty-nine (34% female) people aged between 63 and 84 years formed a sample of healthy older drivers. Participants were tested on a series of cognitive tests and undertook a drive on a driving simulator. Relationship were found between cognitive functioning (across the domains of attention, executive function, memory, visuospatial skills and mental status) and driving performance for both younger and older drivers, with the pattern of these relationships predominately comparable between the two cohorts. Furthermore, overall cognitive functioning improved the prediction of driving performance over and above age for speeding ( Δ R2 = 23.5%), lane deviations ( Δ R2 = 18.8%), and overall driving performance ( Δ R2 = 22.9%). The findings from the current study provide evidence that cognitive functioning is related to driving performance in a somewhat similar pattern for both younger and older drivers alike. This study provides evidence that overall cognitive functioning predicts driving performance after controlling for age, suggesting that these skills are important for understanding the crash risk for both population groups. In an investigation of parsimonious models, visuospatial ability (p < .01) and mental status (p < .05) were found to predict speeding, and executive function (p < .05) was found to predict lane deviation over and above age. The parsimonious model found that attention, visuospatial skills, and mental status (all p < .05) were predictive of overall driving performance over and above age. Together, these findings warrants further investigation of the role that cognitive functioning plays in driving performance regardless of age, with a move towards a single model for cognitive function and driving performance for both population groups.",1369-8478,Not found
Who provides feedback to older drivers when driving ability tails off: The role of age stereotypes,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.016,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Research has shown that older drivers often apply effective self-regulatory strategies to cope with decreasing abilities. However, self-serving biases might prevent older drivers from identifying the full scope of critical behaviors, making it difficult for them to determine when they should stop driving. To overcome such self-serving biases, feedback from passengers such as relatives or friends is crucial. Because feedback in critical driving situations is likely to elicit negative emotions and is not easy to provide, we studied factors that might facilitate or impede the presentation of feedback in such situations. In particular, we hypothesized that positive age stereotypes would foster the belief that feedback can lead to behavioral change and would thus increase the likelihood that feedback would be provided. We asked 221 individuals between 40 and 60 years of age in a survey whether they had observed a decline in the driving abilities of an older person and whether they had approached this person to talk to her or him about the decline. 110 participants indicated that they had observed such a decline and filled out a questionnaire designed to test our hypotheses. 65 participants indicated that they had provided feedback, 45 participants stated that they had avoided this. Additionally, both groups were asked about their reasons for giving or avoiding feedback. The results support the role of positive age stereotypes as a determinant of effectiveness beliefs and the giving of feedback in the observed situation. In addition, the results indicate that the effects of effectiveness beliefs on feedback behavior are mediated by the intention to provide feedback and thoughts about implementation strategies.",1369-8478,Not found
Modelling pedestrian crossing choice on Cape Town's freeways: Caught between a rock and a hard place?,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.005,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Pedestrians and freeways are not supposed to coexist in any proximity to each other, yet in Cape Town, South Africa, the Freeway Management System (FMS) has recorded an alarming increase in pedestrian activity on its freeways in recent years, with a similar trend in (fatal) freeway pedestrian crashes. This paper reports on the development of a series of discrete choice models for pedestrian crossing decisions in a highly volatile and vulnerable freeway crossing environment. We hypothesize that freeway pedestrian crossing is driven by personal factors and the perceived risks associated with completing the crossing using a footbridge or (illegally) at-grade. We test this assumption by making use of stated choice and risk perception data collected from (adult) participants intercepted along three Cape Town freeways. Estimating mixed logit and hybrid choice models we look at the role of random heterogeneity and latent risk perception in the choice to cross at-grade or using a footbridge. The model estimates confirm that, as expected, crossing choice is largely influenced by a combination of built environment, vehicular and pedestrian traffic, next to some socio-demographic factors, but also risk perception. The study brings to light the seemingly opposite effect of some of the factors on risk perception and crossing choice. We also show that risk perception really only influences crossing choice in terms of the perception of at-grade crossing risk, where the impact is however non-trivial. Finally, we look at the implied relative sensitivities of the choice attributes within and between the crossing alternatives, as well between the three estimated models, amongst others demonstrating the power of the hybrid choice model over the other two. The results of the study can inform opportunities to counter the upward trend of fatalities and provide suggestions for policy-making that would lead to improved freeway crossing safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Incorporation of coping planning into the behavior change model that accounts for implementation intention,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.025,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Voluntary travel behavior change has been increasingly paid attention for promoting sustainable transportation. However, in the psychological process underlying the foundation of travel behavior change programs, the roles of volitional phase and its constructs have not been fully clarified. This research therefore incorporated coping planning, in addition to implementation intention, as two volitional constructs, to model the volitional phase of travel behavior change, and to investigate how the volitional constructs mediate between behavioral intention and behavior change. The data were collected from citizens in Taipei City, Taiwan, by two questionnaires across a one-month period. The main results suggested that implementation intention mediated the effect of behavioral intention on car use change only through the mediation of coping planning; that coping planning mediated between behavioral intention and car use change; and that the effectiveness of personalized travel plans in behavior change could be attributed to the volitional constructs. Based on the findings, the behavior change model incorporating coping planning could account for the effectiveness of implementation intention in travel behavior. Further implications of implementation intention and coping planning, and potential extension of behavior change process were discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
A conceptual model for persuasive in-vehicle technology to influence tactical level driver behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.004,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Persuasive in-vehicle systems aim to intuitively influence the attitudes and/or behaviour of a driver (i.e. without forcing them). However, the challenge in using these systems in a driving setting, is to maximise the persuasive effect without infringing upon the driver’s safety. This paper proposes a conceptual model for driver persuasion at the tactical level (i.e., driver manoeuvring level, such as lane-changing and car-following). The main focus of the conceptual model is to describe how to safely persuade a driver to change his or her behaviour, and how persuasive systems may affect driver behaviour. First, existing conceptual and theoretical models that describe behaviour are discussed, along with their applicability to the driving task. Next, we investigate the persuasive methods used with a focus on the traffic domain. Based on this we develop a conceptual model that incorporates behavioural theories and persuasive methods, and which describes how effective and safe driver persuasion functions. Finally, we apply the model to a case study of a lane-specific advice system that aims to reduce travel time delay and traffic congestion by advising some drivers to change lanes in order to achieve a better distribution of traffic over the motorway lanes.",1369-8478,Not found
Increasing mobility for older travellers through engagement with technology,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.019,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The number of older people, especially those over 85, is set to increase right across the developed world, and with it their needs for mobility and transport in societies with growing dependence on technology. Whilst technology has the potential to deliver significant benefits to older people, enabling greater mobility and independence, it may also leave them unable or unwilling to engage with it, risking loss of independence. The aims of this paper are to consider what needs to change to enable greater numbers of older travellers to access transport technologies and what are the key barriers to engaging with new and emerging technologies for older people. Thus, the paper looks to extend the knowledge of how older people engage with technology in relation to their mobility and travelling. A thematic content analysis of interviews with 32 older people and 4 experts yielded findings relating to technology use, examples of good design, and characteristics of older people’s interactions with technology.

Participants were professional drivers who drove through three scenarios in a truck simulator. Sensation seeking and hedonistic present time perspective were associated with a higher mean speed. Conscientiousness correlated with a lower mean speed. Extraversion and sensation seeking were associated with driving more on the right side of the lane. Relationships identified in previous research on automobile drivers were confirmed for professional truck drivers according to (1) higher speed/higher risky behavior and (2) higher sensation seeking, greater present time perspective, and lower conscientiousness.",1369-8478,Not found
Towards guidelines and verification methods for automated vehicle HMIs,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.012,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"In most levels of vehicle automation, drivers will not be merely occupants or passengers of automated vehicles. Especially in lower levels of automation, where the driver is still required to serve as a fallback level (SAE L3) or even as a supervisor (SAE L2), there is a need to communicate relevant system states (e.g., that the automated driving system works reliably or that there is a need for manual intervention) via the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). However, there are currently no agreed-upon guidelines that apply specifically to HMIs for automated driving. In this paper, we summarize design recommendations for visual-auditory and visual-vibrotactile HMIs derived from empirical research, applicable standards and design guidelines pertaining to in-vehicle interfaces. On this basis, we derive an initial set of principles and criteria for guiding the development and design of automated vehicle HMIs. A heuristic evaluation methodology consisting of an itemized checklist evaluation that can be used to verify that basic HMI requirements formulated in the guidelines are met is also presented. The heuristic evaluation involves an inspection of the HMI during typical use cases, judging their compliance with the proposed guidelines and documentation of identified instances of non-compliance. Taken together, the combination of the proposed guidelines and the heuristic evaluation methodology form the basis for both design and validation recommendations of automated vehicle HMIs, that can serve the industry in the important evolution of automation within vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
A strategic driving maneuver that predicts on-road outcomes in adults with multiple sclerosis,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.014,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Objective The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) To compare and determine the differences in higher-order cognitive functions and driving errors underlying the strategic driving maneuver between persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) who pass versus fail the University of Western Ontario (UWO) on-road assessment; (2) To quantify the bivariate correlational relationships between higher-order cognitive functions and driving errors of strategic driving maneuvers; and (3) To determine the predictive validity of higher-order cognitive functions and driving errors on pass versus fail outcomes. Methods This prospective study included licensed drivers (N = 35; mean age = 50 years) with either relapsing-remitting or progressive MS, and cognitive impairment in processing speed and at least one of memory or executive function, but low physical disability. Participants completed the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS and Useful Field of View™ before the UWO on-road assessment. The on-road assessment incorporated a strategic driving maneuver that required higher-order cognitive functions (i.e., executive function) to assess, initiate, plan, reason, decide, and problem-solve, to select a route from various alternatives and reach a goal-directed destination. The on-road assessment included pass versus fail outcomes. The strategic driving maneuver included the number and total of seven types of driving errors as outcomes. Results Seven of thirty-five participants failed the on-road assessment. No significant differences existed on clinical assessment measures between PwMS who passed versus failed. When compared to PwMS who passed the on-road assessment, PwMS who failed made significantly more lane maintenance (mean = 1.1 versus 0.3, p = .02), and speed regulation errors (mean = 0.7 versus 0.04, p = .03) in the strategic driving maneuver. Poorer delayed visuospatial recall moderately correlated with a higher number of speed regulation errors (ρ = −0.37, p = .03). Final regression models included two univariate models. The first model included lane maintenance errors (OR = 0.18, p = .009, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.66]), and the second model included speed regulation errors (OR = 0.04, CI = [0.003, 0.44]), as sole predictors of pass versus fail outcomes in PwMS. An optimal cut-point of one or more lane maintenance errors validly predicted 78 percent (p = .02) of pass versus fail outcomes, with 71 percent sensitivity, 79 percent specificity, and 23 percent misclassification rate. An optimal cut-point of one or more speed regulation errors validly predicted 77 percent (p = .03) of pass versus fail outcomes, with 57 percent sensitivity, 96 percent specificity, and 11 percent misclassification rate. Conclusions The strategic driving maneuver can validly predict 77–78 percent of pass versus fail outcomes in PwMS, through lane maintenance or speed regulation errors. Either driving error may supplement on-road outcomes to help determine pass versus fail outcomes in PwMS.",1369-8478,Not found
Analyzing dilemma driver behavior at signalized intersection under mixed traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.010,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Intersections are important node points in the road network, ensuring safe and efficient way of maneuvering the traffic. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) reported in year 2016 that the highest number of road accidents in India happened at intersections accounting for nearly thirty seven percent (37%) of the total crashes that took place. Even though traffic signals are considered to be the most effective way of controlling the traffic, more than 4300 lost their lives at signalized intersections in India. One of the main contributing factor in traffic signal related crashes is the presence of dilemma zone, where a driver becomes indecisive whether to pass or stop at the intersection on the yellow onset. Significant amount of research has been done on the dilemma driver behavior under homogeneous traffic conditions, however little or no research has been found on mixed traffic conditions, where vehicles do vary in physical and dynamic characteristics. The main motive of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the driver behavior in dilemma zone at signalized approaches in India under mixed traffic conditions. Field data was collected at five signalized approaches using video capturing technique to investigate the driver behavior. Frame by frame manual extraction resulted in 1054 driver responses at the yellow onset and binary logistic regression model is developed to represent the observed behavior. Distance from stop line, vehicle’s approach speed and type of intersection were found to be important factors in drivers stop/go decisions. Vehicle type, which is a characteristic of mixed traffic conditions is found to have a significant impact on the driver’s decision at the onset of yellow. The insights from this study findings can be used to enhance the safety and performance of signalized intersections in developing countries.",1369-8478,Not found
Impact of health differences and longitudinal changes on deceleration driving patterns in older adult drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.006,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Naturalistic in-car driving informatics provides opportunities to identify links between driving behaviours and cognitive and physical health status. The coefficient of variation was used to evaluate deceleration event variability (1) for differences between 171 older adult drivers grouped based on physical and cognitive scores and (2) for changes that aligned with longitudinal health changes in 62 older adult drivers. Differences in older adult physical and cognitive health status were related to deceleration event variability. Greater deceleration event variability was identified in individuals with better cognitive health, with two exceptions. There were also deceleration events subsets where individuals with poorer physical health status exhibited greater variability in deceleration patterns than those with better health status. CoV-measured deceleration event variability did significantly decrease for individuals with longitudinal cognitive health decline and for individuals with longitudinal physical health declines (velocity signal only) for decelerations subsets and CoV increased for individuals with longitudinal physical health decline for acceleration and jerk signals for event deceleration subsets. These findings suggest that worse cognitive health may limit older adult driver’s ability to adapt deceleration patterns when needed, resulting in lower CoV-measured variability. However, particularly in situations that require less adaptation to deceleration patterns, worse physical health may induce unnecessary variability during deceleration events. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether differences in variability relate to successful braking collision avoidance behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found
Impacts of differentiated per-lane speed limit on lane changing behaviour: A driving simulator-based study,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.018,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Inappropriate lane changing behaviour increases a driver’s risk of being involved in a crash and the injury severity levels. It is hypothesized in this study that differentiated per-lane speed limit freeways could reduce inappropriate lane changing behaviours. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to investigate drivers’ lane changing behaviour and the corresponding workload levels when different speed limit values are assigned to different lanes. Participants (N = 36) experienced three different test scenarios with different speed limit configurations. Lane changing behaviours are compared in regards to five measures describing lane changing behaviour. Meanwhile, task workload indexes were developed to evaluate key aspects of drivers’ subjective experience of the test. The results reveal that the speed limit configurations have a considerable impact on lane changing behaviour as well as on the corresponding driving workload levels. This applies especially to the scenario with both different maximum and minimum speed limits for adjacent lanes, with drivers behaving differently than they did in other situations. Lane changes were found to be less frequent and have shorter durations, and drivers tended to avoid the dangerous behaviour of “rolling on the lane edge”, therefore these compensatory safety-prone driving strategies suggest an enhanced driving safety level in association with the differentiated per-lane speed limit scenarios. The findings could provide important references for traffic management of freeways.",1369-8478,Not found
Company employees as experimental participants in traffic safety research: Prevalence and implications,10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.008,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The use of company employees as experimental participants when testing products, technology or paradigms developed by the same company raises questions about bias in results and research ethics. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of studies authored by car company researchers with car company employees as participants, to assess the risk of bias in such studies, to investigate journal editors’ opinions in the field of traffic safety regarding these procedures, and to offer a general discussion about ethical and methodological implications. Three types of data were collected. We (i) examined guidelines and recommendations for authors in eleven selected peer-reviewed journals in the area of traffic safety; (ii) surveyed editors of these journals; and (iii) reviewed articles authored by researchers from a selected group of car manufacturers and published in these journals during 2011–2015. Guidelines and recommendations for authors in the included journals did not mention whether and under what circumstances company employees can be research participants, nor did publishers’ general guidelines.

"Effects of non-driving-related-task modality and road geometry on eye movements, lane-keeping performance, and workload while driving",10.1016/j.trf.2018.10.015,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Driving on horizontal, curved roads requires much research attention because it tends to result in more accidents compared to driving on straight roads. Several studies have found that non-driving-related-task (or secondary-task) sensory modality and horizontal-road geometry (e.g., curvature radius and curve direction) are major factors that affect driving performance and safety on horizontal curves. However, few studies have examined the combined effects of these factors. This paper reports a driving simulation study of the impacts of non-driving-related-task modality (4 levels), road curvature radius (4 levels), and curve direction (2 levels) on driver behaviour. Eye movements, lane-keeping performance, and subjective workload of 24 participants were measured. The results showed that drivers performing non-driving-related tasks using visual stimuli or manual responses on curved roads fixated less frequently and with shorter durations on the road and showed poorer lane-keeping performance compared to other modalities. In addition, when driving on sharper curves with a non-driving-related task, drivers looked at the road more frequently and longer, but their lane-keeping performance was poorer (i.e., higher standard deviations of lane position and of steering wheel angle). Participants reported higher visual demand when performing visual-speech types of tasks compared to auditory-manual types of tasks. The practical implications for driving safety on horizontal, curved roads are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Which cognitive training intervention can improve young drivers’ speed management on the road?,10.1016/j.trf.2018.09.025,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The current study examined the effectiveness of two cognitive based training methods, namely Feedback and Self-explanation in improving young drivers' speed management behaviour in the operational environment. Seventy-five participants, all provisional licence holders under the age of 25 years completed three on-road drives in an instrumented vehicle. In the first drive (baseline), participants randomly assigned to the Auditory Alert Feedback group were provided an auditory alert when they exceeded the posted speed limit. In the Combined Feedback group, participants following the baseline drive were provided feedback about the number of times they exceeded the speed limit, the financial penalties associated with such behaviour, and the safety implications. Participants in the Self-explanation group were asked to explain to themselves their performance, in terms of speed management following the baseline drive. Participants randomly assigned to the Control group experienced no such intervention. The results revealed in the test drive immediately after the baseline drive, and one week post baseline test drive, combined feedback was most effective in reducing the average speed and percentage of time speeding in both the low-speed (50 km/h) and high-speed (80 km/h) zones. Self-explanation with or without combined feedback produced better speed management than control and auditory alert feedback, but was found to be less effective than the combined feedback. These findings provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of cognitive-based training programmes such as Feedback and Self-explanation in improving young drivers' speed management behaviour.

Participants completed a questionnaire measuring past distracted driving behaviors and traditional TPB variables (intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control), as well as self-efficacy and moral norms. Texting and driving was found to be a very prevalent behavior, with 83.5% and 76.6% of participants reporting reading or writing a text message while driving in the last 30 days, respectively. Replicating previous studies, regression analyses found that the traditional TPB variables explained a significant proportion of the variance in intentions to text and drive. However, the addition of past behavior, self-efficacy, and moral norms into the model reduced the predictive strength of the traditional TPB variables while increasing the amount of explained variance. The surprising strength of past behavior, self-efficacy, and moral norms suggests that future campaigns and interventions to reduce distracted driving among young adults ought to focus on crafting messages that disrupt the influence of past behavior on future intentions, and concentrate on moral and self-effectual aspects of the behavior.",1369-8478,Not found

Tactical choices faced by bicyclists at signalised intersections include whether to use the bicycle lane, roadway or sidewalk, to stop at or violate a red traffic signal, to ride with or against the mandatory direction of travel and the method of executing a left turn. The outcome of these choices has a direct impact on traffic safety and efficiency at intersections. In this paper, revealed choice data from 4710 bicyclists at four intersections in Munich, Germany are used to estimate binomial and multinomial logistic regression models to predict tactical choice outcomes. Optimal predictor sets are selected from the main and two-way interaction effects of 43 independent variables describing the situation, strategic behaviour and prior tactical choices of bicyclists using recursive feature elimination. A simplified model is estimated using the statistically significant variables of the optimal predictor set. The prediction power of the resulting regression model is assessed using k-fold cross validation. The models to predict response to a red signal and the type of left-hand turn exhibit high predictive power while the prediction of infrastructure selection and the direction of travel proves to be difficult.",1369-8478,Not found

Therefore, several studies have been conducted to investigate driverś behavior, supported by controlled experiments (e.g. naturalistic and driving simulator studies). However, due to emerging technologies, new study methods can be developed to complement existing studies. In this study, retrospective data gathered from a driver monitoring system (DMS), which monitored 70 professional drivers from different companies, was used to investigate the effect of journey characteristics on the number of alerts due to either distraction or drowsiness. Two separate negative binomial models were developed, including explanatory variables describing the continuous driving time (sub-journey time), the journey time (a set of sub-journeys), the number of breaks and the breaking duration time. Dummy variables were also included. Interesting results were observed such as increasing continuous driving time, the number of distraction and drowsiness alerts increase too. In contrast, the journey time has the opposite effect decreasing the number of alerts. In the case of distraction alerts, stopping the vehicle during the journey (break) was not statistically significant and the increase in the breaking duration time showed an unexpected effect as the number of alerts increased. This was not the case of drowsiness alerts in which the frequency of breaks and the breaking duration time decreases the alerts. The companies (for which the drivers work) affect the alert frequency differently.

Investigating the effect of urgency and modality of pedestrian alert warnings on driver acceptance and performance,10.1016/j.trf.2018.09.028,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Active safety systems have the potential to reduce the risk to pedestrians by warning the driver and/or taking evasive action to reduce the effects of or avoid a collision. However, current systems are limited in the range of scenarios they can address using primary control interventions, and this arguably places more emphasis in some situations on warning the driver so that they can take appropriate action in response to pedestrian hazards. In a counterbalanced experimental design, we varied urgency (‘when’) based on the time-to-collision (TTC) at which the warning was presented (with associated false-positive alarms, but no false negatives, or ‘misses’), and modality (‘how’) by presenting warnings using audio-only and audio combined with visual alerts presented on a HUD. Results from 24 experienced drivers, who negotiated an urban scenario during twelve 6.0-min drives in a medium-fidelity driving simulator, showed that all warnings were generally rated ‘positively’ (using recognised subjective ‘acceptance’ scales), although acceptance was lower when warnings were delivered at the shortest (2.0 s) TTC. In addition, drivers indicated higher confidence in combined audio and visual warnings in all situations. Performance (based on safety margins associated with critical events) varied significantly between warning onset times, with drivers first fixating their gaze on the hazard, taking their foot off the accelerator, applying their foot on the brake, and ultimately bringing the car to a stop further from the pedestrian when warnings were presented at the longest (5.0 s) TTC. In addition, drivers applied the brake further from the pedestrian when combined audio and HUD warnings were provided (compared to audio-only), but only at 5.0 s TTC. Overall, the study indicates a greater margin of safety associated with the provision of earlier warnings, with no apparent detriment to acceptance, despite relatively high false alarm rates at longer TTCs. Also, that drivers feel more confident with a warning system present, especially when it incorporates auditory and visual elements, even though the visual cue does not necessarily improve hazard localisation or driving performance beyond the advantages offered by auditory alerts alone. Findings are discussed in the context of the design, evaluation and acceptance of active safety systems.",1369-8478,Not found

A web-survey is used to collect data from 205 conventional car drivers (76.5% male) living in different parts of Norway. A regression analysis is conducted to investigate the predictive role of the measured constructs for the intention to buy a BEV. Results show that environmental-economic attributes of BEVs, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control are positively related to the intention. Meanwhile, being male is negatively related to the intention. Neither perceived accident risk nor the knowledge about BEVs has a direct effect on the intention. However, further mediation analysis shows that both perceived accident risk and knowledge have an indirect effect on the intention through the perceived attributes of BEVs. Implications of the results for interventions aiming to increase BEV adoption are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Multilevel modeling of gap-selection behaviors: Effects of vehicle arrival time and personal walking time projection abilities in mixed traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2018.09.010,60,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Previous studies have attributed the relatively high risk of elderly pedestrians to their declining abilities, particularly the ability to estimate their own walking time and time-to-arrival of oncoming vehicles. However, how these two abilities affect street-crossing safety in mixed traffic conditions remains unclear. This study conducted a simulation study using filmed real-life traffic to investigate this issue. Repeated measures of gap-selection decision and safety outcomes among 82 adults (42 elderly participants aged 60 years or older and 40 aged between 20 and 45 years) were collected. Two sets of scenarios were developed: one car–one lane simple-flow tasks and multiple vehicle–one lane complex-flow tasks. The analysis results demonstrated that in simple- and complex-flow tasks these two abilities are both critical to gap-selection safety; however, pedestrians’ reliance on walking-time projection is more consistent than is their reliance on TTA projection when making gap-selection decisions. Although young pedestrians are safer on average than elderly pedestrians, how they respond to oncoming vehicles is similar; in particular, both young and elderly pedestrians tend to select longer gaps even when oncoming vehicles are moving quickly. The responses of the elderly pedestrians were relatively varied and skewed toward being unsafe, and thus their on-average gap-selection performance was inferior to that of the young pedestrians. The benefit of offering countdowns to oncoming vehicle arrivals, as a means of enhancing gap-selection safety, is appropriate when traffic flow is simple but relatively less so in complex-flow scenarios, indicating the importance of considering information overload in countermeasure design.",1369-8478,Not found

An innovative real-time test setup for ADAS's based on vehicle cameras,10.1016/j.trf.2018.05.018,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The development of Active Safety Systems in Automotive, i.e. functions aimed to reduce the probability of accidents rather than reducing their damages, is represented by Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS’s). This paper aims to describe an innovative, efficient, safe and economical setup to perform functional tests on ADAS’s whose functions are based on cameras such as Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). ADAS’s are usually distributed between many Electronics Control Units (ECUs). The system consists of a static Vehicle Test Bench with the real wiring harness and ECUs of the car, connected with a dynamic Hardware in The Loop (HIL) simulator. The HIL simulator is a merger of different ones usually used to test the ECUs on the car, e.g. the Engine Control Module (ECM), the Brake System Module (BSM), the Transmission Control Module (TCM) (for automatic transmission cars), by means of proper simulation models (vehicle dynamic, engine, transmission models). A monitor showing the vehicle scenario to the camera of the car and a proper target emulator system for the radar, whose variable are generated by the vehicle dynamic model, complete the system.

"A method to assess individualized driver models: Descriptiveness, identifiability and realism",10.1016/j.trf.2018.02.014,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This paper introduces a systematic assessment method which quantitatively assesses computational driver steering models with respect to their suitability for online identification of individual driver steering behaviour. This methodology is based on three criteria: (1) descriptiveness, the model’s ability to capture different types of steering behaviour, (2) identifiability, the ability of the model for unique mapping between a steering behaviour and a parameter combination, and (3) realism, the parameter span resulting in realistic steering behaviour. The utility of the introduced assessment method is shown by analysing and comparing two driver models from literature which are based on the same high-level concept. Both models assume proportional control on a predicted lateral position, however one uses a linear prediction for lateral position and the other uses a nonlinear prediction. The proposed assessment method distinguishes between the performance of the models by showing that the nonlinear model outperforms the linear model in terms of descriptiveness (66% compared to 33% of the linear model), better inherent identifiability for steering angle (3.8 compared to 7.5), better inherent identifiability for lateral position (0.01 compared to 0.5), better curve-cutting experimental identifiability and a 2.72 times larger realistic parameter span allowing for more flexibility for parameter selection. This quantitative assessment method has successfully reflected the effect of merely altering the way the lateral position is predicted in two driver models. Thereby, this method can be used to give a fair assessment by giving a model an absolute classification that also allows for quantitative comparison with many more driver models.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver situation awareness – Investigating the effect of passenger experience,10.1016/j.trf.2017.12.007,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Passengers have the opportunity to influence the driver’s situation awareness and promote safer performance. This paper reports an investigation into the influence of passengers on driver situation awareness. 40 two-person teams performed an interactive verbal task, while one team member also undertook a simulated driving task. Half of the drivers were paired with driving-experienced passengers; the others took part with driving-novice passengers. Dependent variables were Verbal Response Time (conversation modulation) and Situation Awareness. Results indicated that driving-novice passengers engaged in relatively more conversation than the driving-experienced passengers. Significant differences were found for total Situational Awareness between driving-experienced and driving-novice groups. Further analysis suggested that both experienced drivers and passengers had significantly better Situational Awareness of perceptual factors than driving-novices. Further, Verbal Response Times were found to be significantly predictive of Situational Awareness. Findings provide some support for the notion that passengers may have a positive effect on driver’s attention in spite of their verbal interactions.",1369-8478,Not found
Research on an innovative multifunction steering wheel for individuals with reduced mobility,10.1016/j.trf.2018.01.013,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This article presents the results of an experimental comparative study assessing the functionality of a prototype for a new interface for driving electric vehicles equipped with a steer-by-wire system. The interface was developed under the umbrella of the Eco-Mobility project, co-financed by European funds. Unlike classical steering solutions, the prototype interface described in this report is characterized by an absence of foot controls. Main control is achieved via a multifunctional steering wheel using only the upper limbs, which makes it accessible to drivers with varying degrees of mobility. The steer-by-wire system provides the opportunity to alter the sensitivity of the steering ratio, defined as the ratio of the maximum angle of rotation of the steering wheel to the maximum steering angle of the front wheels. Studies were performed in a dynamic 3D simulator. The goal of these studies was to assess the quality of driving with both a classic and the multifunctional steering wheel (with two steering ratio variants). Simulator studies used a proprietary methodology that enabled assessment of the interface’s functionality. The assessment was made using quality indicators developed for the purpose of quantifying the correctness of test performance.

Effects of roadside distractors on performance of drivers with and without attention deficit tendencies,10.1016/j.trf.2018.02.013,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"As roadway systems become more complex, with increased visual clutter, new automation technologies, and mixed modes of transportation, it is increasingly important to understand the effects of roadside distractors on driver performance. While driver distraction negatively impacts driver performance and crash rates for all drivers, it is especially important for vulnerable road users who may have an increased risk of distraction. This research was aimed at identifying the influence of roadside distractors on the performance of drivers with and without attention deficit tendencies, and it used a driving simulator to obtain performance metrics in the vicinity of distractors. Overall, the study found that roadside events have statistically significant effects on variability of lane position and speed, and drivers with attention deficit tendencies displayed more lane position variability than control group drivers for all roadway segments examined. Of the distractors tested, billboards and work zones were shown to have the most significant impacts on driver inattention, as evidenced by decreased detection time margins and error rates, respectively. This study is one of the first to examine the effects of roadside distractors on drivers with and without attention deficit disorders, and the results lend insight to the effects that external distractions can have on driver performance.",1369-8478,Not found
Multi-player online simulated driving game to improve hazard perception,10.1016/j.trf.2018.02.015,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Young and inexperienced drivers are disproportionately involved in all car crashes. Although programs such as graduated driver licensing have reduced the fatality rates, they still remain unacceptably high for novice drivers as compared to older and experienced drivers. One of the most critical skills related to accident avoidance is the detection, recognition and reaction to traffic hazards, called hazard perception. There have been numerous attempts to improve novice drivers’ hazard perception skills through computer-based simulation programs. However, none of them had multi-user capability incorporating video commentaries by experts adapted to drivers’ mistakes except for a game-based, multi-user, online, simulated training (GMOST) program (Arslanyilmaz, Stillman, and Costello, 2014) developed to examine the effect of GMOST on hazard perception skills. In this pilot study, sample size was too small and duration of the experiment was too short for a significant result (Arslanyilmaz et al., 2014). In addition, the effects of video commentaries were not investigated. The first objective of this study is to showcase an improved version of GMOST. The second objective is to measure the effectiveness GMOST has on young drivers’ hazard perception skills, specifically on their ability to detect and respond to hazards as well as scanning the roads for potential hazards. The third objective is to examine the effects of video commentaries on hazard perception skills.

Predictive shared steering control for driver override in automated driving: A simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2017.12.005,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Recent research efforts on automated driving reveal the need to address driver’s interaction with vehicle automation. This paper focuses on the design of an override mode for automated driving systems, a topic little studied in literature. In this paper, a shared control framework for driver’s override of automatic steering control is proposed. This framework formulates the control transfer between the driver and the system as a constrained optimization problem which is solved online by a model predictive controller. At a higher level in the framework, the system detects driver’s lane-change intention so that the low-level controller can actively assist the driver in a lane-change maneuver. The whole framework was evaluated in a user test based on a driving simulator. The test results show that the proposed shared control framework has the advantage of allowing the driver to regain control with ease while ensuring the smoothness of control transition.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of individual simulator experiences on usability and driving behavior in a moving base driving simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2018.01.004,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Individual reactions to driving simulators are subject to considerable interindividual differences. This includes the expression of motion sickness-like symptoms, simulator sickness (SS), and the subjective feeling of being in the virtual environment, spatial presence (SP). These differences can decrease the statistical power of simulator studies, i.e., lower the probability of finding actual existing effects. The study at hand explored the impact of SS and SP on usability and mean speed in driving simulations using different navigation systems. SS and SP were further measured using both post-exposure questionnaires and repeated online measurements. A mixed models analysis of data from 57 drivers could establish an effect of differing navigation systems on usability and mean speed. The further inclusion of SS and SP in the analysis of these effects was beneficial. SP also mediated an indirect effect of navigation systems on usability. Repeated online measurements did not offer an advantage compared to questionnaires for the prediction of usability. However, for mean speed, they improved predictions compared to questionnaires for both SP and SS. The study highlights the benefits of assessing individual reactions to simulators and illustrates that repeated online measures are more suitable than post-exposure questionnaires for the study of continuous responses.",1369-8478,Not found
Analysis of driving behavior at expressway toll plazas,10.1016/j.trf.2017.12.008,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Drivers are required to make many rapid decisions at expressway toll plazas, which could result in drivers’ confusion, speed variation, and sudden lane change maneuvers. Thus, toll plazas are considered one of the most dangerous segments on expressways. Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies have explored the factors that affect driving behavior and safety at toll plazas. This study assessed driving behavior at a section, including a hybrid toll plaza, on one of the main expressways in Central Florida using a driving simulator. The details of the section and the plaza were accurately replicated in the simulator. Overall, 72 participants were recruited and each driver performed three different scenarios out of a total of 24 scenarios. Subsequently, four behavioral variables were extracted from the experimental data (i.e., average speed, speed variation, standard deviation of lane deviation, and standard deviation of acceleration) to explore risky driving behaviors with various paths, signs, pavement markings, segment lengths, and traffic conditions. In addition, the effects of drivers’ individual characteristics on driving behavior were investigated. A series of linear mixed models with random effects to account for multiple observations from the same participant were developed to reveal the contributing factors for driving behavior at toll plazas. The results uncovered that drivers experiencing the open road tolling (ORT) have safer driving behavior than those who use the tollbooth. Also, providing dynamic message sign (DMS) on the ramp before the toll plaza has a significant effect on reducing sudden lane change maneuvers. Adjustment of the locations of overhead signs was also recommended in this study. Moreover, the existence of arrow pavement marking before and after the toll plaza is important for reducing unsafe driving behavior before and after the toll plaza.",1369-8478,Not found

We examined the contribution of the guidance system to teach procedural skills compared with traditional teaching methods such as video instruction.

Defining the kinematic requirements for a theoretical driving simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2017.11.006,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"In motion-base driving simulators, the simulator kinematic design is a critical factor for achieving a desired simulation fidelity. This paper presents a method to derive kinematic requirements that a theoretical simulator should meet to best replicate reference maneuvers within a predefined workspace. This method uses a Motion Cueing Algorithm based on Model Predictive Control to calculate the optimal motion of the theoretical simulator. Then, extreme positions, velocities and accelerations of the theoretical simulator are used to derive kinematic requirements. The method was applied to two maneuvers previously recorded in a real car. The quality of the resulting simulator motion and kinematic requirements were evaluated for different workspaces. Results showed that the theoretical simulator was able to replicate the two maneuvers with high quality when the lateral and longitudinal ranges were at least 10 m. Interestingly, there was no evidence that a large vertical range improved the quality of the replicated motion. Furthermore, large yaw range, velocity and acceleration were needed for replicating the recorded maneuvers. These results can help to choose the kinematic characteristics of a real driving simulator.",1369-8478,Not found
Tires and vertical dynamics of wheeled mobile driving simulators,10.1016/j.trf.2017.09.009,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Wheeled Mobile Driving Simulators (WMDS) promise a high potential for urban traffic simulation. The tires generate the accelerations of WMDS and therefore are a key component of this simulator type. Hence, the choice of a proper tire concept is of high importance. Solid tires with compact dimensions and a high vertical stiffness are a possible alternative approach to conventional pneumatic tires. To assess the application potential of solid tires their characteristics are identified. The results show that high slip values and slip angles are necessary to reach the maximum friction coefficient of about 0.8 while their correlation is highly nonlinear. With the identified tire properties, the impact of the tires on energy consumption and motion control performance of WMDS is investigated. The solid tires show an increased energy consumption of about 4% compared to pneumatic tires in representative urban driving cycle simulations. Solid tires with their nonlinear characteristics lead to five times higher lateral acceleration errors in relation to pneumatic tires at accelerations of 5m/s2 during a horizontal eight maneuver. The vertical properties of both tires were identified to be not sufficient for the application of a WMDS solely sprung by tires on uneven grounds of common quality.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver behaviour validity in driving simulators – Analysis of the moment of initiation of braking at urban intersections,10.1016/j.trf.2017.09.008,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Introduction: The majority of accidents involving personal injury occur in urban intersections. As human error is the primary cause of these accidents, it seems reasonable to support drivers by intersection assistants. Studies to evaluate such systems are usually performed in driving simulators. However, this implies driver behaviour validity, which cannot always be taken for granted due to the artificial nature of simulated environments. The paper pays special attention to the validity of braking behaviour in urban intersections. In particular, the effect of the test scenario and selected driving simulator design parameters is considered. Method: The Time to Intersection (TTI) time interval between field and simulator study was evaluated at five simple urban intersections. Results: Independently of the type of intersection and the parameter configuration of the simulator, subjects initiated braking in preparation for a turning manoeuvre significantly earlier in the field than in the driving simulator. In particular, the results of both tests differed more at intersections where the driver did not have right of way than at intersections with other layouts, confirming the impact of the test scenario. Some differences were also found when the driving simulator parameter set was varied. Conclusions: The braking behaviour near urban intersections differs between real and simulated experimental environments. From these results, we conclude that caution is required when designing intersection assistance systems based solely on the braking behaviour of subjects in simulated environments. The test scenario and the design parameters must be considered as factors which influence the results. Practical applications: Depending on the current traffic situation and interactions, multiple different kinds of accident can occur at the considered types of intersection, meaning that closely investigating the driver behaviour validity at these junctions is highly important for further intersection assistance systems. Validity of TTI is for example important when determining the best choice of warning interval for a turning assistance system.",1369-8478,Not found
Creating headlight glare in a driving simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2017.10.006,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The glare of bright headlights from oncoming vehicles is a common challenge experienced by drivers at night. Glare can produce discomfort, which may cause drivers to squint or avert their gaze, and can also cause disability in terms of directly disrupting visual perception. The consequences of glare on measures of driving performance specifically are not well described, partially due to safety issues in attempting to evaluate glare effects during on-road driving. Driving simulators, however, provide a particularly useful interface through which to investigate these effects in a safe and systematic manner. That said, very few simulators include integrated glare effects, likely because these effects simply are not achievable with conventional display systems. Therefore, we developed a novel glare simulator that is able to reproduce the effect of bright headlights from oncoming traffic using a novel hybrid display system, combining traditional projectors with panels of high intensity light emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted on a robotic actuator. Each LED on these panels can be independently modulated, allowing the grid to present lights of various sizes and intensities in order to simulate oncoming vehicle headlights over a broad range of distances. In this paper the system design and the mapping to synchronize the two display systems are described, and the resultant effects are illustrated. Overall, glare is a common, yet problematic challenge during driving, therefore understanding precisely how this affects driving performance across different driver populations is of high importance.",1369-8478,Not found

Simulators allow subjective evaluations in early phases of the development process and enable reproducible and controlled experiments with the exact same conditions for test drivers. To investigate on this subject, a study with 31 participants was conducted at the Porsche dynamic driving simulator. The research focusses on the systematic evaluation of the minimum perceptible difference in longitudinal acceleration profiles in a dynamic driving simulator with the goal to establish the simulator as a design tool for powertrain modifications. The just noticeable difference (JND) of the absolute acceleration level and the acceleration gradient is an important indicator, whether a mid-size driving simulator can be used to evaluate the impact of different engine configurations on the drivability of passenger cars. The results were analyzed statistically and show that the participants could detect differences of 4.25% in the absolute level and 13.89% in the gradient.

The hybrid data representation of detailed digital maps and physical automotive sensors provides an extended view of the ego-vehicle environment and thereby facilitates improved inferences and more competent decision-making. It has therefore been instrumental in the ongoing development of predictive driving features, e.g. fuel-efficient driving, traffic sign recognition and highway-pilot. The presented approach utilises a closed-loop Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) co-simulation framework to evaluate the performance of the decision level fusion algorithms. The method contains both the structural design and resource-efficient integration into the HiL test bench in the example of traffic sign recognition. In reality, discrepancy between visual and map data is omnipresent due to map errors, old map data or optical detection failure. Through fault injection, defined inconsistencies can be produced within the HiL simulation environment. Amongst others, the fault injection covers the placement and value of traffic signs. These failures can be used for robustness testing of the fusion algorithms. Subsequently, a method for correlation analysis between field observations and synthetic simulation is realised to extend the requirements-based test coverage adaptively and systematically by modular and parameterised scenario specifications. In summary, the results show that the extended HiL environment is capable of generating electronic Horizon data which can easily be adapted or extended.",1369-8478,Not found

The goal of our research project is to increase understanding of driver steering behavior; through a measuring and modeling approach we aim to extend the validity of McRuer et al.’s crossover model for compensatory tracking to curve driving tasks. As part of this larger research project, this paper first analyzes the four main differences between compensatory tracking and curve driving: (1) pursuit and preview, (2) viewing perspective, (3) multiple feedback cues, and (4) boundary-avoidance strategies due to available lane width. Second, this paper introduces multiloop system identification as a method for explicitly disentangling the driver’s simultaneous responses to various cues, which is subsequently applied to two sets of human-in-the-loop experimental data from a preview tracking and a curve driving experiment. The results suggest that recent human modeling advances for preview tracking can be extended to curve driving, by including the human’s adaptation to viewing perspective, multiple feedback cues, and lane width.

It addresses not only the visual perception but also the immersivity of the experience. The approach is different from the signal detection theory and the quantum efficiency theory that both rely on probabilities computation. It is made of several items, graded between 0 and 100, and divided in two sections: vision cues and immersion cues. These items represent, and are based on, the different skills of the human visual system.

Not only in manual driving, the driver state information is also interesting to consider in automated driving systems in order to provide the driver with a suitable assistance level in respect to his evolving needs. The concepts of adaptive automation and human machine cooperation suggest that the authority of the automation should be adapted in real time according to the situation. However, contrary to existing studies that demonstrated the benefits for continuous fixed haptic feedback in the lane keeping task, evidence regarding the potential benefits of online adaptation of the level of haptic feedback is still lacking.

The effectiveness of such devices is strongly related to their capabilities of well reproducing the driving sensations, hence it is crucial that the motion control strategies generate both realistic and feasible inputs to the platform. Such strategies are called Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCAs). Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been successfully applied to MCAs, being well suited to solve constrained optimal control problems. However, the predictive aspect of the algorithm has not been exploited effectively yet, mainly due to the hard real-time requirement when using a significantly long prediction window. In this paper, a real time implementation of the so called Look-Ahead (LA) strategy is presented, that is based on an effective manipulation of the reference along the prediction horizon, and on an on-line switching policy to a Non-Look-Ahead strategy when the expected driver behavior is not reliable. An optimal tuning of the MCA is computed by means of a multi-objective optimization, where both performance improvement due to the prediction exploitation, and robustness to varying driver behavior are taken into account.

The MCAs were compared in an experiment where 18 participants rated the perceived motion mismatch, i.e., the perceived mismatch between the motion felt in the simulator and the motion one would expect from a drive in a real car. The results show that the quality of the motion cueing was rated better for the optimization-based MCA than for the filter-based MCA, indicating that there exists a potential to improve the quality of the motion simulation with optimization-based methods. Furthermore, it was shown that the rating method provides reliable and repeatable results within and between participants, which further establishes the utility of the method.",1369-8478,Not found
Deploying guidelines and a simplified data model to provide real world geodata in driving simulators and driving automation,10.1016/j.trf.2017.04.004,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Development of driver assistance and automation systems relies on domain-specific formats for the geometrical and logical representation of road networks in simulation environments. The trend to simulate real world urban environments leads to increasing demands for such data which cannot be derived easily from cadastral or open source geodata. In contrast, specific surveying directly into these domain-specific formats quickly becomes time- and cost-consuming. The DLR in partnership with OEMs developed guidelines and a simplified data format to facilitate surveying into an intermediate, discrete geodata format which meets the requirements of both the governmental and the driving simulation domain. The intermediate format should serve as a data hub from which specific simulation formats can be derived automatically through the developed processing tool chain. In this article the need of such an approach is discussed, the data format and the guidelines explained as well as the feasibility and effort of this approach is examined in an urban use case in Germany covering the dedicated surveying of road sections followed by automatic processing into OpenDRIVE.",1369-8478,Not found
Cooperation between driver and automated driving system: Implementation and evaluation,10.1016/j.trf.2017.04.006,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Recent years have witnessed rapid advancement of automated driving technologies. In this context, driver-vehicle cooperation as a new interaction paradigm offers an opportunity to improve the driving performance through the exploitation of human-automation synergy. This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of a new cooperation principle between the driver and the automated driving system. Within a use case concerning highway merging management, we describe the scenario modelling, system functional and HMI design. We evaluate the cooperation principle and the designed HMI through a user study on driving simulator. Based on test results, we discuss user’s perception of the cooperation principle and the potential of this principle to handle highway merging situations. Through this paper, we also aim to demonstrate the strengths of driving simulation in terms of interaction design for automated driving systems.",1369-8478,Not found
A real-time multisensor fusion verification framework for advanced driver assistance systems,10.1016/j.trf.2016.12.002,61,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This paper presents a novel approach for the verification of multisensor data fusion algorithms in complex automotive sensor networks. Multisensor fusion plays a central role in enhancing the interpretation of traffic situations, facilitating inferences and decision making. It has therefore been instrumental in the ongoing innovation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) which paves the way to autonomous driving. We introduce a real-time framework which can benchmark the performance of the fusion algorithms at the electronic system level using a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) co-simulation. The presented research provides a quantitative approach for a trade-off between physical realism and computational efforts of the real-time synthetic simulation. The proposed framework illustrates a generic architecture of ADAS sensor error injection for robustness testing of the System under Test (SuT). We construct a lemniscate model for errors to find multivariate outliers with the Mahalanobis distance. A critical driving scenario considering road users in urban traffic describes the dynamic behaviour testability of the fusion algorithms. The industry-proven framework facilitates a functional verification of multisensor-fusion-based object detection precisely and more efficiently on the target electronic control unit (ECU) in the laboratory.",1369-8478,Not found
"The role of transport priorities, transport attitudes and situational factors for sustainable transport mode use in wintertime",10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.003,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The aim of this study was to investigate transport priorities as a predictor over and above transport attitudes and situational factors, for the use of active and public transport (PT) to and from university among Norwegian university students in wintertime. A cross-sectional self-completion survey was carried out with 441 university students (229 females, 206 males), at two university campuses in Trondheim (Dragvoll and Gløshaugen), Norway. Transport priorities added to the explained variance above and beyond situational factors and transport attitudes. The transport priority of Exercise was associated with increased active transport use and the priority of flexibility was associated with decreased active transport use. In line with previous research, a more positive environmental attitude was related to increased active transport use as well. Among psychological factors, the transport attitude of comfort in PT, related to lower levels of PT use, possibly indicating dissatisfaction with using this mode. Overall, psychological factors (transport priorities, transport attitudes) contributed less explained variance of sustainable transport use, than situational factors (e.g. campus location, travel distance). Reminding students of the health and environmental benefits of active transport might be a promising way to promote this transport mode. Improving PT comfort might also promote continued usage of this mode in later life. However, increased sustainable transport mode use during winter appear to also depend on reducing situational constraints (e.g. clear snow on available walking and bicycling paths, improve infrastructure).",1369-8478,Not found
I only get some satisfaction: Introducing satisfaction into measures of accessibility,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.008,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Improving accessibility is a goal pursued by many metropolitan regions to address a variety of objectives. Accessibility, or the ease of reaching destinations, is traditionally measured using observed travel time and has of yet not accounted for user satisfaction with these travel times. As trip satisfaction is a major component of the underlying psychology of travel, we introduce satisfaction into accessibility measures and demonstrate its viability for future use. To do so, we generate a new satisfaction-based measure of accessibility where the impedance functions are determined from the travel time data of satisfying trips gathered from the 2017/2018 McGill Transport Survey. This satisfaction-based measure is used to calculate accessibility to jobs by four modes (public transport, car, walking, and cycling) in the Montreal metropolitan region, with the results then compared to a standard gravity-based measure of accessibility. This comparison reveals a discrepancy between both measures of accessibility, particularly for public transport users. By combining this discrepancy with mode share data, we identify areas that may be targets for future investigations to better understand the causes for discrepancy. The study demonstrates the importance of including satisfaction in accessibility measures and allows for a more nuanced interpretation of the ease of access by practitioners, researchers, planners, and policy-makers.",1369-8478,Not found
A novel cost/benefit approach for reducing frequency of deviant driving speeds in expressways,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.009,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Objective Testing how effective could be a proposed means to attain reduction of speed dispersion on expressways for decreasing the rate of accident-prone interactions. Background Quite a few studies, mainly over the last two decades, found speed dispersion to be a major determinant of the formation of accident-prone interactions between vehicles moving in the same direction – apparently quite more weighty than average speed is. That seems to call for some conceptual revision on the part of authorities in charge of enacting traffic on expressways, as well as some reform on the part of enforcing agencies. The study reported here examines the effectiveness of a novel concept for the control of driving speed in limited-access highways, possibly extended to other expressways as well, that is based on two tenets: One, introducing a principle tuned to admit just a narrow range of speeds, thereby help to reduce speed dispersion on the road. Two, recording information on mean speed of each car. Driving in limited-access highways is no longer considered a service taken for granted that every driver is entitled to get free, rather a commodity that has in principle to be paid for, unless the driver’s mean driving speed at any given, defined period falls within a known free speed range. Method In a laboratory experiment participants were asked to drive a driving simulator given a traffic regime based on the two tenets described above. The hypothesis was that a novel traffic regime following the principles of this concept might substantially reduce speed dispersion, both within a subject and between subjects. Results In most of the 1-km segments of the driving path, subjects managed to keep speed within the admitted range (width of which was 10 km/h). Speed dispersion measures within- and between-subjects were found substantially lower in the proposed regime condition, compared with a condition simulating the present regime, suggesting that the former may be effective in reducing unwelcome speed dispersion – shown elsewhere (Navon, 2003) to be a major determinant of the formation of accident-prone interactions between vehicles moving in the same direction. Conclusion The proposed regime seems to be effective in helping to decrease speed dispersion on the road, thereby serve to reduce accident rate. Application Widespread use of that proposed traffic regime may serve to reduce both number and intensity of accidents.",1369-8478,Not found
Engaging in NDRTs affects drivers’ responses and glance patterns after silent automation failures,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.020,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The aim of this study was to understand driver responses to “silent” failures in automated driving, where automation failed during a simulator drive, without a take-over warning. The effect of a visual non-driving related task (NDRT) and a road-based vigilance task presented drivers’ take-over response and visual attention was also investigated. Currently, automated driving systems face a number of limitations that require control to be handed back to the driver. Much of the research to date has focused on explicit take-over requests (ToRs) and shows that drivers struggle to resume control safely, exacerbated by disengagement from the driving task, for instance, due to the presence of NDRTs. However, little is known about whether, and how, drivers will respond to more subtle automation failures that come without a warning, and how this is affected by NDRT engagement. Thirty participants drove a simulated automated drive in two conditions, which had 6 silent automation failures each (3 on a Curve, 3 in a Straight), with no ToRs. In one condition, drivers were required to constantly monitor the road, which was enforced by a road-based vigilance task (VMS Only). In the other, drivers performed an additional visual NDRT, requiring them to divide their attention (VMS + Arrows). Results showed that, in both conditions, all drivers eventually detected and responded to all silent automation failures. However, engaging in an additional NDRT during automation resulted in significantly more lane excursions and longer take-over times. Adding a visual NDRT not only changed the distribution of drivers’ visual attention before and after the failure but also how they divided their attention between information on the road environment and the human–machine interface, which provided information on automation status. These results provide support for how driver monitoring systems may be used to detect drivers’ visual attention to the driving task and surroundings, and used as a tool for encouraging driver intervention, when required.",1369-8478,Not found
Identifying motorcycle high-risk traffic scenarios through interactive analysis of driver behavior and traffic characteristics,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.010,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Although the importance of human factors to crash occurrence has been demonstrated previously, the roles played by human factors in motorcycle killed and severely injured (KSI) crashes have remained unclear. One aim of our study is therefore to empirically determine the relative contribution of illegal behavior to motorcycle KSI crashes, conditional on real-world collisions between motorcycles and motor vehicles. Given that a crash is typically the synthetical result of human, vehicle, roadway, and environmental factors, another aim is to identify high-risk scenarios where inappropriate behavior is more likely to result in severe injuries for motorcyclists through interactions with other related factors. Based on a comprehensive dataset of 4587 police-reported crashes involving motorcycles during 2015–2017 in Hunan province, China, a data mining technique namely classification and regression tree was elaborately employed. Our results demonstrated the illegal behavior of the striking motor-vehicle drivers as one of the most dominant factors contributory to motorcycle KSI crashes, with a normalized importance value of 36.9%. We also confirmed collision object (i.e., collision with heavy or light vehicles) and helmet use of motorcyclists as determinants influencing motorcycle rider injury severities. Two types of extreme high-risk traffic scenarios were identified accordingly. A motorcycle rider was hit at weekends by a heavy motor-vehicle driver who was driving without license, driving a substantial vehicle, speeding, changing lanes illegally or driving in the wrong direction, and a motorcyclist was hit on weekdays by a heavy motor-vehicle driver aged 18–34 or 45–54, who was driving without license, driving a substantial vehicle, speeding, changing lanes illegally or driving in the wrong direction. Our findings are expected to shed more light on a deeper understanding of the illegal driving behavior as causation of motorcycle KSI crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
"A correlation analysis of information use, social networks and cooperation consciousness in travel behaviors",10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.015,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The rapid development of information and communication technologies, the availability of various traveling information, and the wide use of social networks facilitate the selection of the appropriate mode of transport in urban traveling. To better understand such selection processes, this paper presents a hierarchical clustering analysis of the transport data collected from some major cities in China for exploring the relationship between information use, social networks, and cooperation consciousness of individual travelers. This leads to the identification of three underlying patterns of cooperation consciousness behaviors including the pro-social relation, the diversity average relation and the homogeneous random relation. An analysis of such patterns shows that there is much to be done for enhancing the social and environmental awareness of travelers in individual travel choices for the sustainable development of urban traveling. This study contributes to the transportation study through the provision of better understanding of the influence of information use and social networks on conscious cooperation behaviors in urban traveling.

Traffic climate and driver behaviors: Explicit and implicit measures,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.016,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Traffic climate is about the road users’ attitudes towards traffic context and it is assumed that perceived traffic climate might influence drivers’ behaviors. In the literature, traffic climate was measured only by using self-report questionnaires. People might give biased responses to self-report measures due to social desirability. The aim of the current study was to develop the first implicit measure for traffic climate. In addition, both implicit and explicit attitudes towards traffic climate and their relationships with self-reported driver behaviors and outcomes of simulated driving were investigated in a young Turkish driver sample. According to the results, implicit measure of functionality was positively related to positive driver behaviors and negatively related to variance in lane positioning. Based on the findings, it can be suggested that drivers might have different implicit and explicit attitudes towards traffic climate. Additionally, it might be suggested that young drivers might need more experience to form stable attitudes towards traffic context. Interventions to change people’s attitudes towards traffic climate to improve road traffic safety might be more effective if stated differences are taken into consideration.",1369-8478,Not found

Methods We recruited 47 individuals, (24 female, 23 male), between the ages of 25 and 71 (mean age = 51, SD = 11.28). Of those, 24 individuals were newly diagnosed with OSA and 23 individuals were in a comparison sample with similar proportions of biological sex and ages, who tested negative for OSA. All participants completed questionnaire measures related to sleep, psychological adjustment, driving behavior, sleepiness and fatigue, immediately after their follow-up appointment. We collected data on driving violations from registered driving records for the 5 years preceding their enrolment in the study, as well as sleep-related data for all participants. Results Results show that individuals with OSA (M = 1.08, SD = 1.38) do not commit more driving violations than control participants (M = 0.64, SD = 1.26). Although drivers with OSA indicate significantly worse scores for fatigue (M = 7.73, SD = 3.71) compared with controls (M = 4.26, SD = 3.66), there was no significant difference for sleepiness between drivers with OSA (M = 10, SD = 3.57) and Controls (M = 8, SD = 3.69).

There is a growing evidence on self-regulatory practices amongst older drivers in developed countries, but limited studies are conducted in developing countries. This study aimed to explore self-regulatory practices amongst older Malaysian car drivers and motorcycle riders. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst older adults aged 60 years and above residing in two states located in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia using a self-administered questionnaire. Stepwise regressions were performed to identify for key factors associated with driving/riding self-regulation and crash involvement. Multilevel modelling was conducted to examine the clustering effect of respondents recruited from the two states. Results Six-hundred and thirty-seven respondents completed the questionnaire, with over three-quarters of them still driving/riding at the time of data collection. Physical fitness, behavioural and psychological changes experienced with advancing age were important motivators towards self-regulation. Motorcycle riders were found to be at a higher risk of crash involvement, and they were more prone to cease riding compared to car drivers. Conclusions Self-regulatory practices amongst older car drivers and motorcycle riders were found to be different. As such, there is a need to customise evidenced-based approaches to cater for specific age groups and road users, particularly in a developing country like Malaysia, where motorcycle is often considered as an affordable mode of transport and is largely involved in road traffic crashes.",1369-8478,Not found

This development is accompanied by several challenges, like the communication between automated vehicles and vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. The current communication strategies involving the driver, will lose their functionality when interacting with automated vehicles. Due to that, this study focused on vehicle deceleration as informal communication cue. We tested specific parameters (deceleration rate, vehicle speed, onset of deceleration, vehicle size and daylight) within two experimental, video-based simulations in regard to detection performance. Results showed significant shorter reaction times for higher deceleration rate and lower speed. Results for vehicle size and onset of deceleration were mostly influenced by interactions among the parameters. Day light condition did not reveal significance. Within the discussion, we argue to support future communication between automated vehicles and pedestrians by applying smooth and early decelerations, that incorporate vehicle speed as well as vehicle size.",1369-8478,Not found
Examining attitudes toward bicycle-share program use: A dual-process theory approach,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.007,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The transportation sector, the largest contributor to global warming, is responsible for around 75% of the tourism industry’s total CO2 emissions.

One promising alternative transportation option, bicycle-share programs (BSPs), have developed rapidly over the past two decades, but studies of non-commuter BSP use have been limited. Moreover, the small body of BSP research that does exist has mostly applied social-cognitive models to explore individuals’ rational decision-making processes, while largely ignoring the influences of emotional and intuitive factors. This study utilized Single Target Implicit Association Tests to bridge this gap by examining the influences of individuals’ dual attitudes toward leisure use of BSPs.

This study evaluates new treatments to improve the safety of horizontal and crest vertical curves and compares their efficiency for driver performance based on design consistency criteria under free flow traffic and on-coming traffic. A combination of chevron signs with three promising treatments included herringbones, sealed shoulder and a yellow blinking signal was applied to hazardous curve sections in a driving simulator. Performance measures consisted of mean of speed and lateral position. The results indicated that combining chevrons and a warning blinking signal is the most appropriate treatment for horizontal and crest vertical curves, as this resulted in lower speed and lateral position. In addition, speed and lateral position variations along the curves were lower compared to other treatments specially, with an on-coming vehicle. Sealed shoulder makes drivers drive faster while entering a curve and brake suddenly while changing direction. Using herring bones is found to reduce speed and speed differential along the curve but not lateral position which was even higher in treated curves particularly, in presence of an on-coming vehicle.",1369-8478,Not found

In line with a burgeoning body of research examining behaviour and social change, this paper explores the governmental systems that influence mobility behaviours through a social practice lens. This paper blends two social practice theoretical models, the ‘3-Elements Model’ and ‘Systems of Provision’, as a means of understanding the delivery of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF), a central government grant scheme for English local authorities. We examine how the meanings, materials and competences within the practices of bid writing by local authorities and scheme selection by government influenced the distribution of funding to local authorities. The research starts from the principle that, where funding is provided by central government, in the case of this research that of the UK, an opportunity is created for mobility practices to change. The significance of funding is not easily theorised by the 3-Elements model but is more helpfully explained when that model is blended with the wider Systems of Provision model to create a model of practice ecology. Our theorisation allows for a rigorous exploration of the ‘practice scaffolding’ which shapes how people travel. Policymakers are recommended to consider a practice ecology approach when developing mobility management schemes to tackle air quality, climate change and obesity issues more effectively.",1369-8478,Not found
From car sickness to autonomous car sickness: A review,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.020,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Motion sickness comprises a set of symptoms, such as nausea, headaches, and disorientation, that affects healthy individuals when undergoing different types of motion, including virtual motion. The ways of mitigating motion sickness is a controversial issue as it strongly depends on variability among individuals due to anthropometric, physical as well as physiological traits, making it difficult to identify and derive a universal solution. With the introduction of autonomous vehicles, we are moving from car sickness, which is motion sickness induced when riding in cars, to autonomous car sickness, which arises from riding in autonomous vehicles. To ensure advancement of fully-autonomous vehicles, a comfortable experience must be provided to the passengers. An important factor that affects the acceptance of autonomous cars is the capability of passengers to perform non-driving tasks like reading, relaxing, and/or socialising in a comfortable style with no or limited motion sickness symptoms. Drivers, who never suffer from motion sickness while driving, might be, when riding as passengers in autonomous cars, susceptible to motion sickness due to the lack of controllability on the vehicle in addition to sensory conflicts. Therefore, in-depth investigations on the causes of autonomous car sickness are required. In this paper, we present different theories explaining the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of motion sickness and then discuss whether these factors are applicable to autonomous car sickness. The adaptation of different motion sickness predictors that can be used to limit autonomous car sickness are also discussed, with a proposal of a framework that provides a viable solution to mitigate autonomous carsickness.",1369-8478,Not found

Data from 396 truck drivers are collected through a self-administered questionnaire. The results show that driver attitude and prevailing social norms both have a positive significant effect on risky driving behavior, while the work safety climate has a negative impact on risky driving behavior. The study distinctly defines the role of “work safety climate” in the context of the culture prevailing among truck drivers in Pakistan, and looks additionally at the moderating effects on socio-cognitive factors and risky driving behavior. Open communication and counseling by supervisors, their role modeling and placing of limits on risky driving behavior in fact have negative effects on the self-reported risky driving behavior of truck drivers. The study reveals that five of the nine factors have significant moderating effects on risky driving behaviors.

However, very few studies have investigated this phenomenon in more vulnerable road user groups, such as cyclists. This study administered the Cycling Anger Scale (CAS) to a sample of 636 active cyclists (who regularly ride on-road) to understand the situations that provoke anger in cyclists, and whether this anger differed according to their comfort levels with cycling. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the CAS showed that a four-factor solution fit the data. These were: (1) interactions with cars, (2) interactions with pedestrians, (3) interactions with other cyclists, and (4) police presence. The least anger provoking situations involved interactions with police. In contrast, the most anger provoking situations involved interactions with cars. This is likely to be due to the higher level of danger associated with collisions with motor vehicles for cyclists. Anger also differed according to levels of cycling confidence. Cyclists with higher levels of confidence generally reported lower levels of anger, particularly when interacting with cars and other cyclists. This study represents one of the few to use the CAS to measure cyclist anger and the findings align with previous applications of the CAS.

Dehumanization of cyclists predicts self-reported aggressive behaviour toward them: A pilot study,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.005,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Cycling provides many benefits to individuals and society, yet in many countries attitudes toward cyclists are largely negative. Public and humorous references to violence against cyclists are not uncommon and a significant minority of cyclists report harassment and aggression. We hypothesize that these hostile attitudes and behaviours are caused, in part, by the dehumanization of cyclists among some individuals. Dehumanization refers to any situation where people are seen or treated as if they are less than fully human. This paper presents a pilot study applying two validated dehumanization measures to a road user group for the first time. We found that the dehumanization measures were internally consistent, showed good discriminant validity (compared to general attitudes to cyclists) and were associated with self-reported aggression toward cyclists. The findings suggest that dehumanization is a concept that deserves further exploration in contexts where cyclists are a minority group. If we can put a human face to cyclists, we may improve attitudes and reduce aggression directed at on-road cyclists. This could result in a reduction in cyclist road trauma or an increase in public acceptance of cyclists as legitimate road users.",1369-8478,Not found
Route familiarity in road safety: A literature review and an identification proposal,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.020,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Route familiarity can be an important safety-related variable, which is often neglected. A review of previous works highlighting the relationships between route familiarity and road safety in behavioural studies and engineering standards/frameworks has been conducted. Theoretical frameworks supported by experimental results have revealed that driving behaviour can be affected by route familiarity. The latter may lead to distraction and self-confidence; and in turn to more dangerous behaviours after repeated journeys. From an economic perspective, the possible worsening of driving safety performance may be explained by trade-offs with mobility benefits. Route familiarity is also considered in engineering practice. Road design guidelines assuming a “design driver” were suggested as implicitly preserving the safety of familiar/unfamiliar drivers. The mix of familiar and unfamiliar drivers in traffic flow is explicitly considered when computing the design traffic. The safety implications of these matters find only partial confirmation in previous studies focused on involvement in crashes. However, comparing those findings was difficult due to the high variability in measuring the route familiarity itself. An attempt to harmonize the possible identifications of familiarity for future studies, based on previous findings, is proposed. The proposal considers two different scales used for measuring route familiarity: one based on travelling frequency, the other on distance from residence.",1369-8478,Not found
Speed perception and actual speed in a driving simulator and real-world: A validation study,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.019,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Background Driving simulators have become an effective research tool in traffic safety, but the validity of results obtained in simulated environments remains a debated issue of high importance. Objective The objective of this study is to validate a fixed-base driving simulator for speed perception and actual speed and to support its application in traffic safety studies. Method The study consisted of two experiments to test the external and subjective validity of the driving simulator in absolute and relative terms. External validity was framed into two parts i.e. for speed perception and actual speed. In the first part, the external validity was assessed based on the speed perception observations from forty volunteers that participated in the study. Speed estimations for four different requested speeds (50, 70, 80 and 100 kph) were recorded under two conditions: speedometer hidden and speedometer revealed. In the second part, the external validity was assessed based on the comparison of actual speed observations from field and simulator. The subjective validity of the simulator setting was assessed through a questionnaire. Results Results from both experiments showed correspondence of the driving behavior between the simulator and real-world settings. In general, the profiles for estimated speed and actual speed followed a significantly similar tendency and indicated relative validity in both experiments. Moreover, external absolute validity for speed perception was established on all the requested speeds with speedometer hidden while only for the requested speed of 80 kph with speedometer revealed. Participants’ evaluation of the quality and performance of the driving simulator supported the subjective validity of the simulator setting. Conclusion The fixed-base driving simulator used in this study can be considered as a useful tool for research on actual speed and speed perception.",1369-8478,Not found
The effects of optic flow on peripheral detection performance,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.015,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Objective In a driving simulator, a fully autonomous driving task was applied to study the effects of optic flow on Peripheral Detection Task (PDT) performance. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that optic flow induces visual tunneling effects. Background The visual tunneling effect as a result of driving, found in a previous study, was investigated further in this experiment. Method Speed, stimulus eccentricity and conspicuity were applied as within-subjects factors. Age was applied as a between-subjects factor. Results Optic flow resulted in increased PDT response time. Also, optic flow resulted in a task by stimulus eccentricity interaction on PDT RT that was interpreted as a visual tunneling effect. Conclusion The results support the hypothesis that optic flow is a factor responsible for visual tunneling while driving. Older drivers experience stronger visual tunneling effects compared to younger drivers. Application During driving tasks, visual tunneling effects may occur as a result of optic flow and these effects are more evident at higher speed and for older drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
"Healthy but risky: A descriptive study on cyclists’ encouraging and discouraging factors for using bicycles, habits and safety outcomes",10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.014,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Transportation is a necessary process that requires not only adequate means, but also individual choices. And apparently, the recent boom of alternative modes of transportation has substantially changed people’s perceptions of cycling, as well as the reasons why they decide to use a bike. Nevertheless, people identify some motives that encourage this use together with the perceived risks and the discouraging factors which affect the choice of using a bike, thus making it important to explore all these elements in the light of the empirical evidence. The objective of this study was to explore and describe the encouraging and discouraging reasons behind the use of bikes among cyclists, together with the reasons behind their journeys and the relationship of these elements with their crash history. For this study, 1064 cyclists were asked to complete an electronic survey which gathered information on their cycling-related habits, perceptions and motives. The results show that physical health and fitness (38%), contribution to environmental sustainability (14%), economy (13%) and time saving (10%) were the most frequent factors which encouraged cycling. On the other hand, perceived crash risk (17%), adverse weather conditions (17%) and lack of safety (16%) were found to be the most relevant discouraging factors. Finally, participants who cycled with more regularity were found to be less prone to suffer cycling crashes. The findings of this study support that cycling is a choice based on both benefits and risks, and its perceived connection to health is highly prevalent among active cyclists. Furthermore, perceived risks which may discourage cycling are an issue that needs to be addressed by transport policies, in order to enhance the engagement of the population in this mode of transportation. Also, this study highlights the need to strengthen utility cycling (cycling for transport to and from places) as a way to integrate transportation within healthier practices and habits.",1369-8478,Not found
Learning to use automation: Behavioral changes in interaction with automated driving systems,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.013,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"To evaluate human-machine interfaces for automated driving systems, a robust methodology is indispensable. The present driving simulator study investigated the effect of practice on behavioral measures (i.e., experimenter rating, reaction times, error rate) and the development of the preference-performance relationship for automated driving human-machine interfaces. In a within-subject design, N = 55 participants completed several transitions between manual, Level 2 and Level 3 automated driving. Behavioral measures followed the power law of practice with exception of transitions to manual and error rates for Level 3 automation. After the first block of interactions, preference no longer predicted performance. The preference-performance relationship remained stable after the second block of interactions, which is mainly due to a stabilization in behavioral parameters. To get a deeper insight into the evaluation of human-machine interfaces for automated driving, the results suggest the application of multi-method approaches. Furthermore, we found evidence for the influence of initial interactions for self-reported usability.",1369-8478,Not found

Grounded in self-determination theory, the objective of this study was to adapt the Spanish version of the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3 to ACS, and to examine the psychometric properties of the resulting version called Behavioural Regulation in Active Commuting to and from School (BR-ACS). The participants were 404 secondary students (207 girls; Mage  = 14.25, SD = 1.32) from different Spanish cities. The confirmatory factor analyses revealed adequate fit indices both for a six-factor structure (intrinsic motivation, integrated, identified, introjected and external regulation, and amotivation) and a hierarchical three-factor structure (autonomous, controlled motivation, and amotivation). The factor structure was invariant across gender and age. The internal consistency and temporal stability analyses showed adequate values for each factor. The binary logistic regression analysis reflected that intrinsic motivation, integrated, and identified regulation positively and significantly predicted ACS behaviour.

Speed limit compliance is not only affected by the speed limit credibility, but is also related to driver’s risk perception. This study investigates the relationship between the factors of risk perception, speed limit credibility and speed limit compliance for a given rural single carriageway road and roadside environment. Speed limit credibility, subjective risk perception and compliance with the speed limit were measured separately. To be specific, speed limit credibility was measured by speed limit rating score using a picture questionnaire. Subjective risk perception was measured by risk rating in an automated car driving simulator for a given speed and road environment. Speed limit compliance was measured by percentage of driving time spent below the speed limit in a simulated manual driving task with a given speed limit and road environment. Multilevel regression and logistic regression analysis demonstrate that risk perception has a positive influence on compliance with the speed limit. Credibility of speed limit has a positive influence on speed limit compliance. Risk perception has a negative influence on speed limit credibility. The research results can be used for guiding speed limit design and speed management.",1369-8478,Not found
Cyclists’ anger experiences in traffic: The Cycling Anger Scale,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.008,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Research on emotions in road traffic has focused on car drivers rather than on cyclists. However, cyclists experience cycling anger and its consequences as vulnerable road users, i.e., without having a car-like protection zone around them. To address the issue of cycling anger, we suggest a psychological measure assessing cyclists’ anger experiences in traffic, the Cycling Anger Scale (CAS). This questionnaire assesses cyclists’ anger experiences in interaction with their cycling environment. A principal component analysis and a following confirmatory factor analyses with two different samples proposed a 14 items questionnaire solution with four subscales: police interaction, car interaction, cyclist interaction, and pedestrian interaction. Alpha reliabilities were acceptable to good. The CAS correlated significantly with the Driving Anger Scale (DAS) for car drivers and with the general State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) suggesting convergent validity. Additionally, we examined the relations between cycling anger, demographics, and self-reported cycling behavior. We conclude that the CAS provides a complementary efficient instrument for measuring cycling anger in road traffic.",1369-8478,Not found
Examining the effect of infotainment auditory-vocal systems’ design components on workload and usability,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.006,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Given the promise for auditory-vocal systems to be less distracting and safer to use than their visual-manual counterparts, automotive manufacturers are introducing an increasing number of voice assistant-like interfaces in vehicles. However, recent studies suggest using auditory-vocal systems can be mentally taxing for drivers, and require long interaction times. Low accuracy and menu complexity are believed to negatively affect the usability of the system, but a systematic analysis of the role of different design components on driver workload and user experience within a real-world setting is missing. This study investigates the role of voice system design components in determining levels of driver workload with participants driving twelve on-road vehicles and interacting with on-board infotainment systems. Menu depth, delay times and system accuracy are recorded for twelve different auditory-vocal systems, and one aggregate score is assigned to each system. Total delay time and menu depth were found to be significant predictors of task duration time and mental workload. Longer delay times also had a direct effect on lower usability ratings, measured by the System Usability Scale and sentiment analysis. Delay times recorded on seven additional vehicles were used to validate the regression model for task duration. This study provides findings of primary importance for researchers and automotive manufacturers to be used in the assessment and development of in-vehicle auditory-vocal systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigation of older drivers’ requirements of the human-machine interaction in highly automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.009,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The population of older drivers is increasing in size. However, age-related functional decline potentially reduce their safe driving ability and thereby their wellbeing may decline. Fortunately, the forthcoming highly automated vehicles (HAVs) may have the potential to enhance the mobility of older drivers. HAVs would introduce a revolutionary human-machine interaction in which drivers can be completely disengaged from driving, and their control would be required occasionally. In order to inform the design of an age-friendly human-machine interaction in HAVs, several semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 older drivers (mean = 71.50 years, SD = 5.93 years; 12 female, 12 male) to explore their opinions of and requirements towards HAV after they had hands-on experience with a HAV on a driving simulator. Results showed that older drivers were positive towards HAVs and welcomed the hands-on experience with HAVs. In addition, they wanted to retain physical and potential control over the HAVs, and would like to perform a range of non-driving related tasks in HAVs. Meanwhile, they required an information system and a monitoring system to support their interactions with HAVs. Moreover, they required the takeover request of HAVs to be adjustable, explanatory and hierarchical, and they would like the driving styles of HAVs to be imitative and corrective. Above all, this research provides recommendations to inform the design of age-friendly human-machine interactions in HAVs and highlights the importance of considering the older drivers’ requirements when designing and developing automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
An analysis of the relationship between driver characteristics and driving safety using structural equation models,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.004,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Traffic crashes pose a serious threat to global health and have negative impacts on social and economic development. Driving safety could be significantly improved if drivers obtained effective training based on practical suggestions from studies of the relationship between driver characteristics and driving safety. In this study, driver characteristics are analyzed with a focus on illegal driving behaviors, and a new method is developed to reduce driver error. However, driver characteristics are complex, and the associated interrelationships among variables are not easily identified. A structural equation model (SEM) is adopted in this paper to capture the complex relationships among related variables. This model can simultaneously address the complex relationships among endogenous and exogenous variables. We investigate five illegal driving behaviors, including illegal passing, illegal lane changes, speeding, running red lights and distracted driving, based on a driving simulator. Distracted driving is chosen as an example to construct the SEM. We group 13 variables into four latent variables in the model. In this paper, 44 participants (average age ± S.D. = 33 ± 12.8 years, range: 19–55 years; average driving experience ± S.D. = 10 ± 8.8 years, range: 2–30 years) were recruited for the experiment, driving behavior data were collected via a driving simulator and driving attitude data were collected using a questionnaire. Our findings reveal that the main factor that influences illegal driving actions is driving attitude and the main factor that influences distracted driver performance is basic driver characteristics. Moreover, the driver training level is the most significant factor that negatively affects the basic driver characteristics (factor load = −0.91), and anger with slow driving is the main factor that influences the driver attitude (factor load = 0.90). According to the SEM results, the relationship between driver characteristics and driving safety is analyzed. The model results suggest that driver training lessons must be implemented and traffic issues must be urgently solved. In addition, our results suggest that extra training sessions should be required of young females and drivers with bad attitudes and serious road rage to improve driving safety. Although the results are based on distracted driving, the method presented in this paper is suitable for other analyses of driving behavior.",1369-8478,Not found

Results from the structural equation modeling of partial least square (PLS-SEM) show the significant associations between convenience, flexible service, commute impedance, and the intention to switch.

The NDRTs used were writing emails and watching videos, while the takeover situations tested were avoiding an obstacle on one’s lane and missing lane markings. Forty-four participants took part in a study carried in a dynamic simulator at PSA Peugeot Citroën Technical Center. Results showed that an effect of takeover situation on takeover time, with shorter times associated with obstacle avoidance, regardless of the type of NDRT. Measures of driver performance in the obstacle avoidance situation did not differ among manual and automated driving conditions, except for minimum time to collision. In the missing lane conditions, an effect of driving mode was observed on lateral and longitudinal control, as well as minimum time headway, regardless of the type of NDRT was observed. Our results suggest that the criticality of the situation had a distinct effect on takeover time and mental workload, while NDRT did not have a clear role.

Three factors – self-efficacy, social support and satisfaction – have previously been shown to be important for behavior change during physical activity intervention programs. In travel behavior interventions, however, these factors have often been studied individually and less is known about their combined effects on travel behavior change. Furthermore, while motives for participating in travel behavior interventions have been frequently studied within travel behavior interventions research, there is a lack of studies investigating the influence of motives on travel behavior change. To better understand the importance of different motives as well as the importance of self-efficacy, social support, and satisfaction with travel on behavior change, a series of surveys were administered to 181 participants before, during, and after their participation in a voluntary travel behavior intervention. The results show that greater self-efficacy and social support during the intervention led to greater travel behavior change. These results indicate that in order to gain better results from travel behavior interventions, individuals should be helped to increase their travel-related self-efficacy, and significant others should be involved to provide social support.

What do riders tweet about the people that they meet? Analyzing online commentary about UberPool and Lyft Shared/Lyft Line,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.015,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Uber and Lyft offer services, entitled UberPool and Lyft Shared (formerly Lyft Line), which allow passengers to share rides with other travelers for a discounted price. These services may reduce the number of vehicles on the road by increasing vehicle occupancy. However, there are drawbacks, including increased and unpredictable travel time and the social implications of sharing a confined space with strangers. To understand how travelers, drivers, and others understand and communicate about these services, we study online commentary about UberPool and Lyft Line on the popular micro-blogging site Twitter. We analyzed more than 2000 “tweets” about the services, coding for who tweets, the emotional tone of the tweets, and what aspects of the services are tweeted about. We find that positive tweets are quite rare and are outnumbered by negative tweets. However, the most common tone is humorous. As expected, there is considerable negative tweeting about service characteristics such as routing and travel time, and tweeters comment about how happy they are when another passenger is not picked up. However, most tweets are about other passengers and their behavior. Negative tweets about other passengers outnumber positive ones, but most tweets about other passengers feature humor about their conversation, behavior, and interactions with the tweeter. Passing on humorous observations and stories about UberPool and Lyft Line experiences with other passengers appears to be a substantial subgenre of the public discourse about sharing rides.

How driving experience and consumption related information influences eco-driving with battery electric vehicles – Results from a field study,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.016,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are a promising form of future mobility. However, current BEV drivers have to interact with quite small ranges because of the relatively small battery sizes and relatively long charging periods. One important coping resource to overcome this barrier is to use the available driving range as efficiently as possible by successfully using several eco-driving strategies. Eco-driving can reduce energy consumption and enhance a BEV’s driving range. Several eco-driving strategies can be adopted from internal combustion engine vehicles, but specific strategies for driving BEVs, such as efficient use of the regenerative braking need to be learnt. We examine the influence of pre-drive theoretical eco-driving training (i.e., consumption related information, eco-driving tips) versus practical BEV driving experience on self-reported eco-driving behaviour, knowledge, knowledge certainty rating and eco-driving acceptance. Experienced BEV drivers (N = 20), untrained non-BEV (N = 23), and a third group consisting of non-BEV drivers who received pre-drive theoretical eco-driving training (N = 20) undertook a BEV test drive in a critical range situation. First time experience of a critical range situation and the pre-drive theoretical eco-driving training both had positive effects on non-BEV drivers’ self-reported eco-driving knowledge, knowledge certainty rating and acceptance.

Drivers of all ages rated use of smart phones to be significantly more distracting than tasks such as listening to music, interacting with a passenger, or talking on a phone. They reported performing safety-positive behaviors (e.g., check blind spots, use turn signals) at a high frequency, and performing safety-negative behaviors (e.g., talk on phone or send text messages) at very low frequency, although younger drivers admitted use of smart phones more frequently than older drivers. Respondents estimated that other drivers are more likely than themselves to engage in safety-negative behaviors and less likely to perform safety-positive behaviors. Differences between self and others were smaller if others were rated first. Respondents also reported that most driving tasks are easier in daylight than at night, and that they drive more slowly at night. However, they greatly overestimated how far they can see a pedestrian at night, and their lack of awareness of poor visibility at night was confirmed by insufficient use of high-beam headlights and trivial reductions in the maximum “comfortable” speeds at night. These findings indicate that most drivers are fully aware of the risks associated with distraction through use of smart phones, although younger drivers admit using those devices. Moreover, although they are dimly aware of increased difficulty when driving at night, respondents greatly overestimated the visibility of pedestrians at night, and they generally fail to compensate for limited night vision through use of high-beam headlights and reduction of speed.",1369-8478,Not found
Changes in physiological indices and deceleration behaviour as functions of braking demands and driver's physiological cluster,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.013,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Physiological indices (e.g. heart rate and skin conductance) hold potential as monitoring tools for driver behaviour and mental workload. However, their effectiveness in this respect is presently limited by the large variability among individuals' physiological responses. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether drivers could be categorised into clusters according to their physiological responses to braking demands and whether the cluster type is related to deceleration intensity (in g units). Twenty-five drivers (males, aged 24–39) participated in a field experiment. We manipulated the braking demands using road signs to communicate the speed before braking (‘50’ or ‘60’) and the target speed for braking (‘30’ or ‘stop’). In an additional session, we asked drivers to brake intensively. We applied an advanced version of the k-means cluster analysis to the physiological data and adopted a two-physiological-cluster solution. Next, we calibrated an RM-ANOVA to estimate the effect of the physiological cluster and the braking demands on both the physiological indices and braking intensity. The results indicated that drivers could be assigned to one of the two clusters, mainly according to their heart rate and heart rate variability indices and less according to their skin conductance levels. However, the physiological cluster did not exert a significant effect on the actual deceleration intensity for any of the braking demands. These results indicate that different physiological responses to identical braking demands may result in similar performance outcomes. The practical implications of our observations might relate to the integration of physiological indices in driver support systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Student drivers the morning after drinking: A willingness to violate road rules despite typical visual attention,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.001,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Substantial research has investigated the effects of alcohol consumption on cognitive functions. However, little research has been conducted which examines the effects of evening alcohol consumption on next morning driving performance. The current study investigated the effects of a night out involving drinking on students’ morning after simulator driving performance, conducted as a within-subject naturalistic study. Thirty student drivers between the ages of 19–23 participated. Driving performance measures and eye movements were recorded while participants performed a short-simulated motorway driving task between 9 and 10 a.m., both after an evening consuming alcohol and on a control morning (no alcohol consumed). The task required drivers to respond to a speed limit and hazardous vehicle, with driving performance being compared over four road sections (speed reduction section, hazard section and two control sections). Sleep duration the night before the drives and breath alcohol content immediately before each drive were recorded. The main findings indicate that despite the majority of drivers being legal to drive, in the morning after condition drivers tended to travel at higher maximum speeds, travel for a longer period of time over the speed limit and demonstrate a larger variance in speed. However, no differences were found in visual attention measures. These findings suggest that the morning after drinking is associated with dangerous driving behaviour in terms of violating road rules even when no deficits in attention are observed. The implications for road safety are discussed, focusing on informative programmes to educate drivers of the dangers associated with morning after driving.",1369-8478,Not found

Nevertheless, few studies have addressed psychological variables to deepen the understanding of drivers’ speed choice in work zones. The present study examined whether work zones represent a type of situation that may trigger the expression of certain personality traits resulting in large individual differences in speed preferences. An additional aim was to study whether the expected relationship between personality traits and speed in work zones was dependent upon the presence of visible roadwork activity. Four sub-scales of the UPPS-Impulsivity scale (perseverance, premeditation, negative urgency and sensation seeking), a measure of altruism and a measure of normlessness were chosen for this purpose. A video-based experiment of real work zones was used where drivers (N = 815) stated their preferred speed in conditions with and without roadwork activity present. Afterwards, they answered an online questionnaire with the study variables. The presence of roadwork activity was the strongest predictor for speed, resulting in a relatively large reduction in preferred speed. The effect of roadwork activity was also found to moderate the relationship between normlessness and speed as well as perseverance and speed, suggesting that the presence of this contextual factor to some extent influences the relation between personality traits and preferred speed. A serial mediation model showed that sensation seeking, altruism and normlessness had weak, but statistically significant indirect effects on preferred speed in work zone through attitudes towards speeding. Negative urgency had an indirect effect on preferred speed through risk perception, but in the opposite direction as expected. The practical implications such as in planning countermeasures are discussed, as well as in interventions targeting attitudes and risk perception specific for work zones.",1369-8478,Not found

Leveraging this new form of transport to transform mobility in cities will depend fundamentally on public acceptance of AVs, and the ways in which individuals choose to use them, to meet their daily travel needs. Empirical studies exploring public attitudes towards automated driving technologies and interest in AVs have emerged in the last few years. However, within this strand of research there is a paucity of theory-driven and behaviourally consistent methodologies to unpack the determinants of user adoption decisions with respect to AVs. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap, by advancing and testing four conceptual frameworks which could be deployed to capture the range of possible behavioural influences on individuals’ AV adoption decisions. The frameworks integrate socio-demographic variables and relevant latent behavioural factors, including perceived benefits and perceived ease of use of AVs, public fears and anxieties regarding AVs, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and attitudinal factors covering the environment, technology, collaborative consumption, public transit and car ownership. We demonstrate the utility and validity of the frameworks, by translating the latent variables into indicator items in a structured questionnaire, and administering it online to a random sample of adult individuals (n = 507). Using the survey data in confirmatory factor analyses, we specify and demonstrate scale reliability of indicator items, and convergent and discriminant validity of relationships among latent variables. Ultimately, we advance four measurement models. These theory-grounded measurement models are intended for application in research aimed at understanding and predicting (a) AV interest and adoption intentions, and (b) user adoption decisions regarding three different AV modes: ownership, sharing and public transport.",1369-8478,Not found
Road-related anger in motorcyclists versus car drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.006,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Investigations of on-road anger have focused on car drivers, with an implicit assumption that findings generalise to other road users. However, research has highlighted differences in physical vulnerabilities and cognitive processing between drivers and other types of road users, such as motorcycle riders. Considering these differences, it is plausible that driving anger would differ as a function of modal type. The current study investigated driving anger in car drivers and motorcycle riders, specifically identifying differences in situational responses. Participants were 239 drivers and 170 riders who completed a set of online self-report surveys including the Driving Anger Scale and a newly-developed Riding Anger Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis found that existing models of driving anger adequately fit the driver sample, but not the rider sample. Subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed that the most anger-provoking situations for riders involved perceived risk. The results suggest that careless or reckless behaviours from other drivers and poorly-designed road environments are significant sources of anger for riders, whereas rude behaviour by others is more anger-provoking for drivers. This study contributes to the growing body of on-road anger research by identifying specific driver and rider provocations, and creating a new measure of riding anger for future research.",1369-8478,Not found
Learning to drive: A reconceptualization,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.010,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Drivers’ population-level crash rates incrementally decrease following licensure, which has led to the implicit assumption that an individual driver’s crash risk also decreases incrementally after licensure as they accrue experience. However, in the aggregate data an incremental decrease in crash rate can reflect both incremental reductions in crash risk within individuals and an incremental increase in the proportion of drivers who have experienced an abrupt decrease in crash risk. Therefore, while it is true to say that the population of drivers’ crash risk reduces in the months following licensure, it is not necessarily true to say that a driver’s crash risk reduces in the months following licensure; that is, it cannot be assumed that individual-level changes in crash risk mirror the population-level changes in crash rates. In statistics, this is known as an ecological fallacy and in formal logic it is known as the fallacy of division, a type of category error. Using computational cognitive modeling methods we demonstrate that aggregating individual-level abrupt decreases in crash risk (i.e., non-incremental change trajectories) accurately fits population-level crash rate data from over 1 million novice drivers and uniquely accounts for effects of two interventions found to reduce police-reported MVCs. Thus, we demonstrate that: (1) a power-law artifact is readily observable in newly licensed drivers’ aggregate crash data, which is not necessarily indicative of individual-level change processes, (2) interventions can alter crash risk trajectories by inducing immediate phase changes in crash risk into a lower risk stratum, or increasing the probability of such a change, and (3) a phase transition model provides a stronger and more parsimonious account of the existing data than an incremental-accrual model.",1369-8478,Not found
Self-reported deterrence effects of the Norwegian driver's licence penalty point system,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.012,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Norway’s penalty point system implies that traffic infractions are penalised with two or three points for full-licence drivers and four or six points for probationary-licence drivers, and when a total of eight points is reached within a three-year period the licence is revoked for a duration of six months. A web-based questionnaire was administered to four different driver samples based on number of acquired penalty points: (a) drivers with no points (n = 1206), (b) full-licence drivers with two or three points (n = 190), (c) full-licence drivers with four points or more (n = 172), and (d) probationary-licence drivers with four points or more (n = 193). Drivers with penalty points had better knowledge about the penalty points than those without penalty points. Drivers with four points or more, which means that they are close to the disqualification limit, to a greater extent replied that they have become more law-abiding, compared to those with few or no points. Also drivers without points reported that their driving was influenced by fear of penalty points. Thus, the penalty point system seems to have both a specific perceived deterrence effect on drivers who are at a high risk of losing their licence, and a general perceived deterrence effect on drivers without penalty points.",1369-8478,Not found
Combining roadside interviews and on-road observation for assessing prevalence of driver inattention,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.004,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Inattention among car drivers on a motorway section with two lanes in each direction was investigated by a combination of two different methodological approaches. First, an observer in a driving car in the non-passing (right) lane observed 1337 passing drivers; i.e., all drivers passing during the observation period. At a service area about midway along the section, 273 drivers were interviewed during the same period. The observations showed that 14% of drivers were involved in some secondary activity, with handheld mobile telephone use (which is prohibited) being the most frequent activity (5%). Involvement in secondary activities were far more frequent among drivers without passengers, with 15%, compared to 9% for drivers with passengers. For the latter, interaction with passengers was observed for 6%. The interviews made a useful supplement to roadside observations, providing prevalence estimates also for non-observable activities and states like daydreaming and listening to radio or music. Concerning passenger interaction, duration data were uncertain because many drivers tended to report total driving time with passengers rather than time interacting with them. Consequently, prevalence estimates for passenger interaction as reported in interviews were uncertain, and we therefore estimated this prevalence from observation data only. Total prevalence of secondary activities and internal states presumably implying inattention was estimated at about 24% of total driving time when based on both methods combined.",1369-8478,Not found
What do driver educators and young drivers think about driving simulators?

However, little research has examined what young drivers and driver educators think about these devices. If driver educators and young drivers do not believe that simulator training will be effective, it is unlikely that they will be used to their full potential. Eight focus groups utilizing a qualitative draw-and-talk technique examined young drivers’ (n = 22) and driver educators’ (n = 10) perceptions of simulators. Participants made a drawing of an ‘ideal’ driving simulator. Thematic analysis was conducted on audio transcripts of the group discussions about their drawings. Results suggested that many young drivers and driver educators may be ambivalent about using simulators as a driver education tool, although they see value in the standardization of training they could provide.

An exploration of the paradoxical violation effect,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.007,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The developmental increase in reported violations at the same time that the accident rate is decreasing (paradoxical violation effect) was investigated. Two explanations of the increase in violations were considered, one involving an increase in normative pressure to violate and the other a release of the tendency to violate. While there was no definitive evidence in favour of the normative pressure hypothesis there was evidence consistent with the release hypothesis. Two general explanations of the paradoxical violation effect were examined. The critical period hypothesis proposes that early in development new drivers are particularly sensitive to violations while the second hypothesis proposes that there is an independent factor that operates early in development to increase accidents but diminishes later. Specific instantiations of these hypotheses were examined. At the general level the two hypotheses make opposing predictions concerning the relationship between violations and accident involvement, with the critical period hypothesis predicting a developmental decrease in the correlation between violations and accident involvement and the independent factor hypothesis predicting a developmental increase in the correlation between violations and accident involvement. A developmental decrease in the correlation between violations and accident involvement was found supporting the critical period hypothesis.",1369-8478,Not found
Rider-to-rider discriminatory attitudes and ridesharing behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.003,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Using online survey data from N = 2041 Uber and Lyft users in the United States collected in 2016 and 2018, this paper establishes the validity, reliability, and invariance of a measure of rider-to-rider race and social class discrimination. This measure is then incorporated into three structural models that investigate associations between rider-to-rider discriminatory attitudes and four aspects of ridesharing behavior. We find no significant relationship between rider-to-rider discriminatory attitudes and whether a TNC user has ever used a ridesharing service (such as uberPOOL or Lyft Line). However, among those who have used ridesharing services before, rider-to-rider discriminatory attitudes are strongly negatively predictive of an individual's level of satisfaction with the sharing option, and marginally negatively predictive of an individual's percentage of shared TNC trips. Furthermore, among those who have not yet used ridesharing services, rider-to-rider discriminatory attitudes are strongly negatively predictive of willingness to consider using uberPOOL or Lyft Line in the future. Together, these findings suggest that rider-to-rider discriminatory attitudes may discourage sustained and frequent use of ridesharing services among TNC users. Further research is required to identify strategies for addressing discriminatory attitudes in the ridesharing context and overcoming reluctance to sharing.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of information on drivers’ toll lane choices and travel times expectations,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.023,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This paper reports on a study of drivers’ toll lane choices and the effect of the type and content of information they are provided with on their travel time expectations and lane choices. In the data collection experiment, participants were asked about their travel time expectations. A mixed-effects regression model is developed to predict these expected travel times depending on the toll rates and type and content of travel information they are provided with. Then, a model to predict the choice whether or not to use the toll lane, using the expected travel times as explanatory variables, is formulated and estimated. The results show that drivers’ expected travel times are affected by the information provided to them on the VMS. In particular, in the absence of precise travel time information drivers use the toll rate itself as an indicator to the expected travel times. In the choice model, there is a significant heterogeneity in preferences and the related values of time among drivers. In particular, there are large differences in values of time between drivers who pay the toll themselves and those whose employers pay the tolls.",1369-8478,Not found
Understanding attitudes to priorities at side road junctions,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.005,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Junctions are places of interaction and hence conflict for all road users.

The aim of the research is to investigate the attitudes to change, and likely behaviour at junctions, of all types of road users, were a general and unambiguous duty to ‘give way on turning’ to be introduced in the UK context. Q-methodology was used because it is good at capturing and describing divergent views and also consensus. Q-mode factor analysis was used and revealed five groups with common perspectives, as follows: optimistic experienced drivers, pessimistic regular cyclists, realistic multi-modals, altruistic pedestrians and the pragmatic sustainably mobile. Differences between groups centred on which road user types should be the prime focus of junction improvements, the relative importance of safety and time saving, and the amount of effort required to implement change. There was a strong consensus between the groups that no level of injury and death at road junctions is acceptable, and that regulation changes should be made. Funding for awareness raising, and supporting any regulation change with concomitant design changes to the physical layout of junctions is also important. There is a consistency of opinion across all groups of road users that the lack of alignment between design and regulation, and lack of compliance with the regulations are not acceptable. Each grouping of respondents thought that it is appropriate to make junctions safe for all, and more attractive and convenient for those that are currently the most at risk. There are practical changes that policy makers and practitioners could and should make. Change in regulations could be undertaken, but it would need to be supported by the following: public awareness raising campaigns; infrastructure design changes; funding; and enforcement.",1369-8478,Not found
Reducing the randomness of latent variables using the evaluative space grid: Implementation in a hybrid choice model,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.018,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The study of latent variables, and in particular of attitudes, contributes to a better understanding of individual preferences and behavior and it is now common practice within transportation literature. However, the procedure of attitude measurement is still not optimal. Two major issues are the misspecification of the attitude itself and the number of suitable items used for defining the psychological factor. The incorrect measurement entails a poor representation of individuals on the latent continuum and a less precise definition of the latent variable itself. These issues become even more relevant when a Likert scale is used. Indeed, the neutral point of this scale is selected by both individuals having an ambivalent and an indifferent attitude, and the poor representation makes impossible to distinguish these categories. Nevertheless, such a distinction can be very profitable for policy reasons. To overcome this issue and to suggest more effective policies, we propose using the Evaluative Space Grid (ESG), which is a single-item measure of positivity and negativity, to collect attitudinal variables. This tool can distinguish between individuals with indifferent and ambivalent attitudes, as well as those with positive and negative inclinations. This paper models the ESG using a pair of ordered logit regressions and suggests a procedure to include this approach in the framework of hybrid choice models. Furthermore, it endeavors to shed light on the preferences of individuals having indifferent and ambivalent inclinations in a transportation context, showing the hypothesis that their preferences are different for commuting trips.",1369-8478,Not found
Performance analysis of urban drivers encountering pedestrian,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.019,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Iran is one of the countries with the highest rates of road deaths in the world. About 18,000 people die every year in road accidents in Iran, where about 22 percent of the dead are pedestrians. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the effective factors on performance of drivers during interaction with pedestrians. Therefore, the Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) of behaviour of 66 participants (29 males and 27 females, 18–65 years old) has been evaluated in Babol city, Mazandaran province, during 2014–2016. The behavioral studies of the participants were conducted in 216 cases of vehicle-pedestrian interaction in divided road and 485 cases in undivided road through video-recorded process. The results showed that vehicle speed and distance to pedestrians are the most important factors affecting the occurrence of vehicle-pedestrian interaction in both sites. Moreover, the results show that on the divided road, Running when crossing the street by pedestrians, as well as listening to the music by drivers, increases the possibility of interaction. Also, on the undivided road, the attention to the traffic flow of road before crossing by pedestrians, as well as crossing the street in a group increase the probability of driver's performance. Drivers responded to pedestrian crossing the street by some performances such as decreasing speed, changing the line, stop and acceleration collision. Finally, the probabilistic models of driver performance as well as the type of performances based on the variables affecting the behavior of drivers are determined using the binary logit model and multinomial logit model, respectively. Further model validation and transferability were checked and it has been observed that the driver performance and types of performance models developed in this study represents quite well. The inference of these models will be useful to assess Drivers’ behavioral models and suggest automotive assistance systems for improving pedestrian safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Design and assessment of in-vehicle auditory alerts for highway-rail grade crossings,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.024,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Train-vehicle collisions at highway-rail grade crossings (RR crossings) continue to be a major issue in the US and across the world. To prevent several decades of safety improvements from plateauing, experts are turning towards novel warning devices that can be applied to all crossings with minimal cost. One of the potential approaches is in-vehicle auditory alerts (IVAAs) which are implementable with today’s technology and could potentially complement the existing warnings in a cost effective manner. Study 1 collected subjective data on a pool of potential in-vehicle auditory alerts from 31 participants. Study 2 recruited 20 participants to drive in a medium fidelity driving simulator with and without IVAAs for RR crossings. Results suggest IVAAs inform and remind drivers of how to comply at RR crossings, and have a lasting effect on driver behavior after the IVAA is no longer presented. Compliance scores were highest among combination RR crossing visual warnings, such as crossbucks featuring STOP or YIELD signs. Compliance was lowest for crossbucks alone and active gates in the off position. IVAAs had the largest impact on compliance scores at crossbucks and gates. The discussion includes implications for designing IVAA systems for RR crossings, the limitations of the study, and the participants’ perception of the novel warning type.",1369-8478,Not found
Understanding drivers’ altruistic driving decisions: A theoretically guided investigation,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.017,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This study used an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1985) incorporating moral norm and descriptive norm, to examine the beliefs, intentions, and behaviours associated with altruistic driving. This study was conducted among Australian drivers aged 17 years and older. A formative consultation (N = 9) was conducted in which participants identified two specific altruistic driving behaviours; namely, letting another driver have a car space and giving way to another driver to enter their lane, in addition to the salient behavioural, normative, and control beliefs underlying the performance of altruistic driving behaviours in general. Following this consultation, a quantitative study was conducted with an initial (Time 1) and follow-up questionnaire (Time 2) explored individuals’ intentions and behaviours associated with the performance of general, and the two specific, altruistic driving behaviours. The regression analyses from Time 1 (N = 237) provided support for the extended TPB in predicting individuals’ intention to engage in altruistic driving. At Time 2, the regression analyses revealed intention significantly predicted general altruistic driving behaviours (N = 124), letting another driver have a car space (n = 63), and giving way to another driver to enter a lane (n = 114). Furthermore, the analysis of the TPB beliefs found two beliefs to underlie the performance of general altruistic driving behaviours, namely ‘maintain traffic flow’ as an advantage associated with the behaviour being more likely to be performed, and ‘time constraints’ serving as a barrier to prevent drivers from performing the behaviour. Overall, this preliminary investigation offers insights into avenues for future road safety campaigns aimed at encouraging drivers to be more altruistic on the roads.",1369-8478,Not found

For this purpose, 74 participants performed driving experiments on a simulated urban route with six signalised intersections. Driver distraction, demographics, intersection configurations and driving attributes were considered as independent variables. Additionally, some specific situations (combinations of the different attributes) associated with the stop/cross decision were identified with a decision tree method. A generalised linear mixed model with a logit link function was developed for estimating the probability of crossing an intersection by considering all the main variables and the potential interaction obtained from the decision tree. The results highlighted that the driving speed was positively associated with the crossing probability. Whereas, Time to Stop Line (TSL), type of manoeuvre and the presence of the distractions had a negative influence on the probability. The odds of crossing an intersection were 17% lesser for the music player distraction than the phone conversation.

Quantifying the difference between intention and outcome in driving performance,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.021,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The extent to which drivers control their vehicles according to their intentions is a critical problem in driving safety. We quantify the difference between a driver’s own intentions and the actual operations from observations of driver performance. Typical driving is governed by two types of processes: proactive and reactive control. In Proactive control, the driver prepares and executes actions in a timely manner ahead of future events, whereas in reactive control the driver responds directly to environmental stimuli. A state in which the relative amount of reactive control is high implies that the driver is busy responding to the surroundings and has difficulty attending to future events. Thirty active drivers participated in on a pylon slalom task, driven on a test track, that demanded rigorous control actions on a predefined course. The vehicle dynamics and driver actions on the vehicle controls were analyzed to quantify the proactive and reactive processes. Based on three indices related to amount of compensation in steering, proactive automatization and steering onset distance, we showed that the ratio of proactive to reactive control could be computed from the driver’s operations. The linear summation of the three indices, referred to as the reactivity index, can quantify the difference between driver intention and actual operations. Quantifying a driver’s ability to control the driving situation would be highly useful for deciding whether the driver should continue driving. The reactivity index could be used in various advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) to monitor driver status.",1369-8478,Not found

Association between visual field impairment and involvement in motor vehicle collision among a sample of Japanese drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.012,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Background There is an expectation that the addition of visual field testing to driving licencing procedures may contribute to detecting unsafe drivers due to visual field (VF) impairment. However, previous research has been inconclusive as to the association between VF impairment and motor vehicle collision (MVC), and there are relatively fewer trials conducted outside the United States using a sample of general drivers compared to studies using eye clinic patients. Purpose To investigate the association between ophthalmic indicators of VF impairment and involvement in at-fault MVC in the previous five years among a sample of middle-aged or older drivers. Method Driving licence holders aged 40 years or over (N = 546) were administered a questionnaire survey and underwent a visual assessment at a driving licence examination centre in the suburbs of Tokyo. Of these participants, 458 were current drivers. Their response to the written questionnaire and ophthalmic indicators of VF impairment were subjected to multivariate logistic regression models to predict at-fault MVC. The analyses were done while adjusting for variables pertinent to driving habit, near-miss experience and perceived driving difficulties. We compared two different dependent variables separately: at-fault MVC based on police record and self-reports. Results Analysis showed that ophthalmic indicators of binocular VF impairment such as Esterman score and Integrated Visual Field was not statistically significant in explaining at-fault MVC involvement. This was true both for predicting police-registered MVC and self-reported at-fault MVC. It was indicated that history of citation, presence of medical conditions and certain driving circumstances such as frequent night-time driving would increase risk of at-fault MVC in conjunction with the individual’s perception about driving difficulties. Conclusion The results of this study were consistent with previous research in that ophthalmic VF impairment may not be directly associated with MVC involvement when VF impairment is not severe. However, a combination of at-risk driving behaviour (exposure to high-risk driving situations and certain near-miss experience), deterioration in health condition, and lack of insight into such circumstances would likely increase at-fault MVC risk.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver behaviour and crash involvement among professional taxi and truck drivers: Light passenger cars versus heavy goods vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.010,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Professional drivers are drivers whose profession is to drive a vehicle such as truck and taxi for working purposes. However, these drivers constitute a heterogeneous group and generalizing assumptions about risky driving behaviour across the entire group might be misleading. The current study aimed to investigate similarities and differences of self-reported risky driving behaviour and crash involvement among different groups of professional drivers. Two rather large samples of taxi drivers obtained from 20 taxi stations in two cities (n = 381) and heavy goods vehicles (truck) drivers obtained from a roadside survey in 10 provinces (n = 785) completed the same 27-item Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) in Iran. Principal component analysis showed that the DBQ segmented into four dimensions both among taxi and truck drivers. Further, a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) supported strong measurement invariance in the DBQ factor structure across the two samples. The results showed that taxi drivers were more likely than truck drivers to commit errors as well as ordinary and aggressive violations. A one unit increase in ordinary and aggressive violations increased the probability of having experienced a traffic crash in the last year by 69% and 98% for taxi drivers, respectively, and 37% and 42% among truck drivers, respectively. This highlights that driving violations increased the probability of crash involvement almost twice as much among taxi drivers compared to truck drivers. Policymakers could target ordinary and aggressive violations by establishing better driving training and by improving the licensing procedures among professional drivers.",1369-8478,Not found

We administered the Driving Violations Inventory (DVI) to all participants—a self-report measure that asks participants to record which of the official list of violations were committed. Data from DVI were compared with official driving records and with driving simulator results. Drivers with OSA did not have more registered driving violations than the control group. The overall number of self-reported violations was highly correlated with the driving simulator lateral position variable only for drivers with OSA. There were no significant associations between the number of official driving violations and simulator deviation of the lateral position for either group. Our findings indicate that the DVI is an accessible measure that could mirror some of the risk associated with impaired driving behavior in general, perhaps particularly for individuals with OSA.",1369-8478,Not found

Adding different geographic content provided an opportunity to assess trends and to obtain more robust results and different insights on the consumer acceptance and travel behavior impacts of self-driving vehicles. Following an extensive descriptive analyses, a multivariate model was estimated to examine the factors influencing intent to use in Texas cities. The results show an increase in intent to use from 2015 to 2016. Demographic variables mattered but to lesser extent compared to psychosocial variables of the CTAM, which were highly significant in predicting intent to use. Younger individuals, males and individuals with physical conditions that prohibiting them from driving had a higher likelihood of intent to use. Travel behavior characteristics were also important. For example, individuals owning a vehicle with highly automated features had a higher intention to use. The strongest associations with intent to use were observed for attitudes toward self-driving vehicles, performance expectation, perceived safety, and social influence. In moving forward, it will be important to continue to monitor and track the behavior with diverse populations, and build an evidence-based consensus through continuous measurement on intent to use automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Efficacy of training with driving simulators in improving safety in young novice or learner drivers: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.006,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Driver inexperience is one of the underlying reasons for the high risk of road crashes involving young drivers (the so-called “young driver problem”). The use of driving simulators for learner or novice drivers could mitigate this problem by enabling them to acquire driving experience without increasing the risk of a road crashes. Evidence of this beneficial effect should lead to expanded use simulators to train learner drivers. We undertook a systematic review of previous studies designed to determine whether the use of a driving simulator for passenger cars or motorcycles in young novice or learner drivers leads to a reduction in road crashes and/or traffic infractions, or to the acquisition of safer driving skills, compared to non-use of driving simulators. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were used for the literature search. A total of 2888 unique references were initially extracted, but only five of them met the inclusion criteria and were selected for review (two experimental studies with random assignment, one quasi-experiment study, and two cohort studies). Two authors independently extracted the information and assessed the quality of each study with the Jadad Scale, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and identification of biases. Heterogeneity among studies regarding the outcomes considered precluded a quantitative synthesis of the results. Overall, the quality of the studies was low, and the most frequent drawbacks were low power to detect significant differences, non-comparability of the intervention and control groups (because of nonrandom assignment, different drop-out rates and uncontrolled confounders) and classification bias (because of inadequate blinding and the use of self-reports for some outcomes). Furthermore, the results were inconsistent across studies regarding the major outcomes. Therefore, the results of our review do not provide evidence to support or refute the efficacy of training programs based on simulators for young learner or novice drivers in improving the safety of their driving styles. Additional studies are needed to overcome the limitations of research designs used thus far.",1369-8478,Not found

Data were collected for a sample of 474 cyclists in Israel and a hybrid choice model allowed to uncover the relations between the choice of sharing the road and the latent constructs pertaining to the Symbolic Interaction Theory. Results show that: (i) the belief that drivers perceive cyclists as aggressive leads to more assertive cycling behaviour and in turn to higher willingness to share the road; (ii) the perception of drivers as aggressive, as opposed to the perception of them as attentive, leads to more cautious cyclist behaviour and in turn to lower willingness to cycle in mixed traffic; (iii) cyclists are not willing to share the road if they have physical negative experiences with near-misses and incidents, as well as emotional negative perceptions of the road sharing experience.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating drivers’ mandatory lane change behavior on the weaving section of freeway with managed lanes: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.007,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Managed lanes (MLs) system has been widely implemented on freeways to mitigate congestion and improve efficiency. MLs are usually designed as concurrent with general-purpose lanes (GPLs), and separated by a barrier or painted stripe with several at-grade ingresses and egresses. However, these kinds of designs may result in weaving segments between ingress (egress) and on-ramp (off-ramp). For example, vehicles from on-ramp must cross multiple GPLs to get access to the ML. This study aims to investigate the safety effects of weaving length, traffic condition, and driver characteristics on drivers’ mandatory lane change behavior based on a driving simulator study. Mixed factorial design with two within-subject factors (traffic volume: off-peak and peak; speed harmonization (SH): SH and Non-SH) and one between-subject factor (weaving length per lane change ( L LC ): 600 feet, 1000 feet, and 1400 feet) were employed in this study. Fifty-four licensed drivers were recruited to conduct this driving simulator experiment. Based on the experimental data, three lane change decision metrics (i.e., lane change merging gap, duration, and patience time), three lane change execution metrics (i.e., maximum longitudinal deceleration, lateral acceleration, and steering wheel angle), and two surrogate-safety metrics (i.e., number of conflicts and time exposed time-to-collision) were analyzed. Results indicated that for the ingress of MLs (entrance weaving segment), 1000 feet L LC would be recommended if the space is limited, otherwise 1400 feet L LC is preferable. For the egress of MLs (exit weaving segment), however, only 1000 feet L LC was recommended since 1400 feet L LC was found to be significantly more dangerous than 600 and 1000 feet L LC . Moreover, peak traffic condition could significantly increase the difficulty of lane change behavior on the weaving segments, and speed harmonization could significantly improve the lane change safety on the entrance weaving segments.",1369-8478,Not found
Risky riders: A comparison of personality theories on motorcyclist riding behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.008,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Objective Few studies have investigated the association between broad personality traits and motorcycle rider behaviours. Typically, studies have focused on specific variables such as Sensation Seeking and Aggression. This study extends the literature by investigating the trait facets of the Big Five and the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). Method An internet-based questionnaire comprised of traditional (Sensation Seeking, Aggression) and novel (Big Five, Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory) personality scales, and the Motorcycle Rider Behaviour Questionnaire (MRBQ) were posted on various motorcycle internet forums. Results A North American sample of 550 motorcyclists completed the survey. Four separate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with each personality theory entered step-by-step to predict the four riding behaviours from the MRBQ (errors, speeding, stunts, protective gear use) as the criterion variables. Consistent with previous literature the traditionally used personality traits, Sensation Seeking, and Aggression, were strongly associated with riding errors, speeding, and especially performing stunts. The addition of the Big Five facets contributed negligibly to riding behaviours with the greatest explained variance accounting for errors. The addition of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory was especially useful in accounting for motorcycle riding errors, and the use of protective gear. Conclusion Although research on personality theories and riding behaviour typically use more narrow trait scales this study demonstrates that physiologically-based, broader, measures such as the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory have a strong association with riding behaviours. Future research would benefit from the inclusion of such measures.",1369-8478,Not found
Improving drivers’ hazard perception in pedestrian-related situations based on a short simulator-based intervention,10.1016/j.trf.2018.12.013,62,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Young drivers remain over-represented in road accident statistics and hazard perception is a likely source of a skills gap between younger and older drivers. The aim of this study was to examine whether a short hazard perception training intervention in a driving simulator enhances young drivers’ tactical hazard perception skills in pedestrian-related situations. The intervention combined error and instructional commentary training. Thirty young drivers were trained and compared to 30 untrained drivers based on their eye fixations and driving behaviour in potential visible and hidden hazard situations. The results showed that trained drivers responded to one of three hazards by decreasing speed, while untrained drivers did not. Additionally, trained drivers had lower self-assessed hazard perception skills after than before the training, suggesting that exposure to these critical situations and the opportunity to negotiate them increased their awareness of the limitations of their driving skills. The eye fixation analysis showed that trained drivers fixated on the hidden hazard locations more often, indicating that they had greater awareness of the situation than untrained drivers. The training intervention showed a positive effect in improving drivers’ approach speed and fixations in hidden hazard situations, which requires more advanced hazard perception skills. This training intervention can be further developed into a training module as an addition to existing conventional training in the classroom and on the road.",1369-8478,Not found
"A comparative analysis of risk associated with eating, drinking and texting during driving at unsignalised intersections",10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.023,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The present study analysed and compared the impacts of distraction caused by eating, drinking and texting on risky driving behaviour at unsignalised intersections. For this purpose, 89 participants approached the simulated unsignalised intersections through the minor road and encountered a series of vehicles on the major road. Their driving performance data were analysed in terms of reaction distance and accident probability at approach and completion zones respectively. The results revealed that during the texting tasks, the drivers detected the major road traffic at a later stage compared to the baseline. Further, unlike the texting task, the eating and drinking tasks did not affect the driving performance negatively in the approach zone. However, the accident risk in the completion zone was increased significantly due to the presence of the eating and drinking tasks. Unexpectedly, the accident risk was as low as 76% for the texting task while crossing through the intersections, possibly because of the compensatory measures adapted by the drivers. The study suggested that everyday distractions could result in unsafe consequences particularly in complex driving situations because of the lower risk perceptions associated with these distractions.",1369-8478,Not found
"Street racing, stunt driving and ghost riding YouTube videos: A descriptive content analysis",10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.012,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Objective YouTube is a highly popular social medium that includes over a billion videos covering a wide range of topics, including high risk driving behaviours. Despite the popularity of these websites, published content analyses of high risk driving videos have been limited. Yet, research suggests that exposure to other media glorifying high risk driving is associated with risky driving behavioural intentions and behaviours (e.g., Fischer et al., 2011). This study aims to provide a snapshot of YouTube videos to: 1) describe the content of a sample of YouTube high risk driving videos, focusing on racing and stunts and 2) summarize the videos in relation to the video’s form characteristics, such as number of views, “likes” and “dislikes” by YouTube viewers. Methods Search procedures chose the first thirty videos that appeared on a university computer, on September 23, 2015 for a final sample of 65 videos: 25 for street racing, 21 for stunt driving, and 18 for ghost riding. Two primary researchers used an iterative approach to develop and refine definitions for the coding of variables in which a quantitative research matrix was developed for analysis of risky driving YouTube videos. They independently coded each video for content and inter-rater reliability was assessed. Results Street racing videos provided the highest median number of views, viewer comments, subscribers, viewer “likes”, and “dislikes” than both stunt driving and ghost riding videos. Street racing, stunt driving and ghost riding exhibited differing viewing patterns and possibly different types of viewers. A range of risky driving activities were portrayed, mostly by young men. Regardless of search term, the majority of sampled videos showed no consequences (69.8%). Bystanders were rarely at safe distances. Any comments made in the videos were most often instructions to the driver, passenger, or the audience. If an opinion was stated it was usually a positive comment about the driving or the nature of the event. Discussion and Conclusions This study is the first examination of YouTube risky driving videos through a content analysis. The analyses clearly show high risk driving and other risk-taking behaviours in the sampled videos. Results of the study support the need for educational interventions and highlight the need for further research to examine the potential impact of social media on driving attitudes and behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver anger towards cyclists in Australia: Investigating the role of the perceived legitimacy of cyclists as road users,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.021,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Aggression towards cyclists by other road users likely contributes to the recent decline in participation and safety of cyclists on Australian roads. In the current study we examined the role of the perceived legitimacy of cyclists as road users on driver anger towards cyclists. 273 drivers in Australia responded to an online survey assessing anger towards cyclists, perceived legitimacy of cyclists as road users, and a range of other variables theoretically related to driver anger. As predicted, legitimacy was a strong predictor of driver anger specifically towards cyclists. Legitimacy, in turn, was predicted by identification with cyclists, knowledge of road rules, and observations of reckless cycling. This study suggests that interventions designed to increase the perceived legitimacy of cyclists as road users could be an effective way to reduce aggression towards cyclists and thus increase cycling participation and safety.",1369-8478,Not found
What impressions do users have after a ride in an automated shuttle? An interview study,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.009,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"In the future, automated shuttles may provide on-demand transport and serve as feeders to public transport systems. However, automated shuttles will only become widely used if they are accepted by the public. This paper presents results of an interview study with 30 users of an automated shuttle on the EUREF (Europäisches Energieforum) campus in Berlin-Schöneberg to obtain in-depth understanding of the acceptance of automated shuttles as feeders to public transport systems. From the interviews, we identified 340 quotes, which were classified into six categories: (1) expectations about the capabilities of the automated shuttle (10% of quotes), (2) evaluation of the shuttle performance (10%), (3) service quality (34%), (4) risk and benefit perception (15%), (5) travel purpose (25%), and (6) trust (6%). The quotes indicated that respondents had idealized expectations about the technological capabilities of the automated shuttle, which may have been fostered by the media. Respondents were positive about the idea of using automated shuttles as feeders to public transport systems but did not believe that the shuttle will allow them to engage in cognitively demanding activities such as working. Furthermore, 20% of respondents indicated to prefer supervision of shuttles via an external control room or steward on board over unsupervised automation. In conclusion, even though the current automated shuttle did not live up to the respondents’ expectations, respondents still perceived automated shuttles as a viable option for feeders to public transport systems.",1369-8478,Not found
An empirical approach to determining speed limit credibility,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.015,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"There is now a body of literature on speed limit credibility, particularly in connection with speed management under the overall umbrella of “Safe Systems”. However, there is rather little empirical work on the underlying factors that determine the credibility of speed limits and on how to enhance credibility for a given type of road. The study reported here aimed to investigate how factors such as road layout and the roadside environment together with drivers’ perception of risk affect speed limit credibility. It also aimed to provide a measurement of speed limit credibility and how to set more credible speed limits to improve drivers’ speed compliance. A picture questionnaire and a driving simulator in an automated condition in a simulator were adopted to obtain the measurements. The results suggest that certain road layout and environment features influence speed limit credibility. The research results show that five new indicators can be used as a reference for deciding on a credible speed limit in a given road environment: the most common choice of speed limit by drivers; the highest credible rating score value; indication of comfort with speed in automated driving; risk rating in the range from feeling safe to very safe; arousal indicated by skin conductance. Applying these indicators makes it possible to determine a limit that is credible for most motorists in a given road environment. Improving the credibility of a speed limit will lead to better speed management overall.",1369-8478,Not found
Modelling overtaking strategy and lateral distance in car-to-cyclist overtaking on rural roads: A driving simulator experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.026,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The involvement of cyclists in road crashes has not been decreasing with the same magnitude as the involvement of other road users. In particular, the interactions between cyclists and motorized traffic can lead to high-severity crashes. To improve the safety of these interactions, a thorough understanding of road user behaviour is first needed. In this study, we focused on drivers overtaking cyclists on rural roads. The two main objectives of this study were to develop models that predicted: (a) drivers’ decisions to perform either a flying or an accelerative overtaking manoeuvre in the presence of oncoming traffic, and (b) the lateral comfort distance that drivers maintain from cyclists during the overtaking. A driving simulator study was designed to assess driver decision-making during the overtaking. The 37 drivers who participated in the study each performed seven overtaking manoeuvres with oncoming traffic. Out of the 259 overtaking manoeuvres, 168 were flying and 91 were accelerative. Binary logistic-regression models with mixed effects predicted the type of overtaking strategy (flying or accelerative). Driving speeds were found to significantly affect the strategy. The overall performance of the models predicting the strategy was 85–90%. Models were also developed for predicting the lateral comfort distance. The results show that the lateral comfort distance is mostly affected by the longitudinal distance between the subject vehicle and the oncoming vehicle, the longitudinal distance between the subject vehicle and the cyclist, and the presence of an oncoming vehicle—as well as by the drivers’ characteristics (sensation seeking in flying overtaking manoeuvres and ordinary violations in accelerative manoeuvres). The root mean square error, which was used to assess the performance of the models, ranged from 0.56 to 0.62. In conclusion, the models predicting the overtaking strategy performed reasonably well, while the models predicting lateral distance did not provide accurate predictions. The models predicting overtaking strategy may support (1) the development and evaluation of active safety systems, (2) the design of automated driving, and (3) policy making.",1369-8478,Not found
Does the group membership shape evaluations on other drivers?

As measurement, mini Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) with the addition of three aggressive violation items of the original DBQ, the Positive Driver Behavior Scale, and an adjective list were used. Participants assessed their own driving behavior as well as three different driver identities represented by three sets of car photographs. In-group (the university) identity, out-group (politically provocative) identity and no identity (control) were represented to participants by use of different car stickers and accessories. As our hypotheses suggested, the participants made the highest evaluations for their own driving behavior, while making the lowest evaluations for the out-group in both measures.

Characterizing driver behavior in dilemma zones at signalized roundabouts,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.007,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"In some Asian countries, roundabouts were designed as a tool for landscape and urban planning in less-populated areas, which did not initially need traffic lights. However, as the urbanization grew, it was needed to signalize these roundabouts to prevent accidents. One of the main reasons for high accident rates at intersections is the dilemma that drivers face when the signal changes from green to yellow. The purpose of this paper is to study the dilemma zone (DZ) at roundabouts and driving factors that affect the stop or go decision. This paper determines the length of all-red interval for yellow light running (YLR) vehicles, using time to collision (TTC) and kinematic motion (KM) methods. TTC sets all-red interval so that the “last to go” vehicles have enough time to clear middle of the roundabout before conflicting vehicles reach the conflict point. KM method applies the kinematic motion equations to estimate the time required to clear the conflict point. The obtained results for three roundabouts in Mashhad, Iran demonstrate that the DZ is shorter and closer to stop-line, as compared to signalized intersections. Drivers drive more conservatively at roundabouts and are more willing to stop. Comparison of TTC and KM reveals that the central tendency and dispersion measures of all-red interval are larger in disaggregate KM method. Studying driving factors shows that driver perception-reaction time of drivers at roundabouts matches to a large extent with the values recommended by AASHTO and ITE. However, such consistency is not observed for acceleration and deceleration rates.",1369-8478,Not found
A dynamical systems perspective on driver behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.010,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Dynamical systems (DS) theoretical and methodological approaches have furthered our understanding of human development and behavior across many different domains, but have not yet been applied to driver behavior. Using a DS lens, a new theory of driver behavior is proposed, the phase transition framework (PTF), and then applied to understanding how novice drivers develop. The PTF can facilitate new lines of research by providing an individual-level explanatory account that yields the widely observed and poorly understood aggregate declines in novice drivers’ crash rates in the early months of licensure. For the purpose of the PTF, learning to drive is defined as changes in the psychological system integral to the acquisition, refinement, automation, and maintenance of competencies necessary for safe driving. In the PTF, the greatest reductions in population-level collision rates observed in the early months of the post-licensure period are hypothesized to be due to qualitative cognitive reorganizations (e.g., adoption of strategies that reduce risk) that cause abrupt shifts in crash risk trajectories into lower risk strata followed by refinement of strategy use and deployment through real-world experience. Critically, the PTF differs from other theories of driver behavior in that it holds that drivers’ behavioral development is self-organizing and emergent.",1369-8478,Not found
Mediational impact of perceived risk on drowsy driving intention and willingness in university students,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.008,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Recent research indicates that perceived behavioral control is the strongest predictor of drowsy driving intention and willingness in young adult university students. This research also suggests that elevated perceived behavioral control concerning drowsy driving may impact a person’s perceptions of risk regarding drowsy driving, which subsequently may impact drowsy driving intention and willingness. Questionnaire data on drowsy driving beliefs and perceptions previously collected from 497 students at a university in the United States was used to investigate the relationship between perceived behavioral control, risk perception, intention, and willingness related to drowsy driving behavior. Regression analyses and Sobel tests revealed that drowsy driving risk perception partially mediates the relationship between perceived behavioral control and willingness to drive drowsy: greater perceived control over drowsy driving behavior decreases perceived risk concerning drowsy driving, which in turn increases willingness to engage in drowsy driving behavior. Limited evidence also was produced indicating that drowsy driving risk perception partially mediates the relationship between perceived behavioral control and intention to drive drowsy. These findings suggest important theory-based messaging strategies that can be developed to alter perceptions and subsequent behavior related to drowsy driving in young adult U.S. drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Predicting intentions to comply with speed limits using a ‘decision tree’ applied to an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.005,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Speed is a major cause of road traffic accidents and deaths. Public authorities address this issue by reducing speed limits, for example by extending the 30 km/h speed limit throughout the urban area. This research is linked to the traffic-calming project in Angers (France). It is based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the prediction of young drivers’ intentions to comply with speed limits. We tested a modified version of the TPB that includes variables related to beliefs and other variables taken from the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI). Participants (n = 391, Mean Age = 22.4, SD = 3.8) completed a questionnaire including measures of the TPB components related to intentions to comply with the 30 km/h speed limit. Bayesian analysis confirmed the relevance of this model, which explained 53% of the variance of behavioural intention. By projecting these results on a decision tree, we were able to identify the most influential variables for predicting intentions. The interest of this decision tree is that it makes it possible to compare self-reported intentions and expected outcomes.

Replacement of distractions with other distractions: A propensity-based approach to estimating realistic crash odds ratios for driver engagement in secondary tasks,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.013,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"As Automated Vehicles (AVs) enter the fleet at lower levels of automated (SAE, 2018), the need for human drivers to remain engaged in the driving task will continue. Thus, understanding driver distraction and estimating the reduction in risk associated with removing distractions is important as AV technology develops. While previous research (e.g., Dingus et al., 2016) has estimated large odds ratios (i.e., 3–4) for using cell-phones while driving, countermeasures directed at reducing cell-phone use have not realized large crash reductions. One reason may be that drivers may replace cell-phone use with other risky activities and that odds ratios (ORs) have often compared cell-phone use to ideal driving rather than a realistic reference. Using data from the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2), we developed two cell-phone propensity models, one with age and one without, to develop weights for events without cell phone use. Using these weights, we estimated the probability of engagement in a variety of tasks in place of cell-phone use. We also estimated weighted odds ratios for cell-phone use (all uses) and cell-phone talking only. Weighted ORs are lower than unweighted ORs and much lower than ORs compared to ideal driving. This is consistent with the idea that in practice, even if cell-phone bans are effective at reducing cell-phone use, they may not greatly reduce risk because drivers may replace cell-phone use with other distracting activities in the same situations in which they normally use cell phones while driving. We also discuss the influence of young drivers on our results. Younger drivers in the dataset are more likely to use cell phones and thus are influential in the propensity model results.",1369-8478,Not found

How do vulnerable road users look at road safety? International comparison based on ESRA data from 25 countries,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.001,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The overall aim of the ESRA project is to provide scientific support to road safety policy by generating comparable national data on the current road safety situation. The first ESRA survey was conducted online using representative samples (N = 1000) of the national adult populations in 25 countries across the world. The field work was carried out in two waves: (1) June/July 2015, and (2) November 2016. In total, the first ESRA1 survey covers almost 27,000 respondents, among which roughly 21,000 were identified as vulnerable road users. Vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists suffer the most severe consequences in road crashes with other road users, because they cannot protect themselves against the speed and mass of the other party. Given their high vulnerability, these types of road users are of special interest to policy makers. The objective of this paper is to present the ESRA1 results regarding the safety attitudes of vulnerable road users. Special attention was given to ‘road crash involvement’, ‘safety feeling’, and ‘self-reported unsafe traffic behavior’ (i.e., the use of headphone and (motor)cycle helmet). Results show that vulnerable road users were more involved in road crashes compared to car drivers and that they feel less safe. Pedestrians feel safer in traffic compared to other types of vulnerable road users. Logistic regression models show that the use of headphones while walking and cycling is associated with gender, age, and support of policy measures. The use of a (motor)cycle helmet is associated with age and support of policy measures.

Effects of anger and collision history on driver space preference,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.002,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Driver space has been defined as the personal space extending from the driver to surround the vehicle in traffic. The current study explored if emotions have an influence on driver space preference. A sample of 39 drivers completed a projective measure of their driver space preference under the influence of state emotions. Three different emotion states were induced in each participant during the experiment, including anger, happiness, and neutral. The results showed that participants preferred larger space when angered compared to the other two states. However, the happy state did not change driver space preference compared to the neutral condition. Meanwhile, history of collisions also had some impact on driver space preference, where those with more collisions over the past three years reported larger driver space preference. In conclusion, driver space preference appears to be influenced by both emotion state and driving experience. These results provide some new perspectives about driver space preference which may be beneficial to more deeply understand the protective function of space that can help build a safer traffic environment.",1369-8478,Not found

Infrared thermography video and automatic facial feature recognition were implemented to assess participants’ facial temperature. It was revealed that forehead temperature, which is supposed to represent emotional dimension of power, decreased significantly more after threat than after challenge events (t(17) = −1.83, p = 0.04, Cohen’s d = 0.54).

A graphical modeling method for individual driving behavior and its application in driving safety analysis using GPS data,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.017,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Due to differences in driving skills and personal characteristics among drivers, the behaviors of drivers when faced with various driving environments differ, causing different levels of driving safety concerns. In past research, the measurement of safety-related driving behavior mostly focused on classification, while few studies were concerned with individual driving behavior characteristics. However, it is important for drivers to recognize and correct their dangerous behaviors and optimize their driving. This paper presents a graphical method for modeling individual driving behaviors, and the results can be used in driving safety analysis. Based on the assumption that drivers have specific driving habits, typical driving patterns during driving are first detected and extracted. These typical driving patterns are then sorted according to their frequencies, forming a driving behavior graph that can directly illustrate each driver’s behavior features. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis method for evaluating driving safety based on the behavior graph is provided. To verify the proposed method, a case study focusing on vehicles’ longitudinal motion was conducted using GPS data collected from Beijing taxis. The results demonstrated that the graphical method can describe the individual features of a driver’s longitudinal acceleration behavior and distinguish differences among drivers. The development of this method can help understand the individual features of driving behaviors and further support measures to optimize driving safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Emergency braking performance of motorcycle riders: skill identification in a real-life perception-action task designed for training purposes,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.019,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Collisions with other vehicles represent the biggest threat to riders of powered-two-wheeler (PTW), and while emergency braking is the evasive manoeuvre most frequently required in PTW riding, many riders fail to perform it adequately due to constraints on response time precipitated by failures of perception, cognition and control actions. Effective rider training methods are necessary for the development of braking proficiency in response to emergency situations. This study proposes a testing and training paradigm that exploits a closer similitude with the real-world scenario by maintaining the natural coupling of action (vehicle manoeuvring) and perception (higher order skill) that underlies any coordinated response to an emergency event. The aim of this study was to understand the behaviour of the riders in the execution of emergency braking coupled with visual perception of vehicle motion as a response to an imminent collision and determine parameters that can be used to identify differences in skill level. Participants performed emergency braking trials in a realistic and controlled scenario using a mock-up of an intersection conflict with a real car initiating a left turn manoeuvre across the path of a PTW approaching from the opposite direction (Left Turn Across Path/Opposite Directions). Analysis of the deceleration patterns recorded during 12 trials per participant revealed that performance of braking in response to an unpredicted moving hazard differs from that in a planned self-timed hard braking. In addition, our results indicate that PTW rider performance may be assessed in a reliable and objective way using the combination of vehicle kinematics and human performance measures. The study identified four categories of riders classified by their level skills. Finally, an important finding was the lack of correlation of both years of riding experience and self-assessed overall riding skill with an objective measure of emergency braking performance such as effective deceleration. The results of this study will support a new training approach and provide insights for future design of active safety systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Social media browsing while driving: Effects on driver performance and attention allocation,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.021,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Texting while driving is known to lead to performance decrements; however, it is still unclear to what extent browsing social media while driving also negatively affects driver performance and attention. There is a need to determine what guidelines and warnings should be in place. The aim of this research study is to analyze the effects of browsing social media on young driver performance and attention allocation (using eye tracking). To this end, a driving simulator experiment was carried out. Participants were asked to drive and either browse a Facebook page or send text messages on a given cell phone. Results showed that both texting and browsing social media lead to performance decrements, but texting while driving is more detrimental to performance. However, in terms of attention allocation, texting and browsing social media seem to be very similar, confirming the need for more awareness about the visual distraction caused by browsing social media.",1369-8478,Not found
A perceptual approach for evaluating vehicle drivability in a dynamic driving simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.013,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"With an increasing number and diversification of powertrain setups, the evaluation of drivability is a major challenge in the vehicle development process. Since comprehensive tests with prototype cars are complex, time-consuming and expensive, using dynamic driving simulators for drivability evaluations is a promising alternative. Currently, driving simulators are not an established tool for drivability evaluations despite offering many advantages. They could enable concept evaluations in early development stages and offer a high degree of reproducibility and controllability regarding the test conditions. One reason for simulators not being utilised for this purpose is the circumstance that certain effects are experienced differently compared to real driving. Therefore, it is important to understand how accelerations are perceived in a simulator and to what extend motion scaling influences the perception. The ability to distinguish between several acceleration profiles resulting from different powertrain setups can be expressed with the just noticeable difference (JND). The JND corresponds to the differential perception threshold and is a suitable measure to classify and assess powertrain modifications. In this paper, the effect of motion scaling on the JND is analysed with a driving simulator study. The aim is to explain the differences in perception between driving simulator studies and real road tests in the context of drivability and to provide guidance for transferring results to real world conditions.",1369-8478,Not found
Aperture judgement in fire-appliance drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.012,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Low-speed collisions are a common occurrence for UK Fire and Rescue Services, with frequent bumps and scrapes adding up to create a significant drain on emergency service budgets, and damaging public faith in the service. We hypothesised that the decision to drive through a gap, or aperture, created by other vehicles and/or road furniture, may be related to driver experience and risk-level. To create a test to assess this skill, video clips were recorded from a fire appliance on blue-light training runs. Eighteen clips were selected on the basis that they culminated in a narrow aperture that the film-driver either navigated through, or stopped and waited for other vehicles to move and the gap to widen. Drivers were required to watch these clips, which paused at the point that the film-driver made the decision to either go though, or to wait. The participants rated their belief that the appliance would fit through the gap, and how confident they would be to drive through that aperture themselves (on a 1–8 scale). Novice fire-appliance drivers were less accurate in deciding whether to proceed or not, though their criterion threshold did not differ to that of more experienced drivers. All drivers favoured looking at the right edge of the aperture (either a vehicle or road furniture), but low-risk, experienced fire appliance drivers had the shortest fixations on this area. The results suggest that a video-based test of aperture judgement can differentiate between fire-appliance driver groups based on experience, opening the way for future testing and training tools using this methodology.",1369-8478,Not found
The relation between driving errors and executive functioning in intellectually able young novice drivers with autism,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.003,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Driving is a complex, goal-directed task. ASD can be related to impairments in executive functioning (EF), which may interfere with driving. This study aimed to investigate (1) if 16 young novice drivers with ASD exhibited a divergent performance on EF tests compared to 18 neurotypical peers, (2) if ASD participants exhibited a divergent driving performance compared to their neurotypical peers, and (3) if differences in driving performance would be related by the performance on the EF tasks. All participants completed a driving simulator scenario and computer-task battery. Driving error classification allowed the selection of several driving measures (e.g., collisions, speeding). Three EF tasks measuring working memory (WM), attention, and response inhibition were included. Results indicated lower WM and attention performance of the ASD participants compared to the control group, whereas response inhibition was similar across groups. Furthermore, the current study demonstrated that people with ASD can be considered as capable drivers once they have learned how to drive, that it is important to take different types of hazards into account, and that EF performance is related to driving performance. This relation may be different for drivers with and without ASD. Moreover, the relation may depend on the specific EFs and driving parameters under investigation. Future research could focus on the very early phases of driving education, and include additional driving and EF measures.",1369-8478,Not found
"Beyond mere take-over requests: The effects of monitoring requests on driver attention, take-over performance, and acceptance",10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.018,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"In conditionally automated driving, drivers do not have to monitor the road, whereas in partially automated driving, drivers have to monitor the road permanently. We evaluated a dynamic allocation of monitoring tasks to human and automation by providing a monitoring request (MR) before a possible take-over request (TOR), with the aim to better prepare drivers to take over safely and efficiently. In a simulator-based study, an MR + TOR condition was compared with a TOR-only condition using a within-subject design with 41 participants. In the MR + TOR condition, an MR was triggered 12 s before a zebra crossing, and a TOR was provided 7 s after the MR onset if pedestrians crossing the road were detected. In the TOR-only condition, a TOR was provided 5 s before the vehicle would collide with a pedestrian if the participant did not intervene. Participants were instructed to perform a self-paced visual-motor non-driving task during automated driving. Eye tracking results showed that participants in the MR + TOR condition responded to the MR by looking at the driving environment. They also exhibited better take-over performance, with a shorter response time to the TOR and a longer minimum time to collision as compared to the TOR-only condition. Subjective evaluations also showed advantages of the MR: participants reported lower workload, higher acceptance, and higher trust in the MR + TOR condition as compared to the TOR-only condition. Participants’ reliance on automation was tested in a third drive (MR-only condition), where automation failed to provide a TOR after an MR. The MR-only condition resulted in later responses (and errors of omission) as compared to the MR + TOR condition. It is concluded that MRs have the potential to increase safety and acceptance of automated driving as compared to systems that provide only TORs. Drivers’ trust calibration and reliance on automation need further investigation.",1369-8478,Not found
Satisfaction-induced travel behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2019.03.001,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Numerous studies – mainly since 2010 – have found that the chosen travel mode is related with how satisfied people are with their performed trips. A consensus has been found in that active travel results in the highest levels of satisfaction, while public transport users are usually least satisfied with their trips. However, evidence of why the use of various modes results in different levels of travel satisfaction is currently lacking. In this conceptual paper, I argue that the effect of travel mode on travel satisfaction might be overestimated, and that it is not so much the travel mode itself that affects satisfaction with travel, but whether the chosen travel mode is consistent with attitudes towards that mode. Furthermore, travel satisfaction might affect travel mode choice and travel attitudes more than vice versa. In this paper a new model is proposed reshaping the links between travel satisfaction, travel attitudes and travel mode choice. I underpin the suggested relationships with travel behaviour literature and psychological theories, draw parallels with (transport-related) residential self-selection, and reflect on the difficulties and possibilities of measuring this model. Finally, I focus on the implications of the proposed model on travel behaviour research.",1369-8478,Not found
The differential associations of functional and dysfunctional impulsivity with driving style: A simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2019.02.011,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The present study investigated the impulsivity and driving style link by measuring driver behaviors on the driving simulator. Previous studies examining this relationship mostly used self-report instruments to measure both impulsivity and driving related outcomes, therefore this study aims to test this association by using a relatively more objective measurement tool than self-report. Moreover, the associations of functional impulsivity dimension with driving style has been investigated, in addition to the dysfunctional impulsivity dimension, which has been predominantly studied in the literature. Finally, both general and driving context specific functional and dysfunctional impulsivity dimensions were included in the analyses of the current study. Eighty (40 women) young drivers (19–25) participated in the present simulator study, and functional and dysfunctional impulsivity dimensions yielded different patterns of associations with driver behavior measures on the simulator. For instance, functional impulsivity yielded significant associations with standard deviation of lateral lane position, while dysfunctional impulsivity was significantly associated with mean velocity. Eye-movements of the participants while driving on the simulator were also recorded and examined as an explorative effort. The findings are discussed with regard to previous research.",1369-8478,Not found
Correlates of self-reported driving aberrations in Tehran: A study at the level of drivers and districts,10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.001,63,2019-05-01,2019,5,"There are relatively few comprehensive studies on driving errors and violations in Iran, a non-Western country with a high traffic fatality rate. In this study, 712 drivers completed a questionnaire at technical inspection centres and carwashes in Tehran, Iran. Respondents were asked about their demographic characteristics, accident involvement, traffic fines, and driving aberrations in the form of the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). The results of a principal component analysis of the DBQ showed a distinction between errors and two types of violations: speeding and non-speeding violations. Correlation analyses showed that DBQ violations were associated with a higher driving mileage, a higher education level (for DBQ speeding violations in particular), and younger age. DBQ errors were associated with risk perception, that is, the belief that one has a high probability of becoming involved in a car accident. Regression analyses showed that the DBQ speeding violations score was predictive of the number of speeding tickets and that the DBQ non-speeding violations score was predictive of involvement in minor accidents in the past three years. A correlation analysis at the level of municipal districts showed that drivers from districts with lower education and literacy levels and lower car ownership were more likely to report driving a low-cost car and had lower DBQ violations scores. These results can be interpreted as indicating that affluence enables deviant driving. We conclude that the error-violation distinction is of relevance to road safety in Tehran, both at the level of individual drivers and at the level of districts.",1369-8478,Not found
The golden rules of ecodriving? The effect of providing hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) drivers with a newly developed set of ecodriving-tips,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.003,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"To advance eco-driving skills in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) drivers, and thus facilitate fuel efficient driving behavior, a set of 15 ecodriving-tips was developed and tested. In part 1, car owner manuals and telephone interviews with HEV expert ecodrivers were analyzed to extract ecodriving-related statements. As the owner manual statements were too generic to be used for the content generation of the ecodriving-tips, only their style was used for formulation purposes at a later stage. The interview statements were used for the content generation, and thus condensed into a concise set of 15 ecodriving-tips. This set was then formulated in three versions. Version 1 was based on the “no context, no details” formulation style extracted from the owner manuals. Version 2 and 3 were psychologically-grounded: Version 2 was based on the concept of implementation intentions, and therefore contained “if-then-plans”. For Version 3, these “if-then-plans” were coupled with technical explanations to additionally target the improvement of drivers’ mental models. Eventually, to ensure technical correctness, all three versions were reviewed by a HEV powertrain expert. In part 2, a longitudinal field study with two points of measurement was conducted to test the three versions in a randomized controlled design. For this, HEV drivers were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups. At baseline, each group received and evaluated a different version of the ecodriving-tips and was then asked to test the tips over the next 31 days. At follow-up, all groups, again, evaluated the ecodriving-tips. At both points of measurement self-reported fuel consumption was assessed. To sum up, 81 participants evaluated the tips as largely positive, both at baseline and follow-up. Furthermore, participants who received Version 3 of the ecodriving-tips (implementation intentions and technical explanations) significantly reduced their fuel consumption by 4% on average over time.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ recognition of pedestrian road-crossing intentions: Performance and process,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.004,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Drivers’ recognition of pedestrian road crossing intentions is an essential process during driver-pedestrian interaction. However, compared with the rich observational findings on interaction behavior, little is known on drivers’ performance in recognizing pedestrian intentions, as well as the underlying cognitive processes. To fill in the gap, this study evaluated drivers’ performance in making judgments of pedestrians’ road crossing intentions in recorded natural driving scenes. Experienced and novice drivers identified pedestrians as “will cross” or “will not cross” at some time-to-arrival while their eye movements were recorded. The results showed that experienced drivers were more conservative in discriminating whether a pedestrian would cross or not (preferred a “pedestrian will cross” judgment) and took a higher level of information processing of pedestrian intention. Regardless of driving experience, drivers had a higher detection rate, earlier detection, higher level of information processing and quicker response over pedestrians who intended to cross than those did not intend to cross. A quicker response was also achieved when the time-to-arrival was smaller. Analysis of eye movements showed attentional bias to the upper body of pedestrians when recognizing intention. These findings offer an initial understanding of the intention recognition process during driver-pedestrian interaction and inform directions for autonomous driving research when interacting with pedestrians.",1369-8478,Not found
Who's in the driver's seat?

We examined how transport mode and current driving status affects social participation and psychosocial wellbeing. Data were collected from 8092 community-dwelling adults aged ≥50 years in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a nationally representative cohort study. Regression analysis was used, examining associations between transport mode and driving status with depressive symptoms, quality of life, loneliness, monthly involvement in active social leisure activities and volunteering and social network strength. 89.8% of adults travel most frequently by car; 72.2% drive themselves. Driving, being driven by a spouse/partner and taking public transport were independently associated with better indicators of social participation and psychosocial wellbeing versus relying on lifts from family/friends. Non-drivers and less frequent drivers had poorer outcomes versus current drivers. These results highlight the importance of being able to travel independently whether by car or public transport. Opportunities to support this should be considered when planning future transport needs of ageing populations.",1369-8478,Not found
Response times and gaze behavior of truck drivers in time critical conditional automated driving take-overs,10.1016/j.trf.2019.06.008,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The desire to enable conditional automated driving (CAD) in the near future, entails the challenge to manage drivers’ safe transitions from automation back to manual control. Several factors have been considered in recent years in the passenger car context, while the truck has largely been disregarded. For the first time take-over behavior of heavy-duty truck drivers in time critical take-overs is considered in CAD research. This study analyzes the effect of non-driving related tasks, CAD duration, take-over situations and number of take-overs on reaction times of truck drivers. Gaze behavior was tracked with a remote eye-tracker; reaction times and driver interaction during CAD drives was recorded and analyzed. Two different non-driving related tasks were presented in nine unique take-over situations, while also controlling for the duration of CAD. Contrary to assumption, no influence of non-driving related tasks or CAD duration on reaction times is found. Notably, different reaction times are recorded due to the nine unique take-over situations. Finally, it is shown that our take-over times decrease over the course of the experiment and are far lower than other published reaction times (M = 1.35 s) in the passenger car context.

Incorporating car owner preferences for the introduction of economic incentives for speed limit enforcement,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.014,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Human error including driving misbehavior contributes to over 90 percent of road vehicle accidents, and speeding is considered to be risky. Smart technologies, such as Connected Vehicle System (CVS) are among the interesting technical options to improve driving behavior, and Pay-As-You-Speed (PAYS) is an effective economic incentive to reduce speed violations. We investigated the acceptability of CVS with and without the presence of economic incentives, such as PAYS, in the context of a middle-income country: Iran. We used a Zero-Inflated Ordered Probit model (ZIOP) to estimate drivers’ willingness to pay for a CVS, and a hazard-based model for predicting the incentive level needed for accepting CVS via a PAYS scheme. ZIOP model indicated that drivers with the following characteristics were more likely to pay more for CVS: having a comprehensive insurance coverage, being younger than 60 years, owning more than one car, and having older vehicles. The hazard-based model also confirmed that drivers that speed relatively often have a lower tendency to adopt CVS, and drivers who experienced an accident in the past were more inclined to adopt CVS via PAYS. Also, drivers' opinion about CVS, vehicle characteristics, demographics, and driving experience influenced the effect of PAYS characteristics on acceptability of CVS. Finally, we offer recommendations for how to effectively implement CVS, in order to significantly reduce the high fatality and accident rates in middle-income countries such as Iran.",1369-8478,Not found
Influence of bicyclist presence on driver performance during automated vehicle take-over requests,10.1016/j.trf.2019.06.007,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"One proposed benefit of automated vehicles (AVs) is their potential to mitigate the occurrence of serious crashes due to human error or poor decision making while driving. However, there are still many concerns associated with the use of SAE Level 3 AVs, which require intervention by a human driver after a take-over request (TOR). These concerns intensify when vulnerable road users, such as bicyclists, are introduced to the driving environment. The objective of this research was to investigate how human drivers of AVs interact with bicyclists during a right-turn maneuver after receiving a TOR. Changes in driver performance, including visual attention and crash avoidance behavior, were measured by using a high-fidelity driving simulator, with 43 participants each completing 18 right-turn maneuvers. Three independent variables were studied: the bicyclist’s proximity to the intersection, the driver’s proximity from the intersection when the TOR was received, and the driver’s engagement in a distracting secondary task (a game on a tablet). In general, the results showed that the introduction of the secondary task led to decreased driver performance with respect to time-to-collision and the time that it took a driver to first identify the bicyclist on the roadway. When given more time to react before the intersection, drivers generally had safer interactions with the bicyclist.",1369-8478,Not found
How speed and visibility influence preferred headway distances in highly automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2019.06.009,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"While the introduction of highly automated vehicles promises lower accident numbers, a main requirement for wide use of these vehicles will be the acceptance by drivers. In this study a crucial variable for the acceptance of highly automated vehicles, the vehicle to vehicle distance expressed in time headway, was researched in a driving simulator. Research has shown that time headway distances, perceived as comfortable in self-driving and assisted driving with adaptive cruise control, remain constant over a range of different speeds. This study aims to test these findings for highly automated driving. Since time headway is perceived visually, the driving situation was varied to investigate the influence of visibility on the subjective comfort of the driver in a highly automated driving situation. In a within-subject design, drivers followed a passenger car in clear weather conditions, the same passenger car in fog which occluded parts of the traffic environment, as well as a truck that occluded the lane ahead, also in clear weather condition. Subjective comfort of drivers in each condition was rated with a haptic rating lever. Results suggest that comfortable time headway following distances in highly automated driving are not constant over different speeds, but that these distances decrease with increasing speed. Reduced visibility generally led to a shift in comfortable following distances towards larger headways. These results have implications for the introduction of highly automated vehicles and their time headway adjustments, which will need to be adaptive to speed and visibility in the road environment.",1369-8478,Not found
How drivers perceive traffic?

It is assumed that the perceived traffic climate in a given context is closely related to driver behaviors. In the current study, this assumption was tested cross-culturally for the first time. The aim was to compare the perceived traffic climate and driver behaviors between Turkey and China. Also, the relationships between traffic climate and driver behaviors in Turkey and China were investigated. In the study, there were 292 drivers aged between 21 and 64 years from China and 294 drivers aged between 19 and 61 from Turkey. The results revealed that Turkish drivers perceived their traffic climate higher in internal requirements and lower in external affective demands and functionality than Chinese drivers. Among driver behaviors, Turkish drivers reported higher numbers of violation and lower numbers of error than Chinese drivers. Perceiving traffic climate as externally demanding was positively related to aberrant driver behaviors (i.e., violations and errors) and negatively related to positive driver behaviors in both Turkey and China. Functionality was negatively related to violations in Turkey, and internal requirements were negatively related to violations in China. In both Turkey and China, external affective demands and functionality were closely related to driver behaviors and might be critical dimensions in road traffic safety. The interventions to improve road traffic safety should be planned based on the differences among cultures. Based on the differences, it might be plausible to suggest that more functional traffic is desired to increase road safety in Turkey, whereas higher internal requirements are important to increase road safety in China.",1369-8478,Not found
The measure for angry drivers (MAD),10.1016/j.trf.2019.06.002,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Although interest in driver anger has increased over the past few decades, the scales for measuring the tendency to driving anger have remained relatively unchanged in terms of the items within them. However, in more recent studies, researchers have found it necessary to modify these instruments, sometimes considerably, suggesting that scales to measure how drivers feel about driving require updating. This paper reports two studies aimed at developing an updated measure for trait driver anger. From an initial pool of 105 items, including items related to contemporary driving contexts, a scale with 23 items and three underlying factors was derived (Study 1) and subsequently confirmed using an independent sample (Study 2). The Measure for Angry Drivers (MAD) consists of three factors: danger posed by others (12 items); travel delays (7 items) and aggression from others (4 items). All three factors showed good reliability. Factors of the MAD were found to be positively related to trait anger and aggressive tendencies, demonstrating good construct validity. While further research is required to extend beyond self-reports, the MAD is a promising new tool for assessing driver tendency to become angered across different driving situations. Scales such as this are important as they provide measures of the emotions that underlie dangerous and risky driving behaviours. It is only by understanding the mechanisms behind these behaviours that we can reduce them.",1369-8478,Not found

Background Assessing valid measurements in driving simulators causes concern because driving simulators are not yet as realistic as real on-road driving scenarios. Common methods like pre-defined training sessions and self-appraisals of simulator adaptation might therefore be insufficient to ensure actual valid data. Hence, influential variables on this discrepancy are investigated. Method In total, N = 203 drivers participated in a training session and a subsequent testing session in a close-to-production driving simulator. Subjective adaptation was estimated by the drivers and an objective adaptation value was gathered on the basis of driving accuracy. The discrepancy between these two measures was calculated and related to age, self-reported driving experience and occurrence of previous adaptation. Results Subjective adaptation was significantly faster than objective adaptation but neither drivers’ age, experience, nor previous adaptation could explain this discrepancy. Discussion Results indicate that younger and older drivers likewise underestimate the time needed for adaptation. Measuring a subjective point of adaptation seems to be an insufficient measure to ensure simulator validity when assessing both older and younger drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Predicting transport-related cycling in Chinese employees using an integration of perceived physical environment and social cognitive factors,10.1016/j.trf.2019.06.003,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Objective Transport-related cycling can contribute to employees’ increased physical activities in their daily lives, with potential health and environmental benefits. Still, a theoretical understanding of the links between the perceptions of physical environment and transport-related cycling through social cognitive theories is unclear. In addition, there is a lack of understanding on the moderating effects of the perceived physical environment on social cognitive pathways when predicting transport-related cycling. The purpose of this study was to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework to determine (a) whether TPB mediates the effects between the perceived physical environment and transport-related cycling and (b) whether the perceived physical environment moderates TPB-cycling relations. Methods Using a prospective design, Chinese employees (N = 193) self-reported their perceived physical environment of their workplace neighborhood (i.e., residential density, land-use diversity, land-use accessibility, street connectivity, infrastructures, aesthetics, traffic-related safety, and crime-related safety), attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavior control (PBC), intention, and duration and frequency of transport-related cycling in the last week. One month later, self-reported cycling for transport was again collected from a subset sample of employees (N = 98). Mediation and moderation structural equation models linking perceived physical environment, TPB constructs, and transport-related cycling were tested. Results The effects from residential density to attitudes and subjective norm, from land-use diversity and street connectivity to subjective norm and PBC, and from aesthetics and crime-related safety to attitudes, were found significant and positive. Attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC predicted intention, in which intention further predicted employee’s future transport-related cycling one month later. Importantly, attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC mediated the relations from land-use diversity and street connectivity to intention, while intention mediated the effect from PBC to employee’s future transport-related cycling. Past behavior showed significant effects on attitudes, subjective norm, PBC, intention, and employee’s future transport-related cycling. The effect from past behavior to intention was mediated by the social cognitive variables of attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC. However, no moderating effects of perceived physical environments on the TPB-cycling relations were found, except the moderating effect of crime-related safety on the path from PBC to cycling. Conclusion Current results indicate that Chinese employees’ transport-related cycling are a function of environmental (i.e., perceived physical environmental attributes) and social cognitive (i.e., attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention) factors. Findings of the current study can inform the development of multi-component behavioral change interventions targeting the improvement of transport-related cycling for employees.",1369-8478,Not found
When personal norms predict the acceptability of push and pull car-reduction policies: Testing the ABC model and low-cost hypothesis,10.1016/j.trf.2019.06.005,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Policymakers may be reluctant to implement pro-environmental policies that the public find unacceptable, such as policies intended to reduce car use. It is, therefore, essential to understand factors that influence acceptability of such measures. We aimed to study to what extent policy acceptability of car-reduction policies is related to personal norms to do the “right thing” and perceived costs associated with the policies. We hypothesized, in line with the A-B-C model, that personal norms would be more strongly related to policy acceptability when the policy was associated with moderate personal costs, rather than with very low or high costs. Such a finding would be somewhat contrary to the low-cost hypothesis, which predicts a simple linear relationship between costs and personal norm, such that personal norms become better predictors of acceptability as costs decrease. We tested this hypothesis in two ways, using data from 6045 people from seven European countries. First, we hypothesised and found that personal norms were less predictive of the acceptability of a pull measure involving few external costs (improved provision of public transport) than of a push measure involving a higher degree of cost (increased car-use taxes), across all countries. Second, we hypothesised and found that, overall, personal norms were more predictive of acceptability of the push measure when respondents felt more able to reduce their car use, and thus when the push measure would be associated with lower personal costs. This result was stronger for some countries than for others. We discuss implications for policy.",1369-8478,Not found
Gaze behaviour and electrodermal activity: Objective measures of drivers’ trust in automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.021,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Studies show that drivers’ intention to use automated vehicles is strongly modulated by trust. It follows that their benefits are unlikely to be achieved if users do not trust them. To date, most studies of trust in automated vehicles have relied on self-reports.

In previous work, we found evidence that gaze behaviour could provide an effective measure of trust. In this study we tested whether combining gaze behaviour with Electrodermal Activity could provide a stronger metric. The results indicated a strong relationship between self-reported trust, monitoring behaviour and Electrodermal Activity: The higher participants’ self-reported trust, the less they monitored the road, the more attention they paid to a non-driving related secondary task, and the lower their Electrodermal Activity. We also found evidence that combined measures of gaze behaviour and Electrodermal Activity predict self-reported trust better than either of these measures on its own. These findings suggest that such combined measures have the potential to provide a reliable and objective real-time indicator of driver trust.",1369-8478,Not found
Mobile phone use while cycling: A study based on the theory of planned behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.020,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"To examine the factors that influence mobile phone use while cycling, mobile phone addiction and perceptions of distraction were included in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) model to explore the relationship between the psychological factors of mobile phone use and cycling from the perspective of social psychology. This study tested the reliability and validity of an extended TPB questionnaire (with 603 eligible responses), explored the correlation between personality factors and other psychological factors, and constructed a structural equation model of mobile phone use behavior while cycling based on the improved TPB model. Consequently, the relationship path between various influencing factors was obtained. The results indicate that neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness are significantly associated with psychological factors. In addition, the TPB can effectively explain and predict mobile phone use behavior while cycling. Mobile phone addiction, distraction perception and behavioral intention are the most important influencing factors, followed by perceived behavioral control. The influence of attitude and subjective norms is weak. The research results may have positive effects on the prevention and reduction of bicycle accidents and improvements to the safety of cyclists. Additionally, the results provide strong evidence to support the policies of the road traffic safety management department.",1369-8478,Not found
Understanding impacts of aggressive driving on freeway safety and mobility: A multi-agent driving simulation approach,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.017,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Considering that aggressive driving behavior significantly contributes to crash occurrences, it is necessary to establish appropriate safety strategies for managing and suppressing the risk factor of aggressive driving behavior. Understanding the characteristics of aggressive driving and its impact on traffic stream is fundamental to developing safety countermeasures. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the crash potential under the various aggressive driving events on freeways based on both driving simulators and microscopic traffic simulation model, VISSIM. A novel feature of this study is the application of a multi-agent driving simulation facility, where two driving simulators are connected to establish a network that can render synchronized driving in the same space. The results of the driving simulation were used for modifying the driving behavior parameters of VISSIM. This approach will enable to effectively represent the driving behavior of aggressive drivers and normal drivers under various aggressive driving cases. Study results indicated that aggressive driving deteriorated not only the network safety performance represented by the crash potential index (CPI) but also the mobility represented by travel speeds. The outcomes of this study would be useful in developing well-informed countermeasures and supporting policy making-activities to prevent aggressive driving events.",1369-8478,Not found
Visualizing distances as a function of speed: Design and evaluation of a distance-speedometer,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.012,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper contributes to the research on transportation and human factors by designing and evaluating an ecological human-machine interface for speed and distance control. In the future, traffic management will determine optima for speed and safety distances. Wirelessly broadcasted, the question remains how to present this information to drivers in a way that is easily understood and intuitively followed. To this end, a human-machine interface, called distance-speedometer, was first developed according to the principles of ecological interface design and then evaluated in a driving simulator study with forty-nine participants. It presents augmented distances derived from speed in a head-up display. Using a within-subject design, the distance-speedometer and standard speedometer were compared against each other in two scenarios (car-following & sign-following). Each scenario triggered several speed changes. When reacting to speed signs, driving performance did not differ between the two interfaces. However, with the distance-speedometer, visual workload was reduced as more secondary tasks could be completed. When reacting to speed changes of a car ahead, the engagement in the secondary task did not differ significantly between the two interfaces. However, the variance of speed deviations was significantly lower with the distance-speedometer. Results can be explained by the ability to process the distance-speedometer in a skill-based manner, whereas the normal speedometer demands rule-based behaviour to control the speed. With regard to traffic management, the distance-speedometer might be used to unconsciously influence the driver’s choice of speed in order to increase traffic safety and efficiency.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver profiling – Data-based identification of driver behavior dimensions and affecting driver characteristics for multi-agent traffic simulation,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.007,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper focusses on the role of driver individuality in the field of cognitive driver behavior modeling for the prospective safety impact assessment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving functions. Virtual traffic simulation requires valid models for the environment, the vehicle and the driver. Especially modeling human driver behavior is a major challenge, which in recent years has already led to the development of various driver models for the purpose of virtual simulation. Modeling human behavior in traffic with a precise representation of human cognition, capability and individuality, are crucial demands, which require thorough investigation and understanding of the human driver. Current driver behavior models often leave aside the aspect of driver individuality and lack the consideration of differences in driving behavior between different drivers. To take into account all the aspects from complex human cognitive processes to individual differences in action implementation, the Stochastic Cognitive Model (SCM) was developed. The SCM is based on five subcomponents: gaze control, information acquisition, mental model, action manager and situation manager (=decision making process) and action implementation. The aim of the present study is to provide a basis for establishing a solid logic for the integration of driver individuality into the current structure of the SCM by creating a new submodule that takes into account several behavior affecting driver characteristics. This subcomponent controls the stochastic variance in several driver behavior parameters, such as velocity or comfort longitudinal acceleration. In a representative driving simulator study with 43 participants, driver behavior on the highway was investigated and thoroughly analyzed. Information about several relevant driver characteristics and personality traits of the participants was collected and a logical hierarchical model was set up to cluster several dependent and independent variables into four layers: independent manifest driver variables, such as age or gender (Level 1), latent driver personality factors, such as thrill seeking or anxiety (Level 2), driver behavior dimensions, such as dynamics and law conformity (Level 3), and various dependent driver behavior parameters, such as velocity, acceleration or speed limit violation (Level 4). Multiple linear regression analyses were run to find the individual driver characteristics and personality traits, by which most of the stochastic variance in the measured driver behavior parameters can be explained. Subsequently, a principal component analysis (PCA) was run to test, if the previously clustered driver behavior parameters were loading on the presumed behavioral dimensions on the third level of the model to identify significant components of driver behavior, such as dynamics or law conformity. Results of the present study show significant correlations between driver characteristics and driver behavior parameters. According to the results of the PCA, variability in driver behavior can be explained to a great extent by three largely independent components: (1) Speed and cruise control, (2) Dynamics and (3) Driver performance. With the consideration of driver individuality in driver behavior models for the agent-based traffic simulation, validity of the results from prospective safety impact assessment analyses of automated driving functions can be enhanced. Beyond that, the findings of the current study can be used as a solid basis for the development of adaptive functions in the field of vehicle automation, considering the different driving skills and preferences of drivers with different individual profiles.",1369-8478,Not found
Safety culture among bus drivers in Norway and Greece,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.006,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The aims of the present paper are to: (1) Examine the influence of national safety culture, sector safety focus and organizational safety culture on the safety behaviours of professional drivers, compared with other explanatory variables (e.g. age, type of transport, working conditions), and to (2) Examine the influence of safety behaviours and other factors (e.g. age, mileage, type of transport) on self-reported crash involvement. A survey was conducted, including 215 bus drivers in Norway and Greece. Our study provides four main results. First, more bus drivers in Greece than in Norway report being involved in more aggressive violations in traffic (e.g. become angered by other drivers and indicate hostility, sound their horn). Second, aggressive violations were predicted by national road safety culture, specified as descriptive norms (“violations”) and values/attitudes (individual freedom to take risk in traffic). Third, Greek bus drivers' aggressive violations in traffic predicted their self-reported crash involvement, although reports on “work related variables” (e.g. experienced work pressure) were more strongly correlated with their crash involvement than their self-reported aggressive violations. Fourth, organizational safety culture contributed negatively to aggressive road safety behaviours, meaning that a positive organizational safety culture may reduce (the negative impact of national road safety culture on) aggressive violations in traffic. Although more research is needed, our study indicates a relationship between national road safety culture, road safety behaviour and crash involvement, that could be developed further to help explain differences in national road safety records.",1369-8478,Not found
Anger and highly automated driving in urban areas: The role of time pressure,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.016,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Highly automated vehicles in urban areas will adopt a safe and cautious driving style, which is likely to result in frequent stops and yields while negotiating interactions in complex traffic environments. Users may not expect, comprehend or accept such behaviors from their vehicle. Considering that most daily trips are completed under time pressure, drivers may feel frustrated and decide to take over manual control in an attempt to save time. The current study aimed at investigating the impact of time pressure while driving a highly automated vehicle in urban areas in terms of anger and frustration. Forty participants drove a highly automated vehicle with or without time pressure in a driving simulator. The driving scenario included rural roads with light traffic and urban roads with traffic congestion and driving impediments. Data on mood, attitude and driver behavior were collected. Results indicate that urban automated driving in congested conditions deteriorated participants’ mood, independently of time pressure. Additionally, the number of takeovers on driver’s initiative was higher under time pressure. This study demonstrates that driving a highly automated vehicle in urban areas may have adverse effects for user’s emotional state. As long as drivers are uncomfortable with the vehicle behavior, they may decide to takeover in complex situations. Therefore, it is important to consider the emotional dimension of driving highly automated vehicles. Otherwise, expected benefits of automation for traffic congestion and safety may be compromised.",1369-8478,Not found
Psychosocial benefits and positive mood related to habitual bicycle use,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.018,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This study explores the relations between cycling habits, eudaimonic well-being and positive mood. Specifically, this study investigates whether cycling contributes to the formation of positive physical, social, and self-actualisation concepts, which in turn could affect the mood and well-being of travellers. A survey was administered to 1131 inhabitants of the Brisbane area in Australia to elicit their socioeconomic traits and travel habits, as well as to measure self-concepts related to self-actualisation and the relation between cycling and mood. Structural equation modelling explored the system of relations between socioeconomic characteristics, observed travel habits, and latent self-concepts. The results of this study highlight that there exists a positive relation between bicycle use, self-actualisation on physical, psychological, social and self-efficacy dimensions and positive mood. Also, the findings of this study suggest that policy implications follow: (i) active travel to school and work should be promoted as a mean to increase the eudaimonic capacity through cycling, as this is one of the most important capacities for both children and adults; (ii) improvements in cycling infrastructure would not only foster higher cycling rates, but also reduce stress for commuter cyclists; (iii) eudaimonic benefits should be included in multi-criteria and cost-benefit analyses to better grasp cycling benefits.",1369-8478,Not found
Establishment of the characteristic evaluation index system of secondary task driving and analyzing its importance,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.013,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The study of secondary task driving behavior is a spotlight in the domain of transportation research, the precondition of this is to have a scientific evaluation index system which could be used for quantitative analysis of driver behaviors. In order to get the scientific characteristic evaluation index system of secondary task driving and weigh the values of each index. The parameters of the driver’s eye-movement behavior and vehicle operation state were measured by using a “driver behavior analysis experimental platform”, and the change rule of driving was investigated. After the linear dimensional reduction by Principal Component Analysis, the redundant evaluation indexes were eliminated and the amount of evaluation indexes was simplified from 17 to 8, then the index set which could reflect the characteristic of driver’s behavior was built. On this foundation, the weights of each characteristic evaluation index were calculated by entropy method. The results showed that in the characteristic evaluation index set, the weight of Standard Deviation of Blink Duration is 0.269, which indicates it is the most significant one. The weight of Peak Value of Saccadic Velocity and Mean Blink Duration were 0.022 and 0.015, indicating that they are the least significant ones.",1369-8478,Not found
Endangering yourself to save another: A real life ethical dilemma,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.015,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Unlike hypothetical trolley problem studies and an ongoing ethical dilemma with autonomous vehicles, road users can face similar ethical dilemmas in real life. Swerving a heavy vehicle towards the road-side in order to avoid a head-on crash with a much lighter passenger car is often the only option available which could save lives. However, running off-road increases the probability of a roll-over and endangers the life of the heavy vehicle driver. We have created an experimental survey study in which heavy vehicle drivers randomly received one of two possible scenarios. We found that respondents were more likely to report they would ditch their vehicle in order to save the hypothetical driver who fell asleep than to save the driver who deliberately diverted their car towards the participant’s heavy vehicle. Additionally, the higher the empathy score, the higher the probability of ditching a vehicle. Implications for autonomous vehicle programming are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver profiles based on values and traffic safety climate and their relationships with driver behaviors,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.010,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Drivers have an important place in the traffic system when the human factor is taken into consideration. Drivers from different cultures are exposed to different values, norms, and traffic systems, and these differences may form various driver behaviors. Thus, traffic climate and individual values can impact driver behaviors. In this study, the relationships between Schwartz’s individual values and traffic climate dimensions were examined. Clusters were then created from the traffic climate dimensions and individual values, and the differences in driver behavior within these clusters were investigated. In order to examine similarities and differences between countries, the results from 5 countries (Estonia, Greece, Kosovo, Russia, and Turkey) are presented. Correlational analyses indicated that, while internal requirements and self-transcendence are positively related in all countries, external affective demands and conservation are positively related in Estonia, Kosovo, Russia, and Turkey. Additionally, external affective demands and self-transcendence are positively related in Greece, Kosovo, Russia, and Turkey. A three-cluster structure fitted the data well in all of the five countries. Within-country differences were observed in clusters of Russian and Turkish data in terms of driver behaviors.

Modelling the relationship between different Blood Alcohol Concentrations and reaction time of young and mature drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.011,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Driving under the influence of alcohol impairs the driving performance and increases the crash risks worldwide. The present study investigated the effect of different Blood Alcohol Concentrations (BAC) on the reaction time of Indian drivers of two age groups (Young: less than 25 years; Mature: 25 years and above) through a driving simulator experiment. Reaction times were measured for the two hazardous events: (1) pedestrian crossing event and (2) road crossing event by parked vehicles. Seventy nine licensed drivers drove on the driving simulator under the influence of four BAC levels (0.00%, 0.03%, 0.05% and 0.08%). To analyse the reaction times, two Weibull AFT (Accelerated Failure Time) models with gamma frailty were developed for both the events separately by incorporating the different alcohol conditions and driver characteristics (such as driver’s age, driving experience and frequent consumption of alcohol) as the explanatory variables. It was observed that the BAC levels of 0.03%, 0.05% and 0.08% resulted in 36%, 53% and 94% increment in the reaction times of the drivers for the pedestrian crossing event and 64%, 78% and 116% increment in the reaction times for road crossing event by the parked vehicles respectively. A year increase in the driving experience resulted in 2% reduction in the reaction times, and mature drivers responded 15% faster than the young drivers. Interestingly, frequent drinkers showed 11% quicker response than the drivers who drink rarely. Overall, the results showed that the stimulus-response behaviour of the drivers was impaired in all the intoxicated states. The research findings may assist the countermeasure studies and policy-making against alcohol-impaired driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring older adults hearing and vision and driving – The Swedish study,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.011,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Aim The aims of this study were to evaluate the self-reported driving abilities and use of visual and hearing aids for driving, among older adults with varying degrees of hearing impairment (HI), vision impairment (VI) and dual sensory impairment (DSI). Visual processing related to driving performance was also assessed to provide a laboratory-based index of driving ability and safety. The research examined the associations between self-reported and clinically measured vision and hearing, and how they related to the level of comfort in various driving situations and the use of hearing and vision aids (spectacles) when driving. Method Participants included 109 older adults (58 women, 51 men) aged over 60 years (M age = 69.5 years (SD = 5.25), age range: 60–87) who held a valid driver’s license. Following attendance at the testing session that involved clinical measures of vision and hearing and an assessment of visual processing abilities, the participants were categorized into four groups according to their hearing and vision abilities: no visual or hearing impairment (NI), corrected visual impairment (CVI), hearing impairment (HI), and corrected visual impairment combined with hearing impairment (CVHI). All participants filled in a questionnaire covering subjective measures of vision, hearing, driving habits, and use of vision and hearing aids. Results and Conclusion There was a strong association between most of the subjective and objective measures of both hearing and vision, which indicates that participants in this study were aware of their abilities to some extent. Better hearing and vision measures were associated with higher level of comfort in several traffic situations. The results also show that spectacles are used more than hearing aids when driving (95% versus 57% of the time respectively). In addition, both the measured and the experienced benefits of hearing aids were significantly associated with the amount of hearing aid use when driving. The findings of this study provide the basis for larger scale studies to explore the impact of hearing and visual impairment on driving and the use of vision and hearing aids and should also include participants who have visual impairment even with their optimal optical correction to fully explore these effects.",1369-8478,Not found

All US states have a threshold for visual acuity (e.g. most use 20/40 for an unrestricted license). Contrast sensitivity (CS) is not measured for licensure, despite evidence that it may be a better predictor of crash risk than visual acuity (VA). Two experiments were conducted to investigate how simulated reductions in VA and CS affect the detection of pedestrians in a driving simulator during the daytime in a highway setting. Young normally-sighted current drivers wore goggles simulating different levels of VA and CS loss (within a range that would meet licensing criteria) and pressed the horn as soon as they saw a pedestrian. The proportion of pedestrians detected and driving speed was not different between the conditions. Reducing VA alone did not significantly reduce reaction time or the deceleration needed to stop before the collision point. However, adding a CS loss to a VA deficit increased both reaction time and the deceleration required to stop before the collision point. These results suggest that an individual’s CS should be considered when determining visual fitness to drive, especially in the early stages of ocular disease, such as cataract, where CS may be impaired while high contrast VA is still relatively unimpaired.",1369-8478,Not found

A population of 40 individuals was tested, with metrics for control takeover quantification given by vehicle maximum lane offset with respect to the lane centerline, and integral offset over an S-curve turn to compare performance during recovery after automation technology failure and conventional manual driving. Independent variables for the study are the age of the driver, the speed at the time of disengagement, and time at which the disengagement occurs (i.e., how long automation was engaged for). Overall results show better performance for lower speed settings with maximum drift increasing over 116% for higher speed settings. Moreover, contrary to expectations, the age factor was found to be not statistically significant for drift performance, with older participants performing better than or equal to the younger age groups. The time dependency observed was non-linear, and the results highlighted the need for additional testing for this variable.

The median reported year was 2030. The later the survey date, the smaller the percentage of respondents who reported that most cars would be able to drive fully automatically by 2020, with 15–22% of the respondents providing this estimate in the surveys conducted between 2014 and 2016 versus 3–5% in the 2018 surveys. Respondents who completed multiple surveys were more likely to revise their estimate upward (39.4%) than downward (35.3%). Correlational analyses showed that people from more affluent countries and people who have heard of the Google Driverless Car (Waymo) or the Tesla Autopilot reported a significantly earlier year. Finally, we made a comparison between the crowdsourced respondents and respondents from a technical university who answered the same question; the median year reported by the latter group was 2040.

Frequent versus occasional drivers: A hybrid route choice model,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.009,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Previous route choice studies have mostly focused on the effect of observable factors, such as route attributes and socio-economic characteristics, on individuals’ decisions. However, route choice decisions might not be exclusively dependent on these observable variables, but also on latent variables, which cannot be directly observed and measured. Also, the latent behavioral heterogeneity among the population has mostly been ignored by assuming that all the individuals in the sample population have similar attitudes, perceptions, and lifestyles. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to explicitly incorporate latent behavioral constructs as well as segment heterogeneity based on a probabilistic segmentation of the population. We apply the proposed framework to compare the route choice behavior of frequent versus occasional drivers. An Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model is used to bring in the role of the underlying behavioral constructs, while a Latent Class model accounts for taste heterogeneity across the two segments of our sample population. An Extended Path-Size Logit model is adopted as the choice model component and a Metropolis-Hastings based algorithm is used to generate route alternatives. Data is collected through a web-based survey designed to collect behavioral data on drivers’ route choices, using psychometric indicators and behavioral questions on respondents’ perceptions and attitudes. Results confirm that the inclusion of latent variables and latent heterogeneity across population segments significantly improve the explanatory power of the choice model, and illustrate how the route choice behavior of frequent car users is different from that of occasional ones.",1369-8478,Not found

This paper presents a pilot study applying a simple vigilance task to simulate the monitoring condition during a partially automated driving session. We gained insights on how drivers voluntarily schedule secondary task processing according to the current and anticipatory monitoring demand on a structured three-level manna. Results indicated that participants’ anticipation of a higher hazard event rate or a higher urgency level could promote more attention to monitoring the hazard. Furthermore, when the expectation of an upcoming hazard increased, participants allocated more attention to discharge the surveillance role.

Understanding mode choice decisions for shopping mall trips in metro cities of developing countries,10.1016/j.trf.2019.05.002,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The traditional travel demand model for an urban region generally considers work trips as the major constituent which subsequently attracts the maximum focus on mode choice analysis. However, with the increase in traffic-related problems coupled with the evolving lifestyle of people in general, it has become imperative to focus on trips intended for other purposes as well. In most of the urban scenarios, shopping trips constitute the second most frequented trips after work trips. The present study aims to develop a mode choice model exclusively for shopping malls in Mumbai city and determine the factors which influence a trip maker’s behavior of mode choice in the context of a developing country. Choice of mode for shopping mall trips is important in relation to the impact of the vehicular traffic generated from the shopping malls on the adjacent road networks as well as in the planning of the parking space allocations at the malls along with providing critical insights on the influential factors to the transport planners for policy recommendation. Revealed Preference (RP) survey technique is used to collect 650 samples of data regarding trip makers’ choice of mode to shopping malls by interviewing individuals at various shopping malls across Mumbai. A Multinomial Logit (MNL) model is initially developed, followed by a Nested Logit (NL) model by grouping the private modes in a single nest. The significance level of the variables used in both the models are mostly consistent. Both the models reveal that travel time has a significant role in the mode choice behavior. While walking time and access time notably affect the utility of public transport mode, factors like number of accompanying persons and driving license possession also influence the private modes significantly. Socio-demographic characteristics like age, gender and occupation are also found to be critical in the mode choice behavior for shopping mall trips. A comparative analysis of the MNL and NL models reveals that the NL model outperforms the MNL model both in terms of goodness of fit and prediction success rate. However, both the models (MNL with a predictive success rate of over 72% and NL with a predictive success rate of about 77%) fairly captures the factors affecting the mode choice behavior for trips to shopping malls. The study can help policy makers to understand the factors affecting the choice of mode for such trips and can aid in planning strategies to minimize traffic congestion resulting from the increasing number of shopping malls.",1369-8478,Not found

We used three complementary approaches: (1) a within-study analysis, in which differences in mean take-over time were assessed for pairs of experimental conditions, (2) a between-study analysis, in which correlations between experimental conditions and mean take-over times were assessed, and (3) a linear mixed-effects model combining between-study and within-study effects. The three methods showed that a shorter mean take-over time is associated with a higher urgency of the situation, not using a handheld device, not performing a visual non-driving task, having experienced another take-over scenario before in the experiment, and receiving an auditory or vibrotactile take-over request as compared to a visual-only or no take-over request. A consistent effect of age was not observed. We also found the mean and standard deviation of the take-over time were highly correlated, indicating that the mean is predictive of variability. Our findings point to directions for new research, in particular concerning the distinction between drivers’ ability and motivation to take over, and the roles of urgency and prior experience.",1369-8478,Not found

Against this background we report the results of our own survey of 11,827 drivers across 11 European countries, addressing attitudes to driving alongside AVs as well as to riding in them. We establish a composite indicator of perceptions of AVs that combines responses on using AVs and sharing the road with them, and analyse its relationship with a set of covariate measures. Respondents’ technological optimism and uptake of driving technology was associated with more positive perceptions of AVs, and measures of respondents’ enjoyment of driving, and how ‘sociable’ they were towards fellow road users, was associated with more negative perceptions. The negative association between driving ‘sociability’ and enthusiasm for AVs was attenuated by levels of general technological optimism. We discuss the difficulties in researching public responses to novel technological objects and make suggestions for improvement in future survey research on AVs.",1369-8478,Not found
"The social representations of cycling practices: An analysis of symbolic, emotional, material and bodily components, and their implication for policies",10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.019,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Drawing on social representation theory and its connections with approaches to embodiment and social practice, the paper reports the result of a survey investigation (based on an on-line semi-structured questionnaire; N = 305) that studied the cognitive, emotional and sensorial components of the social representations of cycling. The general aim was to show how these theoretical frameworks can be used to identify the social-cultural barriers that might hamper the individual use of the bike for everyday purposes in addition to the mere infrastructural ones, and to assess possible variabilities in function of various factors of social-psychological (i.e. the perceived quality of the residential environment), experiential (i.e. linked to the individual daily practices), and geographical (i.e. big vs small urban areas of residence) nature. Results confirm the potentialities of these models to provide a deeper understanding of cycling practices, for example, suggesting, how, rather than being univocal and homogenous, people’s shared conceptions regarding the topic investigated can vary depending on many of the factors considered, among which those of experiential and geographical nature seem to play a prominent role. The paper also discusses the implications for policies directed to fostering the adoption of more sustainable forms of transport within and outside urban areas, as well as their ability to broaden the theoretical understanding of cycling behaviour within social sciences in general.",1369-8478,Not found
Transitions to manual control from highly automated driving in non-critical truck platooning scenarios,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.006,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Automated truck platooning is getting an increasing interest for its potentially beneficial effects on fuel consumption, driver workload, traffic flow efficiency, and safety. Nevertheless, one major challenge lies in the safe and comfortable transitions of control from the automated system back to the human drivers, especially when they have been inattentive during highly automated driving. In this study, we investigated truck drivers’ take-over response times after a system initiated request to take back control in non-critical truck platooning scenarios. 22 professional truck drivers participated in the truck driving simulator experiment and everyone was instructed to drive under three task conditions during highly automated driving: Driver monitoring condition (drivers were instructed to monitor the surroundings), Driver not-monitoring condition (drivers were provided with a hand-held tablet and were asked to use this), and Eyes-closed condition (drivers were not allowed to open their eyes). The total take-over response time was divided into the perception response time and the movement response time by manual video annotation. Results showed significantly longer total take-over times with high variability in both Driver not-monitoring and Eyes-closed conditions compared to the Driver monitoring condition. Hand movement response time was found to be the dominant component of the total take-over time, being influenced by the motoric manoeuvres to resume physical readiness before taking over control (e.g., putting away the hand-held tablet, or adjusting seating position). These results suggest the importance of a personalized driver readiness predictor as an input parameter for a safe and comfortable transition of control.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of alcohol and perceived controllability in optimistic offender drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.024,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The aim of this study was to analyse how the complexity of the situational context in driving and the effect of alcohol influence the use of internal and external factors in prefactual thoughts and performance in a simulated driving task performed by optimistic and pessimistic drivers who attend rehabilitation courses. 72 drivers took part on a voluntary basis. 21 of them were offender drivers attending intervention, awareness, and rehabilitation courses for recouping points deducted from their licences. 43 drivers were attending courses for advanced professional driving licences or the like. The participants followed a route in a driving simulator. At the training stage, we adjusted the task difficulty to induce a high or low perception of control; in addition, we established the condition of alcohol intake or not. On the basis of the outcome obtained in this stage, the participants had to report the resources they required for improving their outcomes. We used different factor ANOVAs to analyse our results. In all cases, the tests were conducted a posteriori with Bonferroni adjustment in order to analyse the interactions. The most interesting differences are noted under the condition of high difficulty and no alcohol intake, where lower control is induced among the participants and where the drivers have not consumed alcohol. In contrast to non-offending pessimistic and optimistic drivers, optimistic offender drivers think their results would be better if there were external factors. We may contend that optimistic offender drivers think they are more likely to achieve the outcomes they want. This thinking may be motivated by the fact that this group does not perform better than the rest of the groups.",1369-8478,Not found
Young male taxi drivers and private car users on driving simulator for their self-reported driving skills and behaviors,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.028,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This study investigated (1) the associations between young male drivers’ self-assessed driving skills and their driver behaviors on driving simulator, (2) the associations between their self-reported driver behaviors and their driver behaviors on driving simulator, and (3) the similarities and the differences between young male taxi drivers and private car users based on these associations. 38 male taxi drivers and 40 male private car users, between 18 and 25 years old, were provided a demographic information form, two self-reports for measurement of their driving skills and behaviors, and 9 km driving simulator scenario in the laboratory. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that safety skills and perceptual motor skills are in opposite associations with young male drivers’ speeds, overtaking behaviors, and their behaviors at traffic lights on driving simulator. Moreover, ordinary violations were found to be in positive association with young male drivers’ speeding, running a red light, and overtaking behaviors on driving simulator. Lastly, differing from each other based on the associations between their overtaking behaviors on driving simulator and types of self-reported violations, the results indicated that young male taxi drivers and private car users share a number of similarities in terms of their negative attitudes towards safety and aberrant driver behaviors in traffic.",1369-8478,Not found
User preferences and design recommendations for voluntary smartphone applications to prevent distracted driving,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.018,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Mobile phone distracted driving has been identified as a significant contributor to road trauma. The use of voluntary smartphone applications (or mobile phone functions) which are designed to prevent certain phone behaviours while driving is an emerging countermeasure for distracted driving. Despite the potential for voluntary smartphone applications to reduce crashes associated with mobile phone distracted driving, there has been limited research assessing how effective these applications are in reducing mobile phone use while driving, and the perceived acceptance of such applications. The overall aim of this study is to investigate factors that influence the use of voluntary smartphone applications to reduce the distraction associated with mobile phone use while driving. A total of 712 drivers from Australia participated in an online questionnaire about their preferences and opinions regarding smartphone applications to prevent mobile phone distracted driving. Statistical analyses including a random-effects logistic regression model were conducted to analyse the impact of the application functions on the participants’ willingness to install and activate the application. The willingness of participants to install and activate a mobile phone app was determined by the facility to disable visual-manual tasks and notifications and allow hands-free conversations. The facility to set up automatic responses to inform contacts that they are driving was also important. Females were significantly more likely to install and activate the app. Preferred functions included the blocking of visual-manual interactions such as texting and browsing but allowing applications that support driving such as GPS and Bluetooth. Participants also wanted to retain the ability to use music-playing functions. The ability to give commands to the phone exclusively through audio using a hands-free device or Bluetooth was also favoured. Some age-related differences were evident when examining preferred functions. Overall, findings suggest that the use of app-based technology is a potential intervention opportunity to reduce exposure to high-risk behaviours among motorists and particularly young drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of a simulator based training on specific measures of driving ability in older drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.014,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Since driving is important for quality of life, it is important to keep older drivers safe drivers for as long as possible. Therefore, this study investigated whether driving simulator based training can enhance specific measures of driving ability in older drivers. Forty older drivers participated in the study, but due to drop-out, 30 participants (mean age 69.93) remained in the sample. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (N = 15) or an active control group (N = 15). During the training session, participants in both groups drove in the simulator, in order to have equal driving experience in the simulator. In addition, participants in the experimental group received driving-specific feedback on their driving ability, while participants in the active control group received general information about traffic and conducted a traffic-related quiz. During the pre-test and post-test, specific measures of driving ability were assessed in the driving simulator (i.e., mean driving speed, standard deviation of lateral position, complete stops at stop signs, giving right of way to traffic at the right side and crashes). Results indicated that both groups had improved lateral control and less crashes after following a driving simulator based training. In addition, after following a driving simulator based training, participants in the experimental group gave more right of way to traffic at the right side and participants in the active control group drove faster (without exceeding the speed limits). These results demonstrated that driving multiple times in a simulator, improves performance on some measures of driving ability like lateral control. However, in order to improve on measures of driving ability like giving right of way to traffic at the right side, driving-specific feedback is necessary.",1369-8478,Not found
"Cyclists’ self-reported experiences of, and attributions about, perceived aggressive behaviour while sharing roads and paths in New South Wales, Australia",10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.027,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper examines the self-reported data from 1404 adult transport and recreational cyclists from New South Wales (Australia) on their experiences of behaviour they perceived to be intentionally aggressive in the previous week, from motor vehicle drivers (MVDs), pedestrians and other cyclists. The perception of aggression appears to be a common experience for cyclists, with about one in two cyclists reporting an aggressive encounter in the previous week. Most encounters (85.7%) were from MVDs, and most occurred on the road. After adjustment for exposure (time travelled) and environmental factors (proportion of cycling time on the road, and region in which most cycling was undertaken), younger cyclists (18–44 yrs), female cyclists and transport cyclists were more likely to report aggressive encounters from MVDs than older (60+ years), male, and recreational cyclists, respectively. The majority of cyclists who perceived aggression from a MVD attributed the behaviour to internal and stable factors in the MVD (such as an anti-cyclist, selfish or arrogant disposition or deliberately careless behaviour), followed by internal and unstable factors (such as ignorance of cyclists’ rights or the road rules). These findings may have implications for initiatives by governments wishing to promote cycling.",1369-8478,Not found
Does automated driving affect time-to-collision judgments?,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.025,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"We compared time-to-collision (TTC) judgments between automated and manual driving to determine whether automation affected only responses (i.e., braking) or also affected visual perception (i.e., TTC estimation). Automation presumably frees cognitive resources because drivers do not have to control the vehicle. Those resources may be reallocated to processing visual information (e.g., optic flow) relevant for judgments of TTC. With a driving simulator, participants completed drives using manual or automated driving and responded to a rapidly decelerating vehicle using either the brake pedal or a button on the steering wheel (TTC judgment). They also completed a cognitive secondary task during half of the drives. Results suggest that automation can affect perceptual judgments (e.g., TTC estimation) in addition to driving responses (e.g., braking). TTC judgments were more accurate, and brake reaction times were faster, during automated driving than manual driving. This occurred even while performing a cognitively demanding secondary task, suggesting that participants used resources freed by automation to process visual information relevant to TTC judgments rather than complete non-driving tasks. TTC judgments were more accurate during automated driving than manual driving, presumably because automation freed up cognitive resources, allowing participants to assign those resources to processing of visual information (e.g., optic flow) relevant to judgments about collisions. To realize the safety benefit suggested by the results, automated systems should be designed so that cognitive resources freed by automation are assigned to information relevant to the driving task and not to non-driving tasks.",1369-8478,Not found
Habit discontinuity and student travel mode choice,10.1016/j.trf.2019.04.022,64,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Overreliance on motorised travel modes aggravates existing problems of public obesity and global climate change. However, travel mode choices are often habitual, and habits are difficult to break, as automatic responses to stable-contexts learnt through repetition. One approach is to destabilise the stable-contexts that cue travel habits. Such an opportunity could arise when people move-house, so we predicted that the travel mode choices and habits of university students would change, without a behaviour change intervention, when they moved-house between academic terms. University students (N = 250) completed two questionnaires, around 5.5 months apart, between new academic years; 153 students moved-house (“movers”). As predicted when movers changed their travel mode choices, their new choices became more automatic and their old choices less automatic. Mover’s travel changes were planned prior to moving-house, however there was insufficient evidence that either changes in the social context or activated values were related to travel changes. We discuss these findings with respect to acquiring habits and the habit discontinuity and self-activation hypotheses (Verplanken, Walker, Davis, & Jurasek, 2008) and the advantages of student house-hunting as a 'window of opportunity' for establish new travel habits amongst university students.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigation of the dependency of the drivers’ emotional experience on different road types and driving conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2019.06.001,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The growing sophistication of technologies and sociological advances are major causes for the dramatic change the automotive sector is currently undergoing. To address changes from a human-centered design perspective an improved understanding of the occupants’ emotional experience and behavior is required. Facial-Expression Analysis (FEA) is an emerging tool in support of such an approach, suitable for automotive research due to its non-contact application and low intrusiveness. The research described here investigated the dependency of the occupants’ emotional experience on road types and driving conditions by investigating emotional responses and their causes through FEA and observational analysis. Twenty-one university students and staff were recruited for the real-time test on a planned road circuit covering different road types and conditions. Facial-expression data and video information from two in-car cameras were collected during an average driving time of 40 min per participant. A multi-method approach was applied for the data analysis, including both quantitative statistical analysis and qualitative observational analysis, as well as an inter-observer reliability test. Emotion frequencies were compared between the different road types, resulting in a percentage difference from the total average of emotion frequency of −6.09% below average for urban roads, +11.15% above average for major roads and +4.88% above average for rural roads. The causes most frequently assigned to the emotional responses in this dataset were poor road conditions and causes related to the navigation device. The research supported the dependency of emotional experiences on the driving condition and type of road. The study presents the first step of a human-centered design approach towards modern automotive design. The results have wide application in automotive design, applicable to the development of, for instance, an affective human-machine interaction or a personalized autonomous driving experience.",1369-8478,Not found
Changes of drivers’ visual performances when approaching a signalized intersection under different collision avoidance warning conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2017.12.018,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Intersections have been recognized as hazard locations with lots of visual information that drivers need to process. Although the collision avoidance systems (CASs) have been proved to effectively reduce the crash rate and much research on the effectiveness of CASs has been conducted with regard to the driving behaviors, drivers’ visual performances under the effects of different collision avoidance warning conditions that were closely related to the effectiveness of CAS have been neglected. In this study, a driving simulator experiment was conducted to evaluate the relationships among drivers’ visual performances, drivers’ different warning conditions (warning timings × warning content) and driver’s gender when they crossed the intersections involved with red-light running (RLR) vehicles. The experimental results showed that warning timings had significant effects on the detection stage and reaction stage. Specifically, drivers could detect the conflicting RLR vehicle most quickly in the warning timings of 4.5 s ahead of a collision. When the warning was released earlier than 5.0 s ahead of a collision, driver tended to take brake action earlier than paying a fixation on a conflicting RLR vehicle. Warning content only had significant effects on drivers’ detection stage. Compared to the non-directional warning, the specific directional information could shorten the time spent in detecting the conflicting RLR vehicle. Besides, directional information could increase drivers’ average blink duration during the process of collision avoidance. Additionally, the results showed that female drivers were more likely to be involved with RLR collisions, and male drivers could detect the conflicting RLR vehicle more quickly than female drivers. Also, it had been found that later warning timings tended to increase female drivers’ blink rate, and non-directional warning tended to increase female drivers’ blink rate. These findings could direct warning condition design to improve the effectiveness of collision avoidance systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Acclimatizing to automation: Driver workload and stress during partially automated car following in real traffic,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.024,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Automated driving systems are increasingly prevalent on public roads, but there is currently little knowledge on the level of workload and stress of drivers operating an automated vehicle in a real environment. The present study aimed to measure driver workload and stress during partially automated driving in real traffic.

The participants, who were experienced with driver assistance systems but naïve to the Tesla, drove a 32 min motorway route back and forth while following a lead car in regular traffic. In one of the two drives, participants performed a heads-up detection task of bridges they went underneath. Averaged across the two drives, the participants’ mean self-reported overall workload score on the NASA Task Load Index was 19%. Moreover, the participants showed a reduction in heart rate and self-reported workload over time, suggesting that the participants became accustomed to the experiment and technology. The mean hit (i.e., pressing the button near a bridge) rate in the detection task was 88%. In conclusion, driving with the Tesla Autopilot on a motorway involved a low level of workload that decreased with time on task.",1369-8478,Not found
A threshold model for stimulus detection in the peripheral detection task,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.014,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Objective A threshold model for stimulus detection in the Peripheral Detection Task (PDT) was presented to explain the results of three previous experiments in terms of underlying processes. In a new experiment the model was applied to test whether the visual tunneling induced by optic flow was affected by time-on-task while driving. Background The effects of stimulus conspicuity, eccentricity, optic flow, age and cognitive load on PDT response time found in earlier studies have been difficult to interpret because of lack of an explanatory model. Method The results from three earlier experiments were re-analyzed statistically in order to test the model, and in a new experiment the effect of time-on-task while driving on visual tunneling was evaluated. Results The results supported the model predictions: speed of the evidence accumulation process was affected by stimulus conspicuity and age, while the sensitivity of the visual field was affected by stimulus eccentricity, optic flow and time-on-task. Short stimulus duration resulted in lower hit rate. This generated response time compression due to under-representation of slower responses: lower hit rate reduced the reliability of RT. Conclusion The results support the presented threshold model for stimulus detection in the PDT. Also, a reduced hit rate because of short stimulus duration reduces the reliability of response time measurement because of response time compression. Application The significance of the paper is both methodological and theoretical. It describes a method to assess the effects of experimental factors on different psychological processes, and discusses the relation between hit rate and response time. The theoretical significance is that it sheds light on the underlying processes of PDT performance and of processes affected by cognitive load. In addition it shows that visual tunneling increases during with time-on-task during driving which affects traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found

These risky driving behaviours are especially common among young adults and adolescents.

A cross-sectional survey of 526 young adults assessed phone use in the car and risky driving, and potential precursors such as boredom proneness, social connectedness, habitual phone use, and other potentially relevant variables. The results showed that young males and females largely differed in the factors associated with their phone use in the car and risky driving. For example, a range of factors was related to males’ phone use in the car (including boredom proneness and social connectedness), but only phone activity frequency uniquely and significantly predicted females’ phone use in the car. The study results indicate that males’ and females’ phone use in the car should be considered separately, as they appear to be influenced by different precursors. In addition, the findings suggest that habitual phone use may be contributing substantially to young males’ phone use in the car, suggesting a need to address this underlying issue.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the impact of dynamic merge control strategies on driving behavior on rural and urban expressways – A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.010,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Harsh decelerations and abrupt lane changes of drivers on the outer expressway lane in response to merging platoon vehicles from on-ramps increase the crash- and congestion risk on expressways. Several merge control approaches are worldwide implemented. However, there is a gap in knowledge which driving behaviors determine whether a particular merge control approach is best for a rural or urban expressway. This study tests a number of dynamic merge control strategies, such as lane control signalization (eventually combined with variable speed limits (VSL), on a 4-lane urban and rural expressway to measure the behavioral responses of drivers being directly exposed to platoon merging from on-ramps. Subsequently, a comparison was made with the driving behaviors in response to static merge control (e.g. merge warning signs or road marking treatment). The driving behavior of 66 drivers from the State of Qatar was recorded in a driving simulator and analyzed by means of a within-subject repeated measures analysis with univariate statistics. The results suggest that dynamic merge control is more effective for rural expressways considering the higher traffic speeds. The earlier lane changes contributed to smooth maneuvers and gradual speed reductions on the rural expressway and improved safe driving behavior as compared to static merge control. In contrast, the dynamic merge control did not deliver additional safety benefits on urban expressways and can be substituted by a low-cost static merge control approach. Policymakers aiming to improve traffic safety at expressway merging sections are advised to take the speed characteristics of the local expressway into account before implementing dynamic merge control.",1369-8478,Not found

At lower levels of automation (SAE L0-2), user experience (UX) is mainly affected by the primary task of vehicle control. However, at higher levels (SAE L3-5) it is dependent on appropriate vehicle behavior as well as non-driving related tasks. Thus, the active role of the driver changes gradually to a passive one and this needs to be addressed earlier on in the design phase of user interfaces for automated driving systems. In this work, we present a need-centered development approach and the involved ""AD UX framework"", which we applied in two studies to create a positive user experience in highly/fully automated driving (AD). In the first study, to derive insights for concept development, we analyze the fulfillment of psychological needs in different contextual variations of driving scenarios, such as road type (highway, rural, urban road) or traffic volume (low, moderate, high) using an explorative qualitative approach (N = 30). In the second, for evaluating our derived concept for highway driving with low traffic volume, we compare manual (SAE L0/L1) and highly/fully automated driving (SAE L4/L5) in a simulator environment (N = 27), suggesting cooperative control as possible solution for enhancing AD experience. Results in this context reveal significant correlations between UX of automated driving and the fulfillment of the psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and meaning. We conclude that users’ feeling of being in control remains and, moreover, should by guaranteed for a pleasurable user experience for each individual driver.",1369-8478,Not found
To buy or not to buy? Predicting willingness to pay for automated vehicles based on public opinion,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.012,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Public acceptability of automated vehicles (AVs) is critical to gauge in order to understand the factors that are likely to encourage drivers to utilise the technology and realise its predicted safety and other benefits. Willingness to pay (WTP) is a particularly important facet of acceptability as AVs will only penetrate the market in so much as people are willing to purchase it. However, there currently exists a lack of research that has examined how attitudes and opinions towards AVs may impact WTP for the technology. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the predictive utility of AV-related attitudes and opinions in identifying individuals who are, and those who are not, willing to pay for the technology. The study employed a sample of 6133 Australian and New Zealand respondents who responded to a comprehensive online survey (including over 50 items specific targeting aspects of AV acceptability). Survey items gauged attitudes and opinions closely related to the acceptability of AVs including (but not limited to) (a) perceived benefits and concerns, (b) likely conditions of use, (c) engagement in secondary activities when supported by automation, and (d) WTP for the technology. Results showed that attitudes and opinions relating to perceived benefits, level of comfort with an AV undertaking certain driving functions, and engagement in secondary activities were among the strongest predictors of WTP, over and above key sociodemographic variables (e.g., age, salary), while the weakest were associated with awareness of AV technologies and perceived concerns. As such, the study makes a novel contribution to the existing literature by highlighting specific attitudes and opinions that may be crucial to consider when attempting to better understand, and predict, peoples’ WTP for AV technology prior to system use. Given this, we believe the information derived from this study will be useful for industry and government stakeholders.",1369-8478,Not found

A total of 5797 respondents were included in the analysis after applying eligibility criteria and data cleaning. Cyclists' beliefs were assessed by 25 items using a 7-point Likert scale. These items were factor analyzed resulting in a four-factor solution (Factor 1: Perceived Benefits and Risk Reduction, Factor 2: Perceived Disadvantages and Barriers to Helmet Use, Factor 3: Perception of Group Norms, and Factor 4: Situation-Dependence of Helmet Use). Results show that both beliefs and helmet wearing behavior differ according to some demographic and cycling-related factors, such as gender, frequency of bicycle use and type of bicycle used. Factor 3 (Perception of Group Norms) and Factor 2 (Perceived Disadvantages and Barriers to Helmet Use) were among the strongest predictors of helmet use, even after controlling for demographic and cycling-related variables. The findings suggest that helmet use promotion should focus primarily on normative beliefs and on the reduction of perceived barriers. Beliefs about helmet use can vary in accordance with the cyclist’s profile, as well as cultural and contextual factors. Assessment of beliefs in specific settings and populations will provide a better basis for planning interventions.

Results from 216 participants show that delegation rates average around 10% but vary greatly between individual players and with the level of traffic information. Focusing on personality factors, extraverted individuals were robustly found to be more likely to delegate than introvert players. Altogether, results suggest that there is –depending on several factors– hesitation to delegate decisions that affect both the decision maker and other participants.",1369-8478,Not found

Part-worth utility and relative importance scores were estimated using hierarchical Bayes analyses. Air pollution level was the most important attribute, followed by traffic, noise level, and the natural environment. The findings help identify burdens for walking in urban areas, particularly with regard to air pollution levels and traffic condition (which have a combined relative importance of 41%). Pro-environmentalists select their routes based on both air pollution and noise levels, thus they might be particularly interested in informing themselves about, and monitoring, these attributes.

In recent years, cell phone use while driving has become the primary research interest regarding distracted driving. However, the majority of this research has focused on the prevalence and risks of such behavior in passenger car drivers and few have investigated its effect on the performance of drivers of large trucks. Due to the inherent job responsibilities, truck drivers are more susceptible to use a cell phone, or other communication devices (e.g., CB radio), while driving to coordinate delivery logistics. The purpose of this study is to further understand distracted driving in the context of large trucks by identifying the factors that contribute to large truck drivers’ decision to report using a cell phone while operating a commercial motor vehicle. Through survey data collected in 2017 from drivers of large trucks who either pick-up or deliver goods in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, Idaho, British Columbia), a random parameters binary logit model is used to identify these factors. Of the 515 respondents, 234 (45%) indicated that they use a cell phone while driving. Through the random parameters binary logit model, unobserved heterogeneity is captured, and specific driver behaviors, demographic, work, temporal, and management characteristics are found to affect the likelihood of truck drivers reporting to use their cell phone while driving. Of particular interest, are carrier management characteristics and safety training. Carriers who manage fatigue by imposing schedules to make it easier to take breaks result in a decrease in probability of drivers reporting cell phone use, while carriers who restrict the number of hours worked decreased the probability of reporting cell phone use for the majority of drivers. In addition, having participated in road safety driving resulted in a decrease in probability of reporting cell phone use for the majority of drivers. Such findings have the potential to aid government agencies and commercial motor vehicle carriers in understanding the factors influencing cell phone use while driving among truck drivers. Understanding these motives can aid in the development of programs and policy initiatives that are intended to mitigate distracted driving among truck drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Preferences for travel-based multitasking: Evidence from a survey among public transit users in the Chicago metropolitan area,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.004,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper presents an empirical analysis of a survey among public transit users in the Chicago metropolitan area. The survey collected information about travelers’ general preferences for travel-based multi-tasking during public transit use, revealed preferences for travel-based multi-tasking during a reference trip by public transit in the Chicago metropolitan area and general preferences for travel-based multitasking during the use of ride-hailing services. To analyze the preference data, a rank-ordered logit models is estimated. The findings show that preferences for performing different productive and non-productive tasks while traveling can largely be explained by individual-specific attributes such as age and marital status as well as by trip-specific attributes such as the trip duration and travel party composition. In addition, the survey requested information about the usefulness of travel-based multitasking during the reference trip. Individuals traveling by themselves and for at least twenty minutes are found to be comparatively more likely to have been able to free up time later in the day, as they were able to multitask during the reference trip.",1369-8478,Not found

Exploring the behavior of suburban train users in the event of disruptions,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.009,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Little research has examined the behavior of public transport users in response to a service disruption that has just occurred. This article aims to identify the different ways in which suburban train passengers cope with service interruptions or delays and to identify the factors involved in their decision-making process. We conducted a study mixing two methods: a revealed-preference questionnaire that asked 185 participants about their choices during the last major disruption they encountered and a diary study in which participants described all disruptions they experienced during a two-week period. Eighty disruptions were reported in detail by 38 users. We analyze our results using multiple correspondence analysis and ascending hierarchical clustering to construct eight suburban train passenger behavioral profiles. Additionally, we compare different cases of disruption (in a multiple-case study). We identify three categories of factors affecting suburban train user behavior: individual-specific factors, journey-specific factors and information-specific factors. The findings show that user expertise, car availability, perception of service recovery time, opinions on passenger information services, available transport services, time constraints, and the moment and place at which communication about the disruption is received influence user behavior.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring transport perceptions across urban areas using free associations,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.005,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"In order to transform urban transport systems to get a potentially healthier and happier travelling public, it is important to understand how people perceive different urban travel modes, since this can affect their travel satisfaction, health and well-being. These perceptions were explored for five transport modes (walking, cycling, car driving, using bus and using train), in four areas in Birmingham, UK. The areas were chosen to reflect differing levels of deprivation and public transport provision. Data were collected using a postal questionnaire, which included a ‘free associations’ methodology. Respondents had to write down the first three associations that come to mind when thinking about each of the five modes, and subsequently rated how positive or negative each association felt to them. Perceptions of all modes except car driving differed significantly across the four neighbourhoods. The level of deprivation seemed to play a particularly distinctive role, as did the availability of public (rail) transport. There were strong relationships between the perceptions of a transport mode and its use, and sometimes also the use of other modes. Exploring perception using a free associations methodology provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of transport modes as perceived by citizens from different backgrounds, as well as their predisposition to change modes.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of non-driving related tasks in prolonged conditional automated driving – A Wizard of Oz on-road approach in real traffic environment,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.023,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of non-driving related tasks on the drivers’ fatigue in prolonged conditional automated driving (CAD) in on-road real traffic environment. Background In CAD, the driving task is executed by the system. This leads to a monotonous situation for the driver as he just has to intervene if requested by the system. Monotony and increasing automation are known causations for fatigue and drowsiness. In previous studies (mostly conducted in driving simulators) an impaired take-over performance due to emerging fatigue and drowsiness could be observed. In the driving simulator studies a rapid increase in drowsiness and fatigue could be observed. To investigate if similar results occur in real traffic environment on-road a Wizard of Oz approach was used. Method Forty-two participants experienced prolonged conditional automated rides on-road in real traffic environment. To provoke fatigue one part of the participants had to engage in a monotonous monitoring task. A control group had no requirements according to the NDRT and had free choice of their activity. Effects on fatigue were measured using percentage of eye-lid closure over time (PERCLOS) and subjective Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Results Prolonged CAD in real traffic environment and simultaneously engaging in a monotonous monitoring task negatively affected the drivers’ state. PERCLOS and subjective KSS significantly increased compared to the control-group. Conclusion Fatigue in CAD can emerge in real traffic environment as fast as in driving simulator environments. Especially when participants had to engage in a monotonous monitoring task PERCLOS and KSS rose. Application The results of this study demonstrate that due to increasing monotony fatigue can emerge in CAD within a one hour drive. The development of fatigue is comparable to the development of fatigue in the driving simulator, where an impaired take-over performance due to fatigue could be observed. Therefore, a monitoring of the driver state and adapted assistance in a take-over situation seems to be a good opportunity to ensure safety in CAD.",1369-8478,Not found

Exploring automated vehicle driving styles as a source of trust information,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.026,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Trust is important for users’ acceptance and adoption of automated vehicles (AVs). Previous research has mainly focused on what information affects user trust in AVs and how the user’s trust is affected by the way the content is communicated. However, recent studies have shown that trust may also be affected by the AV’s driving style. The aim of the study was to further investigate if and how the vehicle’s driving style affects user trust in AVs and, in particular, how this is expressed by users. An experiment involving 18 participants, using a Wizard of Oz setup and within a subject design, was conducted comparing two different driving styles, ‘Defensive’ and ‘Aggressive’. Trust was measured using a mixed method research design including momentaneous trust ratings and think-aloud procedures while driving, a post-run trust questionnaire as well as trust curve sketching and a personal interview. The results show that driving style had an effect on user trust and that the ‘Defensive’ driving style was perceived as more trustworthy, in part because it was deemed more predictable than the ‘Aggressive’ driving style. Furthermore, participants expressed trust in using affective, analogical and analytic responses, the two former during the test runs and the latter directly after each test run. The interview after the completion produced a more mixed result. By combining different data collection methods, a nuanced picture of the trust formation process and users’ trust in AVs was obtained. The study concludes that it is important to consider the vehicle performance information provided by the vehicle’s driving style so as to create user trust in AVs.",1369-8478,Not found

The ERT was designed to flag individuals for potential cognitive impairment, but was not meant to indicate, or assess the level of impairment. Practical feasibility for implementation of the ERT was determined in a pilot study as well as its ability to differentiate drivers with and without cognitive impairment. The research design included both process and outcome evaluation components. The qualitative process evaluation was conducted using surveys administered to participant drivers (N = 70) and feedback obtained from driver examiners involved in the pilot (N = 3). The quantitative outcome evaluation used an experimental design to administer the ERT to a sample of drivers with (N = 42), and without (N = 28), mild cognitive impairment. Regression analysis was conducted and scoring functions of the ERT were compared through a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Survey results revealed that drivers did not raise specific concerns about the ERT and that examiners believed more training on driving behaviours associated with cognitive impairment and some scoresheet formatting changes would be beneficial. ROC Area Under the Curve (AUC) results revealed that some components of the ERT were better at identifying individuals whose driving skills declined. These components are the adjust-control, route finding and divided attention tasks. Two final scoring schemes for the ERT are proposed as well as several recommendations for its possible implementation.",1369-8478,Not found
How the older population perceives self-driving vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.002,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Self-driving vehicles (SAE Level 5) are driven by automated vehicle technology and without any human driver input. These vehicles will especially be helpful to people who cannot drive, whether for medical- or age-related reasons. Since the current population of older Americans is the largest it has ever been, it is important to study transportation needs for older population and the potential of self-driving vehicles to solve their mobility problems. This study investigated older adults’ (aged 60 and over) perception of self-driving vehicles from the perspective of users and pedestrians. Five factors were measured to assess older adults’ perception including attitude, perceived usefulness, social norm, trust, and compatibility. Older adults’ willingness to use a self-driving vehicle, defined as acceptance, was also assessed. Data collection (N = 173) was done using an online survey approach. The results show that older adults perceive self-driving vehicles with positive attitude, perceived usefulness, trust, social norm, and acceptance as users. However, as pedestrians, the perception was either neutral or negative, except for the positive perceived usefulness. The results also revealed that if the older adults are familiar with self-driving vehicles, they are more likely to have a favorable perception of them. These results indicate great potential for the adoption of self-driving vehicles by older adults. However, they also raise concern about the interaction between older pedestrians and self-driving vehicles. The findings of this study will be helpful to developers in designing vehicles that meet the transportation needs of older adults and allow effective interaction between them and the vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Directional tactile alerts for take-over requests in highly-automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.025,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"One of the most significant safety concerns regarding Highly-Automated Driving (HAD) is drivers’ ability to regain control of the vehicle safely. Vibro-tactile alerts were already suggested as an effective modality for Take-Over Requests (TOR) in terms of reducing reaction times. However, it is not clear yet whether such alerts should be compatible or incompatible with the location of hazards that might be present when the TOR is initiated. Studies regarding tactile directionality in other domains, and in manual vehicles have found mixed results. It is argued that part of the contradictory evidence may be related to contextual differences between the driving domain and other domains. Thus, this study aimed to test which directional design would be preferable for TORs in time-critical situations. Twenty-seven participants drove a highly-automated vehicle on a highway with two lanes in each travel direction, in a driving simulator. Each participant experienced five TORs in which they were required to take control and divert their vehicle away from an impending hazard that shut down an entire lane and was situated four seconds ahead. The disengagement of the autonomous driver was signaled using a tactile alert. For the first group, the tactile alert was directed towards the hazard (incompatible with the required action), for the second, it was directed away from it (compatible with the required action), and for the control group, the alert was non-directional. Results showed that drivers using the compatible alert reacted faster and more accurately than those using the incompatible alert. Participants using the non-directional alert reacted slower and less accurately than participants in both directional groups. The results contradict previous findings in the manual driving domain, where drivers are faster and more accurate to respond when the alert is compatible with the location of the hazard and not with the direction of the required action. It is argued that these discrepancies stem from the modified HAD driving task demands where drivers are disengaged from the driving task for long periods and are less aware of the driving environment. The implications for the design of autonomous vehicles are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Speed perception affected by field of view: Energy-based versus rhythm-based processing,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.016,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Two experiments were carried out to test speed perception dependency on field of view (FoV), virtual road markings (VRMs), and presentation orders. The primary purpose was to examine how the extent of the optic flow (foremost peripherally–vertically) informs the driver about egospeed. A second purpose was to examine different task demands and stimulus characteristics supporting rhythm-based versus energy-based processing. A third purpose was to examine speed changes indicative of changes in motion sensitivity. Participants were tested in a car simulator, with FoV resembling low front-door windows, and with VRMs inside the car. Three main results were found. Larger FoV, both horizontally and peripherally–vertically, significantly reduced participants' speed, as did VRMs. Delineator posts and road center lines were used for participants' rhythm-based processing, when the task was to drive at target speeds. Rich motion-flow cues presented initially resulted in lower egospeed in subsequent conditions with relatively less motion-flow cues. The practical implication is that non-iconic, naturalistic and intuitive interfaces can effectively instill spontaneous speed adaptation in drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
"Pedestrian road-crossing willingness as a function of vehicle automation, external appearance, and driving behaviour",10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.027,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper discusses whether the knowledge of the driving mode of an approaching vehicle (manual vs. automated) influences pedestrians’ decisions while crossing a street. Additionally, the paper explores how different appearances and driving behaviours of vehicles interact with driving mode in affecting pedestrians’ road-crossing behaviours. In a video-based experiment with sixty participants, two vehicles with different appearances (a BMW 3 and a Renault Twizy) were presented as either manually-driven or automated vehicles. Both vehicles displayed either yielding or non-yielding behaviour on a straight road devoid of other traffic. Participants were asked to indicate whether they would cross the street in front of the approaching vehicle, at different distances ranging from 45 m to 1.5 m. The results showed that there was no significant influence of the knowledge of the driving mode (manually-driven vs automated) on pedestrians’ willingness to cross the street at any distance. The vehicle’s behaviour (whether it is maintaining speed or yielding) played a dominant role in pedestrians’ decision to cross a road, and this was similar for both modes and both vehicles, at all distances. However, results suggested that in situations and at distances when the intent of the vehicle was not fully clear by the behaviour of the car alone, there were differences between the two vehicles at certain distances, which could be attributed to the differences in their appearance such as size, aggressiveness and novelty. A futuristic-looking vehicle inspired less confidence in road-crossing situations compared to an ordinary-looking vehicle. Additionally, a novel and futuristic-looking vehicle appeared to make it easier for people to believe that it is an automated vehicle. We conclude by discussing design implications for the development of external HMIs automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Testing cooperative intelligent transport systems in distributed simulators,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.020,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Simulation is often used as a technique to test and evaluate systems, as it provides a cost-efficient and safe alternative for testing and evaluation.

Evaluating drivers’ speed choice with and without route-based warnings on approach to black spots on a rural highway,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.028,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"A high percentage of crashes occur at black spots of rural highways, and it is of paramount importance to employ strategies that can significantly reduce these crashes. The use of warning systems is one of the different methods of achieving this goal, and this study evaluates the effectiveness of these systems in different classes of drivers. To analyze the effects of warning systems on driver performance, three speed measures (mean speed, speed variation and speed limit violation) were applied. Forty-eight male and female drivers were categorized into three age groups, namely young (18–35 years old), middle age (36–55 years old) and elderly (above 55 years old), and they were asked to drive on a rural two-lane two-way highway in the north-west of Iran to conduct the experiment. The results indicate that middle-aged men and elderly women had the highest and lowest recorded mean speeds at black spots respectively both in the warning and non-warning states. On the other hand, young male drivers had the highest speed variations in the warning state, and middle-aged male drivers recorded the lowest variations in the non-warning state. Concerning the violation of speed limit at the black spots, young and middle-aged men had the highest number of violations in the warning and non-warning states respectively. Elderly women were found to be the most cautious group both in the warning and non-warning states. Conclusively, strategies such as changing the type and number of warnings are proposed to improve the effectiveness of the warning systems in special groups of drivers.",1369-8478,Not found

This paper aims to investigate the effects of reward-based instruments on promoting emerging mobility schemes and active transport, through real-world demonstrations in two European cities. Specifically, a route planning mobile application which tracks users’ travel patterns was used to integrate a reward program offering points to incentivize people towards sustainable multimodal choices, including public transport, cycling and walking. In addition, a web-based questionnaire survey was conducted, and a discrete choice model was developed to model individuals’ multimodal choice in the presence of different reward types, including monetary rewards, points and the provision of added value services. Overall, our findings indicate that reward-based instruments can contribute to the promotion of sustainable and emerging transport services. In particular, participants spent more time in public transport usage and walking during the reward-based period. Our results indicate that rewards could increase individuals’ time spent in public transport usage and walking by about 21 min and 14 min per day respectively. Furthermore, it is found that public transport users were mostly motivated by rewards, while car users and walkers were not motivated towards cycling. Finally, the results indicate that Birmingham’s users were more motivated than Vienna’s participants, as public transport usage increased by about 209 min per week in Birmingham vs. 74 min per week in Vienna. Similar patterns of increase in the cities were observed for walking, while some population groups in Vienna were found insensitive to the prospect of earning rewards for using sustainable transport modes.",1369-8478,Not found

More recently, autonomous buses have made their debut in several cities. Technological advances in transport services, however, are accompanied by challenges to passengers’ perceived safety and the acceptability of the technology. While passengers’ anxiety and fear appear to reduce their acceptance of new technologies, trust has been shown to positively affect their acceptance of automation and autonomous vehicles. In this vein, the present study investigates the trustworthiness of automated subway services in Korea with regard to passenger anxiety and fear. First, automated subway-specific trustworthiness factors are identified through exploratory factor analysis. Subsequently, the effects of the identified factors on passenger anxiety and fear are examined using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that attributes that contribute to the trustworthiness of automated subways are grouped into automation- and service-related factors: ‘automation trustworthiness’ and ‘service trustworthiness’, both of which appear to negatively affect passengers’ anxiety and fear, mediated by the passengers’ sense of certainty and coping potential. The negative effects of trustworthiness on anxiety and fear indicate that strengthening of the trustworthiness factors must be accompanied with technological advances in transportation. The implications for strengthening the trustworthiness of unmanned automated subways and other transport services employing autonomous features are presented, correspondingly, in this study.",1369-8478,Not found

We find that Danish car owners’ intention to buy an EC increases with their attitude towards ECs and felt moral obligation to buy an eco-friendly car and decreases with increased perceived difficulty in use and feeling uncertain about ECs. Social influence on buying intentions is mediated through the attitude towards ECs and felt moral obligations. Personal experience as an EC owner leads to more favorable beliefs about ECs, which make all motivational factors more favorable. In order to increase demand for ECs, the focus should mainly be on reducing uncertainty and negative expectations. The most effective tool for achieving this is extended trial experience. In addition, communication and other means should be employed to alter the perceived balance between costs and benefits of the EC, including social norms marketing using testimonial advertising and word-of-mouth communication from satisfied EC owners.",1369-8478,Not found

The temptation to text when driving – Many young drivers just can't resist,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.015,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"When questioned, people clearly understand that texting while driving is a dangerous behaviour. However, evidence convincingly shows that a meaningful proportion continue to both read and write texts. Why is this? We prospectively recognise the risks associated with the task; yet in context, many of us are unable to restrain our behaviour for the greater good. This paper reports a simulator study investigating young drivers’ engagement with texting. It considers, (i) willingness to text, and (ii) the nature of the temptation (modest financial reward or penalty). The study had a mixed design with all Participants experiencing a ‘temptation to text’ condition (and a control). During the ‘temptation to text’ condition, half the sample were offered either the financial reward to incentivise responses, while the others had an equivalent penalty. Ultimately, all participants received full compensation. Driver performance and mental workload measures were collected as proxy indicators for behavioural impacts. Results are consistent with previous published studies and showed significantly increased workload. Similarly, vehicle performance was also found to be significantly worse when texting and driving. However, the primary goal of this study was to explore the willingness of young drivers to read and respond to mobile phone ‘texts’ when tempted to do so. Engagement with texting was found to be significantly higher than hypothesised with 60% of participants responding to text messages. Adoption of short headways was found to be predictive of an inclination to text.

Compared to manual driving, drivers can engage in tasks that are difficult to interrupt and of higher demand, the consequences can be a reduced perception of, and an impaired reaction to, warnings. In this study we compared three in-vehicle warnings (auditory, tactile, and auditory-tactile) which were presented during three highly attention capturing tasks (visual, auditory, and tactile) while the user was engaged in a self-driving car scenario, culminating in an emergency brake event where the warning was presented. The novel addition for this paper was that three set paced, attention capturing tasks, as well the three warnings were all designed in a pilot study to have comparable workload and noticeability. This enabled a direct comparison of human performance to be made between each of the attention capturing tasks, which are designed to occupy only one specific modality (auditory, visual or haptic), but remain similar in overall task demand. Results from the study showed reaction times to the tactile warning (for the emergency braking event) were significantly slower compared to the auditory and auditory-tactile (aka multimodal or multisensory) warning. Despite the similar reaction times between the in-vehicle auditory warning and the multimodal warning, the multimodal warning led to a reduced number of missed warnings and fewer false responses. However, the auditory and auditory-tactile warnings were rated significantly more startling than the tactile alone. Our results extend the literature regarding the performance benefits of multimodal warnings by comparing them with in-vehicle auditory warnings in an autonomous driving context. The set-pace attention capturing tasks in this study would be of interest to other researchers to evaluate the interaction in an automated driving context, particularly with hard to interrupt and attention capturing tasks.",1369-8478,Not found
"Driving attitudes, behaviours, risk perception and risk concern among young student car-drivers, motorcyclists and pedestrians in various EU countries",10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.012,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The number of car crashes has gradually reduced in the last decade across all European Countries, but the number of motorcycle crashes has remained nearly the same. In our research we investigate whether there are differences in attitudes towards road safety issues, driving behaviours in specific imagined situations, risk perception and risk concern, among young student drivers and riders. The study involved a large sample taken from across six European countries. The results reveal that although there are no differences between motorcyclists and car drivers in their attitudes toward road safety rules, differences do appear when the road rules compliance is assessed in specific imagined situations, with motorcyclists reporting to be more prone than car-drivers to violations of traffic rules. Moreover, despite the perceived risk during driving is the same for motorcyclists and car-drivers, differences do appear on their concern about this risk, with motorcyclists reporting to be less concerned than car-drivers about the risk of a road crash. This could lead to a high probability of risky driving behaviour in motorcyclists than in car-drivers. Present findings have important practical implications for road safety training courses.",1369-8478,Not found
"Amused, accepted, and used? Attitudes and emotions towards automated vehicles, their relationships, and predictive value for usage intention",10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.009,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Automated vehicles (AVs) have left the laboratories and can be experienced in several projects, e.g. at the premises of a clinic in Germany. With this transition, research on AV attitudes no longer needs to rely on questionnaires with hypothetical scenarios and simulations. Previous research – limited by the unavailability of AVs – has provided ambivalent results regarding age and gender differences in attitudes towards AVs. We present research results about the role of age and gender in connection with attitudes such as acceptance, perceived safety, and trust, as well as intention to use. We additionally demonstrate relationships between those constructs and emotions such as amusement, fear, and surprise. Data were collected from participants (n = 125) after having experienced an AV ride with level 4 automation on two campuses of a clinic in Berlin, Germany. Results reveal strong correlations between all attitudes (0.55 ≤ r ≤ 0.71; p < 0.01) and show acceptance and perceived safety to be solid predictors of intention to use AVs. We also found age to be a significant predictor for usage intention even when other attitudes are considered (β = −0.22; p < 0.01). MANOVA results point to gender differences in all constructs, but with limited confidence (5.40 ≤ F ≤ 18.34; p ≤ 0.02). However, we reject our hypothesis that young men are highly accepting, trusting, and intending to use AVs compared to other combinations of age and gender. We recommend using a mix of attitude, emotion, and behavioural (intention) measures in future research on AVs together with more transparency regarding construct definitions and study materials.",1369-8478,Not found
An objective assessment of the utility of a driving simulator for low mu testing,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.001,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Driving simulators can be used to test vehicle designs earlier, prior to building physical prototypes. One area of particular interest is winter testing since testing is limited to specific times of year and specific regions in the world. To ensure that the simulator is fit for purpose, an objective assessment is required. In this study a simulator and real world comparison was performed with three simulator configurations (standard, no steering torque, no motion) to assess the ability of a utility triplet of analyses to be able to quantify the differences between the real world and the different simulator configurations. The results suggest that the utility triplet is effective in measuring the differences in simulator configurations and that the developed “Virtual Sweden” environment achieved rather good behavioural fidelity in the sense of preserving absolute levels of many measures of behaviour. The main limitation in the simulated environment seemed to be the poor match of the dynamic lateral friction limit on snow and ice when compared to the real world.",1369-8478,Not found
Cognition and driving safety: How does the high-speed railway drivers’ cognitive ability affect safety performance?,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.006,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"A relationship between cognitive ability and safety performance in car drivers has been consistently supported in previous literature. However, this relationship has been neglected in research regarding high-speed railway drivers. Drivers play a vital role in ensuring safety operation of high-speed railway in China. Therefore, it is of great significance to predict the impact of cognitive ability and railway driving experience of high-speed railway (HSR) drivers on safety performance. This study uses a standard driving adaptability system to assess driver’s cognitive abilities which predict safety performance in Chinese high-speed railway. 154 HSR drivers completed a standardized driving adaptability system test on a display device, which is widely used in the HSR drivers’ selection in China. The driving adaptability system is used to assess attention, multiple reaction ability, learning ability, short-term memory, speed anticipation and performance stability. Thereafter, monthly performance assessment data were collected after cognitive test since they truly reflect the driver's safety performance. Research found that attention, speed anticipation and performance stability were found to positively predict safety performance of HSR drivers. The railway driving experience plays a moderating role in the relationship between speed anticipation and safety performance, performance stability and safety performance. The richer the driver's driving experience, the stronger the effect of speed perception and job stability on safety performance, and vice versa. The results provide new ideas for the selection and management of HSR drivers and the improvement of driver safety performance.",1369-8478,Not found

A sample of 287 Israeli drivers completed scales assessing their driving styles, emotion regulation difficulties, and trait forgivingness. Results show that drivers adopting the three maladaptive driving styles (reckless and careless, angry and hostile, anxious) were characterized by a higher level of general difficulties in emotion regulation and by low trait forgivingness. In contrast, drivers adopting the patient and careful driving style had fewer difficulties in all aspects of emotion regulation, as well as higher trait forgivingness. The theoretical contribution of the study lays in showing that difficulties in emotion regulation and forgivingness are closely associated with maladaptive driving styles- an issue crucial for promoting the substantial efforts being invested in the attempts to reduce road crashes.",1369-8478,Not found

Don't shoot the messenger: Traffic-irrelevant messages on variable message signs (VMSs) might not interfere with traffic management,10.1016/j.trf.2018.09.011,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Road authorities struggle with the question whether variable message signs (VMSs) should exclusively be used for traffic management or could also be used to display traffic-irrelevant messages, such as mottos or commercial advertisements. The current study assesses behavioural responses to a critical route instruction displayed on the same VMS that previously displayed a variety of traffic-irrelevant messages. For this, thirty-two participants were divided between a control group and an experimental group (the advertisements group). In a driving simulator, all were familiarised with the same route by driving a VMS-equipped motorway nine times. For the advertisements group, up to drive 8, this VMS displayed various advertisements. Whereas for the control group it was blank. In the 9th drive, the VMS displayed a critical detour message for all participants. This critical route instruction – informing drivers to take the nearest exit – resulted in compliant driver behaviour in the advertisements group. In addition, they only reduced speed marginally to increase the time to process the VMS text. The control group, on the contrary, displayed a much sharper speed reduction; though the instruction only moderately altered motorway exit behaviour. What is more, the 31% (n = 4) of the advertisements group who complied with the critical route instruction subsequently failed to recall this message (recalling an advertisement instead). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that displaying traffic-irrelevant messages on VMSs might not interfere with traffic management; provided the format of said messages is in accordance with ergonomic VMS guidelines as used in this study. It is proposed that due to repeated exposure to various VMS texts, reading the sign has been practised to the extent that little to no conscious deliberation was required. As a result, recall of what was seen, proved to be an inadequate proxy for assessing driver behaviour. This study shows that conscious attention might not be a prerequisite for compliance. Furthermore, it suggests that continuous variability in objects in the traffic environment may become part of a subconscious monitoring process, as long as they have been sufficiently practised.",1369-8478,Not found

Inclusion criteria We sought to identify all epidemiological studies, published in English language, which assessed the association between fatigued or sleepy driving and the occurrence of car crashes lead to death or injury. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review with meta-analysis using PubMed, Google scholar and other valid databases to search for articles published from January 1980 through September 2016 to identify precise effect of drowsy driving on road traffic accidents. For each study odds ratio was calculated, the ratio of event odds in the drivers with drowsy driving divided by the drivers without drowsy driving, which were pooled to obtain an overall estimate using a fixed and random effects models. Findings Fourteen articles satisfying inclusion criteria were identified that all of them were included in quantitative synthesis. Pooled odds ratio obtained by fixed and random effect models was 1.29 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.34) and 1.34 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.43), respectively.

To this end, the data of vehicle cluster situations were collected and analyzed through driving experiments in different environments. In addition, the dual random variations of the vehicle cluster situation and driver’s propensity were modeled to explore the transfer mechanism. The verification results show that the predicted outcomes of vehicle cluster situations using the evolution rule of driver’s propensity are consistent with the real-time recognition. Therefore, the transfer mechanism of vehicle cluster situations was found to be effective and reasonable.

The objective of this analysis is to understand whether EDR systems allow better efficiency of truck fleets with respect to the proposed criteria, and whether the driver training process influences the results. For this purpose, we developed an experimental procedure composed of three monitoring phases – undisclosed (U), conscious 1 (C1) and conscious 2 (C2) – to allow evaluation of the fleet performance and behavior of each driver according to the proposed criteria.

The handover task represents a vulnerability in a given system due to the reduction of situation awareness and possible breakdowns in communication. Handover assistants are a design approach proposed to counteract these vulnerabilities. This study investigated the concept of a vocal handover assistant by exploring information transferred, and the methods for doing so, in naturalistic vocal handover between two drivers. Additionally, it was hypothesised that scripted vocal methods would differ in measures of workload, usability, acceptance and the effect on longitudinal/lateral driving behaviour. In each trial, two drivers took part in a driving simulation exchanging control from one-another. Drivers took part in six conditions: four pre-set conditions related to a different interaction style and two ‘free-form’ conditions before and after pre-set conditions. Our results show a change in information-types transferred and methods adopted for communication from before to after taking part in pre-set conditions. Other findings highlight considerations to be made such as training, personalization, the transmission of priority as well as contextual information, and how handover methods may affect the control of the vehicle following handover.

Research on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suggests that system experience can enhance drivers’ trust and acceptance. To evaluate the transferability of this result to HAD, we examined the development of drivers’ trust and acceptance regarding this technology at different stages of system experience in a driving simulator as well as on a test track. Age effects were additionally addressed by comparing the results of 20 younger (25–45 years) and 20 older (65–85 years) drivers in the driving simulator study. Trust and acceptance were assessed before the initial system experience as well as after the first and second automated drive. Both age groups showed slightly positive a priori trust and acceptance ratings, which significantly increased after the initial experience and remained stable afterwards. Older drivers reported a more positive attitude towards using HAD despite their lower self-assessed self-efficacy and environmental conditions facilitating HAD-usage (e.g. technical support) compared to younger drivers. In the subsequent test track study, trust and acceptance of the younger driver group were assessed before and after experiencing HAD in a test vehicle. Neither trust nor acceptance decreased despite the absence of further system experiences between both studies and the increased realism on the test track. These results underline the importance of the initial system experience for HAD-trust and –acceptance and emphasize the significance of automotive technologies for the preservation of older drivers’ mobility.",1369-8478,Not found
A simulation-based approach to investigate the driver route choice behavior under the connected vehicle environment,10.1016/j.trf.2018.04.008,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Drivers can move with the real-time traffic information under the connected vehicle environment.

The simulation results demonstrated that the performance of traffic state is better when enough drivers put emphasis on fuel consumption, and the optimal percentage of these drivers is about 60%. It is indicated that the travel time is more sensitive to the change of traffic state than fuel consumption, and the traffic system with enough drivers who care the fuel consumption could bring the better performance.

In low control driving conditions, optimistic offender drivers thought they might drive better if external factors favoured them, and they gave less importance to internal factors. In the same conditions, pessimistic offender drivers think that both external and internal factors would improve their driving. In high control driving conditions, pessimistic offender drivers record the biggest differences; they might drive better if internal factors favoured them, and they also reported external factors to a lesser extent.

Visual in-car warnings: How fast do drivers respond?,10.1016/j.trf.2018.02.024,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"We investigate how quickly drivers can change lanes in response to a visual in-car warning. Our work is motivated by technological developments, in which beacons along the road can trigger in-car warnings, for example when a driver is approaching a lane closure. What is not known, however, is at what distance such an in-car warning still allows for a timely lane change. We measured how quickly drivers respond to a visual in-car warning in a driving simulator. The driving task was combined with an audio task that provided different levels of cognitive distraction. We found that the initial reaction time to in-car warnings was significantly larger for drivers that were distracted by the audio task. Although the majority of drivers responded in time for a safe lane change, some drivers occasionally missed these signals, pointing at a serious potential hazard. Indeed, the results of a simulation model, used to investigate how this might extrapolate to regular traffic conditions, suggest that around 50% of drivers might not make a timely lane change in response to a last-minute warning. This indicates that these signals might be insufficient on their own when applied in the real world.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ADAS on Chinese drivers as well as any possible influences of roadway type, gender and experience on driving performance, which can be measured by several variables, including longitudinal, lateral and braking behavior. The ADAS used in this study was a Mobileye M630 with forward collision warning (FCW) and lane departure warning (LDW) functions. Thirty-two participants were recruited to drive a vehicle equipped with Mobileye M630. Participants drove the same test route twice.

Vehicle dynamics, environmental information and driving operational data was recorded by CAN (Controller Area Network) bus and video cameras. The results show that ADAS significantly affects braking behavior. Braking time increased and relative speed decreased when drivers were exposed to ADAS. The ADAS also significantly affects several longitudinal behaviors, including the longitudinal deceleration and time headway (THW). The occurrence of critically low THW decreased in the experiment. However, there was no significant effect on lateral behavior. Furthermore, driver acceptance of the FCW function was much higher than the LDW function, and acceptance on the expressway and freeway was much higher than on the urban road. The results also reveal the significant influence of road type and experience on driving behaviors.

This factor is defined as the ratio of drivers’ actual selected speed to the theoretical curve speed. Aiming at deriving the factor for different driving styles, it was utilized the 28-item Chinese version of Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). A correlation analysis between DBQ subscales and the factor indicated that a driver with higher violations scores is prone to drive faster in curve negotiation. Based on this finding, 24 experienced professional drivers were classified into two types, i.e. the moderate and the aggressive, corresponding to their scores on DBQ violations scale.

The visual far-time of the traditional model and the latitude-longitude control sensitivity parameters were estimated. Foggy conditions were modeled based on the QN-ACTR cognitive architecture to observe the effect of limited sight distance through fog on car-following performance. Jsim in the Eclipse environment and TORCS were applied in co-simulation and verified.

In this study, a discretionary cut-in risk model for vehicles is developed on the basis of field driving data and machine learning methods, namely, decision trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A united algorithm is developed to combine the two machine learning models for achieving enhanced conservativeness to the traffic states with high misclassification costs. To build the naturalistic driving database, the wavelet method is employed for filtering; the K-means approach, an unsupervised data learning method, is used to categorize the cut-in impact on the following vehicles in the target lane into three groups.

This framework is applied to real driving data that were obtained from 43 taxis in Korean metropolitan cities. The application shows that the framework can characterize driving patterns from large-scale driving records and identify clusters with high potential for aggressive driving.

Rearview camera system use among older drivers: A naturalistic observation study,10.1016/j.trf.2017.06.014,65,2019-08-01,2019,8,"With rearview camera systems becoming more widely available in the automobile market, there is a need to understand how older drivers use them when reversing. The rearview camera display can reduce a driver’s blind spot at the rear of the vehicle; however, it is unclear how seniors, who have a high risk of reversing collisions, incorporate the display into their visual scanning strategies when reversing their personal vehicles. Moreover, it remains to be demonstrated how aware they are of their reversing habits or how those habits relate to the usability or familiarity with the technology. This study explored these issues using a naturalistic observation approach that captured the on-road behaviour of fourteen seniors aged 69–82years who owned vehicles equipped with rearview camera systems, followed by an interview about system usability. Results indicate that older drivers incorporate the display alongside other areas of interest (e.g., the rearview mirror) into their scanning strategies when reversing, especially in the presence of other vehicles, but least of all when at home. While older drivers appear to be aware of their reversing habits, they overestimate how often they turn to look directly behind through the rear window. Our sample rated system usability positively, but duration of vehicle ownership may affect perceptions and actual use of the technology. Our data show that seniors incorporate this technology into their reversing routines, which has the potential to make the driving task safer and easier.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of mixed traffic and elderly passengers on city bus drivers’ work-related fatigue,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.020,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"City bus drivers are facing increasingly stressful work situations. In urban areas, bus drivers are competing for limited road space with various vehicles in mixed traffic conditions. This mixed traffic flow condition may not only cause traffic congestion problems but also increase the driving fatigue of a city bus driver. In addition, the average number of elderly passengers are increasing. Constrained by their physical conditions, elderly passengers usually take more time to get on or off a bus and require a city bus driver’s special attention or help. An increase in elderly passengers using city buses may increase the bus driver’s stress and/or fatigue levels. This study developed a structural equation model to investigate the causal relationships between a vector of stress factors and city bus drivers’ fatigue levels from a risk management perspective. The empirical study results based on a questionnaire survey indicated that mixed traffic flow conditions and the characteristics of elderly passengers are positively correlated with the levels of driving fatigue in city bus drivers. An increase in the number of motor scooters in a traffic stream and/or elderly passengers on a bus will lead to higher levels of mental fatigue for a city bus driver. This study discussed the effects of several stressors on a city bus driver’s fatigue and provided suggestions for changes in policies to ensure the fatigue mitigation of city bus drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
"The correlation between education, engineering, enforcement, and self-reported seat belt use in Tennessee: Incorporating heterogeneity and time of day effects",10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.003,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Time of day and heterogeneity are two common factors that received less attention in self-reported studies concerning seat belt use. Although nighttime seat belt use rate is relatively lower than daytime, previous studies have often not separated the analysis of seat belt use between daytime and nighttime. To incorporate heterogeneity in our analysis, we used random parameters and geographically weighted regression models to explore the factors influencing seat belt use. This study consists of a self-reported seat belt use survey conducted in a sample of 814 respondents aged 18–50 years in six counties (50 zip codes area) in East Tennessee. Comparison of the models indicated that the geographically weighted regression models outperformed other models. Considering the non-stationary test, we learned that the local coefficients displayed relatively constant variation across space in the study area, which indicates behaviors, at least across a large metropolitan area, does not vary spatially. For the random parameter models, age and income had random parameter effects. Perception of receiving a ticket for not wearing a seat belt, uncomfortable seat belt design, driving for a short distance, and driving exposure also had significant negative associations with self-reported seat belt use in both models. Moreover, exposure to educational programs had a significant correlation with seat belt use only in nighttime, whereas this correlation was insignificant for daytime. Findings provide new insight for design and convoy new messages to promote seat belt use by targeting factors predicting seat belt use. Results are discussed in line with road safety analysis.",1369-8478,Not found
Cognitive function and driving in middle adulthood: Does age matter?,10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.002,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Objective There is an established relationship in the literature between cognitive function and driving performance in older drivers and new evidence suggests that this relationship also exists in younger drivers. Given this, it follows that this relationship may exist for all drivers, however the relationship between cognitive function and driving in drivers in middle adulthood has not yet been examined. The current study therefore aims to examine this relationship of overall cognitive function and driving, as well as the individual cognitive domains relevant to driving for drivers in middle adulthood. Method The participants were 89 drivers aged between 25 and 65 years. Each participant was assessed on a battery of cognitive tests and completed a drive on a driving simulator. Measures of driving performance included speeding, lane deviation, and an overall driving performance score. Results The results showed new evidence to suggest overall cognitive function can predict speeding and overall driving performance. In addition, the cognitive domains of mental status, executive function and memory were found to be significant individual predictors in this cohort. Conclusions Taken together with previous findings, this study provides evidence to suggest that cognitive function is important to driving across the lifespan. The generalisability of the current results are limited due to the majority of participants being from a university sample, therefore these findings will need to be replicated in a more representative sample. Future research should focus on the development of a comprehensive model to explain driving performance across all ages and across traffic psychology disciplines.",1369-8478,Not found
Risk perception and intention to discontinue use of ride-hailing services in China: Taking the example of DiDi Chuxing,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.021,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The rise of ride-hailing services has been phenomenal in China. However, few studies have explored the links between users’ perceptions of risk and their intention to discontinue using a ride-hailing services. Here we report on the development of an integrated model to investigate how perceptions of risk play into a person’s decision to stop using a particular ride-hailing service—taking the Chinese company, DiDi Chuxing as a working example. An online survey of 443 users was conducted and the results were subjected to data analysis. The highlights are: (1) users’ perception of physical risk is the most important factor negatively affecting users’ trust in drivers; (2) users’ trust in drivers has a positive effect on users’ trust in the ride service platform and their attitude towards the platform; users’ trust in the platform positively affects their attitude towards the platform; (3) users’ trust in the platform and attitude towards it negatively affects their intention to discontinue using the service; (4) sex, age, and income differences have significant effects on users’ risk perception, trust and intention to discontinue use.

The research project KomfoPilot at Chemnitz University of Technology aimed to investigate factors that influence comfort in automated driving as well as to identify physiological indicators of discomfort. In an empirical driving simulator study, 40 participants from 25 to 84 years old experienced three highly automated trips including six potentially uncomfortable situations in each trip. Participants reported perceived discomfort continuously by a handset control. The physiological parameters Heart Rate (HR) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) were assessed using the smartband Microsoft Band 2; pupil diameter and eye blinks were measured by the SMI Eye Tracking Glasses 2. Results showed specific physiological reactions in situations that provoked moderate to high discomfort. Longer lasting and slowly evolving situations with lower reported discomfort did not show associated changes in physiological parameters. HR decreased consistently during uncomfortable situations, which could be related to the phenomenon “preparation for action”. Pupil diameter increased and eye blink rate decreased in uncomfortable situations that were visually monitored. EDA did not show specific effects, which, however could be attributed to measurement procedures of the smartband. The results serve as a basis for developing a real-time discomfort detection algorithm and will additionally be validated on-road.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors associated with commuter satisfaction across travel time ranges,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.019,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Studies have revealed that commuter satisfaction can vary significantly depending on the travel context, as well as individual behavior and attitudes. Despite numerous studies, it remains unclear under what conditions commuters are more (un)satisfied with their commute time. In particular, little is known about the various determinants of commute time satisfaction across different travel time ranges. Using data from a general social survey conducted in Gyeonggi, South Korea, this study investigates which factors influence commuter responses across several travel time ranges. One interesting finding is that the relationship between the proportion of satisfied commuters and travel time is not linear, but instead takes the form of a “V” shape, suggesting that commuter satisfaction can be influenced by factors other than the commute duration. Binary logistic regression models developed for six commute time ranges indicate that commuter satisfaction is a complex function of socio-demographic characteristics, travel characteristics, individual behaviors/attitudes, job-related characteristics, and perceived neighborhood quality. The models demonstrate that some factors have different effects depending on the commute time range. It was also found that some people willingly accept long commutes for the benefit of a high-quality neighborhood.",1369-8478,Not found

We use data from the May 2016 Spanish barometer (n = 1632) to analyse the characteristics of drivers who declare different types of risky driving behaviours. Our estimates suggest that the likelihood of being a high-risk driver in Spain increases with educational attainment and decreases with age. Moreover, it is higher for those with previous sanctions and for men, particularly so regarding speeding and driving after drinking alcohol. These results suggest that prevention policies in Spain should be targeted to different collectives of drivers depending on the particular risky behaviour considered.",1369-8478,Not found
"Higher symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) and younger age were associated with faster visual perception, but not with lower traffic violations",10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.010,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Traffic accidents are a significant health issue in Iran, and mostly due to drivers’ failures and health issues. In this view, the association between age, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), objective visual perception and attention (spatial cueing and visual search) and drivers’ driving violations and accidents have not been investigated in Iran so far. To counter this, 183 participants (mean age: 31.65 years; 147 males, 36 females) were assessed. They completed self-rating questionnaires covering sociodemographic information, driving violations, traffic accidents, and symptoms of ADHD. Further, participants’ visual search and spatial cueing were objectively tested. Results showed that higher symptoms of ADHD were associated with higher traffic violations and accidents, but also with a faster visual search and spatial cueing. Further, higher aging was associated with lower visual search and spatial cueing speed. Both higher ADHD scores and lower age predicted faster visual search and spatial cueing performance. The pattern of results suggests that among adults, symptoms of ADHD appeared to be both negatively associated with higher traffic violations, but also with faster visual search and spatial cueing performance. By contrast, the opposite was true as regards age. To increase traffic safety, both drivers with older age and with symptoms of ADHD appear to demand special attention.",1369-8478,Not found
How should autonomous vehicles overtake other drivers?,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.016,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Previous research examining trust of autonomous vehicles has largely focused on holistic trust, with little work on evaluation of specific behaviours and interactions with human-controlled vehicles. Six experiments examined the influence of pull-in distance, vehicle perspective (overtaking/being overtaken), following distance and immersion on self-reported evaluations of, and physiological responses to, autonomous motorway overtakes. We found that: (i) overtake manoeuvres were viewed more positively as pull-in distance increased before reaching a plateau at approximately 28 m, (ii) physiological-based orienting responses occurred for the smallest pull-in distances, (iii) participants being overtaken were more forgiving of a sharper pull-in if the overtaking vehicle was followed closely by another vehicle, and (iv) for two of three cross-experiment comparisons participants were more forgiving of smaller pull-in distances with lower immersion levels. Overall, the results suggest that the acceptability of an overtake manoeuvre increases linearly with pull-in distance up to a set point for both overtaking and being overtaken manoeuvres, with some influence of traffic context and levels of immersion. We discuss the findings in terms of implications for the development of assisted and fully autonomous vehicle systems that perform in a way that will be acceptable to both the vehicle occupants and other road users.",1369-8478,Not found
HeartPy: A novel heart rate algorithm for the analysis of noisy signals,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.015,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found

Self-regulation of drivers’ mobile phone use: The influence of driving context,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.012,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Mobile phone use while driving is a major concern for traffic safety. Various studies indicate negative effects of distracted driving and recent Naturalistic Driving studies report substantial increase in crash risk of mobile phone use while driving. The increasing level of vehicle automation is likely to further increase phone use behind the wheel, as the automation takes over part of the driving task drivers are likely to experience boredom and feel more confident to get involved in other activities such as phone use. This may further increase the distraction related accidents on our roads. However, the extent to which this further increases depends largely on the drivers’ level of self-regulation of risk, the timing of engagement in phone activities in relation to the driving context. The objective of this study was to investigate if drivers self-regulate their mobile phone use, specifically focussed on the visual manual (VM) task which is associated with the largest increase in risk, while driving in relation to different driving contexts. For this study naturalistic driving data was analysed of Dutch car drivers collected in the UDRIVE project. The results show that Dutch drivers spent over 9% of all driving time engaging in mobile phone related tasks, including calling and VM tasks such as texting. Drivers used their mobile phone significantly less when a passenger was present. Also, significantly more VM tasks were initiated during standstill than for the other speed categories. In addition, on rural roads relatively less time was spent on VM tasks and on highways relatively more time was spent on VM tasks. Overall the results show that the driving context seems to influence the initiation and involvement in VM tasks, which is an indication that drivers self-regulate this behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Flashing yellow arrows for right turn applications: A driving simulator study and static evaluation analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.013,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Pedestrians continue to be considered among the most vulnerable road users, as they are directly exposed to the impact of vehicular crashes. Due to the variety of turning movements that can be, and are, performed at signalized intersections, the vulnerability of pedestrians becomes more apparent upon entering a crosswalk at an intersection. At signalized intersections, it is common for pedestrians to cross an intersection parallel to the vehicular traffic who are provided with a circular green, or right-of-way, indication. A consequence of this approach is the conflict that arises between turning vehicles and crossing pedestrians. As a potential countermeasure, this study analyzed the effectiveness of flashing yellow arrows for right turn applications at modifying driver behaviour (visual attention, intersection approach speed, and direct perspective) through a two-step evaluation, including a large-scale static evaluation and direct driving simulator study. Over 200 respondents completed the large-scale static evaluation and 24 participants responded to 144 simulated right turn scenarios with various pedestrian presence, half of which had a flashing yellow arrow display. This research revealed that drivers have a strong comprehension of the meaning of the flashing yellow arrow and did not behave unsafely when presented with the indication during the simulator portion of the study. This study contributes in the area of pedestrian safety through the evaluation of the applicability of flashing yellow arrows for right turn applications as a countermeasure to mitigate vehicle-pedestrian crashes at intersections with parallel pedestrian crossings.",1369-8478,Not found
Modelling visual-vestibular integration and behavioural adaptation in the driving simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.018,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"It is well established that not only vision but also other sensory modalities affect drivers’ control of their vehicles, and that drivers adapt over time to persistent changes in sensory cues (for example in driving simulators), but the mechanisms underlying these behavioural phenomena are poorly understood. Here, we consider the existing literature on how driver steering in slalom tasks is affected by down-scaling of vestibular cues, and propose, for the first time, a computational model of driver behaviour that can, based on neurobiologically plausible mechanisms, explain the empirically observed effects, namely: decreased task performance and increased steering effort during initial exposure, followed by a partial reversal of these effects as task exposure is prolonged. Unexpectedly, the model also reproduced another previously unexplained empirical finding: a local optimum for motion down-scaling, where path-tracking is better than when one-to-one motion cues are available. Overall, our findings suggest that: (1) drivers make direct use of vestibular information as part of determining appropriate steering actions, and (2) motion down-scaling causes a yaw rate underestimation phenomenon, where drivers behave as if the simulated vehicle is rotating more slowly than it is. However, (3) in the slalom task, a certain degree of such underestimation brings a path-tracking performance benefit. Furthermore, (4) behavioural adaptation in simulated slalom driving tasks may occur due to (a) down-weighting of vestibular cues, and/or (b) increased sensitivity in timing and magnitude of steering corrections, but (c) seemingly not in the form of a full compensatory rescaling of the received vestibular input. The analyses presented here provide new insights and hypotheses about simulated driving and simulator design, and the developed models can be used to support research on multisensory integration and behavioural adaptation in both driving and other task domains.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluation of the effects of daytime running lights for passenger cars,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.008,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Research trying to determine the impact of the use of daytime running lights (DRL), in vehicles, on road safety are lasting throughout the decades. The largest number of previous studies were focused on the search for a relationship between the use of daytime running lights and the number of traffic accidents. As the occurrence of accidents is affected by many factors, this paper examines whether there are differences in driveŕs estimation of passenger car speed when daytime running lights are turned on or off. In order to examine these issues in more details, driving simulator research was conducted. The respondents estimated passenger car speed of 30 km/h, 50 km/h, 70 km/h and 90 km/h, in both conditions (with and without DRL). The results of this research clearly indicate that there are differences in the estimation of passenger car speed when DRL are turned on or off. These differences are statistically significant for higher vehicle speeds (70 km/h and 90 km/h). Furthermore, demographic factors, frequency of driving, as well as involvement in traffic accidents, show significant impact on vehicle speed estimation. The recommended measures (that imply the usage of the DRL only outside of the residential areas), would greatly contribute to the protection and preservation of the environment, primarily in built-up areas.",1369-8478,Not found
Ontology-based adaptive testing for automated driving functions using data mining techniques,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.021,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This paper presents an adaptive verification framework for automated driving functions based on ontologies and data-mining techniques. Despite the recent rapid growth of driver assistance systems to consolidate road safety, they still have various challenges coping with dynamic traffic situations of daily life. Therefore, automotive systems engineering has established data- and knowledge-driven test methods to assure the required functional safety and reliability in a highly safety-critical context. However, the reliance on field testing is inadequate and, in particular, time- and cost-intensive when applied to the next generation of automated driving functions, e.g. collision-free emergency braking and vehicle platooning. The presented framework utilises an ontology-based test scenario synthesis to identify criticality margins using a Hardware-in-the-Loop co-simulation platform for automated driving functions. Additionally, we demonstrate a systematic process to complement virtual testing by extracting insights from field testing database using event-based time-series analysis. To this end, data mining techniques are used to obtain representative scenarios witnessed in real-world traffic. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is performed to extract homogeneous groups (clusters) from recorded triggering events by proximity metrics using normalised cross-correlations. Extracted scenarios are subsequently used at earlier stages of development to effectively and efficiently ensure reliability and safety. In summary, the results show the benefits and some of the challenges of using the industry-proven framework, which enables a cost-effective extension of test domain vaidility throughout software product engineering.",1369-8478,Not found
Determinants of traveler satisfaction: Evidence for non-linear and asymmetric effects,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.009,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Classifying public transport service attributes based on their influence on overall traveler satisfaction can assist stakeholders and practitioners in introducing cost-efficient measures. To date most studies employed methods that were based on the assumption that the impact of service attributes on traveler satisfaction is entirely linear and symmetric. This study examines whether service attributes have a non-linear and asymmetric influence on the overall travel experience by employing the Three-factor theory (basic, performance and exciting factors). The analysis is conducted for different traveler segments depending on their level of captivity, travel frequency by public transport and travel mode used, and is based on a relatively large sample size collected for Stockholm County. Moreover, the estimated models control for important socio-demographic and travel characteristics that have been insofar overlooked. Results are presented in the form of a series of multi-level cubes that represent different essentiality of traveler needs which provide a useful methodological framework to further design quality service improvements that can be applied to various geographical contexts. Our findings highlight that a “one size fits all” approach is not adequate for identifying the needs of distinct traveler segments and of travelers using different travel modes. Furthermore, two-thirds of the attributes are consistently classified into the same factor category which entails important policy implications. This research deepens and expands the very limited knowledge of the application of the three-factor theory in the transport field.",1369-8478,Not found
What's around the curve? A driving simulation experiment on compensatory strategies for safe driving along horizontal curves with sight limitations,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.011,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This paper focuses on the behaviours adopted by road users when negotiating horizontal curves with sight limitations. Experiments at a driving simulator were conducted on two-lane highways in which drivers were confronted with a range of sight conditions generated by the manipulation of variables such as curve direction, radii and distance of lateral sight obstructions along horizontal curves. It was observed that most of the drivers adopted strategies which resulted in a stopping distance shorter than the available sight distance, thereby maintaining safe driving conditions. Some drivers reduced their speed, some increased the lateral distance from any sight obstructions along the roadside, some did both, while others did neither. A preliminary analysis indicated that the safety benefits resulting from a vehicle speed reduction strategy significantly outweigh those from a lateral shift in the lane. Further analyses on the 1246 cases investigated offered further support for this proposition, while revealing that a higher proportion of drivers opted for the first strategy for safety reasons. Moreover, visibility conditions (safe, partially safe, and unsafe) played a role in the choice of driving strategies. Results provide evidence that a significant group of drivers used the two strategies under severely restricted visibility conditions (i.e., along sharp radius curves); however, the strategies selected were independent of the driver speed profile (i.e., slower, average, or faster).",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating rider steering responses to an unexpected collision hazard using a motorcycle riding simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.005,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Motorcycle rider steer responses to unexpected collision emergencies have not been studied experimentally. We used a motorcycle simulator with elastic steer mechanism and modified car driving model to simulate the input-output counter steering response of two-wheeled vehicles in combination with a car pop-up paradigm from driving studies to evaluate rider responses to unexpected collision hazards. We manipulated time-to-crash – either 1 s or 1.5 s – to probe the threshold between not enough and just enough time to respond. The median response time of 570 ms was similar to previously recorded latencies for motorcycle emergency braking responses. Although median response time and steer torque did not depend on time-to-crash (TTC), the distribution and variability of response measures were increased when TTC was shorter. Riders showed improved lateral displacement toward the road centerline by the third TTC1.5 trial and were almost 8 times more likely to produce a successful virtual swerve avoidance maneuver in TTC1.5 rather than TTC1 trials. With 1.5 s to respond, riders were more consistent, with net steering inputs more congruent with the maneuvering goal compared to when they had only 1 s to respond. Comparisons of ‘safe’ versus ‘crash’ outcomes show that average response times across trials and riders are not different, but the variance in timing is lower across successful trials. We have shown than it is possible to safely study rider reactions to an emergency and observe a realistic range of steer responses to a traffic conflict using a motorcycle riding simulator. The results have relevance for the design of automatic rider assistive systems, rider behavior prediction and decision logic algorithms, PTW rider modeling and targeted training interventions.",1369-8478,Not found
Take-over requests during highly automated driving: How should they be presented and under what conditions?,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.023,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Even with highly automated driving, there will exist the occasional need for a human driver to resume control.

We conducted a driving simulator study in the laboratory that examined how either an abstract or skeuomorphic TOR design influenced driving resumption, given different conditions of road curvature and time headway. We found that drivers react faster and more accurately when experiencing a skeuomorphic visualisation of a TOR prompt compared to an abstract interface, especially when there is less time headway. Moreover, participants reported subjective preferences for the skeuomorphic TOR design and considered them to be more intuitively comprehensible. Furthermore, more accurate TOR responses were found when TORs of lateral control were presented before longitudinal control. Based on these results, we formulated five conclusions relating to the design of take-over requests. These conclusions should be validated in more realistic settings. However, in the future, they could be the basis for more research developing design guidelines that could create safe and reliable communications between drivers and vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found

All variables significantly predicted cellphone use while driving, including reading and sending texts as well as answering and making calls.

Understanding interactions between Automated Road Transport Systems and other road users: A video analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.006,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"If automated vehicles (AVs) are to move efficiently through the traffic environment, there is a need for them to interact and communicate with other road users in a comprehensible and predictable manner. For this reason, an understanding of the interaction requirements of other road users is needed. The current study investigated these requirements through an analysis of 22 h of video footage of the CityMobil2 AV demonstrations in La Rochelle (France) and Trikala (Greece). Manual and automated video-analysis techniques were used to identify typical interaction patterns between AVs and other road users. Results indicate that road infrastructure and road user factors had a major impact on the type of interactions that arose between AVs and other road users. Road infrastructure features such as road width, and the presence or absence of zebra crossings had an impact on road users’ trajectory decisions while approaching an AV. Where possible, pedestrians and cyclists appeared to leave as much space as possible between their trajectories and that of the AV. However, in situations where the infrastructure did not allow for the separation of traffic, risky behaviours were more likely to emerge, with cyclists, in particular, travelling closely alongside the AVs on narrow parts of the road, rather than waiting for the AV to pass. In addition, the types of interaction varied considerably across socio-demographic groups, with females and older users more likely to show cautionary behaviour around the AVs than males, or younger road users. Overall, the results highlight the importance of implementing the correct infrastructure to support the safe introduction of AVs, while also ensuring that the behaviour of the AV matches other road users’ expectations as closely as possible in order to avoid traffic conflicts.",1369-8478,Not found

Training has been proposed as a potential tactic to alleviate these challenges and improve driver interaction with automated cars. This study evaluated the effects of Simulator Training and Video Training on procedural and higher-order cognitive skills required for Conditionally Automated Driving (CAD), and users’ attitudes as well. Fifty-four people participated in the experiment, 18 in Simulator Training, 18 in Video Training, and 18 in Control groups. Takeover Time (TOT), speed, speed variance, Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP), Takeover Decision Accuracy (TODA), trust, and acceptance data were collected before and after training sessions. The results showed that both training methods improved TOT, speed variance, and SDLP. Moreover, the participants in Simulator Training outperformed in deciding whether takeover was necessary or not. The results also indicated that self-reported trust was less erratic in Post-Training Driving Assessment in both Simulator and Video Training. These findings imply that training, especially where interactive learning is provided, helped the participants develop a more developed mental model of CAD and better-calibrated trust. Training programs, however, did not create meaningful changes in the number of crashes, speed, nor automation acceptability.

The survey was carried out amongst members of the Norwegian Automobile Federation (n = 1419). The results indicated that a large share of the sample (71.8%) did not evaluate driverless shuttles as useful. Cluster members who stated that it was unlikely that the implementation of driverless shuttles would make them use the public transit more were more worried concerning the safety and security issues, the greatest concern being traffic safety (accidents). Cluster members who stated that it was likely that they would use the public transit more had more trust in the ability of the authorities to reduce the risk of accidents, and they accepted having more automation in future buses. Developers of shuttles, city governments, transport operators, and other authorities should consider the findings of this study in order to develop specific measures to increase the acceptance of automation in the transport sector. We recommend better informing the general public about the procedures for implementing driverless shuttles in mixed traffic and the safety and security requirements for the vehicle automation system. It is crucial to explain the measures (e.g. comprehensive risk analysis, site inspection, laws and regulations) that will be set out to ensure that no incidents or accidents will occur. In the meantime, the actors should do their utmost to reassure passengers and other road users by demonstrating the effectiveness of the safety and security systems.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of psychosocial factors on perceptions of driver education using the goals for driver education framework,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.004,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Professional driver education and training has often been found in evaluations to not provide additional safety benefits for young drivers. However, it is possible that identifying how psychosocial factors affect perceptions of driver education may contribute to improve program design, content and implementation. The Goals for Driver Education (GDE) framework was used in this research to explore the impact of various psychosocial factors, such as sensation seeking, normlessness, attitudes towards driver risk taking and positive attitudes towards speeding on the perceptions of young drivers participating in a professional driver education courses. One hundred and fourteen young drivers (Mage  = 17.89, SD = 0.85) who had attended a driver education course within the past three years completed an online survey that collected socio-demographic information, perceptions of the benefits of education for individuals learning to drive at each level of the GDE framework, and information about psychosocial factors. Overall, the results suggested that psychosocial factors do affect young driver perceptions of driver education and training. Higher levels of sensation seeking predicted that participants thought it beneficial for novice driver education to focus on vehicle manoeuvring (Level 1), mastery of traffic situations (Level 2) and goals and contexts for driving (Level 3) but not the highest level of the GDE matrix, goals for life. Higher levels of normlessness predicted participants believing it was more beneficial for new drivers to learn about the goals and contexts for driving. This suggests there is a need for driver educators to consider personalising their programs as much as possible to take into account the psychosocial differences between individuals, which may impact on the way they respond to the education they receive.",1369-8478,Not found
Riding the emotional roller-coaster: Using the circumplex model of affect to model motorcycle riders’ emotional state-changes at intersections,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.018,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This study uses Russell’s Circumplex Model of Affect to examine whether motorcycle rider emotion is contingent on the environment and behavior. If it is contingent then it becomes predictable. If it is predictable it becomes potentially usable for innovating new ways to improve the safety and utility of this important transport mode. Eighteen motorcyclists took part in a 15 km on-road study during which they were videoed, tracked via GPS, and followed by a ‘chase vehicle’ as they negotiated intersections, all the while providing a concurrent verbal commentary. The verbal commentary was content analysed using a novel method for mapping the verbalized emotional themes to the Circumplex Model. Network analysis was then used to explore the state changes between affective zones in the model. Riders’ emotions at intersections were found to vacillate between negative and positive affect, demonstrating high degrees of emotional dynamism. Many of these transitions occur in and out of the dominant positive state of calmness, with non-calm states appearing to be aversive and those which riders were seeking to avoid. Knowing this brings forward interesting new approaches for safe intersection design.",1369-8478,Not found
The relationship between self and other in aggressive driving and driver behaviors across countries,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.020,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The main aim of the present study was to investigate the moderating role of aggressive driving of others on the relationship between self-reported aggressive driving behaviors committed by driver himself/herself and drivers’ aberrant and positive driver behaviors (i.e. errors, violations, and positive driver behaviors) among drivers from Estonia, Greece, Kosovo, Russia, and Turkey as the total sample in order to understand the grand pattern. The other aim was to examine the same moderating role of aggressive driving for each country separately. It was hypothesized that the combination of self-reported of aggressive driving behaviors committed by the driver himself/herself and perceiving aggressive acts of other drivers against them associates with more errors and violations for each country and the total sample. On the other hand, this combination was expected to associate with less positive driver behaviors. Surveys were completed by 743 participants from five countries (i.e., Estonia, Greece, Kosovo, Russia, and Turkey). The Driver Anger Indicators Scale (DAIS) and the short version of the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) with items of Positive Driver Behavior Scale were used as measurement tools. Moderation analyses were conducted for the total sample and each country separately. The results of the moderation analyses indicated that there was a moderating role of perceiving other drivers as engaging in aggressive behaviors on the relationship between aggressive behaviors of the driver himself/herself and their errors or violations in the total sample and every country except for Russia. However, the significant interaction between aggressive behaviors committed by the driver himself/herself and other drivers' aggressive acts in traffic was related to more positive driver behaviors for Kosovar drivers and less positive driver behaviors for Russian drivers and the total sample. It could be discussed that the way of understanding aggressive behaviors for self and other related to aberrant and positive driver behaviors in traffic may be important to manage aggression for individual level and country level.",1369-8478,Not found
Dimensions of aberrant driving behaviour and their relation to crash involvement for drivers in New Zealand,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.024,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) is the most commonly used framework for investigating the relationship between self-reported driving behaviour and crash involvement. However, in spite of the fact that the scale is almost 30 years old, the factor structure of the scale and relationship to crashes in New Zealand remains under-researched. The present study set out to establish the factor structure of the DBQ in a sample of New Zealand private vehicle drivers and to examine the adequacy of this factor structure in an independent second sample of New Zealand drivers. Using exploratory factor analysis, the first sample (n = 860, M age = 39.3, 44% females) produced a factor structure that broadly supported the four hypothetical factors of errors, violations, aggressive violations and lapses. This factor structure was supported in a second sample from the New Zealand electoral roll (n = 441, M age = 53.4, 55% females), using confirmatory factor analysis. There were a number of differences in the relationships that the DBQ factors had with the demographic and descriptive variables. In the first sample, all four of the DBQ factors were significantly related to crash involvement. In contrast, none of the DBQ factors were related to crash involvement in the second sample, possibly due to the very small number of crashes reported. However, these differences are likely due to differences in the demographic composition of the two samples. The present study suggests that the DBQ is a valid measure of aberrant driving behaviour in New Zealand and this consists of errors, violations, aggressive violations and lapses.",1369-8478,Not found
Adaptations in attention allocation: Implications for takeover in an automated vehicle,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.016,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Automated technology in vehicles is increasingly changing and reducing the driving responsibilities for the human operator. However, these systems are still unequipped to handle many unexpected events and conditions. This study examined changes in driver attention allocation before and during exposure, and after removal of an active lane keeping system. Forty-eight drivers completed six drives across three separate days in a driving simulator. Thirty of the participants were exposed to an active lane keeping system and the remaining 18 participants (control group) were in a manual control group. An in-vehicle information system was used to measure willingness to engage in non-driving tasks. The number of secondary tasks completed, accuracy of these tasks, and eyes-off-road glance durations were measured. Participants exposed to the lane keeping system completed more secondary tasks under the partially automated conditions compared to manual, while accuracy of these tasks did not change. These participants also had longer eyes-off-road glances after returning to manual driving conditions, relative to their baseline measures. These results show that adaptations in driver attention and risk perception carry over after returning to manual control.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of driver's mood on car following and glance behaviour: Using cognitive load as an intervention,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.019,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Driving safety relies on a driver’s ability to maintain their attentional focus and that mood is one of the factors which influences this ability. This driving simulator study used mind wandering theory to understand the changes in car following behaviour and driver glance patterns when affected by neutral, happy, sad and angry moods during car following. Two types of cognitive load were used to investigate ways of disengaging drivers from the mind wandering state. The moods were induced via music and mental imagery and assessed via self-reports and physiological measures. The results show that mood valence and arousal have different effects on driving safety, with negative moods resulting in the most dangerous driving, regardless of arousal. The cognitive load, in some cases, disengaged drivers from mood-related mind wandering. However, more detailed research is needed to understand the amount of load necessary for this disengagement in different moods. The importance of using driving-related measures together with glance patterns in mood research was highlighted to overcome ambiguities resulting from conclusions based on single measurements.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors related to rapid deceleration events among a large cohort of older drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.021,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Studies over the past two decades have attempted to document and understand factors related to crashes involving older drivers to develop more effective countermeasures to reduce the frequency and severity of these crashes. Studies in which vehicle acceleration data can be recorded have begun to explore the relationship between rapid deceleration events (RDEs) and functional abilities among older drivers as a surrogate measure of unsafe driving. Recent naturalistic driving studies with older adults have found differing results using different thresholds to define an RDE. The present study examined the relationship among RDE rates, demographics, visual abilities, cognitive abilities, and driving comfort among a large cohort of older drivers, using two definitions of RDEs—longitudinal deceleration of 0.35 g or greater (RDE35) and longitudinal deceleration of 0.75 g or greater (RDE75). The study utilized objective driving, objective functioning, and reported driving comfort data from 2774 participants of the multi-site AAA Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers (LongROAD) study. RDE rates for each threshold were calculated per 1000 miles driven. Multivariate regression models with backward elimination were developed to examine how outcome measures were related to RDE rates. Too few RDE75 events were found for meaningful analysis. RDE35 rates were significantly associated with several covariates. RDE35 rates were related to declining functional abilities, but many other factors also played a significant role in the rate of RDE35s among older drivers, diminishing the value of using RDE35 rates as a surrogate measure of driving safety. In addition, because the AAA LongROAD sample was relatively healthy and high functioning, other ability-related covariates may also be significantly related to RDE35s but the lack of variance in these measures in the current study prevented these effects from emerging.",1369-8478,Not found

Factor analysis showed that the data best fit the four-factor solution, which explained 47.28% of the total variance. The factors were named rule and aggressive violations, ordinary violations, personal control errors and distractions. On average, male bicyclists reported higher rates of rule and aggressive violations, ordinary violations and distractions than females, and young bicyclists were more prone to these aberrant behaviours than older bicyclists. The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that rule and aggressive violations, ordinary violations and distractions were related to self-reported crashes.

Construction and validation of a public bus passenger safety scale,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.017,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Public transport (PT) passengers make safety evaluations, yet to the best of our knowledge, there exists no instrument that captures what is considered by public transport users when they make such personal safety evaluations. What exists is a generalised service quality scale (SERVQUAL). Unfortunately, this scale does not adequately capture the content domain of personal safety which is important to PT users, especially in developing countries where PT vehicle accidents are both frequent and severe. This study discusses the development and validation of a public bus passenger safety scale (PBPSS), for measuring public bus passengers’ safety. The results of two independent studies suggest that the PBPSS measures three facets of public bus passengers’ safety: driver-related, transport operator-related and vehicle-related. Through both exploratory Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) (using IBM SPSS Statistics and AMOS respectively), we demonstrated that the new scale is reliable, psychometrically sound and can be utilised to assess public bus passengers’ safety. The 3-factor model observed through PCA was confirmed using CFA, indicating that the same factor structure existed in both datasets. The final 3-factor, 17-item model exhibited an acceptable model fit and evidenced both convergent and discriminant validity.",1369-8478,Not found
Real autonomous driving from a passenger's perspective: Two experimental investigations using gaze behaviour and trust ratings in field and simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.013,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Trusting autonomous vehicles is seen as crucial for their dissemination. However, research on autonomous driving so far is restricted by using closed training courses or simulators and by comparing behaviour and evaluation while driving oneself (a manual car) with being driven (by an autonomous car). In the current study, we investigated passengers’ eye movements, categorized as safety-relevant or not safety-relevant, and trust ratings while being driven, once manually and once by an autonomous car, in real traffic as well as in a simulator. As some of the effects observed in the field experiment might have been caused by driving style, driving style was additionally varied in the simulator. Fixations in safety-relevant regions (e.g., on the road and steering wheel) were observed more frequently during safety critical driving situations than during regular driving. More safety-relevant fixations for the autonomous compared to the manual driving mode were observed particularly in the field. Trust ratings were affected by driving mode mainly in the simulator: Here, being driven autonomously led to a lower reported trust than believing to be driven by a human driver. Driving style showed to affect trust ratings, but not gaze behaviour in the simulator experiment. Correlations between gazing into safety relevant regions and trust ratings were of smaller descriptive size than in recent investigations on drivers, suggesting that gazing into safety-relevant regions as objective alternative to trust ratings may not be as exhaustive for passengers as for drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Offline motion simulation framework: Optimizing motion simulator trajectories and parameters,10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.019,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This paper presents a method to simultaneously compute optimal simulator motions and simulator parameters for a predefined set of vehicle motions. The optimization can be performed with a model of human motion perception or sensory dynamics taken into account. The simulator dynamics, sensory dynamics, and optimality criterion are provided by the user. The dynamical models are defined by implicit index-1 differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The direct collocation method is used to find the numerical solution of the optimization problem. The possible applications of the method include calculating optimal simulator motion for scenarios when the future motion is perfectly known (e.g., comfort studies with autonomous vehicles), optimizing simulator design, and evaluating the maximum possible cueing fidelity for a given simulator. To demonstrate the method, we calculated optimal trajectories for a set of typical car maneuvers for the CyberMotion Simulator at the Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. We also optimize the configurable cabin position of the simulator and assess the corresponding motion fidelity improvement. The software implementation of the method is publicly available.",1369-8478,Not found
Studying pedestrians’ crossing behavior when interacting with automated vehicles using virtual reality,10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.015,66,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Partially and fully automated vehicles (AVs) are being developed and tested in different countries. These vehicles are being designed to reduce and ultimately eliminate the role of human drivers in the future. However, other road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists will still be present and would need to interact with these automated vehicles. Therefore, external communication interfaces could be added to the vehicle to communicate with pedestrians and other non-automated road users. The first aim of this study is to investigate how the physical appearance of the AV and a mounted external human-machine interface (eHMI) affect pedestrians’ crossing intention. The second aim is to assess the perceived realism of Virtual reality based on 360° videos for pedestrian crossing behavior for research purposes. The speed, time gap, and an eHMIs were included in the study as independent factors. Fifty-five individuals participated in our experiment. Their crossing intentions were recorded, as well as their trust in automation and perceived behavioral control. A mixed binomial logistic regression model was applied on the data for analysis. The results show that the presence of a zebra crossing and larger gap size between the pedestrian and the vehicle increase the pedestrian’s intention to cross. In contrast to our expectations, participants intended to cross less often when the speed of the vehicle was lower. Despite that the vehicle type affected the perceived risk of the participants, no significant difference was found in crossing intention. Participants who recognized the vehicle as an AV had, overall, lower intentions to cross. A strong positive relationship was found between crossing intentions and perceived behavioral control. A difference in trust was found between participants who recognized the vehicle as automated, but this did not lead to a difference in crossing intentions. We assessed the research methodology using the presence questionnaire, the simulation sickness survey, and by comparing the results with previous literature. The method scored highly on the presence questionnaire and only 2 out of 55 participants stopped prematurely. Thus, the research methodology is useful for crossing behavior experiments.",1369-8478,Not found
The intersection of pedestrian safety and multimodal perception,10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.002,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Pedestrian injury is a costly and all-too-common form of unintentional injury.

Previous pedestrian safety research has included both visual and auditory perceptual cues. Few studies, however, have specifically focused on examining the unique strengths and weaknesses of vision and audition in the pedestrian task. We therefore posit future pedestrian safety research should give more detailed consideration to the perceptual modalities involved in the pedestrian task. The human factors literature contains theories and frameworks which pedestrian safety researchers and practitioners may use to conceptualize the perceptual components of the pedestrian’s tasks. We propose a multimodal approach to pedestrian safety research comprising two broad principles drawn from the perceptual modality literature: independence and dominance. We discuss the principles in the context of how each principle may inform pedestrian safety research as well as injury prevention efforts.",1369-8478,Not found

We utilize a sample of 700 passengers who took a test-ride of autonomous shuttle services in a scooter-dominant urban mobility context for model estimations. Results show that both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness positively correlate to attitude, in turn leading to use intention. Trust is positively related to attitude, but not to use intention, while perceived enjoyment is positively related to both attitude and use intention. Results of multi-group analyses indicate the moderating roles of age and gender in the estimated models. Overall, respondents are satisfied with the shuttle service in terms of the five attributes of speed, stability and comfort, safety, convenience, and information clarity.

However, there appears to be no consensus on which types of eHMIs are clear to vulnerable road users. Here, we present the results of two large crowdsourcing surveys on this topic. In the first survey, we asked respondents about the clarity of 28 images, videos, and patent drawings of eHMI concepts presented by the automotive industry. Results showed that textual eHMIs were generally regarded as the clearest. Among the non-textual eHMIs, a projected zebra crossing was regarded as clear, whereas light-based eHMIs were seen as relatively unclear. A considerable proportion of the respondents mistook non-textual eHMIs for a sensor. In the second survey, we examined the effect of perspective of the textual message (egocentric from the pedestrian’s point of view: ‘Walk’, ‘Don’t walk’ vs. allocentric: ‘Will stop’, ‘Won’t stop’) and color (green, red, white) on whether respondents felt safe to cross in front of the AV. The results showed that textual eHMIs were more persuasive than color-only eHMIs, which is in line with the results from the first survey. The eHMI that received the highest percentage of ‘Yes’ responses was the message ‘Walk’ in green font, which points towards an egocentric perspective taken by the pedestrian. We conclude that textual egocentric eHMIs are regarded as clearest, which poses a dilemma because textual instructions are associated with practical issues of liability, legibility, and technical feasibility.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of incentives and instructions on behaviour in driving simulator studies,10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.007,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"There are a number of factors which may influence the validity of experimental studies, including the incentives offered and the instructions provided to participants. These have been little-studied in the driving domain. The aim of this study was to investigate how manipulating these factors influenced participants’ feelings of ‘presence’ (i.e. the extent to which they believed they were actually driving and not in a simulated environment). The findings showed that imposing a penalty system for poor driving performance and providing ‘good driving’ instructions did not significantly affect presence ratings. This has a number of plausible explanations, including research study participants’ inherent need to perform well under test conditions and the small range of performance variability expected in a normal driving scenario. The financial penalty resulted in slightly slower speeds, although none of the participants drove excessively quickly, supporting the argument that study participants tend to perform diligently under test conditions irrespective of incentives or instructions. Participants in the penalty and instructions conditions gave higher ratings for negative effects (related to physically feeling unwell), suggesting that these conditions made them more aware of the physical symptoms of being in a simulator (but not that participants were actually experiencing more sickness). The results can be viewed positively in terms of reliability and generalizability across different driving simulator studies, as variations in study design (i.e. how instructions are delivered to participants and whether participants are paid to participate) do not have a significant effect on performance.",1369-8478,Not found

Results indicate that individuals perceive and evaluate moving and stopped motor vehicle screen use (MVSU) differently, as well as engage in these behaviors at different rates. Compared to moving MVSU, participants engaged in stopped MVSU more frequently, felt more efficacious and less guilty about such behavior, and evaluated it as less risky, more acceptable, and as less reflective of moral values. Although levels of stopped versus moving MVSU were strongly correlated, larger differences in evaluations of stopped versus moving MVSU were associated with weaker correlations between engaging in the two MVSU behaviors.

The study proposes a two-stage framework where in the first stage a rule-based fuzzy logic model is used to form a latent choice set. The second stage incorporates the set in a discrete choice model to estimate destination selection behaviour. In the travel demand modelling literature, there has been little research into modelling recreational activity destination choices. In this area, the primary focus has been on other activities, such as work, study and shopping. In this context, the sampling methods used to form the choice set using the large set of possible options in the universal set are unconvincing.

Objectives: This study had two aims. First, to describe in detail the validation of the Taubman-Ben-Ari’s MDSI among professional drivers and, second, to test its convergent validity with other key relevant factors present in the work environment of this particular population: driving anger, job strain and occupational driving crashes. Method: The data used for this validation was gathered from a representative sample of 752 Colombian professional drivers and analyzed by means of competitive Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs), assessing psychometric properties and obtaining an optimized structure for the instrument applied to active transportation workers. Results: The outcomes of this study suggest a clear factorial structure, adequate model fit, factorial weights, reliability and internal consistency, keeping the re-evaluated four-factor structure of the questionnaire: Reckless & Careless (F1); Anxious (F2); Angry & Hostile (F3); and Patient & Careful (F4).

How do perceptions of risk and other psychological factors influence the use of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS)?,10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.011,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"In-vehicle information systems (IVIS) have increased in popularity and availability in the past five years and are expected to transform the way individuals drive. Therefore, it is important to investigate the potential risks associated with IVIS use, particularly with regards to distracted driving. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate drivers’ engagement with IVIS and related risky driving behaviours. Specifically, the current study explored drivers’ current knowledge and use of IVIS and perceptions of risk, and used the Theory of Planned Behaviour to investigate the psychological factors that influence drivers’ decision-making in relation to its use. A semi-structured interview was conducted with 32 Australian drivers aged 19–70 years who drove vehicles with an IVIS. The results showed that drivers mainly used their IVIS for entertainment (i.e., music) and navigation purposes (i.e. GPS), and lacked comprehensive knowledge of other capabilities. Additionally, drivers do not believe an IVIS is an essential system, and further stated that it would be risky if drivers relied on the IVIS for engagement in driving tasks (e.g., navigation) or non-driving tasks (e.g., mobile phone). Some of the factors that influenced drivers’ decisions to use IVIS were the safety, entertainment, and convenience it offered and the influence of family and friends. Finally, there is evidence that mobile phones are often preferred over IVIS while driving, based on perceptions that IVIS have lower ease of use and usability.",1369-8478,Not found
Safety of professional drivers in an ageing society – A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.006,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Of the road crashes involving personal injury in Hong Kong, over 70% involved at least one commercial vehicle. Besides, the proportion of older drivers in the transport sector has been increasing due to the shortage of labor and ageing population. It is believed that increase in age can have adverse impact on driving performance, even that professional drivers may possess better driving skill than non-professional drivers and the age-related impairment can be offset by task familiarity of professional drivers. In this paper, a driving simulator experiment was conducted to address this question. Additionally, possible factors that affect the driving performance of professional drivers and that of non-professional drivers were examined. A total of 50 participants were recruited and 94 tests were completed. Driving performance was assessed in terms of standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), standard deviation of heading error (SDHE), mean heading error (MeanHE) and standard deviation of speed (SDspeed). Results of random intercept models indicate that lateral and speed control performances of mid-aged drivers were better than those of older drivers. Then, disaggregated models were established for professional and non-professional drivers respectively based on the results of market segmentation analysis. It was found that lateral and speed control performance of mid-aged professional drivers were better than that of older professional drivers. In contrast, older non-professional drivers were more likely to have degraded steering performance under the high traffic condition. Results of this study are indicative to the driver management strategies of the transport operators for sustained safety improvement of commercial vehicle fleet.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluation of the effects of age-friendly human-machine interfaces on the driver's takeover performance in highly automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.009,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The ability to continue driving into old age is strongly associated with older adults’ mobility and wellbeing for those that have been dependant on car use for most of their adult lives. The emergence of highly automated vehicles (HAVs) may have the potential to allow older adults to drive longer and safer. In HAVs, when operating in automated mode, drivers can be completely disengaged from driving, but occasionally they may be required to take back the control of the vehicle. The human-machine interfaces in HAVs play an important role in the safe and comfortable usage of HAVs. To date, only limited research has explored how to design age-friendly HMIs in HAVs and evaluate their effectiveness. This study designed three HMI concepts based on older drivers’ requirements, and conducted a driving simulator investigation with 76 drivers (39 older drivers and 37 younger drivers) to evaluate the effect and relative merits of these HMIs on drivers’ takeover performance, workload and attitudes. Results showed that the ‘R + V’ HMI (informing drivers of vehicle status together with providing the reasons for the manual driving takeover request) led to better takeover performance, lower perceived workload and highly positive attitudes, and is the most beneficial and effective HMI. In addition, The ‘V’ HMI (verbally informing the drivers about vehicle status, including automation mode and speed, before the manual driving takeover request) also had a positive effect on drivers’ takeover performance, perceived workload and attitudes. However, the ‘R’ HMI (solely informing drivers about the reasons for takeover as part of the takeover request) affected older and younger drivers differently, and resulted in deteriorations in performance and more risky takeover for both older and younger drivers compared to the baseline HMI. Moreover, significant age difference was observed in the takeover performance and perceived workload. Above all, this research highlights the significance of taking account older drivers’ requirements into the design of HAVs and the importance of collaboration between automated vehicle and cooperative ITS research communities.",1369-8478,Not found
Effectiveness of a strategic hazard anticipation training intervention in high risk scenarios,10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.004,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The current study evaluates a training program – STRAP (Secondary Task Regulatory & Anticipatory Program) – designed to improve young drivers’ strategic hazard anticipation skills by training them to strategically detect the clues (e.g., a crosswalk sign) to the presence of a potential hazard prior to being able to tactically anticipate the latent hazard (e.g., a pedestrian at a crosswalk). Following the completion of either STRAP or placebo training, forty-eight young drivers aged between 18 and 21 years navigated eight scenarios on a driving simulator while performing secondary tasks, with their eye movements recorded. The secondary tasks included those that require drivers to take their eyes off the road (e.g., a coin change task) and those which do not (e.g., a cell phone conversation). The drivers were instructed to voluntarily engage in as many secondary tasks as possible during the drive. STRAP did not explicitly instruct them to either disengage from or not engage in secondary tasks. The results show that STRAP-trained drivers were more likely to detect latent hazards and associated clues to those hazards than placebo-trained drivers. Moreover, the STRAP-trained drivers were more likely to limit the duration of their secondary task engagement in the presence of such hazards than the placebo-trained drivers. Strategic hazard anticipation training programs may promote defensive driving among young drivers by allowing them to anticipate clues to latent road hazards.",1369-8478,Not found
Age stereotypes and compliance with feedback in elderly drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.001,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"In spite of their increased risk of causing traffic accidents, older drivers often overestimate their own driving abilities. To develop a realistic assessment of driving abilities, as well as proper self-regulation, feedback from relatives or friends who point out dangerous driving situations is often helpful. However, an open question remains as to how older car drivers respond to such feedback. We conducted a telephone (Study 1, n = 281) and an online survey (Study 2, n = 285) and asked older drivers how they would respond to feedback about their driving behavior. Because previous research has shown positive effects of age stereotypes on behavior in the area of health psychology, we assumed that elderly people with positive age stereotypes see themselves as able to improve and change their behavior, and thus are open to feedback on their driving behavior. In line with this hypothesis, we found overall a strong positive relation between positive age stereotypes and openness to feedback on driving behavior. The positive effect of positive age stereotypes on openness to feedback was not offset by the fact that older drivers with positive age stereotypes perceive themselves as less vulnerable versus other older drivers, and was not moderated according to different feedback givers.",1369-8478,Not found
"Short-term cognitive conspicuity training does not improve driver detection of motorcycles at road junctions: A reply to Crundall, Howard, and Young (2017)",10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.008,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"A common cause of road accidents is driver failure to perceive an approaching motorcycle. In a lab-based study, we investigated whether a simple naturalistic training intervention designed to increase the cognitive conspicuity of motorcycles could improve drivers’ recognition of approaching motorcycles. Experienced drivers completed a series of motorcycle search tasks (training condition) or passively viewed scenes from nature (control) prior to performing a vehicle recognition task from the perspective of a driver approaching a T-junction. Results confirm established findings that drivers perform poorly at recognising motorcycles compared to cars, especially at far distances. However, motorcycle search training had no effect on driver accuracy in recognising approaching vehicles. Training lead to increased response times for recognising approaching cars relative to motorcycles, which could suggest a more thorough consideration of the road scene following training. We conclude that using motorcycle search training to raise the cognitive conspicuity of motorcycles is not effective in increasing their detection from a single delivery of training. Focusing on increasing motorcyclist visibility may be a more effective way to improve driver responses to motorcycles at junctions.",1369-8478,Not found
"Directability, eye-gaze, and the usage of visual displays during an automated vehicle handover task",10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.005,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The proposed next step in semi-automated vehicle technology is to allow a driver to conduct secondary tasks whilst automation is in full control of the driving task. The driver may be required to take control and promptly re-enter ‘the control loop’ if an automated feature reaches a design, geographical or capability boundary. In these circumstances it is of importance to raise the ‘Situation Awareness’ (SA) of the system through transactions between driver and vehicle. Communication literature suggests that a useful method for facilitating interactions between driver and automation is ‘directability’, guidance towards future actions or relevant pieces of information (e.g. road hazards). It is proposed that this would lead to improved SA. This study evaluated the role of directability in semi-automated vehicles by testing two research questions, how well can vocal communication from an automated assistant guide driver visual gaze, and how do drivers utilise visual displays during handover and manual driving? Participants took part in a simulated driving handover task on a highway. It was found that vocal guidance was effective in directing visual gaze. Further, the majority of visual-gaze in both handover and manual tasks was directed towards the road environment, and displays close to the road-view. This study provides additional evidence that vocal communication could serve as a reliable SA raising method, as well as provide insights into how different visual displays can be utilised for raising SA in level 3 and 4 automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
The assessment of hazard awareness skills among light rail drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.003,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Light rail (LR) is a popular means of public transportation worldwide, in use in more than 380 cities worldwide. LR drivers must have good hazard awareness: the ability to understand the complexity of the traffic environment and anticipate road events. Yet, no study has examined LR drivers' ability to anticipate hazards, and this is the purpose of this study. The experimental group included 28 certified LR drivers from the LR in Jerusalem. The control group included 26 licensed drivers, with no experience in LR driving. Participants observed 18 short video clips of typical LR driving that were filmed from the LR driver's field of view and had to press a response button each time they identified a hazard. Participants' eye movements and button presses were recorded throughout the experiment. In general, LR drivers were better at identifying hazards compared to the control group. Novice LR drivers with less than 1 year of LR driving experience or under training were more likely to respond to hidden hazards and responded much sooner compared to both the experienced LR drivers and Control drivers.

Gap acceptance study of pedestrians crossing between platooning autonomous vehicles in a virtual environment,10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.017,67,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating in shared urban environments, often referred to as “pods”, will constantly have to interact with pedestrians. As a result, an effective strategy will be required for pods to continue operating, while in close proximity to people. This strategy could be in terms of active negotiation, where a pod identifies a person and gives way; or a more passive strategy, such as requiring pods to travel close together in platoons, in order to reduce the number of individual vehicle encounters. For this latter example, it is critical to understand how the spaces between pods and AVs in general are perceived by pedestrians, and what factors will persuade and dissuade crossing. Therefore, this paper seeks to understand this relationship, and presents results from a pedestrian gap acceptance study for platoons. To ensure the safety of participants, a virtual environment was used instead of real vehicles. The goal of the experiment described in this paper, is to understand the gap acceptance behaviour of participants, when presented with a platoon of pods in different environments. The experiment evaluated four vehicle speeds, from 1 km/h to 16 km/h, four temporal gaps, from 2 s to 5 s, and two environments. These environments were a typical road layout, with footpath and line markings, and a shared space, where all markings and separation between pod and pedestrian were removed. For each scenario, participants were asked if they would cross between the pods and how safe they felt about the situation, recorded as a Likert score. The results suggest that people are more likely to attempt to cross between a platoon of pods when they are travelling closer together in a shared space (no line markings or separation between vehicles and pedestrian), compared to a road environment (separated by raised pavement and road markings). However, it was also found that people’s subjective rating of safeness was higher in the road environment, when presented with a platoon of pods, compared to the shared space.",1369-8478,Not found

The results show that approximately 21% of the pedestrians violate the lights. There is, however, large variability in the frequency of violations depending on the specific context. Traffic volumes, motorized as well as pedestrian volumes, and situational characteristics that are generally associated with higher traffic complexity (rush hours, number of driving directions, number of lanes per driving direction and the presence of a tram or bus lane) have a lowering effect. A number of technical characteristics of the pedestrian crossing were also found to exert a significant influence: push buttons and worn off zebra markings increase the frequency of violations.

External HMI for self-driving vehicles: Which information shall be displayed?,10.1016/j.trf.2019.12.009,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The objective of this study was to investigate pedestrians’ informational needs towards self-driving vehicles (SDVs). Previous research has shown that external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) compensate for pedestrian-driver communication when SDVs are integrated into traffic. However, detailed insights on which information the eHMI shall provide lack so far. In a mixed design study, N = 59 participants encountered a simulated driverless vehicle in different traffic scenarios (a. unsignalized intersection vs. b. parking lot; between-subject factor). We investigated the effect of no eHMI (baseline) vs. eHMIs displaying the automated driving system (ADS) status, and informing subsequently about its perception of the pedestrian and/or its intent for the next maneuver ((1) no eHMI, (2) status eHMI, (3) status + perception eHMI, (4) status + intent eHMI, (5) status + perception + intent eHMI; within-subject factor). A mixed-methods design was used to explore participants’ subjective feelings, traffic behavior, and underlying attitudes. The findings reveal that any eHMI contributes to a more positive feeling towards SDVs compared to the baseline condition without eHMI, consistent among traffic scenarios: participants felt significantly safer, reflected greater trust and user experience ratings, and perceived the SDV as more intelligent and transparent. The status indicator mainly drives these beneficial effects on subjective measures. Participants reported that the status information explains the absence of a driver steering the vehicle. Compared to the status eHMI, the status + perception eHMI reflects no further benefit regarding subjective feelings and even has a negative impact on traffic flow. Moreover, participants regarded the additional information on the vehicle’s perception as an obvious gimmick. On the contrary, the status + intent eHMI increases user experience, perceived intelligence, and transparency for pedestrians more than the mere status eHMI. Participants reported that additionally informing about the vehicle’s intent adds a further sense of safety. The present study failed to show any improvements in traffic flow but found evidence for individual crossing and clearing strategies among pedestrians. This work can inform the future design of eHMIs.",1369-8478,Not found
Increasing conspicuity on night-time roads: Perspectives from cyclists and runners,10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.016,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Pedestrians and cyclists are at significant risk of being killed as a result of a collision with a vehicle at night-time because of their poor conspicuity. Retroreflective strips positioned on the moveable joints, in a biological motion configuration (biomotion), greatly enhance the night-time conspicuity of pedestrians and cyclists, but it is not clear how widely this strategy is adopted among those running and cycling under low light levels (dawn and dusk or at night). This study explored runners’ and cyclists’ beliefs about their own conspicuity, and the strategies they use to increase their conspicuity and safety under low light levels. Nine focus groups involving 50 participants (mean age = 39.5 ± 13.9 years) were held with individuals who ran and/or cycled under low light conditions or at night-time. The strategies that participants used to increase their conspicuity and enhance their personal safety, and the importance they placed on increased conspicuity to other road users at night was explored. Data were analysed thematically, with two main themes identified. Strategies describes the different approaches used to increase conspicuity when running or cycling in low light, some of which are ineffective. Importance describes how conspicuity relates to other considerations that influence cyclists and runners. While they may believe that conspicuity is essential for their safety, they may compromise their own conspicuity by prioritising style or comfort, or because they believe that being more conspicuous is of limited value because it cannot compensate for the behaviour of other road users. In summary, cyclists and runners are largely unaware of effective strategies to increase their night-time conspicuity, particularly the use of biomotion reflective strips. Garment manufacturers should ensure that conspicuity features (with supporting educative product information on labels) are incorporated into cyclists’ and runners’ clothing or accessories to improve wearer conspicuity and hence safety in low light conditions.",1369-8478,Not found
Who's the boss?

Determining a combination that preserves the best performance features of human and automatic control yet allows either driver to cover for the faults of the other is a challenging problem. In this study, we invited 11 participants to drive a simulated vehicle through a course with obstacles to investigate the ability of human-automation teams to cover for human and automation faults. We developed the automation system using model predictive control and implemented three schemes under which the human would share control with the automation. In Autopilot, the human driver initiated a takeover with a button press whereas in Active Safety the automation initiated a takeover when it anticipated an obstacle collision. In Haptic Shared Control the human was free to invoke a transition by activating or relaxing muscles. In addition, we included two baseline conditions in which control was given in whole to either the human or the automation. We compared performance in the five conditions by analyzing obstacle hits and metrics related to driving maneuvers around the obstacles that were avoided. Relative to individual human or automatic driver performance, we found that control sharing reduced obstacle hits under fault conditions but also occasionally resulted in obstacle hits under no-fault conditions. Our findings further indicated that team performance suffered most under Autopilot for automation faults and suffered most under Active Safety for human faults. Haptic Shared Control supported the best overall team performance.",1369-8478,Not found

For every condition 100 trials were recorded with a staged pedestrian that initiated a standardized crossing when a vehicle was approaching. The frequency of drivers’ yielding was computed for each condition. A significant increase for yielding compliance was recorded from standard road lighting to enhanced dedicated lighting (19–38.21%), and from enhanced dedicated lighting to the seventh condition with the flashing beacons and the flashing in-curb LED strips activated (38.21–63.56%).

Driver performance due to small unmanned aerial system applications in the vicinity of roadways,10.1016/j.trf.2019.12.006,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), or drones, have become increasingly utilized for a myriad of applications in the vicinity of roadways and can offer a low-cost alternative to many labor-intensive data collection techniques, including infrastructure inspection, roadway marking data collection, and more. To collect much of this data with a desired degree of accuracy, sUAS must be flown near moving vehicles, pedestrians, and/or bicyclists. However, sUAS, and their operators, have the potential to be a distraction to drivers. Through a full-immersion driver simulator study and post-experiment questionnaire, this study furthered the current state-of-the-literature and investigated the potential for sUAS to be flown in the vicinity of roadways in the future as well as potential safety implications of those circumstances. Specifically, driver performance due to drone height and the presence of drone operators was evaluated. The results of the driving simulation study revealed that participants were more visually distracted in situations where the operators and drone were both present compared to the drone only scenarios. Furthermore, in 11% of all analyzed situations, drivers were critically visually-distracted as shown by a continuous glance of two seconds or more at the drone or operators. The post-experiment questionnaire revealed that approximately 30% of participants had seen a drone in flight near a roadway prior to this study.

The safety and conspicuity of pedestrian crossing at roundabouts: The effect of median refuge island and zebra markings,10.1016/j.trf.2019.12.007,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Roundabouts are one of the most used road intersections because, compared to signalized ones, they reduce conflict points between traffic flows and moderate driving speed. Great attention should also be paid to vulnerable road users at roundabouts. According to accident statistics, in fact, accessibility of pedestrians and cyclists is not always ensured. This paper has evaluated the effects on the visibility of pedestrian crossing before and after the displacement of zebra markings, moved before intersections, and the introduction of media refuge islands and “Yield here to pedestrians” vertical signs. The above effects have been assessed by before-after analysis of speed and visual behaviour of drivers approaching the crosswalk. Moreover, the analysis of the drivers’ eye movements has highlighted the most salient elements of the pedestrian crossing. The relation between the drivers’ visual behaviour and the vehicle speed have also been calculated. Results have confirmed that the intervention carried out has increased both visibility and safety of the studied pedestrian crosswalks. Zebra markings and the median refuge island have turned out to be the most glanced elements, respectively seen by 93.75% and 56.25% of the drivers, followed by the “Yield here to pedestrians” vertical sign. The mean distance of first fixation of the crosswalk increased from 21.98 m before the intervention, to 40.69 m after it.

Additionally, glance data from 23 participants who both cycled and drove along an urban route are compared with respect to information sampling strategies and the fulfilment of attentional requirements depending on its type for three intersections. Generally, more attentional requirements existed for cyclists, and due to where they occur relative to the infrastructure, in combination with the physical aspects of cycling, they are less likely to be fulfilled. This was also corroborated by the empirical data, which showed that requirements clearly visible from the infrastructural design are fulfilled more often than those that are not.

The empirical strategy consisted of exploratory data analysis (EDA), ordinary least squares (OLS), and a local regression model to account for spatial autocorrelation. The latter model was robust (R2 = 68%), and showed that two statistically significant (p < 0.05) urban design factors influenced bicyclist physiology. Controllability, a measure of how spatially dominated a space is, increased bicyclist responses (i.e., decreased comfortability); while integration, which is related to accessibility and connectivity, had the opposite effect. Other noteworthy covariates included one-way streets and density of parked automobiles: these exerted a negative influence on bicyclist physiology. The results of this research ultimately showed that nuanced urban designs have a moderate influence on bicycling comfort.

Moreover, in-vehicle information systems using different display positions and information processing channels might encourage secondary task engagement. During manual driving scenarios, varying secondary tasks and display positions could influence driver’s glance behavior. However, their impact on the driver’s capability to monitor the partially automated driving system has not yet been determined. The current study assessed both the effects of different secondary tasks (Surrogate Reference Task (SuRT) vs. text reading) and display positions (head-up display (HUD) vs. center console) on driver’s glance behavior during partially automated driving in a simulated car following task. Different automation system failures regarding the lateral and longitudinal control occurred while driving. Furthermore, participants’ reported advantages, disadvantages and preferences regarding the investigated display positions as well as regarding the secondary task engagement during partially automated driving in general. Mixed design ANOVAs revealed that the HUD yielded considerably longer eyes-on display time (total and mean glance durations) than the center console. Moreover, the text reading task resulted in longer total and mean glance durations than the SuRT. Similar to manual driving scenarios, the results showed a consistent effect of display position and secondary task on the driver’s glance behavior. Despite the longer eyes-on display time for the HUD, its proximity to the driving environment might enable a faster identification of and reaction to critical situations (e.g., due to system failures).

This research examined the effectiveness of Chinese-English bilingual guide signs on highways in China for drivers with different language backgrounds. The study involved three different groups of participants: Chinese (Group C), foreigners who passed the Chinese proficiency test HSK (Group FC), and foreigners without Chinese proficiency test (Group F). A driving simulator and an eye tracker were used to obtain eye movement and driving behaviour data for both monolingual and bilingual guide sign scenes. The results showed that, for Groups C and FC, their performance in the two scenes had little difference when the number of Chinese place (destination) names on the sign was 5 or less. However, the performance of Groups C and FC in the bilingual guide sign scene was worse than that in the Chinese guide sign scene when the number of place names exceeded 5. Moreover, the participants’ performance worsened as the number of place names increased for all different groups within the same scene. Thus, the threshold of the number of place names for bilingual guide signs on highways appears to be 5. Actually, the English place names on the bilingual guide signs did not have much practical effect on the drivers, since the letters of the place names were too small to be quickly seen and the translation was inaccurate.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving under the influence of psychostimulant drugs: Effects on cognitive functioning among truck drivers in Brazil,10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.018,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Introduction: Brazil has one of the highest traffic accident rates in the world. Cargo vehicles are the second most common type of vehicle involved in these accidents. Driving under the influence of drugs increases the risk of truck drivers being involved in road traffic injuries or fatalities. Psychostimulant drug use among truck drivers is of particular interest, as they use these drugs to maintain their occupational performance. Aim: The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence of psychostimulant drug use among truck drivers through toxicological analyses of urine and saliva samples and to evaluate its effects on the drivers’ performance on attention level and executive functioning tests. Methods: A nonprobabilistic sample of 684 truck drivers was recruited at truck stops along three highways in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Participants were requested to answer questions on personal information and work-related matters via a structured research instrument. Afterwards, they were asked to perform four cognitive tests and to complete other questionnaires on confounding variables. Strict exclusion criteria were enforced. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed in the Minitab 18.1 and R programs, version 3.5.3. Then, the variables from the cognitive performance tests were included as response variables in the generalized linear regression models, separately, correcting for the effects from confounding variables. Results: 504 drivers were excluded from the data analysis due to health conditions that prevented them from safely participating in a cognitive performance evaluation. Therefore, 180 drivers remained in the sample; among them, 44 participants were categorized as users, and 136 were categorized as nonusers. The drug users performed better than the nonusers in almost all the cognitive tests in the univariate analysis. However, after controlling for the effects of confounding variables, we observed that despite drug users being faster at performing some tests, they committed more errors and had lower precision rates than nonusers in other measures. Moreover, users dealt with tasks that involved alternate and divided attention more poorly than nonusers. Conclusion: Psychostimulant drug use may initially seem advantageous to truck drivers since it allows users to maintain their attention for longer periods of time; however, the onus related to that use is much larger and should therefore be avoided by truck drivers and policed by competent authorities.",1369-8478,Not found

Road anger has been demonstrated as an important precursor of unsafe behaviors and crash-related outcomes for drivers. However, little attention has been paid to road anger experienced by cyclists and less is known about how cyclists’ road anger would impact their road safety, especially in middle-income countries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Cycling Anger Scale (CAS) in a Chinese sample, and to explore the road anger experienced by Chinese cyclists as well as international differences regarding cycling anger. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between cycling anger and cyclists’ demographics, gender roles, cycling-related experience, risky riding as well as aggressive riding. The survey was operated with an online questionnaire. A total of 442 cyclists were included in the final sample. Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported the original four-factor solution of the 14-item CAS. The overall cycling anger and anger levels in different situations reported by Chinese cyclists significantly differed from those of German and Australian cyclists. Cyclists with a stronger masculine identity reported a higher level of cycling anger, and those who cycled for over 20 km per week were less likely to be provoked by interactions with cars, cyclists and pedestrians. Cyclists who had been involved in crashes over the past three months reported a higher level of anger towards car interaction. Besides, both risky riding and aggressive riding were significantly correlated with cycling anger, and the two types of behaviors were predicted by different aspects of cycling anger. This study again demonstrates that the CAS is a reliable and valuable tool to measure cyclists’ road anger, and the results can aid in designing evidence-based interventions for cycling anger in China.",1369-8478,Not found
"What and how to tell beforehand: The effect of user education on understanding, interaction and satisfaction with driving automation",10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.017,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The success of introducing automated driving systems to consumers will depend on an appropriate understanding and human-automation interaction with this technology. Educating users on driving automation technology bears the potential to attain these two requirements. In a driving simulator study, we investigated the effects of user education on mental models, human-automation interaction performance (i.e., time on task, error rate, experimenter rating) and satisfaction with a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for automated driving. N = 80 participants were randomly assigned to one of three different user education conditions or to a baseline. Subsequently, they completed several driver-initiated control transitions between manual, Level 2 (L2), and Level 3 (L3) automated driving. The results revealed that user education promoted an accurate evolution of mental models for driving automation. These, in turn, facilitated interaction performance in transitions from manual to both L2 and L3 automated driving. There was no comparable influence of prior education on performance in transitions between the automation levels. Due to the performance enhancing effects of user education, no further improvements of interaction performance were observed for educated users in comparison to uneducated users. There was no effect of user education on satisfaction. The current findings emphasize the necessity to provide information about automated vehicle HMIs to first-time users to support accurate understanding and behavior. Based on the current findings, we propose conceptual approaches to teach users and derive implications for user studies on automated vehicle HMIs.",1369-8478,Not found
"Understanding daily car use: Driving habits, motives, attitudes, and norms across trip purposes",10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.013,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This paper presents a classification of motives considered as relevant when selecting a mode of transport, and it examines the relative importance of driving habits, car attitudes, descriptive norms and motives for transport mode choices for commuting, shopping, leisure and child-related trips. A survey was sent by post to 3000 Swedish residents in metropolitan, semi-rural and rural areas (with a response rate of 34.6%). Through an ordinal factor analysis, three classes of motives were extracted: Perceived outcomes, Symbolic and Instrumental motives. Hierarchical proportional odds logistic regression and hierarchical linear regression models assess the relative importance of socio-demographic variables, motives, descriptive norms, car attitudes and driving habits for each kind of trip. These models indicate that the impact of socio-demographic and psychological variables varies across trip purposes. Commuting and child- related trips were primarily predicted by socio-demographic variables. Leisure and shopping trips were mostly predicted by driving habit. Driving habit was a common and strong predictor among all trip purposes. These results are evidence of the power of script-based trips to generate habitual travel behaviours across different trip purposes. Conclusions are made in the light of the usefulness of these results to practitioners and researchers who aim to foster sustainable transportation and to reduce private car use.",1369-8478,Not found

Our dependent variable is the desire to purchase any type of car as well as specific car types, such as small cars, sports cars or hybrid cars. We focus on Japanese aged 18 to 25 and obtain a valid sample of 1125 from Tokyo residents, Kyoto residents as well as people living in rural areas of Japan. As expected we find significant differences according to the city or rural living context. We control further for a number of attitudinal aspects that have been found significant in previous studies. We find that the perceived fun one gains from owning a car is an important factor and that more expensive and prestigious cars appear to be still desired. Our main focus and contribution is the inclusion of car’s “usefulness to avoid pollution” and “online lifestyle”. We find that those spending more time alone with online activities, have less desire to purchase cars. We discuss that there might be cyclic relationships which call for careful discussion on the implication of car ownership reduction in rural Explanatory variables areas. Furthermore, there is some weak evidence for an “environmental dilemma” where pollution in fact encourages more car usage in order to avoid this pollution.",1369-8478,Not found
Traffic safety competencies in Peruvian high school students,10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.009,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This study aims to comprehend traffic safety competencies in high school students from two specific regions of Peru, as well as to analyze the differences between both groups. For this purpose, a qualitative study was carried out which consisted of eight focus groups in high schools, three of them in the metropolitan area of Lima (Lima region) and five in the province of Rodríguez de Mendoza (the Amazonas region). The focus groups were constituted by 73 students enrolled in the last three years of high school, named 3rd, 4th and 5th grade of secondary education, whose ages ranged from 14 to 18 years. The collected data were analyzed employing elements of Grounded Theory and Axiomatic Set Theory. The main findings reveal that most participants have a general understanding of traffic rules and the proper use of the components of traffic safety. Thus, they understand the traffic rules as road signs that regulate the behavior of drivers and pedestrians. In addition, participants know the proper procedure to follow at traffic lights, pedestrian walkways and how to use seat belts. They also identify the driver’s tiredness/drowsiness, and the consumption of alcohol and drugs as potential factors that cause traffic accidents. No causes that are linked to pedestrian behavior were identified, and only participants from the Amazonas region mentioned speeding as a contributing factor. On the other hand, participants report that in practical situations they engage in risky behavior and fail to comply with transit rules. They justify this behavior by citing poor infrastructure, vehicle malfunctions, and the need get around quickly in order to get things done. Finally, the implications of the results are discussed and compared to the content and implementation of the Peruvian Road Safety Educational Program (PENSV, for its acronym in Spanish), providing recommendations that can aid evidence‐based policy making in Peru.",1369-8478,Not found

In this study, volunteer drivers operated five vehicles equipped with automated longitudinal and lateral control and completed surveys about their experience. A subset of drivers also documented uncomfortable experiences as they used the automation while driving. Driver agreement that the automation improved the overall driving experience was significantly higher for Vehicle A than the systems implemented in the other four vehicles. Drivers reported significantly higher trust in adaptive cruise control than in lane centering in every vehicle but Vehicle B. Increased agreement that the automation consistently detected lane lines; detected moving vehicles ahead; and made smooth, gentle steering inputs was associated with significant increases in agreement that the automation improved the overall driving experience. Situations where drivers reported feeling uncomfortable with the automation during their drive were dominated by instances where lane centering struggled with common roadway features such as hills and intersections.",1369-8478,Not found

Numerous reducing countermeasures have been previously tested; however, they often have undesirable side effects. The present study investigated the possible effect of seat vibrations on simulator sickness. Three configurations were tested: no vibrations, realistic ones and some that might affect the proprioception. Twenty-nine participants were exposed to the three configurations on a four-minute long automated driving in a simulator equipped with a vibration platform. Simulator sickness was estimated thanks to the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and to a postural instability measure. Results showed that vibrations help to reduce the sickness. Our findings demonstrate that some specific vibration configurations may have a positive impact on the sickness, thus confirming the usefulness of devices reproducing the road vibrations in addition to creating more immersion for the driver.",1369-8478,Not found

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Impulsive Driver Behavior Scale (IDBS, Bıçaksız & Özkan, 2016a) with a Chinese sample. Two hundred and ninety-nine drivers completed the Chinese version of the Impulsive Driver Behavior Scale, the Driver Behavior Questionnaire, the Big Five Inventory and some social-demographic and traffic violation items. A confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a four-factor solution with 20 items yielded a better fit to the data than other solutions. The reduced IDBS showed good reliability and a stable structure. Drivers’ functional impulsivity was positively correlated with positive driver behavior and some ordinary violations. Meanwhile, the other three dimensions of dysfunctional impulsivity showed negative correlations with positive driver behavior and positive associations with aberrant driving behavior and penalty points and fines. Impulsive driver behavior is also associated with agreeableness and conscientiousness. These results provide evidence supporting the IDBS as a reliable and valuable instrument for measuring driving impulsivity in the Chinese traffic environment.",1369-8478,Not found
The evolution of mental models in relation to initial information while driving automated,10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.003,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Objective Mental models guide drivers’ expectations about the functioning of a conditionally automated vehicle. We induced different mental models using preliminary system descriptions to explore mental models with an objective, online measurement during conditionally automated driving. Background Human-machine interaction, based mainly on mental models, has been examined mostly by employing subjective measurements. However, an objective measurement method could improve the comparability of studies and provide a broader understanding of mental models in automated driving, thus leading to road safety in times of mixed traffic. Methods and results In two experiments (total N = 148), we manipulated the participants’ mental models by providing correct and incorrect system descriptions. In Experiment 1, contrary to our expectations, the results showed faster reaction times in the condition with an incorrect mental model. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding and showed that this effect can be traced back to the very first experience of the mismatch between the mental model and actual system behavior. Conclusion Overall, our results showed an impact of the preliminary system description on mental models. Moreover, the importance of a complete and correct manipulation of materials in conditionally automated driving research is emphasized. Application Potential applications include the online assessment of mental models during automated driving (e.g. dead man’s switch).",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the relationships between pedestrian behaviours and traffic safety attitudes in six countries,10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.006,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The majority of cross-cultural research on traffic safety has investigated driver behaviour, yet in most low- and middle-income countries, where the weight of the road fatality burden is felt, motorisation rates are significantly lower than in higher-income countries. As such, this approach necessarily excludes large parts of the populations in those settings. In order to investigate the link between traffic safety attitudes and road user behaviours, this study used a self-report measure of pedestrian behaviour, applying it in six countries; Bangladesh, China, Kenya, Thailand, the UK, and Vietnam. Focus was on the relationships between a respondent’s attitude towards risky or rule violating on-road behaviours (of other road users, or more generally, not specific to pedestrians), and the extent to which they reported performing three types of risky pedestrian behaviours (i.e., intentional rule violations, errors in judgement or memory, and aggressive behaviours). Data from a sample of 3,423 individuals was subjected to a series of regression models, revealing significant links between attitudes and pedestrian behaviours in all countries, in all three behavioural factors, after controlling for age, gender, and exposure to the road environment. Differences were found between countries in the strength of these relationships, with weaker connections between attitudes and behaviours in Kenya, and stronger connections in China (with other countries in-between the two). Results are discussed in terms of the need to understand the relationships between social cognitive constructs in the specific country in which a road safety intervention is intended to be implemented.",1369-8478,Not found

Prediction of effort and eye movement measures from driving scene components,10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.001,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"For transitions of control in automated vehicles, driver monitoring systems (DMS) may need to discern task difficulty and driver preparedness. Such DMS require models that relate driving scene components, driver effort, and eye measurements. Across two sessions, 15 participants enacted receiving control within 60 randomly ordered dashcam videos (3-second duration) with variations in visible scene components: road curve angle, road surface area, road users, symbols, infrastructure, and vegetation/trees while their eyes were measured for pupil diameter, fixation duration, and saccade amplitude. The subjective measure of effort and the objective measure of saccade amplitude evidenced the highest correlations (r = 0.34 and r = 0.42, respectively) with the scene component of road curve angle. In person-specific regression analyses combining all visual scene components as predictors, average predictive correlations ranged between 0.49 and 0.58 for subjective effort and between 0.36 and 0.49 for saccade amplitude, depending on cross-validation techniques of generalization and repetition. In conclusion, the present regression equations establish quantifiable relations between visible driving scene components with both subjective effort and objective eye movement measures. In future DMS, such knowledge can help inform road-facing and driver-facing cameras to jointly establish the readiness of would-be drivers ahead of receiving control.",1369-8478,Not found
"The ability of young, middle-aged and older drivers to inhibit visual and auditory distraction in a driving simulator task",10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.007,68,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Driver distraction is one major cause of road traffic accidents. In order to avoid distraction-related accidents it is important to inhibit irrelevant stimuli and unnecessary responses to distractors and to focus on the driving task, especially when unpredictable critical events occur. Since inhibition is a cognitive function that develops until young adulthood and decreases with increasing age, young and older drivers should be more susceptible to distraction than middle-aged drivers. Using a driving simulation, the present study investigated effects of acoustic and visual distracting stimuli on responses to critical events (flashing up brake lights of a car ahead) in young, middle-aged, and older drivers. The task difficulty was varied in three conditions, in which distractors could either be ignored (perception-only), or required a simple response (detection) or a complex Go-/NoGo-response (discrimination). Response times and error rates to the critical event increased when a simultaneous reaction to the distractor was required. This distraction effect was most pronounced in the discrimination condition, in which the participants had to respond to some of the distracting stimuli and to inhibit responses to some other stimuli. Visual distractors had a stronger impact than acoustic ones. While middle-aged drivers managed distractor inhibition even in difficult tasks quite well (i.e., when responses to distracting stimuli had to be suppressed), response times of young and old drivers increased significantly, especially when distractor stimuli had to be ignored. The results demonstrate the high impact of distraction on driving performance in critical traffic situations and indicate a driving-related inhibition deficit in young and old drivers.",1369-8478,Not found

This research explored the effect of the emotional state on simulated driving behavior. Thirty-five licensed drivers participated in this study and completed a car-following task. The angry, happy and neutral states were manipulated during the task. The participants’ driving performance and risk perception were recorded under each emotional state. Trait anger and driving experience were also measured to explore the possible mediating effect. The results showed that the drivers in an angry or happy emotional state tended to maintain less time to collision and take a longer time to brake while following a lead vehicle than the drivers under the neutral condition, suggesting that drivers in emotional states are more dangerous those in neutral states. Moreover, the happy state rendered the drivers more dangerous, which manifested as a lower perceived accident risk than that among the drivers in the angry and neutral states. More specifically, experienced drivers in happy states performed worse with respect to vehicle lateral position control. Recommendations and implications for safety education and further research are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Attitudes of learner drivers toward safety at level crossings: Do they change after a 360° video-based educational intervention?,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.018,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In light of the growing number of level crossing accidents and the limited prevention programmes, this study examined relationships among attitudes toward traffic rules, impulsiveness, and behavioural intentions at level crossings. It explored the behavioural effects of an educational programme newly developed within the framework of the Croatian national safety project “Implementation of measures to improve the safety of the most vulnerable traffic participants at level crossings“. The programme aimed to change risky attitudes and behavioural intentions of learner drivers at level crossings. It consists of a safety lecture accompanied by pictures, videos and the exposition to a 3D virtual reality film shot at a real level crossing, which allows the participant to experience, from the driver’s perspective, safe and risky crossings. The programme was implemented in 11 driving schools. First, 285 participants (62.8% men) answered a questionnaire measuring safety attitudes toward traffic and impulsiveness, then they attended a lecture and participated in the virtual reality experience. Finally, they answered a questionnaire measuring planned future behaviour at level crossings. The results showed that attitudes toward level crossing risk significantly predicted intended driving behaviour at level crossings. Furthermore, the 360° video-based educational intervention altered the relationships connecting attitudes toward level crossings and risky driving behaviour at level crossings.

Evidence for the role of personality in the cognitive performance of older male drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.005,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Objectives This study aimed to examine whether in older male drivers the level of information processing under increasing cognitive workload varies with the level of personality traits. Method The study involved 60 male, active drivers aged between 65 and 81 (M = 71, SD = 4.4). During passive driving they performed central (a test in the n-back scheme, in three cognitive workload levels) and peripheral (memorizing objects characteristic for road traffic) tasks presented simultaneously in the central and peripheral visual fields. A wide-angle high-fidelity collimated visual system was used to display visual stimuli. In the central task, the reaction time and its correctness were measured, while the peripheral task measured the number of memorized objects. The EPQ-R questionnaire was used to assess personality traits, and the memory functions were assessed using the MMSE test. Results As the central task-induced cognitive workload increases, the performance of both central and peripheral tasks deteriorates. These tasks were performed less accurately by drivers with a higher level of psychoticism than those with a lower level of this trait. This dependency related to all levels of cognitive workload. In contrast, the drivers with a higher level of neuroticism showed a lower level of performance of the peripheral task than those with a low level of this trait. This dependency concerned only the central task with a medium cognitive workload. Conclusion The level of personality traits, especially the ones related to the emotional sphere, contributed to the decrease in the effectiveness of action (longer reaction time, increase in the number of errors, decrease in the number of memorized objects) in the conditions of increasing cognitive workload. A higher level of neuroticism and psychoticism can be conducive to making errors on the road. This applies especially to situations that pose high demands on the driver’s cognitive system.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating the effectiveness of a young driver-education intervention: Learn2Live,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.009,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Road traffic collisions are the leading cause of death among young adults, and behaviour change interventions play a key role in battling this public health concern. Road safety interventions are often educational and have traditionally relied on fear appeals to alter risky driving behaviour - yet there is a paucity of data regarding their effectiveness. Peer-education has been championed as an additional route to promoting safe driving behaviour. To examine these issues, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a fear appeal intervention in improving young drivers’ attitudes towards risky driving behaviour. A total sample of 800 high school and college students (16–20 years old) completed a similar set of questionnaires pre- and post-intervention and at a 3-month follow-up. Two different types of follow-up interventions were also compared: a peer-led and an expert-led road safety educational event. Measures evaluating attitudes towards risky driving behaviour were completed at all 3 time frames, and questions regarding the participants' perception of the follow-up event were asked. Overall, our data showed an improvement in attitudes towards risky driving behaviours both immediately after the intervention and three months later. These changes were especially evident among females. With regard to the follow-ups, both were effective in improving the attitudes towards risky driving.

Mechanisms behind hazard perception of warning signs: An EEG study,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.001,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Warning signs are the most effective way to alert people to hazards in the industries, architecture, and transportation. To better understand how these warning signs prompted hazard, this study investigated the intrinsic mechanism of hazard perception of warning signs, including warning words (low versus high hazard levels) and surrounding shapes (upright triangle versus circle). We recruited 18 participants and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG). We found that a combination of high-hazard-level words and an upright triangle shape significantly elicited more negative N300 and increased theta-band (3–8 Hz) synchronization, but reduced beta-band (15–30 Hz) desynchronization. The N300 component represented the emotional arousal strength, theta oscillations reflected the engagement of retrieval of emotional experiences from episodic memory, and beta oscillation connoted the semantic encoding. Thus, these findings suggested that a high-hazard-level combination had the ability to obtain high priority in cognitive processing. The EEG pattern changes allowed us to assess whether the hazard perception of warning signs was high or low, which could be an accurate indicator to better evaluate the design of warning signs.",1369-8478,Not found

We analysed, using a driving simulator, three important aspects of driving - use of the accelerator pedal, steering wheel and eye-steering coordination - to test for any differences, and then to integrate these findings to identify a unique pattern of changes in people driving with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy displayed differences in use of the accelerator pedal compared to healthy control drivers (p < 0.05) which could be a direct consequence of their sensorimotor impairment due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Drivers with DPN used the more extreme high and low positions of the pedal to a greater extent than the Control group who exhibited a more graded use of the accelerator pedal over the mid-range. Eye-steering coordination was also different in drivers with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05) and, as it improved during the second drive, becoming closer to healthy drivers’ values, the occasional loss of control experienced during driving reduced. These insights demonstrate that diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects multiple aspects of driving performance suggesting the need for an integrated approach to evaluate the potential for driving safely in this population.",1369-8478,Not found

Effective intervention requires a fundamental foundation of understanding the nature of the problem. Therefore the current study explored the self-reported risky driving behaviour of young drivers in Lithuania, a nation classified as a developed country as recently as 2015. Method The self-report Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (BYNDS, 1) was applied in a sample of 457 Lithuanian young drivers aged 18–24 years, after a rigorous forward-backward translation process. Results Seven factors (risky exposure, transient rule violations, driver misjudgements, driver mood, vehicle overcrowding, personal seatbelt use, substance consumption) explained 65.2% of the variance in self-reported risky driving behaviour as measured by the BYNDS-Li. The most common risky driving behaviours included driving in excess of posted speed limits, and driving at high risk times such as at night and on weekends. Discussion and implications The seven-factor structure of the BYNDS-Li supports arguments that culturally-valid measures should be operationalised in jurisdictions other than those in which they were developed (in the case of the BYNDS, Queensland, Australia). Moreover, systems thinking argues that interventions and efforts must be multi-sectoral and collaborative interventions. In the case of young driver road safety, these should be framed within the 4E’s of education, engineering, enforcement, and engagement.",1369-8478,Not found
Safety effects of parking maneuvers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.002,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Parking maneuvers, particularly a vehicle’s maneuver for entering and leaving a parking space, have varying rates of use and safety impacts. In this effort, crash data were collected for parking lots in the vicinity of a university campus and compared to observational parking position data. The campus was selected for this study because a change in the parking enforcement process was expected to (and did) change parking maneuver choices. When entering and leaving a parking space, three maneuver options exist for drivers: (1) forward, (2) reverse, and (3) pulling through an adjacent parking space. When specifically entering a parking space, the maneuver options become: (1) pull-in, (2) back-in, and (3) pull-through. When leaving the parking space, the maneuver options become: (1) pull-out, (2) back-out, and (3) pull-through. This study found that the pull-in/back-out vehicle maneuver’s percentage of total crashes was greater than the percentage of vehicles that were actually observed to use the same maneuver. The analysis from this study implies that the pull-in/back-out parking maneuver is more likely to result in a collision and therefore, is associated with a higher crash risk. Further analysis of North Carolina’s parking related fatal and serious injury crashes found that vehicles backing out of parking spaces was overwhelmingly the main cause for these serious injuries. 90% of North Carolina’s parking related fatal and serious injuries occurred during a back-out maneuver. Overall, this study concludes that the back-in/pull-out parking maneuver is safer than the pull-in/back-out maneuver and is the recommended approach to 90° parking.",1369-8478,Not found

By comparing GTWR model and standard geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and temporally weighted regression (TWR) model, the proposed GTWR model showed potential benefits in modeling both spatial and temporal non-stationarity simultaneously in terms of goodness-of-fit and F statistics. Results revealed that number of vehicles, number of pedestrian-related casualties, speed limit, vehicle movement and injury location have significant influence on pedestrian injury severity in different areas.

A normally sighted control group (n = 10), a peripheral visual field loss group (n = 9), and a low visual acuity group (n = 12) rode a fixed route (7.5 km) in the Netherlands on a regular bicycle and on a pedelec. Speed and lateral position were measured when participants cycled a (I) one-way cycle path, (II) two-way cycle path, (III) residential area, and (IV) shared space zone. With regard to both the regular bicycle and the pedelec, no significant speed or lateral position differences were found between the three groups. In conclusion, for some people with severe and permanent visual impairments, and under certain circumstances, regular bicycle and pedelec riding may be possible without noticeable speed reduction or adapted lane position to compensate for their functional impairment. The present findings may further optimise the cycling advice provided by mobility trainers of vision rehabilitation centres and the independent mobility of visually impaired people.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving mental workload and performance of ageing drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.019,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The World Health Organization stated that the global ageing population is increasing rapidly as well as the case of road accidents involving ageing drivers. This study presents the driving mental workload and performance model of ageing drivers in the context of real-time road driving. Twenty paid participants (ten males) with a mean age of 57.8 years old (SD = 2.7) and mean driving experience of 29.6 years (SD = 8.5) took part in driving experiments with three complexity levels of situation: simple situation (SS), moderately complex situation (MCS), and very complex situation (VCS). The subjective ratings using NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), physiological measure using electroencephalogram, number of traffic violations (NTVs), speed variability, and reaction time of peripheral detection task were measured. The driving experiments reveal the following: (1) The subjective workload ratings on mean physical demand score were the highest. (2) The electroencephalogram results show that situation complexity had significant effects on theta relative power and alpha relative power of two channel locations (3) The highest mean NTVs was in VCS. (4) The mean speed variability in the MCS was significantly lower than that of in the SS and VCS. (5) The maximum reaction time was recorded in VCS while the minimum reaction time was recorded in the MCS. The overall driving performance score regression models were developed based on the strong correlation and linear relationship between mental workload and driving performance elements. The models may benefit as a reference for designers, manufacturers, developers, and policymakers in designing better driving environment for ageing drivers by integrating safety and transportation, thus, optimizing and sustaining the driving performance of ageing drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ visual attention: A field study at intersections,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.012,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Crossing a road intersection, a driver must collect visual information from various locations. The allocation of visual attention, which allows this collection, mainly relies on top-down processes. This study focuses on three top-down factors which influence the collection of visual information: the value of visual information for the ongoing task, their bandwidth, and the familiarity with the environment. These factors are studied according to the priority rules at intersections (Give way, Stop or Priority), the expected traffic density (Lower or Higher) and the number of passages (First or Second passage). Fourteen participants were installed in an instrumented vehicle equipped with an eye-tracker. They drove during 1h45 along a 80-km long route, mainly on rural roads, which included 19 intersections. Visual attention was studied by means of the head and gaze horizontal eccentricity. Effects were found for each of the three factors, in agreement with Wickens’ theoretical framework and with previous studies, despite the important variability in the data due to the experimental situation.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessing the driving distraction effect of vehicle HMI displays using data mining techniques,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.016,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"With the rapid development of human–machine interface (HMI) systems in vehicles, driving distraction caused by HMI displays affects road safety. This study presents a data mining technique to model the four driving distraction indicators: speed deviation, lane departure standard deviation, dwell time, and mean glance time. Driving distraction data was collected on a real-car driving simulator. 3 secondary tasks in 13 mass produced cars were tested by 24 drivers. The random forest algorithm outperformed linear regression, extreme gradient boosting, and multi-layer perceptron as the best model, demonstrating good regression performance as well as good interpretability. The result of random forest showed that the importance of target speed is large for all driving distraction indicators. Among the variables of interaction and user interface design, less step and less on-screen distance of finger movement are efficient for lowering lane departure standard deviation and dwell time. The position of right point is another important variable, and should be between 37 and 47 degrees on a typical sample in this study. A larger angle leads to bigger lane departure, while a smaller angle leads to bigger mean glance time. Most variables of HMI display positioning themselves are not important. This study provides one driving distraction assessment method with a variable impact trend analysis for HMI secondary tasks in an early phase of product development.",1369-8478,Not found
Cross-cultural effects on detecting multiple sources of driving hazard: Evidence from the deceleration detection flicker test,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.013,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Collision rates in Malaysia are much higher than the UK; do these reflect poorer hazard perception skill or does exposure to hazardous events improve hazard detection ability? The deceleration detection flicker test (DDFT) was used to investigate the effect of experience and cross-cultural differences between Malaysian and UK drivers in their ability to detect the deceleration of a lead vehicle while simultaneously identifying any secondary hazards in side roads. Matched groups of participants with lower or higher levels of experience were recruited from the University of Nottingham in the UK and Malaysia. Malaysian drivers were significantly less accurate than UK drivers in detecting the deceleration of lead vehicles on urban roads, and significantly less accurate in detecting the presence of secondary hazards across all road types. Experienced drivers were significantly faster than novices in detecting decelerations of the lead vehicle, and were significantly more accurate in detecting the presence of secondary hazards. The study concludes that high exposure to hazardous events on the road in Malaysia does not yield expertise in this hazard perception task, although the DDFT does differentiate experience cross-culturally.",1369-8478,Not found
Creating a qualitative typology of electric vehicle driving: EV journey-making mapped in a chronological framework,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.009,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"‘Range anxiety’ is considered a barrier to market acceptance of electric vehicles (EVs), but perceptions of inadequate recharging infrastructure and limited battery range may be part of a more complex set of consumer concerns; experiences and practices of existing EV drivers – with reference to wider transport and energy systems – need to be understood in greater detail. Qualitative material from semi-structured interviews [n = 88] is used to formulate a chronological Typology of Electric Vehicle Driving which synthesises drivers’ decisions, actions and dynamic considerations before, during and after a journey. The typology outlines and tabulates spatio-temporal elements specific to driving an EV; describes adaptations and compromises in household routines and travel habits; draws out how or when drivers engage with external digital information sources – i.e. smartphone apps, social media – during journey-making; plots their intervention in behavioural changes; and could inform development of infrastructure, tools or services, policy or interventions to support EV uptake.",1369-8478,Not found
Beliefs underlying modal choice in school trips: A case study in Brazil,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.008,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Various factors can influence the choice of transportation mode such as the urban layout, land use and occupation patterns, and the services offer. In recent years, however, research studies have investigated the influence of psychological aspects on personal decision-making associated to modal choice, thereby contributing towards the elaboration of more sustainable public policies. This study investigates the beliefs that are subjacent to modal choices regarding school commute trips, based on the opinions of students attending a senior high school institution in Brasilia, Brazil. Using procedures suggested by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) a set of beliefs was obtained by means of a focus group activity and used to support the elaboration of a School Trips Modal Choice Scale (STMCS). The scale was subjected to Principal Components Analysis to verify the consistency of factors related to the beliefs and the direct measurements of the TPB constructs. Following that Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were elaborated using the Quasi-likelihood estimation method to investigate the correlation between the beliefs obtained and the said constructs. In addition to identifying the principal beliefs related to the modal choice, the results showed that different TPB constructs can be correlated with the same belief and so attributing specific beliefs to each construct based on an initial intuitive classification can actually be an impediment to understanding them. Those findings regarding the beliefs identified as subjacent to each construct are specific for the school community that was studied. However the question of some beliefs significantly affecting more than one construct is a more generalizable and corroborates what has previously been verified in other contexts where TPB has been applied.",1369-8478,Not found
How do drivers recall positive and negative driving events? A quantitative approach to analysing driving diaries,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.005,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Whilst diary studies are often analysed in a qualitative manner, quantitative methods which analyse the percentage of different types of language used in diary entries, now exist. From a driving perspective, this could arguably tell us more about the underlying psychological processes occurring when drivers reflect on their on-road experiences. As part of a larger project, the current study used a quantitative method of language analysis, known as word count analysis, to compare driver diaries in which positive and negative driving events were reflected upon. Results suggested that when describing positive events, drivers discuss them with more elaborate and descriptive language and focus on certainty and goal-driven processes. Negative events, however, had more of a social focus as indicated by an increased use of function words. These findings provide insights into the ways in which positive and negative driving events may be appraised. Additionally, drivers used more words indicating control and reward when describing positive driving events; this is discussed in consideration of how word count analyses can provide further insight into psychological process associated with emotion, such as appraisals.",1369-8478,Not found
The effects of secondary tasks that involve listening and speaking on young adult drivers with traits associated with autism spectrum disorders: A pilot study with driving simulation,10.1016/j.trf.2019.12.011,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"A driver’s license is key to independence for many young adults, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, individuals with ASDs may face special challenges when learning to drive. If effective driver training is to be devised for this demographic, it is important to determine the nature of these challenges. Driving inherently requires multitasking (e.g. steering, speed maintenance, navigation, hazard detection) and drivers are routinely obligated to combine driving with the demands of listening and responding to others, as occurs during driving lessons. Given that individuals who display traits associated with ASDs may have special difficulties with secondary tasks and especially those that involve socialization, we examined the effects of secondary tasks that involve listening and responding to questions while driving. We compared performance when simply driving (the control condition), driving while listening (the audiobook condition), and driving while listening and speaking (the prompt: answer condition). The autism spectrum quotient (AQ:Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001), a commonly used self-report questionnaire intended to measure traits associated with ASDs in research, was used to identify young drivers with more and fewer traits related to ASDs in a community sample, (None had a clinical diagnosis of ASD.) Consistent with studies of drivers clinically diagnosed with ASDs, we found that high AQ scorers reported greater mental and physical demand, effort, and frustration when driving, and showed more moment-to-moment variability in lane position and hazard reaction compared to low AQ scorers as measured in a driving simulator. Differences between the low and high scorers were typically largest when secondary tasks were imposed, but the predicted interaction between drive condition and AQ group only emerged in terms of steering variability.",1369-8478,Not found

To achieve this, smart navigation systems can be used to inform drivers of optimal charging times and locations. Yet, required flexibility may impart time penalties.

In a laboratory experiment with real-life time costs, we find that monetary and symbolic incentives are both effective in changing behavior towards ‘greener’ charging choices, while we find no significant statistical difference between them.",1369-8478,Not found
"Attitudes, risk perception and risk-taking behaviour among regular cyclists in Norway",10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.007,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The main aim of the study was to investigate whether attitudes toward traffic safety, risk perception, worry, risk tolerance, safety priority, and accident involvement are associated with cyclists’ risk-taking behaviour. Two types of cyclists’ risk-taking behaviour were studied: (1) ‘violation of traffic rules, and (2) ‘conflicts with other road users when cycling’. The study was based on a questionnaire survey carried out in 2017 among regular cyclists in Norway (n = 426). The results revealed that cyclists’ risk-taking behaviour was influenced by their attitudes, risk perception, and accident involvement. Pragmatic attitudes toward traffic rule violations and safety priority were found to be important predictors of the frequency of rule violations when cycling. Attitudes towards the enforcement of traffic rules for cyclists and dissatisfaction with the traffic rules for cyclists were found to be important predictors for the frequency of situations involving conflicts with other road users. Risk perception and accident involvement were found to be associated with conflicts with other road users, but not with rule violations when cycling. The findings show that risk perception and attitudes toward traffic safety are important for cyclists’ risk-taking behaviour in traffic. The road infrastructure and the traffic regulations are primarily planned for car drivers and pedestrians. If cyclists’ attitudes are to be changed, the cycling infrastructure and traffic rules for cyclists would need to be adjusted to cyclists as road users. When building new infrastructure and implementing new safety measures for cyclists, it is important to include attitude campaigns, as well as communications to the public about safety and the risks linked to cycling. Attitude campaigns could be used to strengthen the authorities’ communications that cyclists are prioritized as road users.",1369-8478,Not found
"Driving demands, stress reactivity and driving behavior: An interactional approach",10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.001,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of driving demands, neuroticism, and their interaction when predicting driving behavior. More precisely, we strived to examine how driving behaviors (i.e., speeding, winding, tailgating and jerky driving) unfold across low and high driving demands and whether they are contingent on a personality factor that has previously been linked to stress reactivity. In a driving simulator, 50 participants with a valid driver’s license (56.6% female, age: M = 30.13, SD = 10.16) were exposed to driving scenarios of different levels of information processing and vehicle handling demands. Additionally, they filled-out a self-report questionnaire that measured their neuroticism. We found that driving behavior became safer in scenarios that were highly demanding in terms of information processing, while this pattern did not emerge with vehicle handling demands. Moreover, tentative support was found for the notion that individuals high in neuroticism are less able to adapt their behavior to higher information processing demands. The present study offers new insights on driving demands in a simulated driving context and points to the potential importance of exploring interactions between personality and situational factors when understanding driving behavior. Additionally, the results of the present study may be used to adapt driver’s education programs.",1369-8478,Not found
Pedestrians’ road crossing behaviour in front of automated vehicles: Results from a pedestrian simulation experiment using agent-based modelling,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.014,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The objective of this research is to explore the relation between personal characteristics of pedestrians and their crossing behaviour in front of an automated vehicle (AV). For this purpose, a simulation experiment was developed using Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) techniques. Sixty participants were asked to cross the road in a virtual environment displayed on a computer screen, allowing to record their crossing behaviour when in the presence of AVs and conventional vehicles (CVs). In some experimental configurations, the AVs communicated their intention to continue or not to continue their trajectories through the use of lights. The ABM allowed controlling the behaviour of the vehicles when interacting with the simulated avatar of the respondents. The subjects of the experiment were also asked to fill in a questionnaire about usual behaviour in traffic, as well as attitudes and risk perceptions toward crossing roads. The questionnaire data were used to estimate individual specific behavioural latent variables by means of principal component analysis which resulted in three main factors named: violations, lapses, and trust in AVs. The results of generalized linear mixed models applied to the data showed that besides the distance from the approaching vehicle and existence of a zebra crossing, pedestrians’ crossing decisions are significantly affected by the participants’ age, familiarity with AVs, the communication between the AV and the pedestrian, and whether the approaching vehicle is an AV. Moreover, the introduction of the latent factors as explanatory variables into the regression models indicated that individual specific characteristics like willingness to take risks and violate traffic rules, and trust in AVs can have additional explanatory power in the crossing decisions.",1369-8478,Not found

Overall, the odds of receiving an infringement in the month prior to a crash were 35 per cent higher than receiving an infringement in the same month the year prior, for the case group, adjusted for the change over time in the control group (Odds Ratio = 1.35, 95% CI 1.17–1.57, p < 0.001). Rather than infringements preceding a period of reduced crash involvement, and thus potentially indicating a deterrent effect, the odds of receiving an infringement in the one-month period just prior to a crash occurring was greater.

In our study based on a large naturalistic data set, we investigated the driving style of 76 individuals driving in a motorway setting.

Effects of training and display content on Level 2 driving automation interface usability,10.1016/j.trf.2019.12.010,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Introduction Level 2 driving automation features, such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) combined with lane centering, primarily communicate their operating statuses through the instrument cluster. It remains unclear how interface-specific training and display content influence the ability to understand Level 2 activity in production vehicles. Methods Eighty participants viewed videos recorded from the driver’s point of view in a variety of driving scenarios with Level 2 activity displayed in the instrument cluster of a 2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Half viewed one of two instrument cluster layouts (simple or complex), and half received an orientation to the interface before the experiment. After each video, they were asked about the scenario they had just seen. We then examined what information in the displays participants used to identify Level 2 activity and the usability of the displays. Results Training improved recognition accuracy of when lane centering was temporarily inactive and understanding of why it was inactive. Neither training nor display content affected the ability to recognize when ACC had adjusted the vehicle’s speed or detected a vehicle ahead, or when ACC initially did not detect a lead vehicle and understanding of why it had not detected it. Both factors influenced which sources of information participants used to determine Level 2 activity. Recognition accuracy of system activity improved when participants used valid sources of information. Training, but not display content, improved lane centering usability, but not ACC usability. Discussion Basic training improves detection of notifications that potentially require further driver action, but not of those that display persistent status information. Training does not result in full understanding of all system notifications or functional limitations, which reinforces the need for intuitive, salient communication about system behavior and its limitations.",1369-8478,Not found
A qualitative exploration of apprehended women's experience of drink driving events,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.011,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Background In Australia, drink driving remains a serious road safety issue. The few studies that have addressed drink driving behaviour amongst women often focus on aggregated statistical comparisons to men or view the concept of drink driving as part of broader criminological behaviour. In contrast, scant research has directly focused on convicted female drink drivers. The aim of this study was to explore the factors that contribute to drink driving in a cohort of women convicted for drink driving and examine why these women were unsuccessful in mitigating the risk of engaging in drink driving behaviour. Method The study thematically analysed the narratives of 14 women who had been apprehended and subsequently convicted of a drink driving offence in the state of Queensland (Australia). All participants were recruited by way of their attendance at a drink driving education program. Results Overall examination of participants’ narratives revealed drink driving behaviour derived from a complex set of processes including taking a risk, using alcohol to self-medicate and alleviate psychological distress, basing the decision to drive on subjective assessment, and past engagement in drink driving behaviour and punishment avoidance. Underpinning these themes was the participants lack of awareness about the increasing risks associated with their alcohol consumption levels, with cognisance only being achieved after apprehension. Conclusion These findings add to the limited research addressing drink driving behaviour among women and highlight important factors to explain why women are increasingly engaging in this risky behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Analysis of the factors influencing overtaking in two-lane highways: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.006,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Background Human factors are among the leading causes of frontal collision accidents. Therefore, understanding the factors that affect driver behaviour during overtaking is essential. Objective This research proposed a methodology to observe passing manoeuvres on two-lane highways in a driving simulator and to investigate the effects of the speed of an impeding vehicle, the type of the vehicle to be overtaken and the passing sight distance on the following gap distance as an indicator of driver behaviour. Method The repeated measures experiment allowed for 640 possible overtakings with a sample of 80 participants. The speed of the impeding vehicle, the type of the impeding vehicle and the passing sight distance were used as within-subject factors with eight treatments. The driver’s age, gender, and experience were considered the between-subject factors. Results When the speed of the impeding vehicle was 60 km/h, the participants adopted a following gap in passing sight distance of 446 m (M = 81.32 m), which was larger than the following gap in passing sight distance of 560 m (M = 70.84 m). Conclusion Among the factors that were considered, the effect of the speed of an impeding vehicle on the following gap at the beginning of overtaking was higher than the effect of the type of the impeding vehicle or the passing sight distance. Together, these combination values can describe the driver behaviour and help to improve the standards-based design values to increase safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Willingness of people who are blind to accept autonomous vehicles: An empirical investigation,10.1016/j.trf.2019.12.012,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Attitudes of a sample of 211 UK people who are blind concerning autonomous vehicles (AVs), and the determinants of the willingness of people who are blind to travel in AVs, were examined. Participants answered an open-ended question regarding their attitudes towards level 5 AVs and the results were analysed using a semi-automated structural topic modelling procedure. (Level 5 AVs are fully autonomous anywhere, and do not require controlled areas in which to operate.) Four “topics” emerged from the exercise: (i) “hope” for future independence and freedom to travel offered by AVs to people who are blind, (ii) scepticism that AVs will ever be configured to meet the needs of people who are blind, (iii) concerns over safety, and (iv) the affordability of AVs. The four topics were employed as mediating variables in a structural equation model designed to explain the respondents’ willingness to travel in an AV. A number of covariates were presumed to influence the four mediating topics, including a participant’s desire for independence, comorbidity, locus of control, and level of generalised anxiety. Three of the mediating variables exerted significant influences on willingness to travel in an AV, i.e., hope for future independence, misgivings about safety, and affordability. Scepticism about AVs did not have a significant effect. Several implications for AV design and for the creation of public information messages promoting AVs are suggested. In particular, public information campaigns should emphasise the freedom to travel that AVs will provide for people who are blind; reassurances concerning safety; and the inevitability of AVs appearing on the roads of economically developed countries.",1369-8478,Not found
Patterns in perceived crash risk among male and female drivers with and without substantial cycling experience,10.1016/j.trf.2019.12.013,69,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Perceived risk of crashes is generally higher in female than in male cyclists. No study has assessed whether these gender differences only apply to riding bicycles. Using an online risk assessment task and survey, this study (a) tested the hypothesis that compared to men, women perceive higher risks, irrespective of traffic mode and (b) explored gender differences in the predictors of perceived risk. Data were analysed from 595 driver licence holders in Australia: 444 who cycled regularly, termed ‘cyclists’ from here on (31% women) and 151 regular drivers who did not (63% women), who are referred to as ‘drivers’. Cyclists in their role as cyclists and drivers in their role as drivers (traffic role) were instructed to imagine being in a specified traffic scenario and to assess crash likelihood. Each of 6 traffic scenarios was presented twice but differing in configuration: a violating car and a violating bicycle. A mixed ANOVA, with rated probability of a crash as the dependent variable, gender and traffic role as grouping factors, and configuration as the repeated measure, resulted in a main effect of configuration, showing that both drivers and cyclists perceived higher levels of risk of violating cars than of violating bicycles (ηp2 = 0.34). The interaction of traffic role and configuration showed this difference to be smaller for drivers than for cyclists (ηp2 = 0.18). This suggests that drivers are aware of the car’s high injury potential in crashes with cyclists. The main effect of gender showed that irrespective of traffic role, women perceived higher risk than men, which supported the hypothesis that gender differences are not limited to cycling (ηp2 = 0.03). The main effect of traffic role was not significant. For the predictors of perceived risk, ANOVA showed main effects for traffic role and gender, with small effect sizes (from ηp2 = 0.02 to ηp2 = 0.03). Cyclists were more confident, less inattentive and more in favour of stricter laws. Women felt less skilled and were more concerned about risks. None of the interactions between gender and traffic role were significant, which lent further support to the hypothesis that gender differences were a general rather than a cycling specific characteristic. Thus, perceived risk does not differ between women who regularly cycle and those who do not. These findings may inform interventions about the role of perceived risk in the uptake of cycling.",1369-8478,Not found
Should we pass on minimum passing distance laws for cyclists? Comparing a tactical enforcement option and minimum passing distance laws using signal detection theory,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.011,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Legislation mandating minimum distances for motorists passing cyclists is seen by advocates as a straightforward way to increase the perceived safety of cycling and thus remove a prominent barrier to the uptake of cycling. The evidence, however, is not as clear. The alternative to compliance-based enforcement via Minimum Passing Distance Laws (MPDLs) is performance-based enforcement as recently highlighted by UK Police forces under the name ‘Operation Close Pass’. This existing legislation and enforcement method relies on police officer judgement and discretion. For a MPDL to be introduced it has to show an improvement by identifying more manoeuvres that make cyclists feel unsafe, whilst at the same time not penalising drivers for manoeuvres that are benign. This study uses Signal Detection Theory to show that on almost every measure the current performance-based enforcement is preferable. Officer discretion is aligned more closely to cyclists’ real-world perceptions of risk than an objective, compliance-based MPDL. Any level of enforcement harshness can be achieved equally well, if not better, through officer discretion than through a fixed passing distance law, with the former being significantly easier to adjust if needed. Further discussion about the unintended effects of passing distance laws is discussed, such as the risk of a net loss to the effectiveness of cyclist safety because it is more difficult to prosecute and enforce manoeuvres which make cyclists feel unsafe than the performance-based alternative.",1369-8478,Not found

Also, limited information exists about how public transit agencies comprehend and perceive autonomous vehicle transportation (AVT) services. This study discusses mobility issues for people with disabilities and explores the potential of AVT to serve that population, particularly those with visual impairments or physical disabilities.

Each session was audio-recorded and analyzed using conventional content analysis. This study identified people with disabilities’ mobility issues related to: (1) current transit services (including fixed-route and paratransit services) and (2) the quality of neighborhood built environments. Both people with disabilities and transit experts expected that AVT could mitigate current mobility issues, especially in improved built environments. However, participants with disabilities also expressed concerns and anxieties regarding AVT. Transit experts agreed that more targeted strategies would be needed to overcome possible barriers to AVT for people with disabilities.

Using a mobile phone while driving was found to be the most common risky driving behaviour (52%) among app-based motorcycle taxi drivers, followed by neglecting to use turn signals (31%), encroaching car lanes (25%), exceeding the speed limit (21%), running red lights (19%) and carrying more than one passenger (17%). In addition, drivers who were students, or those who worked more than 50 h per week, were found to be more likely to engage in risky driving behaviours. Binary logistic regression modelling showed that neglecting to use turn signals, carrying more than one passenger and smoking while driving was significantly associated with self-reported active crash/fall involvement. Turn signal neglect was also associated with active injury crash/fall involvement. The incidence of risky driving behaviours and associated crash involvement was found to be lower among app-based motorcycle taxi drivers compared with regular motorcyclists, yet the findings still highlight the need for ride-hailing firms to deliver improved education and road safety training for their drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Situational influencing factors on understanding cooperative actions in automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.006,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Cooperative interacting vehicles are a promising approach in the context of automated driving. To ensure understanding and acceptance of such systems, the underlying mechanisms of human cooperation in the context of traffic must be understood. In a driving simulator study, we investigated how situational factors influence cooperative behaviour in a lane change situation on a two-lane German highway during automated driving in the left lane. When another car in the right lane was approaching a slower truck, participants (N = 32) were asked by an automated system to either accelerate, decelerate or maintain speed. The driver’s scope of action, the situation’s criticality for the lane-changing vehicle and the display of intention to change lanes were manipulated. A hierarchical multinomial logistic regression revealed that a wider scope of action, a higher situation’s criticality and signalling the intention to change lanes positively influenced cooperative behaviour by accelerating and decelerating. These results might be applied to design user-centred automated cooperatively interacting vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Characterising mobile phone calls while driving on limited-access roads based on SHRP 2 naturalistic driving data,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.002,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Research has found that mobile phone call engagement while driving negatively affects driving performance. However, no studies exist characterising hand-held mobile phone calls while driving under naturalistic conditions that include aspects such as the duration of mobile phone subtasks and glance behaviour. Identifying the particularly distracting phases of hand-held telephoning and the nature of influencing factors are the basis for developing design recommendations (e.g. for an in-vehicle information system). Potential influencing factors on driving performance such as call type, mobile phone storage location, or any self-regulatory behaviour need to be taken into account. The present study aimed to draw a comprehensive picture of making hand-held mobile phone calls while driving on limited-access roads using SHRP 2 naturalistic driving data. Mobile phone phase duration, glance behaviour, call type, and mobile phone storage location were coded manually across 98 events. The results show that the handling phase of a mobile phone call (e.g. searching for contacts, dialling) was the most dangerous due to longer mean off- than on-road glances. Outgoing calls caused longer mean off-road glances than incoming; nevertheless, the 2 s critical threshold was not exceeded. A significant influence of mobile phone storage location on glance behaviour did not exist. Moreover, at least in free-flow driving conditions, drivers had enough spare capacity to conduct a mobile phone call without reducing vehicle speed. The results suggest that in low complexity traffic situations drivers can compensate for the increased driving task demand due to telephoning by making minor changes in glance behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of leftward bias on visual attention for driving tasks,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.016,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The leftward bias of driving visual attention has been found to explain the role of driving experience in the visual attention strategy; even though the results reported in the literature are not always consistent. This study aims to explore the driving attention characteristics and the eye movement patterns by using a simulated driving experiment in conjunction with an eye-tracker device. 31 young inexperienced drivers (undergraduate students, average age 21) and 30 old experienced drivers (taxi drivers, average age 36) took part in the experiment. Results show that the eye movement patterns of the drivers have certain similarity in the occurrence of subtle asymmetries of visual attention favouring left space (the direction of the driving in the experiment was right-side) and that they are related to the right hemisphere specialization for spatial attention. However, in the more experienced drivers the leftward eye movement tends to shift toward the centre or even rightward to pay attention to the hazard events on road. These results suggest that inexperienced drivers are initially aroused by natural biological leftward visual attention and likely to develop central and rightward eye movement strategy for safety diving purpose. The implications of this study suggest that, despite the existence of natural visual attention bias, the left asymmetries in visual scan in inexperienced drivers still can be modified by driving trainings that focus on the hazard situation on road.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving environments that influence on-road outcomes in persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.003,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Introduction Drivers with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) who demonstrate adjustment to stimuli and gap acceptance errors may be prone to fail a standardized on-road assessment. However, the complexity (e.g., traffic speed, volume of road users, flow of traffic, spaced interchanges) of driving environments, and their relationship to driving errors critical for failing, is not fully understood. This prospective research study determines the predictive validity of the total number of adjustment to stimuli and gap acceptance errors (modelled as one variable) in residential, suburban, city, or highway environments on drivers with MS failing (vs. passing) a standardized on-road assessment. Methods Community-dwelling participants with MS (N = 35) completed a comprehensive driving evaluation consisting of clinical and on-road assessments, adhering to the regulations for assessing fitness to drive in Ontario, Canada. Results Logistic regression models indicated that, as sole predictors, the total number of adjustment to stimuli and gap acceptance errors made in suburban (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = [0.23, 0.83], p = .012) and city environments (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.13, 0.89], p = .028) significantly increased the odds of participants failing the on-road assessment. Also, the total number of adjustment to stimuli and gap acceptance errors made in suburban (AUC = 0.84, SE = 0.11, p = .006, 95% CI = [0.63, 1.00]) and city environments (AUC = 0.74, SE = 0.12, p = .05, 95% CI = [0.51, 0.98]) predicted on-road outcomes. A cut-point of 4 or more adjustment to stimuli and gap acceptance errors made in suburban environments optimally predicted on-road outcomes with 71.4% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, and 4 misclassifications; while a cut-point of 2 or more adjustment to stimuli and gap acceptance errors made in city environments optimally predicted on-road outcomes with 57.1% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, and 5 misclassifications. Conclusion The total number of adjustment to stimuli and gap acceptance errors made in suburban and city environments predict drivers with MS failing a standardized on-road assessment. Assessing adjustment to stimuli and gap acceptance errors in these environments are critical for informing fitness to drive decisions.",1369-8478,Not found
After you?! – Use of external human-machine interfaces in road bottleneck scenarios,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.004,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"In the near future, automated vehicles (AVs) will enter the urban transport system. This fact will lead to mixed traffic consisting of AVs, human car drivers and vulnerable road users. Since the AV’s passenger no longer has to monitor the driving scene, conventional communication does not exist anymore, which is essential for traffic efficiency and safety. In research, there are plenty of studies focusing on how AVs could communicate with pedestrians. One approach is to use external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on the AV’s surface. In contrast to the studies dealing with AV-pedestrian communication, this paper focuses on communication strategies of AVs with drivers of regular vehicles in different road bottleneck scenarios. The eHMI development and design is building on previously defined requirements and on fundamentals of human visual perception. After designing several eHMI drafts, we conducted a user survey with 29 participants resulting in the final eHMI concept. The evaluation of the evolved eHMI was conducted in a driving simulator experiment with 43 participants investigating the AV-human driver interaction at road bottlenecks. The participants were assigned either to the experimental group being faced with the eHMI or to the baseline group without explicit communication. The results show significantly shorter passing times and fewer crashes among the human drivers in the group with the eHMI. Additionally, the paper researches the aftereffects of an automation failure, where the AV first yields the right of way and then changes its strategy and insisted on priority. Experiencing the automation failure is reflected in increased passing times, reduced acceptance ratings and a lower perceived usefulness. In conclusion, especially in unregulated bottleneck scenarios flawless communication via eHMIs increases traffic efficiency and safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver glance behavior towards displayed images on in-vehicle information systems under real driving conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2020.01.017,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Intelligent vehicle technologies like driver assistance systems and in-vehicle information systems, enhance convenience of the driving experience for drivers and passengers. At the same time, these systems may increase driver distraction and workload. Guidelines developed for this purpose include principles, methods, and assessments which are widely agreed upon, with some being singled out for a particular recommendation or requirement. Especially the display of graphical or photographic images are generally assumed to distract the driver from safely operating the vehicle and should be blocked during driving under all circumstances (so called per se lock outs). This study investigates the effect of displaying graphical and photographical images during driving on driveŕs glance behavior during real-world driving. Findings presented in this paper provide empirical evidence for the unobtrusiveness of these stimuli: Participants didn’t exhibit longer glance durations towards in-vehicle information systems, nor a deterioration of driver distraction parameters such as total eyes off road time and long glance proportion when being compared to driving without displaying any photographic images.",1369-8478,Not found
Cyclist strategies and behaviour at intersections. Conscious and un-conscious strategies regarding positioning,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.013,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Severe and even fatal accidents between cyclists and motor vehicles commonly occur at intersections. Many of these accidents occur with right-turning vehicles, with drivers not observing an adjacent cyclist. Few structured investigations exist regarding the interaction between cyclist and motor vehicle, and factors in need of study are how infrastructure and vehicle properties affect human decision-making and cycling behaviour. Therefore, a bicycle simulator study was performed, where vehicle type, presence of lane markings and lane width were systematically varied in a scenario with a cyclist approaching a vehicle from behind, at a signalized city intersection. 33 participants cycled through 8 intersection variants each. Data on cycling trajectories, stopping points and speed was coupled with survey data from the participants, and semantically categorized verbal responses to questions regarding strategy for choice of stopping point. Results show that all three factors (vehicle type, lane markings and available vehicle-adjacent space) significantly affects cyclists’ behaviour and conscious strategies. Participants were more cautious in the presence of a truck than a car, reflected in choice of position when cycling and stopping, and in explicit verbalisations regarding perilous aspects of the situation and their conscious and strategic choice of positioning. Available lateral space also affected stop positions and feeling of safety (expressed verbally). Presence of bicycle lane markings made the cyclists inclined to continue into the space to the right of the vehicle. This was revealed by their positioning and speed, and also apparent in the verbal expressions, especially the positive remarks on the situation and conditions. However, the perceived comfort with lane markings present was actually lower than when they were missing. Cyclist type (slow, moderate, or fast) matters with the self-reported faster cyclists being more prone to stop to the right than the slower one.",1369-8478,Not found
"Three consecutive nights of sleep loss: Effects of morning caffeine consumption on subjective sleepiness/alertness, reaction time and simulated driving performance",10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.017,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Caffeinated products are often consumed as a popular countermeasure to the effects of sleep loss. However, the efficacy of caffeine to exert these effects after consecutive nights of sleep loss is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three consecutive nights of restricted sleep and morning caffeine consumption on subjective ratings of sleepiness/alertness, reaction time, and simulated driving performance. Twenty healthy, habitual caffeine consumers (11 females; age: 23.3 ± 5.7 y; BMI: 22.3 ± 3.5 kg⋅m−2; caffeine intake: 204 ± 89 mg⋅day−1; Mean ± SD) who had normal sleeping patterns (≥8 h⋅night−1) participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study. Following one night of normal sleep (≥8 h time in bed (TIB)), participants underwent three consecutive nights of restricted sleep (5 h TIB). Participants received caffeine (200 mg; n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) capsules each morning and all participants received caffeine (100 mg) capsules each afternoon. Subjective ratings of alertness, concentration and tiredness were measured before and 1 h after morning capsule administration. Choice Reaction Time (CRT) was examined 1 h after morning capsule administration, with response speed and accuracy as outcome variables. Driving performance was assessed using a 30 min simulated driving task, with lateral (standard deviation of lane position [SDLP]; total number of line crossings [LC]) and longitudinal (standard deviation of speed [SDSP]) measures of vehicle control as outcome variables. Alertness and concentration significantly decreased, and tiredness increased across the three days of sleep loss. Caffeine only marginally alleviated these effects. No differences were observed between treatments or across trial days for response speed and accuracy on the CRT task. Likewise, no significant differences were observed between groups or across trial days for any measures of simulated driving performance. Overall, results from this study indicate that three consecutive days of sleep loss influence subjective ratings of alertness, concentration and tiredness, but does not alter CRT or simulated driving performance. Caffeine may alleviate some of the negative subjective effects imposed by restricted sleep, but the efficacy of caffeine to attenuate performance changes in CRT and driving performance were unable to be observed.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of different non-driving-related-task display modes on drivers’ eye-movement patterns during take-over in an automated vehicle,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.001,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Highly automated vehicles relieve drivers from driving tasks, allowing them to engage in non-driving-related-tasks (NDRTs). However, drivers are required to take over control in certain circumstances due to the limitations of highly automated vehicles. This study focused on drivers’ eye-movement patterns during take-overs when an NDRT (watching videos) was presented via a head-up-display (HUD) and a mobile device display (MDD), compared to no NDRT as the baseline. The experiment was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator with real-world driving videos scenarios. Forty-six participants took part in the experiment by completing three drives in three counterbalanced conditions (HUD, MDD and baseline). A take-over-request was issued towards the end of automated driving requesting drivers to stop the NDRT and take over control. Eye-movement data including pupil diameter, blinks, glance duration and number of AOI (Area of Interest) were collected and analysed. The results show that during automated driving, drivers were more engaged in the MDD NDRT with smaller pupil diameter and shorter glance duration on the front scenario compared to the HUD and baseline modes. The number of AOI was reduced during automated driving in both MDD and HUD modes. The take-over-request redirected drivers’ visual attention back to the driving task from NDRT by increasing drivers’ pupil diameter, glance duration and number of AOI. However, the effect of MDD NDRT on pupil diameter and glance duration continued even after the take-over-request when the NDRT was terminated. The study demonstrated HUD is a better display to help maintain drivers’ attention on the road.",1369-8478,Not found
User acceptance of automated public transport: Valence of an autonomous minibus experience,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.008,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Autonomous driving is receiving increasing attention in the automotive industry as well as in public transport. However, it is still unclear whether users are willing to use automated public transportation at all. In order to answer this and other questions, the transport company of the city of Mainz, Germany, tested the autonomous minibus EMMA (Elektro-Mobilität Mainz Autonom) on a 600-meter-long test track in public space. The study presented here was conducted with the aim of exploring crucial determinants for the use of an autonomous minibus. On the basis of established acceptance models, a questionnaire was developed, which was completed in a field survey by a total of 942 participants before or after their journey with the minibus. Autonomous vehicles in public transport in general and the minibus in particular were evaluated positively by the majority of respondents. Above all, participants judged safety and environmental friendliness of the minibus as important. Participants who completed the questionnaire after their first trip with EMMA provided higher ratings of acceptance than those who had not travelled on the bus. Performance expectancy was the most important predictor for both acceptance of automated public transport in general and acceptance of the minibus EMMA. However, the experienced valence of the ride, in terms of how pleasant or unpleasant passengers experienced the first trip with the minibus, also affected acceptance of the minibus. This suggests a role of valence on intention-to-use, which has hardly been considered in previous theories and studies.",1369-8478,Not found
Tactile detection response task: Metrics for assessing drivers’ cognitive workload,10.1016/j.trf.2019.12.003,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The Tactile Detection Response Task (TDRT) has been used to assess the cognitive workload of driver distraction with response time and miss rate as metrics of cognitive workload. However, it is not clear which metric is more sensitive and whether sensitivity is maintained for visual tasks. The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity of the TDRT to changes in cognitive workload and to examine whether the sensitivity depends on task modality. A driving simulator study was conducted with 24 participants. The study included restaurant selection tasks with three presentation modalities (auditory, visual, and hybrid) and two difficulty levels (low and high). The high difficulty level was designed to be more cognitively demanding than the low difficulty level. Mixed-effects models were applied to examine the TDRT metrics and task difficulty level. The model controlled for age group, gender, and included a random effect for participants. The high difficulty level of the auditory tasks significantly increased the likelihood of missing a TDRT stimulus. No statistically significant differences were observed for visual and hybrid tasks. TDRT response time was not significantly associated with the difficulty level, regardless of task modality. In this study, the binary outcome TDRT miss was thus considered a more sensitive metric of cognitive workload than TDRT response time. TDRT response time can still be used to measure cognitive workload when tasks are relatively easy and the TDRT miss rate is close to zero. In addition, the sensitivity of the TDRT miss diminished for tasks that involved a visual component. Researchers who use TDRT to measure the cognitive workload associated with visual tasks should be aware of this limitation.",1369-8478,Not found
Surrogate safety indicator for unsignalised pedestrian crossings,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.011,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Problem Although the road safety situation in Poland is generally improving, the number of accidents at pedestrian crossings has not decreased in the last four years. This paper presents the results of the MOBIS research project, the aim of which was to develop surrogate safety indicators, based on detection of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts using video analysis. Method Pedestrian and vehicle traffic was filmed at two unsignalised pedestrian zebra crossings in Warsaw and Wrocław for over 40 days. Motion trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians were determined based on video processing. Several variables describing pedestrian-vehicle interactions were calculated, such as speed, post-encroachment time, distance between the participants, decelerations, etc. Classification of encounters was based on interactions of pedestrians and vehicles i.e. drivers yielding to pedestrians, vehicles passing just in front of, or behind pedestrians. Results and discussion Criteria for identification of dangerous encounters were selected with the assumption that it should be possible to automate the assessment process. The selected variables were: pedestrian-vehicle passing distance and the vehicle speed at that moment. Other criteria were used in cases of abrupt braking – deceleration exceeding 4 m/s2 and vehicle speed. A Dangerous Encounter Index is proposed as a surrogate safety indicator for pedestrian crossings. It relates the occurrence of dangerous events to exposure, defined as the number of pedestrian-vehicle encounters. Practical applications The proposed index shows that crossing two lanes involves more risk than crossing one lane, given similar traffic flow. Some improvement of safety at both types of crossing was observed after active signage involving blinking lights had been introduced. The proposed method is a step towards automation of safety assessment.",1369-8478,Not found
A driving simulator study to assess driver performance during a car-following maneuver after switching from automated control to manual control,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.014,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"A review of the literature on autonomous vehicles has shown that they offer several benefits, such as reducing traffic congestion and emissions, and improving transport accessibility. Until the highest level of automation is achieved, humans will remain an important integral of the driving cycle, which necessitates to fully understand their role in automated driving. A difficult research topic involves an understanding of whether a period of automated driving is likely to reduce driver fatigue rather than increase the risk of distraction, particularly when drivers are involved in a secondary task while driving. The main aim of this research comprises assessing the effects of an automation period on drivers, in terms of driving performance and safety implications. A specific focus is set on the car-following maneuver. A driving simulator experiment has been designed for this purpose. In particular, each participant was requested to submit to a virtual scenario twice, with level-three driving automation: one drive consisting of Full Manual Control Mode (FM); the other comprising an Automated Control Mode (AM) activated in the midst of the scenario. During the automation mode, the drivers were asked to watch a movie on a tablet inside the vehicle. When the drivers had to take control of the vehicle, two car-following maneuvers were planned, by simulating a slow-moving vehicle in the right lane in the meanwhile a platoon of vehicles in the overtaking lane discouraged the passing maneuver. Various driving performances (speeds, accelerations, etc.) and surrogate safety measures (PET and TTC) were collected and analysed, focusing on car-following maneuvers. The overall results indicated a more dangerous behavior of drivers who were previously subjected to driving automation; the percentage of drivers who did not apply the brakes and headed into the overtaking lane despite the presence of a platoon of fast-moving vehicles with unsafe gaps between them was higher in AM drive than in FM drive. Conversely, for drivers who preferred to brake, it was noted that those who had already experienced automated driving, adopted a more careful behavior during the braking maneuver to avoid a collision. Finally, with regard to drivers who had decided to overtake the braking vehicle, it should be noted that drivers who had already experienced automated driving did not change their behavior whilst overtaking the stopped lead vehicle.",1369-8478,Not found
From trait anger to aggressive violations in road traffic,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.006,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Drivers' beliefs and attitudes are known to be precursors of driving behavior, mediating the relationship between it and personality traits. However, the mediation effect of these beliefs on the relationship between trait anger and aggressive driving is not fully understood. The present study examined how the variance in the total numbers of violations, ordinary violations, and aggressive violations was explained by anger and behavioral, normative and control beliefs, and how much of this variation was explained by a linear combination of anger and any of these beliefs. A sample of 224 participants completed a series of instruments tapping into trait anger, attitude, subjective norms, descriptive norms, perceived behavioral control, intention, total number of violations, aggressive violations, and ordinary violations. The results showed that trait anger controlled approximately 9% of the variation in the total number of violations and aggressive violations and 6.5% of ordinary violations, while behavioral beliefs (through attitude) added a further 9.2–11.6%. The intention, which prior research linked to the manifestation of the behavior, explained a further 21.6% in aggressive violations in our study. Attitude mediated the relationship between trait anger and behavioral outcomes, the linear combination of trait anger and attitude accounting for 40.7% in intention, 17.6% in aggressive violations, 22.5% in the total number of violations and 25% in ordinary violations. The role of behavioral beliefs was greater when the level of aggressive violation decreased. Aggressive violations are less intentional than other behaviors that lead to violations, making it very important to consider both attitude toward behavior and trait anger to reduce them.

However, medium-term modifications in activity patterns (such as increasing trip frequencies and changing destinations) have been less explored. Using 2017–2018 survey data collected in the US state of Georgia, this paper (1) measures (at a general level) how people expect their activity patterns to change in a hypothetical all-AV era; (2) identifies population segments having similar profiles of expected changes; and (3) further profiles each segment on the basis of attitudinal, sociodemographic, and geographic characteristics. In the survey, respondents were asked to express their expectations regarding 16 potential activity modifications induced by AVs. We first conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to reduce the dimensionality of the activity-change vector characterizing each individual, and estimated non-mean-centered (NMC) factor scores (which have been rarely used in applied psychology). The EFA solution identified four dimensions of activity change: distance, time flexibility, frequency, and long distance/leisure. Next, we clustered Georgians with respect to these four-dimensional expectation vectors. The cluster solution uncovered six segments: no change, change unlikely, more leisure/long distance, longer trips, more travel, and time flexibility & more leisure/long distance. Using NMC factor scores identified considerably more inertia with respect to expectations for change than would have been apparent from the usual mean-centered scores. Finally, the various segments exhibit distinctive demographics and general attitudes. For example, those in the more leisure/long distance cluster tend to be higher income and are more likely to be Atlanta-region residents compared to other clusters, while those in the no change and change unlikely clusters tend to be older and are more likely to be rural residents.",1369-8478,Not found
Modeling pedestrian-cyclist interactions in shared space using inverse reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.trf.2020.02.007,70,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The objective of this study is to model the microscopic behaviour of mixed traffic (cyclist-pedestrian) interactions in non-motorized shared spaces. Video data were collected at two locations of Robson Square non-motorized shared space in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. Trajectories of cyclists and pedestrians involved in interactions were extracted using computer vision algorithms. The extracted trajectories were used to obtain several variables that describe elements of road users’ behaviour including longitudinal and lateral distances, speed and speed differences, interaction angle, and cyclist acceleration and yaw rate. The road users behaviour was modeled as utility-based intelligent rational agents using the finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework with unknown reward functions. The study implemented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) using two algorithms: the Maximum Entropy (ME) algorithm, and the Feature Matching (FM) algorithm to recover/estimate the reward function weights of cyclists in two types of interactions with pedestrians: following and overtaking interactions. Reward function weights infer cyclist preferences during their interactions with pedestrians in non-motorized shared spaces, and can form the key component in developing agent based microsimulation model for road users. Furthermore, the estimated reward functions were used to estimate cyclists’ optimal policy for such interactions. A simulation platform was developed using the estimated reward functions and the cyclist optimal policies to simulate cyclist trajectories for the validation dataset. Results show that the Maximum Entropy (ME) IRL algorithm outperformed the Feature Matching (FM) IRL algorithm, and generally provided reasonable results for modeling such interactions in non-motorized shared spaces, considering the high degrees of freedom in movement and the more-complex road users interactions in such facilities. This research is considered an important step toward developing a full Agent-Based Model (ABM) for road users in shared space facilities to evaluate the safety and efficiency of such facilities.",1369-8478,Not found

In order to explore this, short high-quality animation videos of conflicts between a car and a cyclist at five different intersections were developed. These videos were ‘shot’ from the perspective of the cyclist and ended when a collision was imminent should the car or the bicyclist not slow down. After each video participants indicated whether they would slow down or continue cycling, how confident they were about this decision, what they thought the car would do, and how confident they were about what the car would do. The appearance of the approaching car was varied as within-subjects variable with 3 levels (Car type): automated car, automated car displaying its intentions to the cyclists, and traditional car. In all situations the cyclist had right of way. Of each conflict, three versions were made that differed in the moment that the video ended by cutting off fractions from the longest version, thus creating videos with an early, mid, and late moment for the cyclist to decide to continue cycling or to slow down (Decision moment). Before the video experiment started the participants watched an introductory video about automated vehicles that served as prime. This video was either positive, negative, or neutral about automated vehicles (Prime type). Both Decision moment and Prime type were between subject variables. After the experiment participants completed a short questionnaire about trust in technology and trust in automated vehicles. 1009 participants divided in nine groups (one per Decision moment and Prime) completed the online experiment in which they watched fifteen videos (5 conflicts × 3 car types). The results show that participants more often yielded when the approaching car was an automated car than when it was a traditional car. However, when the approaching car was an automated car that could communicate its intentions, they yielded less often than for a traditional car. The earlier the Decision moment, the more often participants yielded but this increase in yielding did not differ between the three car types. Participants yielded more often for automated cars (both types) after they watched the negative prime video before the experiment than when they watched the positive video. The less participants trusted technology, and the capabilities of automated vehicles in particular, the more they were inclined to slow down in the conflict situations with automated cars. The association between trust and yielding was stronger for trust in the capabilities of automated vehicles than for trust in technology in general.",1369-8478,Not found
App-based feedback on safety to novice drivers: Learning and monetary incentives,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.005,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"An over-proportionally large number of car crashes is caused by novice drivers. In a field experiment, we investigated whether and how car drivers who had recently obtained their driving license reacted to app-based feedback on their safety-relevant driving behavior (speeding, phone usage, cornering, acceleration and braking). Participants went through a pre-measurement phase during which they did not receive app-based feedback but driving behavior was recorded, a treatment phase during which they received app-based feedback, and a post-measurement phase during which they did not receive app-based feedback but driving behavior was recorded. Before the start of the treatment phase, we randomly assigned participants to two possible treatment groups. In addition to receiving app-based feedback, the participants of one group received monetary incentives to improve their safety-relevant driving behavior, while the participants of the other group did not. At the beginning and at the end of experiment, each participant had to fill out a questionnaire to elicit socio-economic and attitudinal information. We conducted regression analyses to identify socio-economic, attitudinal, and driving-behavior-related variables that explain safety-relevant driving behavior during the pre-measurement phase and the self-chosen intensity of app usage during the treatment phase. For the main objective of our study, we applied regression analyses to identify those variables that explain the potential effect of providing app-based feedback during the treatment phase on safety-relevant driving behavior. Last, we applied statistical tests of differences to identify self-selection and attrition biases in our field experiment. For a sample of 130 novice Austrian drivers, we found moderate improvements in safety-relevant driving skills due to app-based feedback. The improvements were more pronounced under the treatment with monetary incentives, and for participants choosing higher feedback intensities. Moreover, drivers who drove relatively safer before receiving app-based feedback used the app more intensely and, ceteris paribus, higher app use intensity led to improvements in safety-related driving skills. Last, we provide empirical evidence for both self-selection and attrition biases.",1369-8478,Not found
The specific role of spatial orientation skills in predicting driving behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.009,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"How people acquire environmental information brings out individual differences that are extremely large and robust. We assume that different spatial strategies used to represent, explore and move through the environment may predict risky driving behaviour. Here, we investigated spatial strategies and driving behaviour in 167 college students (86 women) using the following tests: the Spatial Cognitive Style Test, aimed at assessing spatial strategies characterized by different degrees of spatial competences (ranging from landmark, route to survey); the Manchester Driver Behavior Questionnaire, aimed at assessing errors, lapses, ordinary and aggressive Highway Code violations; the Attitude toward Road Safety Issues, aimed at assessing road safety attitudes related to driving. A series of regression analysis showed that spatial strategy used by drivers predicted the number of errors, lapses, ordinary and aggressive violations, as well as the number of road-safety behaviours. In conclusion, our results suggest that drivers preferring a survey strategy are much more able to make correct spatial decisions. Specifically, they are more confident about their spatial competence that in turn makes them less aggressive towards other drivers. Our findings suggest that good navigators travel without incurring in violations and fines. Implications regarding the possibility to use spatial navigational training to improve driving skills and release driving licence, as well as limitations of the study are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Revealing psychological inertia in mode shift behavior and its quantitative influences on commuting trips,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.006,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The inertia effects stemmed from repeated past behavior have been investigated by both psychology and transportation studies because of its bearing on explaining human mobility and forecasting travel demand. However, the existing literature from psychology does not strictly control potential endogeneity due to ignorance of detailed level-of-service (LOS) variables of alternatives and rational preference in the analysis. Quantitative transportation studies are insufficient in providing explicit behavior mechanisms. This paper aims to fill the gaps by empirically examining the effects of irrational psychological inertia in mode shift behavior with controlling potential endogeneity. A specific-designed comparison experiment is conducted to demonstrate the existence of psychological inertia in mode shift behavior. The effects of dominance in LOS variables and rational preference towards a certain transport mode are controlled to eliminate potential endogeneity in the analysis. The results demonstrate that after controlling the above-mentioned endogeneity, both car and metro users show significantly and substantially larger predilections to previously used transport mode in mode shift scenarios without overturning travel contexts than those in new context mode choice scenarios with noticeable changes in travel contexts. The results support that psychological inertia plays a significant role in mode shift behavior after controlling potential endogeneity. Moreover, this study utilizes hybrid choice modeling to quantitatively measure the effect of psychological inertia. The relationships between travelers’ characteristics and strength of psychological inertia are analyzed as well to shed light on heterogeneity in the strength of psychological inertia. The findings provide solid evidence of psychological inertia in mode shift behavior by a novel method and provide an approach to measure the quantitative effects of psychological inertia along with empirical studies.",1369-8478,Not found
The development and validation of a hazard perception test for Thai drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.011,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Thailand is a developing country with a high traffic accident fatality rate. However, few attempts have been made to understand crash risks in Thai drivers from a psychological perspective. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a latency-based hazard perception test for Thai drivers. The initial test comprised our full item pool of 77 clips containing traffic conflicts captured on video from the driver’s perspective on Thai roads. We evaluated the validity of this test by examining whether performance differed as a function of driving experience in a sample of 135 Thai drivers. We found that experienced drivers (n = 87) performed significantly better than novice drivers (n = 48) after adjusting for individual differences in computer mouse skill, mirroring crash risk differences between these groups. The final 30-item version of the test, which comprised the best items from the initial test, yielded novice/experienced driver differences with or without adjusting for computer mouse skill. These results offer preliminary support for the validity of the latency-based test as a measure of hazard perception ability in Thai drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Diverging diamond interchanges: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.007,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"This study assessed driver performance while navigating a Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) compared to a standard intersection in a driving simulator. A total of 201 Western Australian (WA) drivers aged 18–80 years completed the simulator drive and questionnaire. Measures of driving simulator performance assessed included time spent out of lane, number of lane excursions, compliance to the speed limit, crashes and near misses. Other driving measures, which were recorded by the researcher, included driver errors/violations such as red-light violations, wrong way violations and navigation errors. Qualitative information was also obtained in a post exit interview with each participant regarding the difficulties they experienced when driving through the DDI. A repeated-measure analysis of variance (r-ANOVA) was undertaken to examine differences in intersection type (DDI versus standard intersection) and driving performance measures from the driving simulator. The only significant result was compliance to the speed limit (F (1, 656) = 160.11,p < 0.001) on the driving simulator. A higher proportion of red-light violations were observed by the researcher as participants navigated through the DDI, compared to the standard intersection. Qualitative comments from participants also highlighted the need for better signage and road markings. Recommendations when DDIs are implemented include community education on speed limit compliance, avoidance of red-light violations and design improvements regarding signage and road markings.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors related to the use of pedestrian bridges in university students of Honduras,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.016,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Considering that deaths and injuries due to run overs near pedestrian bridges (PB) are preventable events, this research aims to analyze the factors related to the use of pedestrian bridges in students of a public university of Honduras. This was made through a quantitative methodology; 330 questionnaires were applied to a sample of university students. Results suggest that 17.27% of the respondents don’t use the bridge. Most respondents (62.42%) believe it’s faster to cross the street and that using the bridge is tiresome (79.90%). Pedestrian bridges are also considered to be unsafe places, prone to robberies. Pearson’s r coefficient determined that this belief is significantly associated with the perception of cleanliness, quality of the infrastructure and illumination. There is a correlation between stress and considering the use of the bridge as a tiresome activity. A logistic regression model determined that significant variables explained the use of the PB included: being in a hurry, believing it’s faster to cross the street, thinking that PBs have a bad infrastructure, laziness and thinking that using the PB is tiresome, all of them reducing the chance that someone will use the bridge. On the other hand, non-significant variables in the model included: age, considering that using the PB is stressful, thinking that crossing the street is stressful, thinking PBs have good illumination. Safety related variables were not able to discriminate between users and non-users. These results are discussed in the light of previous research and their implication for public policy and future research.",1369-8478,Not found
Differences in parental perceptions of walking and cycling to high school according to distance,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.013,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Background Parental perceptions towards different modes of transport correlate with adolescents’ mode choice for school trips. Whether parental attitudes differ for walking versus cycling and/or home-to-school distance is unknown. We compared parental perceptions of walking versus cycling to school in adolescents in Dunedin, New Zealand and examined whether mode-specific barriers differ by distance to school. Methods Parents (n = 341; age: 47.5 ± 5.2 years; 77.1% females) completed a survey about their adolescent’s (age: 13–18 years; 48.1% boys) school travel and their own perceptions of walking/cycling to school. Participants were categorised into three groups according to distance to school as ‘walkable’ (≤2.25 km), ‘cyclable’ (>2.25–≤4.0 km) and ‘beyond cyclable’ (>4.0 km). Results Common modes of transport to school differed significantly across the ‘walkable’/’cyclable’/’beyond cyclable’ categories (car passenger: 25.7%/40.5%/60.6%; public/school bus: 5.5%/15.4%/28.4%; walking: 66.2%/28.2%/1.2%; cycling: 0.0%/7.7%/0.5%; all p < 0.001). Compared to walking, parents perceived cycling to school to be less important (walking/cycling: 87.5%/62.5%), with less social support from parents (46.2%/17.1%), peers (20.6%/4.8%) and school (24.5%/12.4%), less interest from adolescents (48.5%/31.9%), fewer cycle paths (26.5%) versus footpaths (65.0%) and more safety concerns (35.0%/64.6%; all p < 0.001). As distance to school increased, parents’ social support decreased whereas personal, environmental and safety-related barriers increased for both modes, with less consistent findings for cycling. Overall, 68.2% of parents expected to participate in adolescents’ walking/cycling to school decision-making. Conclusions Parents favoured walking compared to cycling to school with parental attitudes for both modes changing with increasing distance to school. The findings illustrate the importance of addressing parental concerns, considering the specificity of walking and cycling and taking into account distance to school in active transport to school initiatives.",1369-8478,Not found
Positive influence of practical electric vehicle driving experience and range related knowledge on drivers' experienced range stress,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.013,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The challenge of reducing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions has become increasingly important in recent years. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are a promising alternative having the potential for a CO2 neutral and sustainable utilization over the whole vehicle lifetime. However, BEVs limited range is still considered as one important usage barrier. Reducing drivers' experience of range stress is discussed as one possibility to overcome this barrier. The objective of the present research was to investigate the influence of range related knowledge, practical driving experience and the encounter of a critical range situation (i.e., experience of a small range buffer) on drivers' range stress. A specific focus lied on the effects of critical range situation encounters on experienced BEV drivers. A field experiment with 63 participants (20 experienced drivers and 43 inexperienced drivers) who drove a BEV in a critical range situation was conducted. Results indicate that range related knowledge and practical driving experience reduced range stress. The experience of the critical range situation is related to lower range stress, even for the experienced BEV drivers. The results can be useful to derive strategies and design recommendations aimed at reducing the experience of BEV drivers' range stress.",1369-8478,Not found
From workplace attachment to commuter satisfaction before and after a workplace relocation,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.022,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"While attention has been paid to travel satisfaction studies during the last decade, less research has investigated the relationship between the influence of a sense of place – and more particularly the psycho-environmental concepts of workplace attachment and workplace satisfaction – and commuting satisfaction. Using a retrospective survey, this paper focuses on the relocation of a workplace within the city of Montréal (Canada); the McGill University Healthcare Centre. It examines the motivations and barriers involved in the evolution of commuting characteristics, using the theoretical framework of mobility biographies. The empirical analysis includes a large dataset of independent variables, applying a multinomial logistic model in order to explain the transition of the employees’ commuting satisfaction. With regard to the measurement of change in commuting satisfaction, the findings confirm the role of attitudes, while taking into account the contextual differences before and after relocation. The change in travel time is found to be an important factor in the evolution of commuter satisfaction, whereby reduced commuting time improves satisfaction, as expected. In addition, the more an employee is attached to the new workplace, the more the commuting satisfaction will increase. The results provide further evidence that the meaning of the workplace goes beyond a location or a space, and opens up new avenues for research in travel behavior.",1369-8478,Not found
The perception of bicycle crashes with and without motor vehicles: Which crash types do older and middle-aged cyclists fear most?,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.021,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Several studies have focused on the perceived risk of bicycle crashes (irrespective of crash types) and concluded that cycling near high volumes of motor vehicles deters people from cycling. The perceived risk of bicycle crash types (with or without motor vehicles) has not yet been studied. Cyclists, both in countries with low and high levels of cycling participation, are substantially more likely to sustain severe injuries in single-bicycle crashes than in bicycle-motor vehicle crashes. This questionnaire study sets out to compare which bicycle crash types are perceived to cause most hospitalizations among cyclists. The study comprised cyclists over 55 years in the Netherlands, and over 40 years in the Belgian regions of Flanders (a region with high cycling participation), Brussels and Wallonia (regions with low cycling participation). The majority of cyclists (60%) perceive bicycle-motor vehicle crashes cause most hospitalizations among cyclists. This percentage is greatest in the areas of Brussels and Wallonia and lowest in the Netherlands. Cyclists who were involved in a bicycle-motor vehicle crash themselves are more likely to regard this crash type as the most common cause of hospitalizations among cyclists, while cyclists over 60 years who were involved in a crash without a motor vehicle are more likely to perceive that crash type as the most common cause. The smaller perception bias in the study areas with higher cycling participation – particularly the Netherlands and to a somewhat lesser degree Flanders – is probably due to bicycle infrastructure being more separated from high-speed motor traffic, leaving cyclists less exposed. The outcomes show that cyclists underestimate the likelihood of severe injuries due to single-bicycle crashes. New interventions should raise the awareness of the risk of single-bicycle crashes and provide solutions to avoid such crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
Human factors evaluation of an in-vehicle active traffic and demand management (ATDM) system,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.004,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"This research study focused on the evaluation of an emulated in-vehicle Active Traffic and Demand Management (ATDM) system on Interstate 66 in Northern Virginia. Traditional ATDM systems rely on infrastructure-mounted variable message signs (VMS) to provide information (speed limits, lane availability, etc.) to the traveling public. By providing information about dynamic roadway conditions on an in-vehicle device, the ATDM may improve driving safety and performance by allowing drivers to remain consistently aware of forthcoming traffic conditions and roadway requirements; even when external signage is inaccessible. This study represents an initial investigation of an emulated in-vehicle ATDM to provide developers with design guidance and ensure that unintended consequences, such as distraction, do not undermine the potential benefits. Twenty younger and 20 older participants, accompanied by a member of the research team, experienced the following ATDM features on an in-vehicle device (IVD) mounted to the dashboard: (1) dynamic speed limits, (2) dynamic lane use/shoulder control, (3) High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) restrictions, and (4) roadway information from variable message signs. The IVD was equipped with auditory and visual alerts notifying the driver when relevant visual information was updated. Research questions addressed distraction and driver behavior associated with use of the system. Qualitative and quantitative participant data was acquired from the instrumented vehicle, various questionnaires, and researcher observation. Several key findings were uncovered: (1) The IVD, as tested, did not warrant classification as a source of distraction according to the NHTSA guidelines; v2) There was a significant difference in eye-glance durations to the IVD when comparing the VMS alerts to both the speed limit and lane management alerts; and (3) The speed limit alert motivated participants to alter their speed (per survey results and participant speed data).",1369-8478,Not found
A qualitative study of young drivers and deterrence based road policing,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.003,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Deterrence theory is the predominant theory used to underpin road policing initiatives. However, survey research indicates that this approach may not be as effective for young drivers. This study uses focus groups, conducted in both metropolitan and regional locations in two Australian states (Queensland and Victoria), to explore three components of classical deterrence theory: certainty, severity & swiftness. The results suggest that geographical context affected perceptions of certainty with individuals from regional locations less likely to indicate that they would be caught by police for committing a traffic offence. Additionally, the use of cameras to detect road offences increased perceptions of certainty for young drivers. The results of this study suggest that police agencies should focus on undertaking actions to increase the perceptions of certainty swiftness and severity of punishment, particularly in regional areas, for young drivers who engage in illegal behaviour on the road. Where appropriate, these actions should take into account the geographical context. There may also be value in considering augmenting deterrence theory with other theoretical perspectives for this group.",1369-8478,Not found
How drivers adapt their behaviour to changes in task complexity: The role of secondary task demands and road environment factors,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.015,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The present study investigates the impact of different sources of task complexity such as driving demands and secondary task demands on driver behaviour. Although much research has been dedicated to understanding the impact of secondary task demands or specific road traffic environments on driving performance, there is little information on how drivers adapt their behaviour to their combined presence. This paper aims to describe driver behaviour while negotiating different sources of task complexity, including mobile phone use while driving (i.e., calling and texting) and different road environments (i.e., straight segments, curves, hills, tunnels, and curves on hills). A driving simulator experiment was conducted to explore the effects of different road scenarios and different types of distraction while driving. The collected data was used to estimate driving behaviour through a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with repeated measures. The analysis was divided into two phases. Phase one aimed to evaluate driver performance under the presence and absence of pedestrians and oncoming traffic, different lanes width and different types of distraction. The second phase analysed driver behaviour when driving through different road geometries and lane widths and under different types of distraction. The results of the experiment indicated that drivers are likely to overcorrect position in the vehicle lane in the presence of pedestrians and oncoming traffic. The effect of road geometry on driver behaviour was found to be greater than the effect of mobile phone distraction. Curved roads and hills were found to influence preferred speeds and lateral position the most. The results of this investigation also show that drivers under visual-manual distraction had a higher standard deviation of speed and lateral position compared to the cognitive distraction and the non-distraction condition.",1369-8478,Not found

It was predicted that drivers from these five countries differ significantly in terms of driver aggression for self and others, aberrant, and positive driver behaviors. In the study, 743 participants completed the questionnaire package, including the Driver Aggression Indicators Scale (DAIS), the short version of the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) with items from the Positive Driver Behavior Scale, and the Demographic Information Form. Paired samples T-tests were conducted to examine the differences in driving aggression between self and others in the five countries. The results indicated that, except for Russian drivers, drivers reported that other drivers had higher driver aggression than themselves. To examine the cross-cultural differences, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests were conducted for the two dimensions of the DAIS (hostile aggression and revenge, and aggressive warnings) and the three dimensions of the DBQ with items from the Positive Driver Behavior Scale (errors, violations, and positive driver behaviors). Cross-country item-based comparisons were then made for the DAIS and the DBQ. The ANCOVA results showed significant differences in both item-based and subscale comparisons. Russian drivers were significantly different from other drivers in terms of hostile aggression and the revenge subscales of the DAIS and positive driver behaviors. Turkish drivers were significantly different from other drivers in several items of the DBQ, including errors and violations. The findings suggest that culture-specific strategies might be conducted for traffic-related anger management. Furthermore, differences in errors and violations among the five countries may be due to cultural differences. Positive driver behaviors might be better promoted in countries by drawing on their distinct cultural road safety strategies.",1369-8478,Not found
Scores on a new hazard prediction test are associated with both driver experience and crash involvement,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.016,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Hazard perception skill has been found to be associated with drivers’ crash risk. This skill has typically been measured using computer-based response-time hazard perception tests, in which drivers indicate the earliest point that they detect a potential hazard in video clips of traffic filmed from a driver’s perspective. In recent years, researchers have suggested an alternative type of measure, known as a “hazard prediction test”, in which each test item is a traffic clip that stops (typically cutting to black) just before a hazardous incident unfolds. Drivers taking the test have to predict what happens next in the clip. Measures of this kind have been found to distinguish between high risk (novice) and lower risk (experienced) driver groups, and have been argued to offer several advantages over traditional response-time hazard perception tests. However, a key strength of the response-time hazard perception test is that assessments using this format have been found to predict crash involvement. The same has not yet been demonstrated for hazard prediction tests, raising questions about their validity. In the present research, we created a new hazard prediction test using Australian traffic scenes. In our version of the test, drivers’ scores were based on how many plausible predictions they were able to generate for each traffic clip. We established validity evidence for the test scores in two studies with separate samples, using two different versions of the test (long vs. short) with different response modes (verbal vs. written). As well as distinguishing between novice and experienced driver groups, test scores were also associated with self-reported crash involvement in both studies. We also found a significant correlation between hazard prediction test scores and scores in an established response-time hazard perception test. These findings support the proposal that scores on the hazard prediction test are a valid measure of hazard perception skill.",1369-8478,Not found

When including childhood experiences, this rate increased to 59%, comparable to the 1975 findings by Reason and Brand. The highest and lowest incidence of carsickness was reported in China and Germany, respectively. In all countries, men and older participants reported a lower incidence of carsickness as compared to females and younger participants. The main modulating factors were found to be driving dynamics, visual activities, and low air quality. This study showed that carsickness still affects about 2/3 of passengers and discusses how its occurrence relates to in-transit activities and other modes of transport.

Therefore, it is important to fully understand drivers’ merging behavior in work zone related areas. In this study, a model framework composed of decision-distance analysis and merging-distance analysis was proposed, which could describe both decision-making and lane-changing process of merging behavior. A road environment with work zone was developed based on a driving simulator, and six scenarios composed of two levels of traffic volume and three different lane-end sign’s locations were designed. Forty-two licensed participants, including 21 females (10 professional drivers vs. 11 normal drivers) and 21 males (15 professional drivers vs. 6 normal drivers) finally completed the experiment. Based on the experimental data, parametric survival models were established to analyze the effects of traffic sign location, traffic situation and driver characteristics on drivers’ decision distance and merging distance. The results showed that: (i) the lane-end sign’s location affected the decision point of lane changing and further affected the merging distance. However, the effect was weakened when the sign was placed far away from the work zone; (ii) merging distance in high traffic volume condition was shorter than that in low traffic volume condition; (iii) work zone posed greater challenges for female drivers as they merged later than males, and females were reluctant to adjust their merging distance according to different gap conditions.

We employed the Tobii eye tracker to collect the eye movement markers and reaction time data of 35 drivers. First, the road type and distances of neighboring cars were used to classify situations in the video clips into high- and low-risk situations. The revised Chinese version of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI-C) was used to measure the driving style of drivers. The eye movement heatmap of drivers was used to classify the areas of interest into the front view and side mirror. We found that the angry driving style and the total fixation duration on the front view of drivers in high-risk situations were predictors of the relative lane-changing decision time. Angry-driving-style drivers’ relative lane-changing decision time is shorter than that of other drivers. In high-risk driving situations, the longer the total fixation duration on the front view, the shorter the relative lane-changing decision time. We also found that the angry driving style and eye movement areas of interest interacted with the mean search durations and total fixation durations of the drivers. Angry-driving-style drivers were more focused on the front view. Our study has significance for the improvement of the improvement of the allocation of visual attention of angry-driving-style drivers and the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).",1369-8478,Not found

Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) was used to test the factor structure and measurement invariance across females (n = 602) and males (n = 675), and across young (18–29, n = 558), adult (30–49, n = 395) and older (50 and older, n = 317) drivers. The results showed that a 36-item six-factor ESEM model represented by risky, angry, dissociative, anxious, distress-reduction and careful and patient driving styles was the best model based on fit indices and interpretability. Configural, weak and strong invariance of the six-factor ESEM model across gender and age was also supported. The MDSI in its Argentinian version is equivalent across gender and age, supporting the validity of previous research findings examining gender and age differences in driving styles. Future studies should examine the measurement invariance of the MDSI across other relevant driving-related variables.",1369-8478,Not found
Matters of State: Examining the effectiveness of lane departure warnings as a function of driver distraction,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.009,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Lane departure warnings (LDW) have the potential to mitigate a significant number of lane departure crashes. Such safety benefits have yet been realized, in part due to drivers deactivating LDW systems. Perceived false alarms—where drivers receive a warning but feel the warning was unnecessary or incorrect—could lead to system disuse. In part, this could be a failure of LDW systems to account for the state of the driver. The current study investigated whether LDWs were more effective for drivers when they were distracted compared to when they were undistracted, using a high-fidelity driving simulator. During distracted lane departures, drivers with LDW responded faster and had less severe lane departures than drivers without LDW. During undistracted lane departures, there was no evidence of a benefit of LDW over no warning. These results suggest that lane departure warnings are most effective when drivers are distracted. This study suggests a need for driver state monitoring systems to enable adaptive automation.",1369-8478,Not found
"Influence of values, attitudes towards transport modes and companions on travel behavior",10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.002,71,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The design and implementation of transport policies to promote active transport requires a deep comprehension of the factors that influence travel behavior. In this context, psychological factors and social interactions play an important role in explaining travel-related decisions. Even though, the importance of psychosocial variables in travel behavior research has been widely recognized during recent years, there is a lack of understanding of how these factors interact. This paper aims to better understand the interrelationships between values, attitudes towards transport modes and a subset of the social network composed by habitual trips and activities companions. For this purpose, a theoretical framework is proposed which posits all the possible relationships among these factors. In order to test this conceptual framework, two Structural Equation Models are estimated considering attitudes towards active transport (bike and walking), using a dataset from a web-based survey developed for the MINERVA project in Valencia (Spain). The data is composed by 404 respondents who provided valid information regarding all the variables of the study. Results confirm the hierarchical value-attitude-behavior structure while several effects are also found directly between values and attitudes. For instance, individuals who attach more importance to Stimulation and Achievement values are higher active transport user, while values traditionally associated with car use are no longer maintaining this relation. Besides that, positive attitudes towards walking and cycling are strongly associated with a higher use of active transport, and also seem to discourage the use of motorized modes. Several characteristics of companions affects personal values and active travel and less influence is found on attitudes. These findings are useful to develop transport policies and campaigns to promote sustainable transport, such as the design of strategies in the context of Travel Behavior Change Programs. Limitations of this research include several aspects related to online surveys, for instance, sample size and underrepresentation of individuals over 55 years.",1369-8478,Not found

The utility of psychological measures in evaluating perceived usability of automated vehicle interfaces – A study with older adults,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.003,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The design of the traditional vehicle human-machine interfaces (HMIs) is undergoing major change as we move towards fully connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Given the diversity of user requirements and preferences, it is vital for designers to gain a deeper understanding of any underlying factors that could impact usability. The current study employs a range of carefully selected psychological measures to investigate the relationship with self-report usability of an in-CAV HMI integrated into a fully automated Level 5 simulator, during simulated journeys. Twenty-five older adults (65-years+) participated and were exposed to four journeys in a virtual reality fully automated CAV simulator (with video recorded journeys) into which our HMI was integrated. Participants completed a range of scales and questionnaires, as well as computerized cognitive tests. Key measures were: perceived usability of the HMI, cognitive performance, personality, attitudes towards computers, trust in technology, simulator sickness, presence and emotion. HMI perceived usability correlated positively with cognitive performance (e.g., working memory) and some individual characteristics such as trust in technology and negatively with neuroticism anxiety. Simulator sickness was associated negatively with CAV HMI perceived usability. Positive emotions correlated positively with reported usability across all four journeys, while negative emotions were negatively associated with usability only in the case of the last two journeys. Increased sense of presence in the virtual CAV simulator was not associated with usability. Implications for design are critically discussed. Our research is highly relevant in the design of high-fully automated vehicle HMIs, particularly for older adults, and in informing policy-makers and automated mobility providers of how to improve older people’s uptake of this technology.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of system transparency on trust: Evaluating interfaces in a highly automated vehicle,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.001,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Previous studies indicate that, if an automated vehicle communicates its system status and intended behaviour, it could increase user trust and acceptance. However, it is still unclear what types of interfaces will better portray this type of information. The present study evaluated different configurations of screens comparing how they communicated the possible hazards in the environment (e.g. vulnerable road users), and vehicle behaviours (e.g. intended trajectory). These interfaces were presented in a fully automated vehicle tested by 25 participants in an indoor arena. Surveys and interviews measured trust, usability and experience after users were driven by an automated low-speed pod. Participants experienced four types of interfaces, from a simple journey tracker to a windscreen-wide augmented reality (AR) interface which overlays hazards highlighted in the environment and the trajectory of the vehicle. A combination of the survey and interview data showed a clear preference for the AR windscreen and an animated representation of the environment. The trust in the vehicle featuring these interfaces was significantly higher than pretrial measurements. However, some users questioned if they want to see this information all the time. One additional result was that some users felt motion sick when presented with the more engaging content. This paper provides recommendations for the design of interfaces with the potential to improve trust and user experience within highly automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
A matter of style? Testing the moderating effect of driving styles on the relationship between job strain and work-related crashes of professional drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.015,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Different empirical studies suggest that both job strain and driving styles are significant contributors to the work-related traffic crashes suffered by professional drivers. Nevertheless, the current evidence falls considerably short when explaining why driving styles may modify (or not) the relationship between occupational stressors and professional drivers’ safety outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine whether driving styles moderate the effect of job strain on professional drivers’ Work Traffic Crashes (WTCs). This research was performed using the data collected from a sample of 753 professional drivers, responding to a self-report questionnaire on job strain (work stress indicator of the Job Demand-Control model), driving styles and work-traffic safety outcomes suffered in the past two years. Regression-based moderation analyses suggest that the job strain of professional drivers is positively associated with the occupational traffic crashes they suffer, and that such association is stronger in drivers with “reckless & careless”, “anxious”, and “angry & hostile” driving styles. Meanwhile, the “patient & careful” (positive) driving style was not associated with a lower risk of suffering a WTC, nor with a lower vulnerability to stress-related WTCs. The results of this study support the hypothesis that driving styles exert a statistical moderation between the job strain and the occupational traffic crashes suffered by professional drivers. These findings may support the design of evidence-based interventions in both the organizational and individual levels, focused stress-related factors and driving styles as predictors of work traffic crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
Attitudes towards privately-owned and shared autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.014,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Research on attitudes towards autonomous vehicles (AVs) shows variation across gender, age, and socio-economic factors. While previous research has emphasized specific features and qualities of AVs, little is known about how attitudinal factors shape AV acceptance across a range of AV “modes” from privately-owned AVs to AV taxis shared with strangers. With an online panel of 834 US-based participants, we examine attitudes towards AVs and sharing. An exploratory factor analysis establishes four attitudinal dimensions: technology acceptance, risk-taking, traffic regulation, and driving enjoyment. We estimate multinomial logistic regression models to examine the impact of these four factors on attitudes toward AVs, willingness to purchase AVs, willingness to use AVs as a taxi service, and willingness to share AV taxis with strangers. We find a complex relationship between psychological factors and AV attitudes. “Early adopters” of technology and those who support stricter traffic regulations are more likely to have a positive attitude about AVs, whereas those who avoid risky behavior were more likely to have a negative attitude instead of a neutral attitude. Similar patterns were found across models of purchasing, using, and sharing AVs. The results imply that people who support traffic regulations may perceive AVs as a safer transport mode than human-driven cars, while those who avoid risk-taking behavior may perceive AVs to be more dangerous. However, we find that a large fraction of the population is not yet ready to use an AV with no driver, and overall reluctance to share a ride in an AV taxi.",1369-8478,Not found
Public perception of autonomous vehicles: A qualitative study based on interviews after riding an autonomous shuttle,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.012,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can potentially compensate for human error whilst driving. Thus, the number of accidents and the amount of congestion, emissions and fuel consumption could be reduced. For such reduction to occur, insights into public acceptance of AVs must be considered because they are a crucial factor for the successful implementation of AVs in existing traffic systems. Purpose This study aims to explore (1) the mobility behaviour of current passengers, (2) the perception of the public of how AVs can be applied, (3) the perceived challenges of AVs in terms of integration into existing traffic systems, (4) the general attitude of the public towards AVs and (5) the perceived safety of passengers after riding an autonomous shuttle with a maximum SAE level of 3 in the setting of mixed traffic. Method This qualitative study was conducted in Carinthia (Austria) in September 2018. Interviews were conducted with 19 participants aged between 20 and 75 years. The participants were recruited through purposeful sampling, and data were collected through in-depth, semistructured interviews which were recorded, transcribed, organised and analysed using systematic, qualitative content analysis. Results Results show that transport mobility plays an important role in social life. In rural areas, AVs can shift transportation modes from private cars to public transportation. The respondents perceive AVs as an alternative more than as a substitute for existing means of transportation. With the integration of AVs into existing traffic systems, the transportation of goods and people could be improved despite related uncertainties. This study explores different aspects of societal, technical, legal and economic challenges. Overall, the respondents feel positive about AVs. Responses regarding safety show that experience with AVs and speed are key factors. Originality/Value This study is one of the first to explain qualitatively public perceptions of AVs after an actual ride in an AV under real-life conditions. The results, which help understand AVs from the public’s perspective, may also provide guidelines for the successful integration of AVs in Austria.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors underpinning unsafe driving: A systematic literature review of car drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.008,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Objectives The purpose was to provide a systematic review of the literature related to the personality and well-being of social, domestic, pleasure and commuting (SDP&C) car drivers. Methods The following databases were searched: PsychINFO (PsychNET), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Social Sciences Index; WoS), ORCA (Online research at Cardiff University), Science Direct (Elsevier), Taylor and Francis Online, and PubMed. Grey literature was sourced using the Transport Research International Database (TRID) as well as conference proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society and Driver Assessment. In parallel, an internet search of Google Scholar was undertaken. Two researchers reviewed papers suitable for inclusion. Eligible papers were those published in the English language, during the last decade; the latter to allow for a more contemporary appraisal of the literature. The search yielded thirty peer reviewed articles and ten reports relevant to the personality and well-being of SDP&C road users. Results The findings show that anxiety, stress and depression were predictive of unfavourable driving outcomes (e.g. risk-taking, aggression, poor driving behaviour.) Further, driving discourtesy by others was found to not only induce stress reactions in drivers, but also led to riskier driving practice, such as deliberately engaging in intimidating driving behaviour. Negative personality traits were related with negative driving behaviours, whilst higher levels of well-being and life satisfaction appear to safeguard drivers against deliberate driving violations. There was a dearth of literature focusing on UK drivers, as well as research examining the impact of driving itself on the well-being of the driver. Conclusions Further longitudinal, multivariate research is required to examine all well-being/personality predictors, whilst controlling for established predictors (such as fatigue) such that the factors underpinning unsafe driving behaviour (in isolation and in combination) may be revealed.",1369-8478,Not found

Research has shown that visually distracted drivers need about 7 s to regain situation awareness (SA). However, it is unknown whether the presence of a hazard affects SA. In the present experiment, 32 participants watched animated video clips from a driver’s perspective while their eyes were recorded using eye-tracking equipment. The videos had lengths between 1 and 20 s and contained either no hazard or an impending crash in the form of a stationary car in the ego lane. After each video, participants had to (1) decide (no need to take over, evade left, evade right, brake only), (2) rate the danger of the situation, (3) rebuild the situation from a top-down perspective, and (4) rate the difficulty of the rebuilding task. The results showed that the hazard situations were experienced as more dangerous than the non-hazard situations, as inferred from self-reported danger and pupil diameter. However, there were no major differences in SA: hazard and non-hazard situations yielded equivalent speed and distance errors in the rebuilding task and equivalent self-reported difficulty scores. An exception occurred for the shortest time budget (1 s) videos, where participants showed impaired SA in the hazard condition, presumably because the threat inhibited participants from looking into the rear-view mirror. Correlations between measures of SA and decision-making accuracy were low to moderate. It is concluded that hazards do not substantially affect the global awareness of the traffic situation, except for short time budgets.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessing the factor structure of the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (BYNDS),10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.015,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (BYNDS) is a self-report instrument to assess risky driving behaviours among youth population. Although previous studies have offered evidences of reliability and validity for the BYNDS scores, results are not conclusive as regards its factor structure. The aim of this research was to assess the factor structure of the BYNDS via Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA). The BYNDS was administered to a sample of 832 drivers aged from 18 to 25 years (Argentina = 270, Colombia = 350, and Mexico = 212). Six models were examined: three derived from previous literature, one emerged from an exploratory factor analysis, a unidimensional model, and a bifactor model. Results showed that none of the models analysed offered a completely acceptable fit to the data. However, the original model hypothesizing five orthogonal factors showed the best fit indices, with all of the items loading onto the associated factor. Results of the bifactor analysis suggested that three of the subscales (transient violations, fixed violations, and misjudgements) share a strong common basis and their scores would not offer much information above and beyond the total score. On the contrary, the items in the subscale of risk-exposure are clearly influenced by a specific domain factor, contributing to the multidimensionality of the BYNDS. In line with previous studies, males scored higher than females in driving violations, fixed violations, and risk-exposure. This study contributes to the psychometric refinement of a novel measure of risky driving in youth population. This self-report could be a valuable tool in the evaluation of road safety performance.",1369-8478,Not found

Ecological interface design effectively reduces cognitive workload – The example of HMIs for speed control,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.009,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"This paper aims to demonstrate that ecological interface design reduces the use of cognitive resources. Making the boundaries of acceptable performance visually perceivable should elicit skill-based behavior, thus lowering the cognitive load. To illustrate the psychological mechanisms of ecological interface design and validate its influence on cognitive load, we compared a conventional speedometer to an ecological speedometer. Both interfaces were displayed on the head-up display of a static driving simulator and were tested in a rural highway scenario. In a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated-measure design, the human–machine interface was tested along with the informative intelligent speed assistance system (representing an existing alternative for speed control) and the additional workload induced by a 1-back task (representing cognitively demanding driving situations). To measure cognitive load, we used a tactile version of the detection response task and controlled for all confounding variables. The experiment was conducted with 28 male and 21 female drivers. Our hypotheses and the ecological interface design theory are supported by the finding that the ecological speedometer reduces the use of cognitive resources. Moreover, the specific application of the ecological speedometer enables better driving performance (i.e., longitudinal and lateral control) compared to a conventional speedometer.",1369-8478,Not found
"Safety equipment use and crash involvement among cyclists – Behavioral adaptation, precaution or learning?",10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.002,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The present study has investigated relationships between cyclists’ safety equipment use, crash involvement, and other safety relevant behavior. The main focus is on relationships that indicate either behavioral adaptation (safety equipment use leads to riskier behavior) or precautionary behavior (safety equipment is used for cycling in risky situations). Three consecutive surveys were conducted in 2015, 2016, and 2017 years among 650 Norwegian cyclists. Most items were dichotomized and analyzed with logistic regression models. In contrast to the behavioral adaptation hypothesis, regular use of safety equipment (bicycle lights, high-visibility clothing, and helmets) was found to be negatively related to some types of high-risk behavior (listening to music and taking chances while cycling). Regular use of bicycle lights and high-visibility clothing is also negatively related to collision involvement. Safety equipment use was found to be positively related to regular winter cycling and cycling in mixed traffic (not on sidewalks), and it is most likely used as a precautionary measure in such situations. Some cyclists learn from crash involvement by starting to use safety equipment after a crash, but the results do not indicate that crash involvement deters from cycling. The main conclusion from the study is that recommending, promoting or even mandating safety equipment for cyclists can be expected to improve safety and that behavioral adaptation is not likely to occur, at least not to an extent that will outweigh the positive safety effects. The results do not support reservations against the use of “sporty” (well-equipped) models in campaigns for promoting cycling.",1369-8478,Not found

The study sample comprised 973 older drivers (65+ years) living in Perth, Western Australia. Information was collected on socio-demographic characteristics, health, cognitive function, driving-related characteristics and driving cessation. Descriptive and univariate statistics were undertaken to assess differences between drivers with and without suspected MCI. Multivariate logistic regression models examined the association between socio-demographic/driving-related characteristics and plans to cease driving. Increasing age (adjusted OR: 1.75, 95% CI = 1.22–2.50, p < 0.01), living alone (adjusted OR: 1.61, 95% CI = 1.09–2.38, p = 0.02), “suggestion to stop or limit driving in the past year” (adjusted OR: 5.07, 95% CI = 1.09–23.57, p = 0.04) and thinking it was “not important to continue driving” (adjusted OR: 4.80, 95% CI = 1.93–11.95, p < 0.01) were significantly associated with plans to cease driving.

In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing traffic measures in Beijing and analyse the underlying factors from the perspective of drivers, which provide insights for the traffic regulations in other cities worldwide. While the car ownership restriction has effectively limited the total number of vehicle in Beijing, the effect of the car use restriction only lasts for a short period. A survey on drivers’ opinions and attitudes towards the traffic situation and a potential measure, i.e., tradable driving credit (TDC), is conducted. Although traffic data shows that congestion improved and traffic was slightly congested in recent years in Beijing, most respondents believe congestion is still serious in Beijing. However, they think the impact of traffic congestion on their personal car use is relatively low, which could partly explain why so many travellers still depend on driving given the relative convenient transit facilities in Beijing. In addition, a large proportion of respondents treat personal cars as a representation of social status and think driving bring them pleasures, which indicates that it may be hard to further decrease the share of car trips in Beijing. According to their attitudes and social-economical characters, respondents’ willingness on their changes of travel behaviours under TDC is investigated. The results show that individuals’ social-economic characters such as income level, education and family size and the symbolic meaning of personal cars have significant influence on respondents’ willingness to switch to other transport modes.",1369-8478,Not found
Analysis of the factors affecting drivers’ queue-jumping behaviors in China,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.008,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"In China, drivers’ queue-jumping behaviors are very common. To explore the factors affecting drivers’ queue-jumping, first, a driving attitude scale, a risk perception scale and a queue-jumping behavior scale were designed, and an existing Type A behavior pattern scale and a driver skill scale were also introduced. Second, these scales were used to collect empirical data, and 202 valid samples were obtained. Third, the reliability and validity of the developed scales were verified, and a structural equation model of drivers’ queue-jumping behaviors was established to explore the interrelationships among the Type A personality trait, cognitions (including attitudes and risk perception), driver skills (including driving skill and safety motivation) and queue-jumping behaviors. The results showed that drivers’ cognitions significantly affected their queue-jumping behaviors; specifically, drivers’ attitudes toward queue-jumping and traffic violations positively correlated with their queue-jumping behaviors (β = 0.323, t = 3.470; β = 0.277, t = 3.072), while drivers’ risk perception toward queue-jumping negatively correlated with their queue-jumping behaviors (β = −0.297, t = −3.889). Drivers’ driving skill and safety motivation also significantly affected their queue-jumping behaviors (β = 0.198, t = 2.385; β = −0.355, t = −4.101).

Road user interactions in a shared space setting: Priority and communication in a UK car park,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.004,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Appropriate communication between road users can lead to safe and efficient interactions in mixed traffic. Understanding how road users communicate can support the development of effective communication methods for automated vehicles. We carried out observations of 66 pedestrian-driver and 124 driver-driver interactions in a shared space setting. Specific actions and reactions of the road users involved were recorded using a novel observation protocol. Overall, results showed that pedestrians’ failure to look towards a driver created the greatest uncertainty in the interaction, with the driver slowing down, but not completely stopping, in response to pedestrians. Looking towards the driver also influenced which road user took priority in driver-driver interactions. Groups of pedestrians were more likely to be given priority than an individual pedestrian, and the use of vehicle-based signals were also associated with taking priority during an interaction. Our observations show the importance of non-verbal communication during road user interactions, highlighting it as an essential area of research in the development of automated vehicles, to allow their safe, cooperative, interactions with other road users. Observations were made on a limited number of interactions to inform challenges facing future automated vehicles. Further work should therefore be done to corroborate and extend our findings, to examine interactions between human road users and automated vehicles in shared space settings.",1369-8478,Not found

Inspired by the idea in text mining, this paper proposes a topic-based two-stage SFSB data mining algorithm to understand the SFSB user’s travel behavior and to discover city functional regions. A region, a function and human mobility patterns are treated as a document, a topic and words, respectively. Then, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is featured by a distribution of mobility patterns. The point-of-interest data is combined to annotate the clustered regions to discover the real functions. At last, the proposed method is tested using 14-day SFSB data in Beijing and the results are estimated by the Satellite Map data. The proposed methods and the results can be applied to infer the individual’s travel purpose through functional regions and to improve land-use planning, etc.",1369-8478,Not found
Examining human attitudes toward shared mobility options and autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.001,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of people’s attitudes toward shared mobility options and autonomous vehicles (AVs), with a focus on the underlying patterns and potential determinants.

A structural equations model was developed to identify latent attitudinal factors and examine the correlations between the latent attitudes (as the endogenous variables) and the observed covariates (including the socio-economic and demographic characteristics, and users’ current mobility profile, such as mode use frequency, travel distance, and trip fare). The model identified eleven latent factors that represent various aspects of attitudes toward AVs and shared mobility options. The findings could be used by policymakers and Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) to a) recognize the users’ latent attitudes, b) understand the underlying patterns of attitudes, c) implement plans and policies more efficiently, d) guide or influence users’ perceptions, and e) enhance travel behavior models. This study lays the foundation for further analysis on understanding user acceptance and adoption of these emerging mobility options, which is essential to estimate the likelihood and magnitude of behavior shifts in the era of automated, connected and shared mobility.",1369-8478,Not found
Abiding by the law when it does not exist: The case of the helmet bicycle law,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.010,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"To improve the safety of bicycle users, some countries have enacted, or considered enacting, mandatory helmet legislation. Of course, the enactment of such legislation in a country assumes that its citizens will be well-informed of it, and consequently, will use the helmet more frequently than before. However, in the survey described in this paper we found that many people are not aware of the legislation in force in their own country, or, even if they know, they may not necessarily behave as dictated by the law. Thus, the effects of mandatory helmet legislation may be somewhat different than desired or expected. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to ascertain the role of cyclists’ knowledge of the law in their country as a mediator between the law and the actual use of the helmet. Respondents from seventeen countries participated in an international survey about cyclists' habits, and answered questions about helmet legislation, and frequency of helmet use. The results indicate that the main effect of mandatory helmet legislation on the frequency of use of the helmet is mediated by the perception that such a law exists in their country—even when in fact sometimes it does not exist.",1369-8478,Not found
Modelling the influence of time pressure on reaction time of drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.017,72,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Speeding is a major traffic violation and time pressure is one of the leading contributors to speeding. High-speed driving requires an immediate response to perilous events from the driver to avoid a crash. Reaction time is one of the important driving performance measures to assess the driver’s response to the event. Therefore, the current study examined the influence of time pressure on reaction times of the drivers measured for two different perilous events (pedestrians crossing and obstacle overtaking). Eighty-five Indian licensed drivers participated in a driving simulation study designed for three different time pressure conditions: No Time Pressure (NTP), Low Time Pressure (LTP), and High Time Pressure (HTP). The survival analysis technique was used to model the effect of time pressure and driver characteristics with reaction times of the drivers. It was observed that drivers’ reaction times decreased by 18% and 9% in LTP and 28% and 16% in HTP during the pedestrians crossing and obstacle overtaking events, respectively. Further, 1 m/second increase in approach speed resulted in 2% and 4% reduction in reaction times of the drivers in pedestrians crossing and obstacle overtaking events, respectively. Young drivers responded 21% faster than mature drivers during the pedestrians crossing event. Interestingly, sleeping hours and physical fitness played an important role in driver’s reaction to the events. The drivers performing regular physical exercise and having minimum eight-hours of overnight sleep reacted 16% and 17% earlier in pedestrians crossing and obstacle overtaking events, respectively. The overall findings from this study showed enhanced stimulus-response behaviour of the drivers under time pressure driving conditions. The results obtained from the study can give new insight into various safety-related ITS applications.",1369-8478,Not found
"“They would call me, and I would need to know because it is like life and death”: A qualitative examination of the acceptability of smartphone applications designed to reduce mobile phone use while driving",10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.007,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Distracted driving is one of the most prevalent risky behaviours worldwide. Research has highlighted that current approaches to distracted driving based on education and police enforcement have shown low effectiveness. Smartphone applications to reduce distracted driving are an emerging technology with the potential to prevent road crashes. However, recent evidence has shown that the adoption of these applications has been limited. A qualitative study was carried out to investigate the acceptability of smartphone applications that are designed to prevent distracted driving. A total of 35 drivers (57% females) aged 19–44 years (Mean = 28.43) participated in interviews which explored acceptability constructs for in-vehicle intelligent technology as defined by Regan et al. (2012): usefulness, usability, effectiveness, social acceptability, affordability, and willingness to use the application functions. Generally, drivers perceived that these applications have the potential to increase safety and reduce voluntary and involuntary mobile phone interactions while driving. Nonetheless, it was also found that drivers want to retain some of the functionalities of their mobile phone, such as music playing applications, accessing GPS/maps and being able to interact with certain groups of people through their phones while driving. Finally, barriers to the uptake of the applications among drivers who use their mobile phone while driving are discussed. A frequent barrier that needs to be overcome is the perceived need and pressure to respond to their phone while driving to communicate for work purposes or with people with strong social ties to the driver, for example, a parent or spouse.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors explaining driver yielding behaviour towards pedestrians at courtesy crossings,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.006,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Courtesy crossings are pedestrian crossing facilities where drivers are not legally required to stop for pedestrians, but are encouraged to do so by design elements such as stripes, coloured or textured road surfaces, visual narrowings of the carriageway, and ramps. There is little empirical evidence on drivers' behaviour or guidance on how to design these crossings. This paper analysed data for 937 interactions between drivers and pedestrians at 20 crossings across England, comparing driver yielding behaviour at courtesy crossings and at zebras (marked unsignalised crossings, where drivers are legally required to stop); and identifying the design elements associated with yielding behaviour at courtesy crossings. The analysis controlled for crossing stage; characteristics and situation of pedestrians and vehicles; characteristics of the road and site; and time context. Driver yielding behaviour was analysed for each separate traffic lane that pedestrians need to cross. We found that all four design elements considered (stripes, coloured/textured surface, visual narrowing, and ramps) increased the propensity of the first vehicle to stop and of any vehicle to stop. A before-after analysis then showed that adding a new element (stripes) to a courtesy crossing led to an increase in yielding rates from 20% to 97%. Overall, we found evidence supporting the use of multiple design elements in courtesy crossings. We discuss the implications of these findings for transport policy and urban design.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors associated with red-light running among motorcyclists at signalised junctions in Malaysia,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.013,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Red-light running (RLR) among motorcyclists at signalised junctions (SJ) in Malaysia are common. This study investigates factors associated with RLR among motorcyclists at signalised junctions. The observation was conducted in 2016–2017, at 26 signalised junctions nationwide, and was analysed using the mixed-effect logistic regression. Out of the 53,475 observed vehicles, only 3.6% run the red light (by which 99% are motorcycles), and from the 19,232 observed motorcycles, 26.2% among motorcyclists run the red light while 54.1% of them, run the red-light without stopping. Factors associated with a high probability of RLR are male riders who do not wear a helmet, who approach the SJ via lane split, who cross SJ via turning, SJ with no traffic island, and SJ with the presence of vehicles waiting on one or both legs. The random parameters show that the majority (83%) of variation in the outcomes occurs among the riders (at Level 1), which suggest that motorcyclists’ characteristics and riding behaviour are still the main factors in affecting the RLR occurrences and require more in-depth study. While 1.5% of variation occurs among the type of motorcycle by region (at Level 2), it also shows that RLR occurs regardless. Other variations are from the range of median width (3.9% at Level 3) and the speed limit range along major roads (9.5% at Level 4). To reduce RLR among motorcyclists, we are recommending that SJ be equipped with traffic islands, and replace the overhead signal pole with pedestal pole.",1369-8478,Not found
Safe on the road – Does Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems Use affect Road Risk Perception?,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.011,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"A major goal of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) deployment is higher road safety. However, these systems are only as safe as users handle them. This article presents a study evaluating the links between the use of ADAS and road risk perception. 101 drivers were invited to evaluate accident probability and risk controllability and to indicate whether they were using ADAS or not. Results show that the use of ADAS decreases perceived accident probability and increases perceived controllability for risky driving situations. Since the degree of automation in ADAS is still low nowadays, it is important to discuss the importance of human factors for the purpose of a safer implementation.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of cognitive functioning on driving performance of older persons in comparison to younger age groups: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.009,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Older drivers are at a severely higher risk for motor vehicle crash involvement. Due to the global aging of the population, this increased crash risk has a significant impact on society, as well as on an older individual’s quality of life. For this reason, there is a need for understanding how normal age-related changes in cognition and underlying brain dynamics impact driving performance to identify the functional and neurophysiological biomarkers that could be used to design strategies to preserve or improve safe driving behavior in older persons. This review provides an overview of the literature on age-related changes in cognitive functioning and brain dynamics that impact driving simulator performance of healthy persons. A systematic literature search spanning the last ten years was conducted, resulting in 22 eligible studies. Results indicated that various aspects of cognition, most importantly executive function, complex attention, and dual tasking, were associated with driving performance, irrespective of age. However, there was a distinct age-related decline in cognitive and driving performance. Older persons had a more variable, less consistent driving simulator performance, such as more variable speed adaptation or less consistent lane keeping behavior. Only a limited number of studies evaluated the underlying brain dynamics in driving performance. Therefore, future studies should focus on implementing neuroimaging techniques to further unravel the neural correlates of driving performance.",1369-8478,Not found
Cross-cultural perspective of driving style in young adults: Psychometric evaluation through the analysis of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.010,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Self-evaluating methods are frequently used to identify driving styles. Among others, one of the most commonly used questionnaires is the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI), developed for the Israeli population. Because of the extensive use of the questionnaire, the present paper aims to validate an Italian version and to confirm the 8-factor structure of the original one, i.e, dissociative, anxious, risky, angry, high-velocity, distress-reduction, patient, and careful driving style. The Italian version of the MDSI was filled out by 561 Italian drivers, who had a driving license for at least 1 year. A confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) was conducted on the 44-item of the translated questionnaire showing not so good values of the goodness of fit tests (SRMR = 0.085; RMSEA = 0.063). The total-item correlation of each scale indicated that 4 items had a low index of total-item correlation. A second CFA was conducted on the remaining 40 items: goodness fit parameters improved (SRMR = 0.0685, RMSEA = 0.0584). Previous validations of the original version of MDSI for different populations (Argentine, Romanian, Chinese, Malaysian, Butch and Belgian) showed several critical issues in confirming the original structure. In the Italian version of MDSI validated in the present paper, the original 8-factor structure was confirmed by removing the 4 items which did not properly contribute to the factors. The results not only confirmed the usefulness of the MDSI in assessing driving style but they also indicated that the concept of driving style is considered in the same way in Italy and Israel, even though traffic rules are different. The latter consideration raises interesting questions for future research concerning cross-cultural comparisons of driving behavior in different countries.",1369-8478,Not found
Barriers to children's walking to school in Iranian and Chinese samples,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.008,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Factors that contribute to children’s walking to school have been investigated in previous research, which primarily focussed on socio-economic variables in high income countries. There is a general lack of studies which have examined mode choice differences on school trips in low and middle income countries. Focusing on parental social cognitive variables in addition to household socio-economic characteristics, the present study is among the first to compare barriers to children’s walking in daily commuting to schools across samples from two middle income countries: Iran and China. A self-administered questionnaire was devised and distributed among primary school pupils (7–9 years old) in Mashhad, Iran and Nanjing, China. The children were asked to take the questionnaires to their parents to complete and return the filled forms. A total of 671 (response rate of 90 percent) and 224 (response rate of 82 percent) completely filled questionnaires were returned in Mashhad and Nanjing, respectively. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed that parents in Mashhad perceived higher risk and reported more worry of children being involved in road crashes when walking to school. Analyses revealed more safety favourable parental attitudes in the Chinese sample, compared to the Iranian sample. Parental attitudes towards transport safety were safer in the sample from Nanjing as compared to Mashhad. Hierarchical binary logistic regression showed that walking time from home to school and parental worry about road crashes were negatively associated with children’s walking to school in both samples. In the Iranian sample, results suggested that while householdcar ownership and higher family income were associatedwith a decreased probability that a child walk to school, the total number of children in the household increased the probability of walking to school.",1369-8478,Not found
Contributory factors to sleepiness amongst London bus drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.012,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Driver sleepiness contributes to a substantial proportion of all road crashes. Despite all that is known about driver sleepiness, bus drivers are often overlooked. What is certain is that bus drivers have the potential to suffer from sleepiness as they are shift workers. The current research used a large online survey to investigate sleepiness amongst London bus drivers. There were two aims; to quantify the prevalence of sleepiness amongst London bus drivers, and to determine the factors which contributed to sleepiness. Overall, 20.8% of respondents indicated that they had to fight sleepiness at least 2–3 times a week, and 36.6% of respondents stated that they had experienced a close call due to sleepiness in the past year. There were several potential causes of sleepiness including work, sleep, and personal factors such as obtaining less than 11 h rest between shifts, working 6 or more days without a rest day, and poor self-reported health. These findings show that sleepiness is common amongst London bus drivers and is caused by a combination of factors. The combination of contributory factors suggests that a multifaceted approach should be taken to reduce bus driver sleepiness.",1369-8478,Not found

This research examined the effectiveness of current and future potential countermeasures from an end-user perspective by means of interviews and a focus group with smartphone users. Four broad countermeasure categories were identified from a countermeasures review: behavioural; legislation/regulation; infrastructure initiatives and technology advances. Overall it was found that no single countermeasure category was perceived by end-users to be fully effective in removing the road safety risk of smartphone use by pedestrians, but rather an integrated approach that combines elements such as pedestrian infrastructure separation, publicity, legislation and a shared responsibility for safety amongst all road users, was deemed to be the most promising solution.

Mobility as a service and sustainable travel behaviour: A thematic analysis study,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.004,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a novel brand of transport that promises to replace private cars with multimodal personalised mobility packages enabled by a digital platform capable of integrating travel planning, booking and ticketing, and real-time information services. It is an intervention that through its digitisation, connectivity, information and sharing merits intends to inspire and support the transition to a more sustainable mobility paradigm. Recent research suggests, however, that the potential uptake of MaaS might not be overwhelming; current car drivers could face considerable difficulties in bypassing their personal car for it and, more worryingly, future MaaS users may substitute not only personal car trips but also public transport journeys with car-sharing and ride-sharing services. This means that MaaS might not be able to create travel behaviour change, and even if it does, the changes may not be always towards the right direction. Through conducting 40 semi-structured interviews in three different UK cities, namely London, Birmingham and Huddersfield, and employing a robust Thematic Analysis approach, this study explores the factors underpinning the uptake and potential success of MaaS as a sustainable travel mechanism. The challenges and opportunities reflecting and affecting potential for responsible MaaS usage refer to five core themes Car Dependence; Trust; Human Element Externalities; Value; and Cost, each of them with distinctive and diverse dimensions. Policy-makers and mobility providers should realise that MaaS success relies on changing people’s attitudes to private cars (something very challenging) and thus they should incentivise responsible MaaS use, promote public transport as its backbone, use public engagement exercises and trials to expose people to the concept and somewhat demonise private car ownership and car use.",1369-8478,Not found

The results revealed positive and significant relationships between preoccupation, self-sufficiency, value of parental authority and parental interference, and trait driving anger. Furthermore, a SEM-based multiple mediation analysis showed that both trait general anger and self-esteem significantly mediated the relationship between preoccupation and trait driving anger, and self-sufficiency and trait driving anger, with a medium effect size (f 2 = 0.16).

A frequently used model to understand walking behavior is Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior, and its extension, the Expanded Theory of Planned Behavior. Although this topic is widely investigated across the world, it is understudied in Brazilian culture. This study reports the psychological determinants of walking behavior in three Brazilian cities, indicating which theoretical model better fits the data: The Theory of Planned Behavior versus Extended Theory of Planned Behavior. Some 3296 residents of Distrito Federal, Florianópolis and Porto Alegre answered a 10-item scale. The face-to-face questionnaires were conducted in the participants’ residence. Most of the respondents were women, with age ranging from 18 to 101 years old. Structural Equation Modeling indicated the Theory of Planned Behavior be more powerful to explain walking behavior than the Expanded Theory of Planned Behavior. Perceived behavioral control and intention were the best predictors of walking.

This paper validates the Safety ladder approach in empirical research by comparing safety structure, safety culture and accident risk for trucking companies. The study has four aims: 1) To map the safety structure at the different levels of the Safety ladder, 2) Examine whether safety culture is improved with increased structural measures at each Safety ladder level, 3) Examine whether the accident risk decreases at each Safety ladder level, and 4) Discuss practical implications. The study is based on survey data (N = 533) from 17 companies at different levels of the Safety ladder, a Reference sample, and qualitative interviews (N = 30) with management and employee representatives in the companies. Based on the interviews, we describe the safety structural measures at each level of the Safety ladder. Survey results indicate increasing safety culture scores at each level of the Safety ladder, while the accident risk decreases. The safety culture level was 12 points higher at Level 4, than in the Reference sample, and the accident risk at Level 4 was half the risk of Level 2.

Exploring psychological factors of mobile phone use while riding among motorcyclists in Vietnam,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.023,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Mobile phone use while riding is one of the five most common risky behaviors of motorcycle riders in Vietnam. This study investigated motorcyclist’s mobile phone use while riding intention and behavior based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework. Based on this framework, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, habits, and health motivation underlying the rider’s mobile phone use while riding intentions and behavior were included in a questionnaire and captured by direct and indirect measurements. Small-displacement motorcycle riders (N = 291) completed the extended TPB based questionnaire. An exploratory factor analysis technique identified the selected factors (e.g., attitude, habit, etc.). Moreover, Structural Equation Modeling results showed moderate to good fits to the observed data. Therefore, the results supported the utilization of extended TPB framework in identifying factors of mobile phone use while riding intention and behavior. Specifically, negative attitude, perceived behavioral control, and mobile phone use while riding habit related to the intention to use a mobile phone while riding of small-displacement motorcyclists. Meanwhile, habit and behavioral intention related to the behavior to use a mobile phone while riding of small-displacement motorcycle riders. Especially, the correlation between behavioral intention and self-reported behavior was very strong. This finding embraced previous research indicating that intention was a major motivational component of behavior.

This requires the previous learning of cognitive rules and heuristics. The acquisition of safer cognitive heuristics depends on previous experience and adequate feedback to our responses. The first aim of this research was to analyze the effect of negative feedback on risk evaluation and decision processes in dangerous and harmless driving contexts. The second aim was to demonstrate the influence of prior experience upon the process of decision-making and feedback, comparing individuals with and without driving experience. One hundred and three participants (with and without driving license) were required to evaluate a set of 120 driving images with respect to the risk level of the situations and decide whether to brake or not. Half of the participants received negative feedback. The results showed that decisions were faster and more accurate than evaluations, and both were improved by the effect of feedback and previous experience in risk situations. However, the same feedback resulted in inaccurate risk evaluations and decisions in harmless situations. The cognitive processes underlying these effects point to a response bias rather than to discriminative factors. These results clarify the effect of negative feedback and previous experience on different phases of the decision-making process, showing the importance of these factors for the automatic processes and cognitive heuristics implied in driving. Our findings have potentially important applied value in the promotion of safe driving practices.",1369-8478,Not found

The findings show that the TPB explained up to 24% of the variance in intention to comply with speed limits. Drivers’ attitude emerged as the most significant predictor and strongest correlate with intentions to comply with the speed limit in both work and private vehicle. Further analysis revealed participants had a higher intention to comply with speed limits in their work than private vehicle. Also, investigation of the relationship between TPB variables and observed speeding behaviour suggests that participants with higher intention to comply with the speed limit or high perceived behavioural control (PBC), exceeded the speed limit less often than those with lower intention to comply with the speed limit or low PBC. The findings have important theoretical and applied implications for development of better speed limit compliance interventions to improve driving behaviour, and road safety in general.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of explanation types and perceived risk on trust in autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.021,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Despite technological advances, trust still remains as a major issue facing autonomous vehicles. Existing studies have reported that explanations of the status of automation systems can be an effective strategy to increase trust, but these effects can differ depending on the forms of explanations and autonomous driving situations. To address this issue, this study examines the effects of explanation types and perceived risk on trust in autonomous vehicles. Three types of explanations (i.e., no, simple, and attributional explanations) are designed based on attribution theory. Additionally, four autonomous driving situations with different levels of risk are designed based on a simulator program. Results show that explanation type significantly affects trust in autonomous vehicles, and the perceived risk of driving situations significantly moderates the effect of the explanation type. At a high level of perceived risk, attributional explanations and no explanations lead to the lowest and highest values in trust, respectively. However, at a low level of perceived risk, these effects reverse.",1369-8478,Not found
Buying an electric car: A rational choice or a norm-directed behavior?,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.009,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The diffusion of electric cars can contribute to more sustainability in the transport sector, but diffusion rates in most countries are still low. We investigated motives for electric car adoption in German households from an environmental psychology perspective. The public debate focuses on rational aspects such as the purchase price or new technological demands (e.g., limited range and a new charging system). Psychological research on energy-related investment decisions in households confirms the relevance of rational motives, but additionally points to the importance of norm-directed motives (moral and social norms). We investigated the relevance of different motives in an online questionnaire with n = 220 members of German households interested in buying a new car. The questionnaire included possible rational and norm-related predictors of electric car adoption. We tested three action models to explain adoption intention: An adjusted technology acceptance model (TAM), an adjusted norm activation model (NAM), and an integrative model with predictors from both models. We analyzed the hypothesized models with path analyses. All models explained a substantial share of variance in adoption intention. The explained share of variance in the NAM was higher than in the TAM and comparably high to the integrative model. The results demonstrate the important role of moral and social motives for households’ investment decisions. Additionally, the technology’s perceived usefulness was an important rational motive. We discuss the context dependency of the results, as household members might have little knowledge about the new technology during the early stages of a technology’s diffusion process. The results strongly suggest broadening political support schemes, such as informational and image campaigns, as a way to more effectively foster electric car diffusion. More comprehensive assessments appear to be necessary in future analyses of electric car adoption as well as energy-related investment decisions.",1369-8478,Not found

Therefore, we conducted a semi-naturalistic cycling study with 56 participants where a 10 km long, pre-defined route was individually cycled while 36 signals (visual, auditory and vibro-tactile) were transmitted. The participants signalled the perception of a signal by pressing a button. Response rates differed significantly between signal modalities. While auditory signals performed best closely followed by vibro-tactile signals, visual signals were frequently missed. The route type had an effect on the perception of the signals. The influence of the route segments with haptic interference was not expected to be this large on the perception of vibro-tactile signals. The obtained results indicate how and in which situations the different modalities are suited to transmit information to cyclists.",1369-8478,Not found
Modeling the interaction between vehicle yielding and pedestrian crossing behavior at unsignalized midblock crosswalks,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.019,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The interaction between pedestrians and vehicles is an inevitable phenomenon at unsignalized midblock crosswalks. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between vehicle yielding and pedestrian gap acceptance (VY and PGA). A microscopic traffic flow model was established to describe the interaction and explores its effect on traffic flow. The VY and PGA behaviors were converged into the proposed model. The proposed model was accomplished in a time step simulation. The results stability and descriptive power of the proposed model were analyzed. The proposed model was also validated using empirical data. The effects of the traffic and geometric factors on the operation of the unsignalized midblock crosswalks were discussed based on numerical experiments. Accordingly, the recommendations on choosing the proper control mode of midblock crosswalks (unsignalized or signalized) were proposed.",1369-8478,Not found
Toward a greater understanding of Colombian professional truck drivers’ safety performance,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.006,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"In this investigation involving 227 lone professional truck drivers from a national transportation company in a low and moderate-income country (LMIC), Colombia, a multidimensional model of drivers’ safety performance and expectations concerning how safety performance dimensions would predict hard braking were evaluated. The results supported a multidimensional conceptualization of professional truck drivers’ safety performance, with factors aligned with confirmed general safety performance factors and occupation-specific factors. Furthermore, results supported the expectation that the dimensions associated with communicating safety information and complying with laws and regulations would predict hard braking over and above less conceptually relevant safety performance dimensions such as using personal protective equipment and preparing to drive, safety climate, and region of operation. Notably, a dimension of safety performance expected to promote workplace safety, the communication of health and safety information, was associated with increased hard braking. We discuss the implications of a multidimensional conceptualization and measure of safety performance for studying workplace safety for professional truck drivers in Colombian organizations and beyond.",1369-8478,Not found
The interactive effect of vehicle signals and sensation-seeking on driver hazard perception,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.018,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Does sensation seeking—as a personality trait that is closely related to risky driving—affect a driver's hazard perception, and if so, under what circumstances? Using hazard locations and vehicle signals as cues, this study classifies traffic situations into four types: danger ahead with cues, danger ahead without cues, danger behind with cues, and danger behind without cues. Based on these classifications, we examine the characteristics of hazard perception, decision-making criteria, sensitivity, and visual attention patterns of drivers with different sensation-seeking tendencies. Fifty-two experienced drivers were recruited for experiments in Dalian, China. Using computer, participants were shown videos taken from the driver's perspective and were asked to respond to hazards by pressing keys on the left mouse button. Their eye movements were recorded, and a multi-dimensional driving-style scale was used to divide participants into higher and lower sensation-seeking groups. The results showed that the higher sensation-seeking drivers had a lower hazard detection rate, fewer fixation counts, and shorter glances when there were cues, and they responded more slowly when there was danger ahead. For dangers ahead with cues and dangers behind without cues, the more attention the higher sensation-seeking drivers paid to the danger, the slower their response and the lower their hazard detection rate. The results indicated that higher sensation-seeking drivers have poor hazard perception in situations when there are vehicle signals as prompting clues and dangers ahead. In particular, for a danger with clues, the visual agility of the higher sensation-seeking drivers was worse than that of the lower sensation-seeking drivers. The more attention they paid to the danger the worse their hazard perception. The results of this study can provide guidance to teach drivers hazard-perception skills.",1369-8478,Not found
How gender differences and perceptions of safety shape urban mobility in Southeast Asia,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.014,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Despite numerous studies on how gender differences affect transport mobility choices and perception of safety, there has been little emphasis on the influence of spatial and socio-cultural constructs on it, particularly in the Southeast Asian context. This article investigates this relation through (1) an on-street survey involving 383 participants in eight neighbourhoods in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, (2) analysing videos taken with the walking with video approach, and (3) a computational analysis of the street network using space syntax. Findings suggest that a large proportion of women ascribed to negative perceptions of safety as compared to men. Negative perceptions of safety were related to wariness towards motorcycles in Jakarta and absence of other pedestrians and the image of the place in Kuala Lumpur. This difference can be attributed to distinctions in spatial configurations and socio-cultural constructs between both cities. Findings provide practical insights – mode segregation or changes to street design – to address gendered mobility for sustainable urban transport in the region.",1369-8478,Not found
Does online ticket booking system make people better off? An empirical study on railway service,10.1016/j.trf.2020.03.014,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The Spring Festival Travel Rush (SFTR) as the largest annual migration on earth has been a serious challenge for the railway system in China. In order to reduce the difficulty of ticket purchase, Chinese government has adopted information and communications technology (ICT) include online ticket booking system so that more ticket channels are available for passengers to choose from. However, whether the online ticket booking system in transportation can improve passengers’ well-being with the Spring Festival experience remains unknown. In this study, a structural equation model is developed to investigate the impact of online ticket booking system, socioeconomic status and perceived control on passengers’ well-being during SFTR. Results show that online ticket booking system has a direct positive influence on passengers’ well-being. In addition, the application of online ticket booking system and perceived control play an important mediating role between socioeconomic status and passengers’ well-being of Spring Festival. In particular, online ticket booking system had made it easier for people of lower socioeconomic status to purchase tickets and thus significantly raised their well-being.",1369-8478,Not found
Can infrastructure improvements mitigate unsafe traffic safety culture: A driving simulator study exploring cross cultural differences,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.022,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This paper presents the results of a cross-cultural study to investigate the influence of traffic safety culture and infrastructure improvements on driver behaviour. To achieve this, the driving style of UK drivers was compared with that of Nigerians with and without experience of driving in the UK. A driving simulator experiment compared the actual driving style of these three groups of drivers in different safety critical scenarios. The simulated road environment varied depending on how much infrastructure was provided (low or high infrastructure). In addition, the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire was used to collect self-reported data on violations, errors and lapses. It was hypothesised that Nigerian drivers with no experience of driving in a UK road system would report and engage in more unsafe driving behaviour compared to the other two groups, and that increasing infrastructure would have little positive benefit. Overall, the results supported these hypotheses, indicating that the behaviours of drivers are interpretable in relation to their traffic safety culture, compared to changes in their driving environment.",1369-8478,Not found
The effects of age on the contributions of head and eye movements to scanning behavior at intersections,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.015,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The current study was aimed at evaluating the effects of age on the contributions of head and eye movements to scanning behavior at intersections. When approaching intersections, a wide area has to be scanned requiring large lateral head rotations as well as eye movements. Prior research suggests older drivers scan less extensively. However, due to the wide-ranging differences in methodologies and measures used in prior research, the extent to which age-related changes in eye or head movements contribute to these deficits is unclear. Eleven older (mean 67 years) and 18 younger (mean 27 years) current drivers drove in a simulator while their head and eye movements were tracked. Scans, analyzed for 15 four-way intersections in city drives, were split into two categories: eye-only (consisting only of eye movements) and head + eye (containing both head and eye movements). Older drivers made smaller head + eye scans than younger drivers (46.6° vs. 53°), as well as smaller eye-only scans (9.2° vs. 10.1°), resulting in overall smaller all-gaze scans. For head + eye scans, older drivers had both a smaller head and a smaller eye movement component. Older drivers made more eye-only scans than younger drivers (7 vs. 6) but fewer head + eye scans (2.1 vs. 2.7). This resulted in no age effects when considering all-gaze scans. Our results clarify the contributions of eye and head movements to age-related deficits in scanning at intersections, highlight the importance of analyzing both eye and head movements, and suggest the need for older driver training programs that emphasize the importance of making large scans before entering intersections.",1369-8478,Not found
Modelling heterogeneity in behavioral response to peak-avoidance policy utilizing naturalistic data of Beijing subway travelers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.016,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Studies of travelers’ response behavior to transportation demand management is receiving substantial attention among researchers and transport operators in recent years. While previous studies in this area have generally assumed that the sensitivity of travelers to different factors is homogeneous and relies on survey responses, which may be prone to self-reporting errors and/or subject to behavioral incongruence. Relying on naturalistic data, this paper aims to investigate the behavioral response to pre-peak discount pricing strategy in the context of the Beijing subway with a special focus on the heterogeneity among the travelers. Anonymous smart card data from 5946 travelers before and after the introduction of a peak avoidance policy in Beijing are used to construct a latent class choice model to capture the sensitivity to different factors and the associated taste heterogeneity of travelers. Given the passive nature of the data, the model can offer more realistic outputs. The results indicate that there is substantial heterogeneity in travelers’ responses to the peak avoidance policy, and that they can be probabilistically allocated to four latent classes. For all classes of travelers, the decision to shift their departure to off-peak is affected by the monetary saving, the required change in departure time and the frequency of travel, but in different magnitudes. In particular, only two classes of travelers (who exhibit lower standard-deviation in pre-intervention departure time) show significant sensitivity to price changes indicating that the discount policies are more likely to be effective for these groups. The rest of travelers are largely price insensitive – warranting the need for non-monetary incentives as opposed to fare discounts. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to innovatively apply the LCC framework to analyze travelers’ heterogeneous behavior using large-scale smart card data without socio-demographic information. The findings can provide guidance to the subway authority in devising differential peak avoidance policies targeted for different groups of users, which are likely to be more effective than the current ‘one size fits all’ approach.",1369-8478,Not found
A perception-based cognitive map of the pedestrian perceived quality of service on urban sidewalks,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.013,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"A better understanding of what walking entails is important in sustainable transportation planning. Recent research has shown that perceptions have a higher power to explain the quality of service (QoS) than objective measures have; the latter being typically used in the pedestrian level of service methodologies. Despite the existing research on perceptions and QoS in other transportation fields, very little information has been found in the literature that can explain a clear cognitive structure that defines the pedestrian QoS. In this research, we propose a cognitive map to make it possible to understand and explain pedestrian sidewalk QoS of a given infrastructure when walking, based on perceptions. We gathered the perceptions of 1056 pedestrians on-site, regarding the attributes (indicators) identified in the literature review in 30 locations in Bogotá, Colombia. Based on an Exploratory Factor Analysis, we developed a conceptual model through Structural Equation Modeling. We found that seven latent variables (LVs) (i.e., Sidewalk characteristics, Externalities, Surrounding, Discomfort, Bike hassles, Protection, and Amenities) interrelate to each other, forming a pedestrian cognitive map. QoS is directly explained by how pedestrians perceive the LVs sidewalk characteristics and surrounding and indirectly by the rest of LVs. The cognitive map shows three LVs related to the interaction between pedestrians and other transportation modes (i.e., externalities, discomfort, and bike hassles) that impact the perceived QoS negatively, and four LVs related to the interaction between pedestrians and different elements of the sidewalk (i.e., sidewalk characteristics, surrounding, amenities, and protection) that impact the perceived QoS positively. To understand pedestrian perceptions when walking and the path that these perceptions follow to develop a QoS perception provides an accurate tool by which to improve the QoS from the useŕs perspective, generating a new opportunity to provide better pedestrian facilities.",1369-8478,Not found
"The influence of alcohol (0.5‰) on the control and manoeuvring level of driving behaviour, finding measures to assess driving impairment: A simulator study",10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.017,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Objective The influence of psychoactive substances on driving performance and traffic safety has been extensively studied. Research on the influence of alcohol at the control level of behaviour (i.e. automated processes) has been well established and has shown that the ability to operate a vehicle decreases with rising alcohol levels. However, results one level higher at the manoeuvring level (i.e. conscious processes), are inconsistent. The current study aimed to replicate findings on the influence of alcohol on the control level of behaviour and investigate effects on the manoeuvring level in order to find suitable measures to assess driving impairment. Method The study was double-blind, placebo-controlled with a counterbalanced treatment order and a two-way crossover design. Thirty participants performed tasks in a driving simulator under the influence of alcohol (0.5‰) and a placebo. In the driving tasks the control level of behaviour (swerving, average speed, and speed variation) was investigated, as well as the manoeuvring level of behaviour (distance to other traffic during an overtaking manoeuvre, reaction time to a traffic light turning amber, and response to a suddenly merging car). Results As expected, alcohol affected the control level of behaviour negatively. Participants swerved more and showed more speed variation after alcohol intake. The manoeuvring level of driving behaviour was also affected by alcohol. The distance to other drivers during an overtaking manoeuvre was smaller under the influence of alcohol. Results on reaction time were however less straightforward. Reaction time increased significantly under the influence of alcohol when reacting to a traffic light but not in reaction to a car unexpectedly merging into traffic. When analysing behaviour in reaction to these different events in more detail it became clear that they were responded to in varying manners, making it difficult to find an average impairment measure. Conclusions The deteriorating effect of alcohol at the control level of driving behaviour was replicated, confirming the suitability of the standard deviation of lateral position and the variation in speed as measures of impairment. At the manoeuvring level, the kept distance to the leading car during an overtaking manoeuvre appeared to be a suitable measure to assess impairment as well as reaction time to a traffic light. The current study also confirms the difficulties in evaluating complex driving behaviour and the need for more research on this subject.",1369-8478,Not found
Influence of pedestrian-to-vehicle technology on drivers’ response and safety benefits considering pre-crash conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.012,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Pedestrian-to-vehicle (P2V) technology may offer a promising approach to reducing pedestrian crashes. However, its influences on both driver response and safety benefits have been little studied in previous research, particularly in regard to the variation of influences between different pre-crash scenarios. To investigate these influences, this study designed three pre-crash scenarios based on pedestrian crash contributing factors identified from crash reports, and collected 44 drivers’ driving simulator experiments’ data. The results clarified how using P2V technology to warn drivers of an impending collision improves safety by causing a series of changes for both brake operation and braking profile. These series of changes were further demonstrated to vary between scenarios. The study showed that P2V technology may be particularly useful in scenarios in which a pedestrian’s crossing intention is unclear; specifically, in this type of scenario, the P2V warning had changed the braking process from a panic brake of “slow reaction-hard brake” to a comfortable brake of “quick reaction-gentle brake.” In addition, the P2V warning may be less effective in “low-risk” level scenarios where a driver is confident that he/she can handle the situation through a more conservative evasive action and don’t need to react strongly to a warning. Moreover, depending on the pre-crash scenario, the P2V warning may be mostly beneficial for drivers who had a crash/citation in the past five years and working-aged drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Modelling the acceptance of fully autonomous vehicles: A media-based perception and adoption model,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.004,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"As the technology matures, fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) are on the corner. This calls for exploring the factors that might influence potential users’ perception and acceptance of AVs. Limited existing studies related to acceptance modeling investigated the effects of media and human on fully AVs’ beliefs. Hence, a media-based perception and adoption model (MPAM) is developed to investigate how information and opinion (from mass media and social media) affect human self-perception (including self-efficacy and subjective norms) and product value perception (including perceived usefulness and risks), which in turn drive users’ adoption intention to private AVs and public AVs as well. Through a questionnaire survey, 355 samples from two universities were collected in Beijing. The structural equation model results confirm that media channels have salient effects on consumer and product with different emphases. Mass media enhances potential users’ self-efficacy of fully AVs, while social media strengthens subjective norms. Both usefulness and risks of AVs are perceived simultaneously via mass media, whereas risks perception can be significantly eliminated by social media. All constructs of user’s self-perception and product perception are verified to drive users’ intention to using AVs and public AVs. Besides the theoretical and modeling contributions, practical implications are provided for the marketers and stakeholders in the early stages of AVs launch.",1369-8478,Not found
An intercept study of footbridge users and non-users in Malaysia,10.1016/j.trf.2020.05.011,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Road safety of vulnerable road users in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is a major concern. Footbridges or overpasses are pieces of infrastructure designed to allow pedestrians to cross safely. Although there is tension over whether footbridges are the most inclusive and sustainable way to support safe road crossing for vulnerable road users, footbridges are still a predominant piece of infrastructure in LMICs. Therefore, research aimed at optimising the use of footbridges could have an impact on the safety of vulnerable road users. The objective of the present study is to understand the motivational factors influencing pedestrian crossing decisions to use a footbridge in Malaysia. Additionally, the present study investigates the effectiveness of some proposed interventions to change the crossing behaviour of footbridge non-users. An intercept study was conducted in five major cities in Malaysia. Pedestrians answered questions regarding their perceptions about footbridges and previous walking experiences. The analysis was divided into two parts: Firstly, a decision tree analysis was conducted to study the relationship between the observed decision to use or not a footbridge and pedestrians’ perceptions about footbridges and experiences. Secondly, a decision tree analysis was used to identify the effectiveness of proposed countermeasures in increasing the footbridge usage among non-users. The findings showed that the footbridge height and the frequency of using it were associated with a decrease in the likelihood of utilising this structure. Being in a hurry was highly associated with crossing at the street level. In addition, footbridge non-users might change their behaviour if escalators or fences are provided as interventions. The results indicated that safety messages delivered through posters to alert footbridge non-users have the potential to sustain safe mobility. A user-centred approach is necessary to increase the usability of footbridges in LMICs.",1369-8478,Not found

However, the majority of injuries and fatalities occur disproportionately in low-income and medium-income countries. Previous studies have concluded that risky behaviours were the main contributing factor of traffic crashes. Turn signal neglect (TSN) when making a turn is one of those risky behaviours. Unfortunately, research on TSN has been very limited. This study investigates the prevalence of TSN-related crashes and factors affecting TSN among motorcyclists and car drivers. Data was obtained from self-administered questionnaires conducted in Vietnam. The findings showed that 17.54% of motorcyclists and 14.76% of car drivers have experienced at least one crash caused by their failure to turn signals in the last three years. Additionally, fewer years having a riding/driving license, longer daily travelling time, lower frequency of turn signal use, and having received a fine due to TSN were found to be positively associated with TSN-related crashes for both motorcyclists and car drivers. The findings highlight the importance of TSN for road safety and the need for authorities to develop more effective educational strategies and to increase traffic law enforcement.",1369-8478,Not found
Psychometric properties of the Driving Behaviour Scale (DBS) among polish drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.008,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Anxiety can negatively affect an individual’s psychological wellbeing and lead to mild-to-moderate functional impairment in various areas of their lives.

Although there have been a few studies examining the effect of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) on rider performance in developed countries, there has not been any research on the effect of BAC levels on motorcycle rider’s performance in developing countries. This study is attempted to evaluate the effect of low BAC levels (i.e., ≤0.05 g/dL or 0.05) on riding performance of motorcycle riders in Vietnam using an advanced motorcycle riding simulator. Thirty-four motorcycle riders aged 18–40 complete simulated rides on three BAC levels, namely 0.00, 0.02, and 0.05. Riding performance indicators are measured and compared at different BAC levels. These indicators include average speed, average lateral overtaking distance, brake reaction time, acceleration, deceleration, and frequency of lane change. At the level BAC = 0.02 or lower, the negative effects on the rider’s ability to control a motorcycle safely are statically insignificant. At the level BAC = 0.05, all the performances are impaired and the negative effects become statistically significant. In comparison of between novice participants and experienced participants at the same level of BAC, mean speed and acceleration rates of novice participants are significantly higher than the experienced participant. Based on the findings, the paper further discusses empirical relationships between reduced riding performances and road crash risk, and insights into drink-riding deterrence policy-making with regard to motorcycle riders.",1369-8478,Not found
Behavioral changes to repeated takeovers in automated driving: The drivers’ ability to transfer knowledge and the effects of takeover request process,10.1016/j.trf.2020.06.002,73,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Only a couple of studies evaluated whether drivers of automated vehicles change their takeover behavior when they experience takeover requests repeatedly. Even less evidence was accumulated regarding the question whether drivers are able to transfer learned behavior to takeover situations with varying visibility characteristics and whether drivers’ takeover behavior depends on the takeover process in these situations. This paper therefore examines three research questions. First, it assesses how drivers change their behavior with the repeated experience of a takeover situation with the same visibility (fog or no fog). Second, it tests whether drivers can transfer their learned takeover behavior from a takeover situation with high or low visibility to the same takeover situation with different visibility conditions. Third, it assesses whether drivers’ takeover behavior and their experience of the situation differ between a one-step and a two-step takeover request process. Forty participants experienced a takeover situation three times. Experimental trials varied between-subjects concerning the permanent presence or absence of fog in the adaptation condition, the change of visibility conditions from fog to no fog or vice versa in the transfer condition, and the design of the takeover process with one-step or two-steps. Dependent variables included participants’ takeover time, minimum time-to-collision (TTCmin) with the construction site, deceleration and maximum steering behavior, and their ratings of criticality of the driving situation and perceived effort. Results show that participants adapted their deceleration behavior when repeatedly experiencing a takeover situation with the same visibility characteristics (adaptation condition). Changing these characteristics (transfer condition) lead to increased minimum TTCs, criticality and perceived effort ratings. In general, participants were able to maintain their takeover behavior in takeover situations with varying visibility characteristics indicating that they can transfer their takeover behavior across situations. Finally, the two-step takeover request process was associated with longer takeover times. However, minimum TTCs were larger and maximum steering movements and criticality ratings were lower compared to the one-step process. We conclude that drivers transfer their behavior across takeover situations. However, this performance comes at higher costs in terms of perceived effort and criticality. In addition, two-step takeover request processes should be favored over one-step processes when designing takeover requests. Future studies should examine the validity of the results in various takeover situations and on-the-road studies.",1369-8478,Not found
Is it really too far? Overestimating walk time and distance reduces walking,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.009,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In this paper we use an intercept survey of 1,297 people at seven locations in New Jersey to answer three questions about perceived distances and walk times to nearby destinations. First, we seek to clarify conflicting results from the literature by asking: what factors are associated with perceived distance and walk times? Like other studies, we find that people overestimate both walk times and distances. We find that characteristics of the route matter. People are more likely to overestimate in car-dependent locations, along routes with many turns or barriers, or for destinations that are relatively closer. In terms of personal characteristics, experience walking and familiarity with the area both lead to lower estimates, while concerns about crime, getting lost, or carrying something heavy increase estimates. Next, we explore whether overestimating walk times and distances reduces the likelihood of walking. We find that people who overestimate are less likely to walk, everything else equal. Together, these results suggest that wayfinding campaigns that clarify the travel time to nearby destinations and ease the fear of getting lost are likely to improve perceptions and increase walking. We make an additional contribution by highlighting important differences between our university and town center samples, which raises questions about the reliance on student samples in research.",1369-8478,Not found

Risk management architectures embedded in autonomous vehicles fail to include human cognitive aspects. We set out to evaluate whether eye movements during a risk driving detection task are able to predict risk situations. Methods Thirty-two normally sighted subjects (15 female) saw 20 clips of recorded driving scenes while their gaze was tracked. They reported when they considered the car should brake, anticipating any hazard. We applied both a mixed-effect logistic regression model and feedforward neural networks between hazard reports and eye movement descriptors. Results All subjects reported at least one major collision hazard in each video (average 3.5 reports).We found that hazard situations were predicted by larger saccades, more and longer fixations, fewer blinks, and a smaller gaze dispersion in both horizontal and vertical dimensions.Performance between models incorporating a different combination of descriptors was compared running a test equality of receiver operating characteristic areas. Feedforward neural networks outperformed logistic regressions in accuracies. The model including saccadic magnitude, fixation duration, dispersion in ×, and pupil returned the highest ROC area (0.73). Conclusion We evaluated each eye movement descriptor successfully and created separate models that predicted hazard events with an average efficacy of 70% using both logistic regressions and feedforward neural networks.The use of driving simulators and hazard detection videos can be considered a reliable methodology to study risk prediction.",1369-8478,Not found

The present work reports the results of a study conducted in primary and secondary schools in the Arusha Region of Tanzania which investigates the students’ road crossing mental representation, as well as their level of hazard perception awareness, through their declared gaze behaviour. The students were asked to identify and tell the areas where hazards could come from within three road crossing scenarios, thus exploring the mental representation of the visual exploration strategies applied by children and teenagers when crossing the road. Results showed the tendency to apply the “compliant gaze behaviour” pattern in a flexible manner and to integrate it with the exploration of other areas in the visual field, particularly by the senior students. Practical implications for planning effective pedestrian road safety training programs are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found

"The impact of leaving a voicemail, environment familiarity, and pedestrian predictability on driving behavior",10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.006,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Talking on a cell phone can impair driving performance, but the dynamics of this effect are not fully understood. We examined the effects of leaving a voicemail message on driving when there are critical driving targets to attend to (crosswalks and pedestrians). Participants engaged in an ecologically-valid “voicemail” task while navigating a virtual environment using a driving simulator. We also examined the potential weakening or strengthening of effects of leaving a voicemail message on driving as the familiarity and predictability of critical targets changed. Participants completed four experimental runs through the same driving environment in a driving simulator. There were two crosswalks, one with a pedestrian entering the roadway and one without a pedestrian and the location of the pedestrian was predictable (the same pedestrian consistently used the same crosswalk) for the first three runs and then unpredictable for the fourth. Half of the participants left voicemail messages using a hands-free headset, while the other half drove in silence. Leaving a voicemail message increased steering deviation and velocity. Drivers who were leaving a voicemail message decelerated for pedestrians in the roadway to a similar speed as drivers who were not leaving a voicemail message, but they were delayed in braking. Drivers who were leaving a voicemail message also had worse memory for roadway landmarks. These effects were relatively stable across runs through the same driving environment, suggesting that familiarity and predictability did not impact the effects of leaving a voicemail message while driving. Therefore, leaving a voicemail message leads to poorer driving behavior; faster speed, variable steering, and worse memory for roadway landmarks. Interestingly, although drivers who were leaving a voicemail message were slower to react to local targets, they slowed as much as drivers who were not leaving a voicemail message and familiarity with the driving environment did not impact the effects of leaving a voicemail message on driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Would you rather teleport or spend some time commuting? Investigating individuals’ teleportation preferences,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.010,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The “teleportation test” is a unique question—used in some travel behavior research since the 2000s—to examine individuals’ perceptions towards travel time and affinities for travel. It gives people a hypothetical choice between teleporting or spending some time traveling. All studies (using different methods, including focus groups, interviews, and questionnaires) have consistently reported high teleportation preferences (about 70%). Yet, few correlates of teleportation preferences (especially sociodemographic and perceptual characteristics) have been investigated. Using data from an online questionnaire of 648 commuters in Portland, Oregon, this study investigated factors affecting individuals’ teleportation preferences. While generally representative of the area’s commuters, the sample did have higher shares of high-income workers and people using active modes or transit. Overall, 62% of respondents preferred to teleport than to spend some time commuting. Results from binary logit models identified actual commute duration, typical mode of travel, and “ideal” travel time (but no demographic attributes) as major predictors of preferences to teleport. As expected, people with longer commute durations had a greater desire to teleport, whereas bicyclists and pedestrians more often preferred to commute. People with longer ideal travel times had a greater affinity to commute and were less keen to teleport. Analysis of follow-up questions exploring reasons for respondents’ answers suggested that most “teleporters” were motivated by saving time to do other things, while most “commuters” found parts of their commutes to be enjoyable or productive. Findings from this study are consistent with related studies in implying that a teleportation preference does not necessarily represent zero ideal travel time or viewing travel time as wasted. Finally, this study discusses several travel behavior policy implications of the teleportation test, along with limitations and areas for future research.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of speed display signs on driving speed at pedestrian crossings on collector streets,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.004,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This study was designed to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of speed display signs on driving speed at pedestrian crossings in a low-speed (40 km/h) urban environment. Driving speeds were compared 1 week before installation, after installation (1 week; 1 month; 3 months; 5 months) and 1 week after removal. The main results showed that the speed displays decreased the mean speed by 0.5–2.9 km/h, which translates to a 4–22% drop in pedestrian fatality risk. Furthermore, there was a drop in the proportion of speeding vehicles and approaching speed of individual vehicles. The decrease in speed persisted over time, suggesting that speed displays may reduce speeds in the long term. In conclusion, installing speed displays at pedestrian crossings on collector streets reduces driving speeds and could contribute to the safety of pedestrians.",1369-8478,Not found
Distressed in the queue? Psychophysiological and behavioral evidence for two alternative car-following techniques,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.011,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Background Nature offers numerous examples of animal species exhibiting harmonious collective movement. Unfortunately, the motorized Homo sapiens sapiens is not included and pays a price for it. Too often, drivers who simply follow other drivers are caught in the worst road threat after a crash: congestions. In the past, the solution to this problem has gone hand in hand with infrastructure investment. However, approaches such as the Nagoya Paradigm propose now to see congestion as the consequence of multiple interacting particles whose disturbances are transmitted in a waveform. This view clashes with a longlasting assumption ordering traffic flows, the rational driver postulate (i.e., drivers’ alleged propensity to maintain a safe distance). Rather than a mere coincidence, the worldwide adoption of the safety-distance tenet and the worldwide presence of congestion emerge now as cause and effect. Nevertheless, nothing in the drivers’ endowment impedes the adoption of other car-following (CF) strategies. The present study questions the a priori of safety-distance, comparing two elementary CF strategies, Driving to keep Distance (DD), that still prevails worldwide, and Driving to keep Inertia (DI), a complementary CF technique that offsets traffic waves disturbances, ensuring uninterrupted traffic flows. By asking drivers to drive DD and DI, we aim to characterize both CF strategies, comparing their effects on the individual driver (how he drives, how he feels, what he pays attention to) and also on the road space occupied by a platoon of DD robot-followers. Methods Thirty drivers (50% women) were invited to adopt DD/DI in a driving simulator following a swinging leader. The design was a repeated measures model controlling for order. The CF technique, DD or DI, was the within-subject factor. Order (DD-DI / DI-DD) was the between-subjects factor. There were four blocks of dependent measures: individual driving performance (accelerations, decelerations, crashes, distance to lead vehicle, speed and fuel consumption), emotional dimensions (measures of skin conductance and self-reports of affective states concerning valence, arousal, and dominance), and visual behavior (fixations count and average duration, dwell times, and revisits) concerning three regions of the driving scene (the Top Rear Car –TRC- or the Bottom Rear Car –BRC- of the leading vehicle and the surrounding White Space Area -WSA). The final block concerned the road space occupied by a platoon of 8 virtual DD followers. Results Drivers easily understood and applied DD/DI as required, switching back and forth between the two. Average speeds for DD/DI were similar, but DD drivers exhibited a greater number of accelerations, decelerations, speed variability, and crashes. Conversely, DI required greater CF distance, that was dynamically adjusted, and spent less fuel. Valence was similar, but DI drivers felt less aroused and more dominant. When driving DD visual scan was centered on the leader’s BRC, whereas DI elicited more attention to WSA (i.e., adopting wider vision angles). In spite of DI requiring more CF distance, the resulting road space occupied between the leader and the 8th DD robot was greater when driving DD.",1369-8478,Not found
Can emotion regulation explain the association between age and driving styles?,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.008,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Numerous studies have sought to explain why young drivers tend to engage in maladaptive driving styles more than older drivers. The current study seeks to further this line of inquiry by examining the mediating role of emotion regulation in the association between age and driving style. The sample consisted of 287 drivers aged 18 to 72 who completed scales assessing their driving style and emotion regulation difficulties. Results show that the younger the drivers, the more they tended to report difficulties in regulating emotion, which, in turn, was positively related to the maladaptive driving styles: reckless and careless; angry and hostile; and anxious. Understanding the role of emotion regulation in the choice of driving style is crucial for promoting the substantial efforts invested in attempts to reduce traffic crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
Risky riding behaviours among motorcyclists in Malaysia: A roadside survey,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.031,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Motorcyclists are over-represented in fatal crashes in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). In Malaysia, motorcyclists comprise about 60% of all fatalities in road crashes. However, the prevalence and determinants of risky riding behaviours have been rarely studied in the country. This study aims to investigate motorcycle-related risky riding behaviours at signalised intersections. A total of 72,377 observations were made during six days at six different signalised intersections in Terengganu, Malaysia. Four risky riding behaviours were observed together (i.e. helmet non-use, red-light running, mobile phone use, turn signal neglect) along with additional demographic and contextual factors. The most prevalent risky riding behaviour was turn signal neglect (29.7% of all observations), and the least prevalent was mobile phone while riding (0.2% of all observations). Four logistic regressions were fitted to predict the four risky riding behaviours using the demographic and contextual explanatory factors. The results suggest that helmet non-use increases among female riders, riders wearing industrial uniforms, carrying passengers, riding during the weekend, during off-peak hours, during clear weather, at T-junctions, on multi-lane roads, and on minor road approaches. Red light running increases among female riders, riders wearing industrial uniforms, carrying passengers, during clear weather, at T-junctions, on multi-lane roads, and on major road approaches. Mobile phone use increases among female riders, riders wearing industrial uniforms, carrying passengers, and at cross-junctions. Turn signal neglect increases among male riders, riders not wearing industrial uniforms, solo riders, on weekends, during off-peak hours, during clear weather, on single-lane roads, and on minor road approaches. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of targeted countermeasures such as education programs and road policing.",1369-8478,Not found
Determinants of standard motorcycle safety helmet usage among child pillion riders,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.029,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The World Health Organization stressed that compliance with the use of safety helmet could significantly reduce the risk of injury by 72% and the probability of death by 39%. In Malaysia, the enforcement of the safety helmet legislation significantly reduced 30% of motorcycle crash fatalities in Malaysia. The aim of this study is to explore the use of motorcycle helmets and the determinants of standard helmet usage among child pillion riders. A cross-sectional survey of 200 adult riders accompanied by the child pillion riders aged 6–12 years old from Klang, Selangor, was conducted. The proper use of the helmet among the respondents and the child pillion riders was observed and recorded. A questionnaire was used to assess socio-demographic background and awareness of the use of child safety helmets. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 23. Only 3% of child pillion riders use standard child safety helmets, while 37% wear standard adult motorcycle helmets. Adult riders who were married, female, always wear helmets, have a higher household income and travel a long distance, are more likely to use a standard motorcycle helmet for their child pillion riders. Knowledge on Standard Certification (SIRIM) label and its importance, awareness of the campaign on child safety helmets, police enforcement, understanding the safety of toy/game helmet use have been identified as additional determinants of standard helmet use among child pillion riders. This study recommends prospective studies with continuous road safety educations programs that integrate behavioural change approaches to enhance the use of standard motorcycle helmets among the child pillion riders in Malaysia.",1369-8478,Not found
Aging drivers and post delineated express lanes: Threading the needle at 70 miles per hour,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.005,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Post-delineated express lanes represent a combination of driving complexities that are particularly difficult for older drivers to navigate. The narrow geometry and high speeds that are common to this treatment reflect a critical test for drivers whose depth perception, contrast sensitivity, and visual processing speed are reduced. The present study was designed to empirically examine the effects of age and color of express lane delineators on driver behavior. Three groups of participants (aged 18–39, 40–64, and 65 + years old) were required to complete a series of simulated driving scenarios consisting of combinations of single and dual lane configurations, with speed and lane position measured at the beginning and midpoint of each express lane. All drivers were pre-screened on various visual functioning abilities. Drivers in the 65 and older group show significant age-related declines in depth perception, contrast sensitivity, and phoria which were subsequently correlated with a wide range of driving measures including deceleration rate, brake time, jerk, speed, and lane position. Age related perceptual declines were statistically correlated with slower driving speed and wider lane deviations, including a statistically significant increase in the number of excursions beyond the typical 12-foot lane width. Based on these findings, the behavior of senior drivers was identified as a distinct design condition that should govern the design of high-speed, narrow geometric conditions. This age group requires wider lane widths, particularly at the beginning of single-lane post delimited sections, wider buffer areas around the post markers, and dual lane configurations wherever possible.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of navigation system display size and environmental illumination on young driver mental workload,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.027,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Driver distraction is a major cause of road crashes and has a great influence on road safety. In vehicles, one of the common distracting sources is navigation systems (NSs). The navigation system (NS) can distract the driver due to following directions and reading the provided information through its display. These tasks take the driver’s attention from the primary task of driving and may cause poor driving performance, increasing the risk of crashes. In this paper, the effect of the environment (i.e., urban areas and rural areas), the navigation system display (NSD) size, environmental illumination, and gender on young drivers between the ages of 18 and 29 years mental workload was investigated using a simulated driving experiment. To evaluate each driving condition, the NASA-TLX (NASA Task Load Index) workload assessment tool, and a distraction evaluation element, were introduced and used to assess the overall workload, the workload subscales and the distraction by the NSD. The assessment showed a higher perceived overall workload for urban areas and night driving as compared to a rural areas and daytime driving. Moreover, the results showed a greater perceived distraction by the NSD in urban areas compared to driving in rural areas. The subjects also felt distracted when using the small NS compared to using the large NS. The study concluded that urban areas driving, and night driving creates higher perceived workload than rural areas and daytime driving. Furthermore, small NSD leads to more perceived distraction than large NSD while driving. The NSD designers may utilize this research findings to optimize NSD designs to improve driving safety, performance and comfort. Moreover, this study contributes to our understanding of the effect of the NSD size on driving workload and distraction.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of position of speed limit signs and the presence of speed camera on Malaysian drivers’ speed choice: An eye-tracking study,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.030,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Speeding is one of the most common driving violations in the world including in Malaysia. Reducing speed-related fatalities is one of Malaysia’s strategies to improve road safety. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of speed limit sign positioning and the presence of speed camera on drivers’ judgments about the appropriate speed to drive and their associated eye movements. Twenty participants took part in the study, and thirty two images of roads with a range of actual speed limits were presented. In each picture the displayed speed limit was edited to 30% lower than what participants think is appropriate on average. Speed limit signs were either presented on the road or on the speed limit sign boards at the road sides, and a speed camera sign was either present or not. Drivers judged a lower appropriate speed to drive when the camera sign was present than absent, while there was a wider spread of differences between judged and displayed speed when the speed limit sign was presented on the board than on the road. Drivers were quicker in fixating and looked more at the general area in which the speed limit sign appeared. Therefore drivers’ visual attention across scenes may be manipulated by the sign positions. These low-cost interventions could be useful in managing speed choice in Malaysia.",1369-8478,Not found
Public acceptance of semi-automated truck platoon driving.

This technology has recently been tested on public highways with heavy trucks in Germany and California. The objective of this study is to assess the level of acceptance among other road users as well as influencing factors of acceptance. An online questionnaire was administered in Germany and California with a total of N = 536 participants. They received information about truck platoon driving (level-1 and level-2 automation) and answered questions about their attitudes towards the technology as well as their behavioral intention to cooperate with the truck platoons. The overall results showed that 70% of respondents indicated acceptance towards the technology, with acceptance rates being significantly higher in California than in Germany. German respondents were more willing to drive into the gap of platoon vehicles and preferred larger platooning gaps. An adaption of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) showed that the expected usefulness, and the expected ease of sharing the highway, were the strongest predictors for the behavioral intention to cooperate with platoon vehicles. However, the intention to cut in between platoon vehicles could not be predicted by these variables. Cut-in vehicles are a potential safety risk and decrease the efficiency of platoon driving. Therefore, future research should focus on finding behavioral countermeasures.",1369-8478,Not found

This study thus aims to examine the impacts of technology-identity concerns on consumers’ acceptance of AV technology. Theories of identity threat, identity control and innovation diffusion are synthesised to build the conceptual framework. Face-to-face interview data were collected from 353 consumers (all with a driving license) in Singapore. The results show that consumers’ technology anxiety and self-identity expressiveness act as two sources of resistance that cause consumers’ intentional avoidance of the AV technology. The avoidance is further characterised by consumers’ disengagement from the ‘observe’ and ‘try’ stages of technology penetration, which ultimately dissuades consumers’ acceptance of AV technology. The impacts of socio-demographics are also explored. Our findings contribute to multiple streams of literature and create practical implications to AV manufacturers and retailers.",1369-8478,Not found

Self-perception of driving abilities in older age: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.020,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Older adults have become the fastest growing age group worldwide and will continue to make up a more significant portion of the driving population. Given the increased potential for age-related perceptual, cognitive, and physical declines, it is important to understand the perception that older drivers have regarding their own driving abilities. This awareness often motivates their driving behavior and patterns. A systematic review was conducted to synthesize the literature regarding the self-perception of driving abilities in older age. The PRISMA method was used and 10 databases (SCOPUS, TRID, PsycINFO, AgeLine, Web of Science, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, Inspec, Compendex, PubMed, and Medline) were searched to identify relevant articles. A total of 25 articles met the search criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis. Overall, methods used to assess self-perception of driving abilities in older adults vary considerably. Some studies employ only subjective questionnaires, while others administer questionnaires in addition to on-road driving or simulated evaluations. Nonetheless, the studies overwhelmingly report that older drivers tend to rate highly, and often overestimate, their driving abilities. They perceive their driving abilities to be better than themselves at a younger age, their cohorts, and all other drivers. However, more work is needed to develop improved subjective assessments that guide drivers in more accurately estimating their true driving abilities, as well as to compare subjective ratings to objective performance-based measures of driving abilities. This review may assist researchers in better understanding the characteristics that influence driving self-perception and may inform the development of interventional strategies that help older drivers to better calibrate how they perceive their driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Does morality predict aggressive driving? A conceptual analysis and exploratory empirical investigation,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.017,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Risky and aggressive driving is an important cause of traffic casualties and as such a major health and cost problem to society. Given the consequences for others, risky and aggressive driving has a clear moral component. Surprisingly, however, there has been little research on the relation between morality and risky and aggressive driving behavior. In this study we aim at addressing this gap. First, we present a conceptual analysis of the relationship between moral values and aggressive driving behavior. For this purpose, we extend Schwartz’s integrated model of ethical decision making and apply it to the context of aggressive driving. This conceptual analysis shows that moral decision-making processes consist of several stages, like moral awareness, moral judgment and moral intent, each of which are influenced by individual and situational factors and all of which need to materialize before someone’s generally endorsed moral value affects concrete behavior. This suggests that the moral value-aggressive driving relationship is rather indeterminate. This conceptual picture is confirmed by our empirical investigation, which tests to what extent respondents’ moral values, measured through the Moral Foundation Questionnaire, are predictive of respondents’ aggressive driving behavior, as measured through an aggressive driving behavior scale. Our results show few and rather weak empirical relationships between moral values and committed aggressive driving behaviors, as was expected in light of our conceptual analysis. We derive several policy implications from these results.",1369-8478,Not found
Rewards decrease risky decisions for adolescent drivers: Implications for crash prevention,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.028,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are a major contributor to adolescent mortality. Adolescent drivers are more likely to make risky decisions in the presence of peers. However, rewards have also been shown to improve decision making in adolescence. Our goal was to determine if peer observation and reward effects on decision-making were dependent upon adolescent driving styles. Twenty-four healthy adolescents played a driving game in a 2 (no peer; peer) × 2 (no rewards; rewards) within-subjects experiment. Driving styles were measured by self-report. Rewards favoring safe choices reduced risky decision making, but this effect was especially robust for adolescents with driving styles that increase risk of MVCs (i.e., dangerous, fast, angry, or distracted styles). Findings suggest that rewards for safe driving can be an effective mechanism for reducing MVCs, especially for the most at-risk drivers, if they can be made appetizing to adolescents.",1369-8478,Not found
Improving payment of traffic fines with financial incentives: Discounts vs. penalties,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.019,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The effective enforcement of traffic laws is critical for improved road safety outcomes. Decisions to follow traffic rules and pay fines are influenced by formal institutions (e.g. laws, court summons, and fines) as well as informal institutions (e.g. norms and aspects of culture). Formal and informal institutions create incentives that should be designed to steer individuals’ behaviour towards desired outcomes. Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe that the institutions to deal with traffic violations in South Africa currently create effective incentives. This paper discusses the findings of a controlled laboratory experiment, conducted with a sample of university students, that tested the efficacy of different financial incentives that may influence the payment of traffic fines. An early payment discount was compared to a late payment penalty (used in other countries, for example, some states in the USA), and to the absence of any incentives. Furthermore, we examined whether the willingness to settle fines is sensitive to the likelihood of detection by the authorities. We found that introducing financial incentives significantly increases voluntary payment of fines, irrespective of whether immediate payment is encouraged with a discount or late payment is discouraged with a surcharge. In addition, subjects are more sensitive to the likelihood of detection when financial incentives are present.",1369-8478,Not found

Among these 41.85%, respondents plan to talk to fellow travellers (44.76%), surf the internet, watch videos or TV shows (44%), observe the landscape (41.70%), and work (17.06%). The UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) was applied to investigate the effects of performance and effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation on the behavioural intention to use conditionally automated cars. Structural equation analysis revealed that the UTAUT2 can be applied to conditional automation, with hedonic motivation, social influence, and performance expectancy influencing the behavioural intention to buy and use a conditionally automated car.

A multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the predictors of the perceived collision/incident risk involving other motor vehicles. Results showed that traffic safety attitudes among horse users were the strongest predictor of the perceived collision/incident risk. In particular, horse users reported a negative attitude towards the other road users (e.g. drivers) indicating that they perceive the other road users’ actions and approaches as the biggest source of risk in road traffic. The level of knowledge about the rules and regulations applying to horse use, especially in walking and cycling lane, was relatively low among the respondents.

Drivers’ driving style and their take-over-control judgment,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.009,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs), which help a driver drive a car safely and easily (e.g., warning alerts, steering control, and brake/acceleration pedal operation), have increased in popularity. However, such systems have not yet been perfected. Sometimes, humans must take over control from the systems; otherwise, they can cause an accident. In this study, we focused on one of the ADASs, adaptive cruise control (ACC), which automatically maintains a selected distance from the preceding car, and investigated individual differences in take-over-control judgment and related factors. The candidate factors included driver’s manual driving style, driving performance without the ACC, and the usability evaluation of ACC. Ten participants repeated the short, strictly controlled trials in a driving simulator (DS), with a varying value of only one parameter (deceleration of the preceding car) affecting the need for intervention. First, we confirmed that the participants made the judgment based on the dangerousness of the situation and that there were individual differences in the take-over-control judgments. Some participants intervened in the ACC control in less dangerous trials, whereas other participants did not, even if their own car got very close to the preceding car. We conducted a correlation analysis and confirmed the results with the estimation of the confidence interval using a bootstrap method. As a result, we found that driving style and driving performance without ACC had a stronger relationship to the number of interventions, rather than the usability evaluation. In particular, methodical drivers, who obeyed traffic rules and manners, began to intervene in less dangerous situations. The tendency to avoid utilizing brake operations was also related to take-over-control judgment. This might be because the participants intervened by pressing the brake pedal. Our study showed that drivers’ driving style could affect the usage of ACC independently from the performance of the ACC.",1369-8478,Not found
Travel behavior as a driver of attitude: Car use and car pride in U.S. cities,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.021,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Individuals attribute social status and personal image to owning and using a car (‘car pride’), which may interact with their travel behavior in complex ways. This study explores the multi-directional relations among car pride, car ownership, and car use for a sample of 1236 adult commuters in New York City, NY and Houston, TX. Applying multivariate structural equation modeling and incorporating instrumental variables, we find evidence of a feedback loop among car pride, car ownership, and car use. Our results suggest that an individual with higher car pride is more likely to own a vehicle, and, enabled with this ownership, use it more frequently. And individuals who use their car more frequently are likely to feel more pride in owning and using their vehicle. This exploration of causal multi-directionality in transportation attitude-behavior relations has important implications for behavioral research, model development, and policy interventions. For researchers, potential bidirectionality must be anticipated from the outset of research design and accounted for appropriately in modeling to address underlying endogeneity. For policymakers, our results suggest that there are multiple intervention points within the reinforcing cycle of attitudes and car consumption. Policies could directly target car ownership and use or could consider influencing behavior through attitude change.",1369-8478,Not found
Nomophobia and self-reported smartphone use while driving: An investigation into whether nomophobia can increase the likelihood of illegal smartphone use while driving,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.024,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In Australia, illegal smartphone use while driving is on the rise, increasing the likelihood drivers could be distracted and crash. Smartphones avail users a sense of belonging, connectedness, and access to information. As such, the sensation of being without one’s smartphone has developed into the prevalence of nomophobia, defined as the fear and anxiety associated with being without smartphone. The aim of the current study was to specifically examine the relationship between smartphone use while driving and nomophobia by 1) determining the types and frequency of illegal phone use while driving and, 2) exploring the relationship between nomophobia and illegal phone use while driving. The sample consisted of 2,774 Victorian smartphone users (47.0% male) with a valid driver’s licence. Driver’s nomophobia levels were measured using the Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q), while driver’s smartphone use was measured using an original scale developed by the authors. A binary logistic regression was conducted which showed that the longer average time spent per day on a smartphone and a lack of knowledge of the mobile phone road law were the strongest positive predictors of illegal use (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.09–1.60; OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.48–2.28, respectively). However, only one nomophobia factor (i.e., access to information) significantly predicted illegal smartphone use (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.04–1.09). Smartphone use is a complex and contextual behaviour, therefore, focusing on the fear of being without in dependency overlooks the nuances of the need to be with. This study offered several practical interventions that may mitigate illegal smartphone use and reduce the likelihood of crashes among Victorian road users.",1369-8478,Not found
A driving simulation study to investigate the information threshold of graphical variable message signs based on visual perception characteristics of drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.023,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Graphical variable message signs (VMSs) are infrastructure-based advanced traveler information systems widely used to provide drivers with real-time traffic condition information about a road section or area. However, there is a lack of research on the suitable volume of information to be shown on graphical VMSs. In practice, an overload of VMS information commonly exists, especially on China’s highways. Building on our earlier findings obtained through surveys and static cognitive experiments, this study introduces the use of dynamic simulation experiments to assess the influence of the volume of information (i.e., number of roads displayed) on graphical VMSs from the perspective of drivers’ visual perception characteristics. Thirty-two drivers participated in the driving simulation experiment and questionnaires. Five indexes, including legibility speed, legibility distance, legibility time, comprehension accuracy, and driver subjective scoring, were thoroughly analyzed to evaluate their relationships to different volumes of information (i.e., four, five, and six roads shown on a VMS). The results show that the legibility distance notably decreased with increasing volumes of information. The comprehension accuracy decreased significantly when the number of roads shown increased to six. The legibility speed, legibility time, and subjective scoring also deteriorated as the number of roads displayed on the VMS increased. The index scores were evaluated, in combination with the data of the drivers’ subjective scoring, data-based statistical analyses, and comprehensive evaluations using the TOPSIS method, to recommend that five is the recommended maximum number of roads to be shown on a graphical VMS. The results of this study support the goal of providing understandable and effective messages for drivers by addressing issues relating to how much information should be displayed on a VMS. These findings provide a basis for policy development to ensure consistent and practical designs of graphical VMSs on highways.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessing the feasibility of the theory of planned behaviour in predicting drivers’ intentions to operate conditional and full automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.015,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study examined the beliefs underpinning, and feasibility of the factors in predicting, individuals’ intentions to use a conditional (Level 3) automated vehicle (AV) and a full (Level 5) AV. Australian drivers (N = 505) aged 17–81 years (Mean age = 33.69, SD = 18.79) were recruited and completed a 20 min online survey which featured both quantitative and qualitative items. For the quantitative data, two linear regressions revealed that the TPB standard constructs of attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control (PBC) accounted for 66% of the variance in intentions to use a conditional AV and 68% of the variance in intentions to use a full AV. Of the TPB constructs, attitudes and subjective norms were significant positive predictors of future intentions to use conditional and full AVs. For the qualitative data, some differences emerged for the underlying behavioural beliefs that underpinned intentions to use conditional and full AVs. For example, having beliefs about control over the conditional AV was identified by many participants as an advantage, while not being in full control of the full AV was identified as a disadvantage. For underlying control beliefs, participants identified similar barriers for both vehicle types, including; high costs, lack of trust, lack of control over the vehicle, lack of current legislation to support the mainstream introduction of these vehicles, and concerns of safety for self and for other road users when operating AVs. Overall, these findings provide some support for applying the TPB to understand drivers’ intended use of AVs. However, while the current study showed that the constructs of attitudes and subjective norms might reflect intended use of AVs, more research is required to further examine the role of PBC. Additionally, the findings provide initial insights into the underlying behavioural and control beliefs that may motivate drivers to use AVs and highlight the similarities and differences in drivers’ perceptions towards two levels of vehicle automation.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver behaviour and traffic accident involvement among professional urban bus drivers in China,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.007,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The present research aimed to investigate specific behaviors of professional urban bus drivers in China with the revised Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), and to define the relationships among various driving behaviors (errors, positives, inattention errors, violations), background information (age, years of driving experience, mobility, etc.), self-assessment, and traffic accident. To achieve such goals, the present research designed a four-dimensional DBQ with 20 items for professional urban bus drivers in China. The KMO coefficient of the whole scale was 0.835, and Bartlett’s test was statistically significant (p < 0.000), which demonstrated strong validity of the scale and should be suitable for factor analysis. The four loading factors accounted for 58.991%. In addition, the reliability and effectiveness of the present 20-item scales were measured. The coefficient of internal consistency-Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.881 and the Cronbach’s Alpha Based on Standardized Items was 0.911. This showed that driving behavior scale of professional bus drivers in China was of high reliability and validity. The analysis showed that among the four factors, positive driving behaviors were significantly associated with errors, inattention errors and violations, respectively. Errors, inattention errors and violations correlated positively with each other. This verified that the correlation coefficient of each factor was medium and high, which indicated that the scale had good difference validity. The test content of the total scale was also highly consistent with the test content of each factor, which indicated that the revised scale had good standard related validity. According to the accident prediction model, the variables that significantly affected the occurrence of traffic accidents were daily driving time, positive driving behavior, SE2 (Driving safety), SE3 (Aberrant driver behaviors). The results showed that professional bus drivers often working overtime were most likely to have accidents. The probability of traffic accidents decreased by 53% for every unit of positive driving behavior frequency of professional bus drivers. The more they felt that they had the tendency of aberrant driving behavior, the more likely they were to have traffic accidents. To summary, the present research contributed to validating and improving the DBQ for professional urban drivers in China.",1369-8478,Not found
Using a multi-user driving simulator system to explore the patterns of vehicle fleet rear-end collisions occurrence under different foggy conditions and speed limits,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.025,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Vehicle fleet rear-end collisions (FRECs) are an extremely fatal type of traffic collisions on freeway and they usually occur in foggy weather. This study aimed to explore the patterns of vehicle fleet rear-end collisions occurrence under different foggy conditions and speed limits on freeway. A multi-user driving simulator system was used to conduct the experiment and the driving behavior data were collected from eight participants. The experimental results showed that as the fog density increased, the length of vehicle fleet decreased significantly, and drivers tended to keep a more stable car-following distance. The fog weather and short vehicle gap prompted drivers to react faster and brake harder in respond to the leading vehicle’s brake. In spite of the compensational behaviors, more FRECs were observed under heavy fog condition. Lowering speed limit can significantly reduce the FRECs under foggy conditions. As the speed limits reduced, drivers’ brake response time and speed variance significantly reduced. The study also found that drivers’ brake response time was negatively correlated with their positions in the fleet. Drivers in the front positions of the fleet had a longer response time than drivers in the back positions and thus were more likely to encounter collisions. The study generated a better understanding of drivers’ behavioral pattern in a vehicle fleet and the patterns of vehicle fleet rear-end collisions occurrence. The findings also shed lights on the design of driver assistance system for complex driving situations such as freeway driving under adverse weather.",1369-8478,Not found
Overall performance impairment and crash risk due to distracted driving: A comprehensive analysis using structural equation modelling,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.018,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Distracted driving leads to performance changes in both longitudinal and lateral control. However, driving performance, being a multidimensional phenomenon, is very difficult to be interpreted from individual performance measures. The present study aimed to exhibit the distraction impacts on overall driving performance estimated by a single measure rather than assessing distraction effects on individual performance metrics such as speed, acceleration, lateral variation, etc. The study also focused on modelling and quantifying the impacts of overall deteriorated driving performance on crash risk. To achieve the objectives, a comparative analysis of investigating phone and music player usage was conducted using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). In total, 90 drivers’ demographic details and driving performance data in distracted and non-distracted driving environments were collected. Firstly, the latent variable “performance degradation” was derived from longitudinal and lateral performance measures. Then the structural model revealed a positive relationship between the distractions and the overall performance degradation. Finally, the crash risk was modelled against the presence of distraction and performance degradation. With a factor loading of 0.29, the impact of deteriorated driving performance (i.e., indirect impact) was found to be the highest among all the contributory factors of the crash risk. Further, the results showed that among the distractions (i.e., direct impact), texting had the highest impact (factor loading = 0.28) on crash risk followed by visual-manual tasks related to music player (factor loading = 0.21). Thus, the present study quantified the effects of deteriorated driving performance caused by distracted driving on the crash risk. Further, the study also presented quantified effects of each distracting activity on the crash risk which accounted for the factors that could not be considered through the performance degradation measure. The approach used in the present study can be adopted in designing the countermeasures using advanced driver warning systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Analysis of overtaking patterns of Indian drivers with data collected using a LiDAR,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.016,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Vehicle overtaking is a complex maneuver on highways and high-speed arterials. When overtaking occurs in heterogeneous traffic conditions, it becomes even more challenging due to the variety of different vehicle sizes and operating characteristics. This study analyzes overtaking behavior on Indian highways under high vehicle heterogeneity. Data were collected using LiDAR and video cameras from an instrumented vehicle. Overtaking times for both sides of overtaking and for different types of vehicles were analyzed. This study introduces a new variable, “excess distance,” to understand overtaking. The results show that on divided four-lane roads, the side of overtaking plays an important role in determining overtaking behavior. On undivided two-lane roads, the type of overtaken vehicle is found to be significant. It is observed, as expected, that while overtaking at higher speeds, overtaking vehicles maintained greater excess distances with the overtaken vehicle. However, data shows that the rate of change of excess distance depends upon the type of road and the type of overtaking vehicle. The analysis also shows that overtaking behavior on undivided roads is affected by the presence of oncoming vehicles and the type of overtaken vehicle.",1369-8478,Not found
Pro-social behaviour in young passengers: Predictive utility of the social reaction pathway of the prototype willingness model,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.014,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This study examined the social reaction pathway of the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM) to assess how attitudes, subjective norms, prototype perception (favourability and similarity), and risk perception influenced young passengers’ willingness to speak up to a driver exceeding the posted speed limit by either 5 km/h or 10 km/h. It was hypothesised that participants would be more willing to speak up to drivers’ travelling 10 km/h over the posted speed limit than 5 km/h over the posted speed limit. Further, it was hypothesised that the PWM constructs would significantly predict passenger willingness to speak up to a driver travelling 5 km/h over the posted speed limit and 10 km/h over the posted speed limit. Young Australians aged 17 to 25 years (N = 136, Mage = 19.32, 77.9% female) were recruited to complete a 30-minute online questionnaire. As predicted, passengers were significantly more willing to speak up to drivers travelling at 10 km/h over the posted speed limit than drivers travelling 5 km/h over the posted speed limit. Further, the results from a linear regression revealed that some of the PWM constructs were effective in explaining the variance in willingness to speak-up to drivers travelling either 5 km/h or 10 km/h over the posted speed limit. These findings address a gap in road safety research by shifting focus from the behaviour of drivers to the behaviour of passengers. The focus on the pro-social behaviour of speaking up to drivers performing risk taking behaviours may help to inform future educational campaigns and interventions designed to reduce young peoples’ involvement in road crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
The relationship between cognitive function and hazard perception in younger drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.008,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Driving is a complex task; with research suggesting cognitive function plays a significant role in driver behaviour. Recent studies have investigated the role of cognitive function in younger drivers who are experiencing brain maturation and are over-represented in crash statistics. Emerging evidence suggests poor cognitive functioning is one explanation for this high crash risk. For younger drivers, the relationship between cognitive function and driving ability has been consistently shown for speeding and lane deviations. However, the driving skill most consistently linked to crash involvement is hazard perception, which is the ability to anticipate and respond to potentially dangerous traffic situations. The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive correlates of hazard perception in younger drivers. Seventy-nine undergraduate students completed a hazard perception test and a battery of cognitive tests that have previously demonstrated a relationship with safe driving. The newly created hazard perception test measured accuracy of hazard identification, response times when anticipating the hazard, and response times when taking action to avoid the hazard. Hazard perception accuracy was significantly related to visuo-spatial skills, executive functioning and global cognitive status. Anticipation response times were significantly related to inhibitory control, with no significant relationship found between cognitive function and action response times. These findings are discussed in line with limitations in the study. Future research into the role of specific cognitive domains could lead to the enhancement of hazard perception testing for licensing with cognitive training and assessment, with the potential to reduce the crash risk of vulnerable younger drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
"Pedestrian temporal gap acceptance behavior at unsignalized intersections in Kanpur, India",10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.010,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Vehicle heterogeneity, lack of lane discipline, lack of infrastructure facilities, and weak enforcement of traffic rules are all characteristics of Indian traffic. These characteristics make Indian roads difficult for non-motorized road users, especially pedestrians. Most intersections in urban areas in India are unsignalized, which results in complex interactions between pedestrians and motorists. This study aims to understand pedestrian gap acceptance behavior at unsignalized intersections in India under heterogeneous traffic conditions. Pedestrian data were collected from six unsignalized intersections in the city of Kanpur. The critical gap was estimated using Wu’s (2006) macroscopic model, and then the effects of several variables on the critical gap were studied. A discrete choice model (binary logit model) was developed to understand the choice of accepted and rejected vehicular gaps depending on traffic, road, and peer pedestrian characteristics. The mean critical headway was 3.76 s using Wu’s model. The behavioral analysis revealed that pedestrians accept rolling gaps to cross unsignalized intersections, resulting in a reduction of the size of the critical gap. The adoption of rolling gap behavior can be attributed to the unyielding behavior of motorists, which forces pedestrians to accept short vehicular gaps in the traffic stream.",1369-8478,Not found

In order to resolve these situations and increase cooperative driving behavior in situations of merging or turning left, manual drivers could be assisted by an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for cooperative driving. This simulator study investigated the behavior of drivers confronted with system limits and failures of such a system. The ADAS used in this study informed the driver about an upcoming cooperation situation and gave advice on how to behave (e.g. reduce speed, change lane). Two test situations were implemented: a system freeze and an unexpected event, which could not be detected by the system. In order to find the most fitting HMI solution, the place of presentation (head-up display (HUD) vs. instrument cluster) as well as the form of presentation (dynamic vs. symbolic) were varied. The results indicated that the most fitting HMI solution to support the driver in a complex coordinated driving situation is a dynamic HUD, mainly due to the positive effect on glance behavior. However, advantages of both forms of presentation were revealed, as each form of presentation increased the probability of recognition for one of the test situations. The fewest collisions took place with the dynamic form of presentation.",1369-8478,Not found
The Impact of Commercial Parking Utilization on Cyclist Behavior in Urban Environments,10.1016/j.trf.2020.07.014,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"With growing freight operations within the United States, there continues to be a push for urban streets to accommodate trucks during loading and unloading operations. Currently, many urban locations do not provide loading and unloading zones, which results in trucks parking in places that can obstruct roadway infrastructure designated to vulnerable road users (e.g., pedestrians and cyclists). In an effort to understand the implications of these truck operations, a bicycle simulation experiment was designed to evaluate the impact of commercial vehicle loading and unloading activities on safe and efficient bicycle operations in a shared urban roadway environment. A counter-balanced, factorial design was chosen to explore three independent variables: commercial vehicle loading zone (CVLZ) sizes with three levels (no CVLZ, Min CVLZ, and Max CVLZ), courier position with also three levels (No courier, behind the truck, beside the truck), and loading accessories (Acc) with two levels (no Acc, and with Acc). Cyclist’s velocity and lateral position were used as performance measures. Data were obtained from 48 participants (24 women) resulting in 864 observations in 18 experimental scenarios. Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMM) were developed to examine the effect of each independent variable level on bicyclist performance. Results from LMM model suggest that loading zone size had the greatest effect on cyclist’s divergence. Additionally, when the courier was walking beside the truck, cyclist’s velocity significantly dropped to almost one m/sec in compared when the courier located behind the truck. The presence of accessories had the lowest influence on both velocity and lateral positions of cyclists. In the no CVLZ scenarios, the delivery vehicle was parked at the bike lane, therefore; cyclists had to choose between using the travel lane or the sidewalk. About one-third of participants decided to use the sidewalk. These findings could support better roadway and CVLZ design guidelines, which will allow our urban street system to operate more efficiently, safely, and reliably for all users.",1369-8478,Not found

The study was carried out in Dar es Salaam between December 8th 2018 and March 24th 2019. Drivers aged 18 years and above were selected from 90 parking stages within the city and completed a structured interview. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate the prevalence ratios (PRs). We found that close to 60% of drivers considered unsafe driving to be unsafe. However, reported unsafe driving behaviour was moderately common. Our results showed that reported unsafe driving behaviour (adjusted PR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.3–2.2) was associated with a low perception of the dangers of unsafe driving among motorcyclists. The higher the earnings a driver had (adjusted PR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.0), the higher the likelihood of having a low perceived risk of unsafe behaviour.

Additional external signaling devices have the aim to increase the perception of safety by providing auditory or visual feedback for road users. Due to the international relevance of this topic, we surveyed participants from six countries on the importance of communication. Our results reveal that intention messages are more important than the status signal. The importance of communication is independent of the time of day, traffic density and number of pedestrians.

Fifty-two riders from 40 different riding groups, recorded footage of 126 group riding trips, resulting in 135 h of video. A total of 108 unsafe events (‘near-crashes/ crash relevant events’ and ‘close passing only events’) involving the group riders and a motor vehicle were observed. The most common type of unsafe event involved a motor vehicle attempting to pass/ overtake the group (65.7%). For 39.4% of the passing events, the presence of road infrastructure ahead (e.g. roundabout, traffic island) prevented safe passing and led to an unsafe event. Motorists were at fault for 83.3% of all unsafe events and reckless behaviour by the motorist was observed for 13.3% of these at-fault events. Aggressive communication on the part of the motorist or rider/s was observed for 15% of all unsafe events. This study highlighted that motorists were at fault for the majority of unsafe events involving group riders but only a small proportion involved reckless behaviour.

The effect of sleep-need and time-on-task on driver fatigue,10.1016/j.trf.2020.08.001,74,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Both sleep- and task-related factors are thought to contribute to driver fatigue, with each factor individually associated with deteriorated driving performance. However, the relative and combined effects of these factors in the context of monotonous driving have not been well studied. This study (N = 60) investigated lateral and longitudinal vehicle control, subjective fatigue and physiological response (EEG) during three 10-minute periods of time-on-task spread across a monotonous, 2-hour simulator drive. Level of physiological sleep-need was manipulated between participants by varying the instructed time spent in bed on the night before testing (≤5h or ≥ 8 h). In addition, half of the participants in each sleep group read the applicable speed limit from periodic roadside signs whereas the others performed an arithmetic calculation, displayed on the signs, to determine the speed limit. This task manipulation has been demonstrated to reduce performance decrements over time. Results demonstrated effects of time-on-task and sleep need on self-report ratings, an effect of time-on-task on EEG indices, and an interaction of sleep-need and time-on-task on an EEG index of mental workload and on the lateral control measure of driving performance. There were no significant effects on the measure of speed variability. These results confirm that both sleep-need and time-on-task negatively affect driver state, and that time-on-task decrements in driver performance can occur in the absence of heightened sleep-need. Results also suggest that drivers with heightened sleep-need could protect their performance for a short time, perhaps by exerting effort to compensate for reduced capacity. The secondary task did not counteract declining performance.",1369-8478,Not found

While this has benefited the drivers’ productivity and entertainment behind the wheel, it has also heightened the possibility for distraction. Research into driver distraction to date has identified how technologies inside the vehicle may be used ineffectively and can compromise the safety of the road transport system. Yet, the factors that drivers state impact on their decision to engage with distracting technologies are less well known. This paper presents the first diary study into driver distraction. The study asked drivers to record all technological distractions that they engaged with across a 4-week period, as well as interactions that they ignored or choose not to engage with. The diary entries include the technologies drivers interacted with and the conditions surrounding this, as well as external factors that drivers cited to influence their decision to interact. Primarily, factors relating to the task itself were found to be of most importance to the drivers’ decision to engage. Differences were also found in how drivers stated they compensated for any engagement with distracting tasks. This has important consequences for the design and integration of technological devices into the vehicle. The novel application of the method offers insights into the naturalistic conditions surrounding drivers’ involvement with distracting technologies. The method is also reviewed on its applicability to the study of driver distraction.",1369-8478,Not found
Gaze behavior during urban cycling: Effects of subjective risk perception and vista space properties,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.007,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"In this research, we investigate how gaze behavior during urban cycling is affected by subjective risk perception and the local spatial configuration. For this purpose, participants cycled at five defined test locations while wearing a mobile eye tracking system. Next to the fixation duration, we extracted sight vector lengths (i.e., the distance between the current body location and the gaze location) and gaze angles (i.e., the degree to which the gaze deviates from the current travel direction). Concerning risk perception, participants provided a hazard estimate for each test location, as well as information about specific areas they experienced as dangerous. This information was aggregated into a local hazard level across all participants. Finally, the vista space (i.e., the space visible from the current position during a fixation) was quantified via isovist analysis. The results imply that spatially open locations, extending about equally into all directions, increase the level of perceived risk. Depending on the local spatial properties, participants also gaze into different directions, rather than further ahead and into their travel direction. Higher cycling experience and greater familiarity with a location enabled a more foresighted and focused gaze behavior. Our findings underline the importance to provide cyclists not only with enough space and with unobstructed views, but also to limit the space they are required to distribute their attention to.",1369-8478,Not found
A comparison of computational driver models using naturalistic and test-track data from cyclist-overtaking manoeuvres,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.020,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The improvement of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and their safety assessment rely on the understanding of scenario-dependent driving behaviours, such as steering to avoid collisions. This study compares driver models that predict when a driver starts steering away to overtake a cyclist on rural roads. The comparison is among four models: a threshold model, an accumulator model, and two models inspired by a proportional-integral and proportional-integral-derivative controller. These models were tested and cross-applied using two different datasets: one from a naturalistic driving (ND) study and one from a test-track (TT) experiment. Two perceptual variables, expansion rate (the horizontal angular expansion rate of the image of the lead road user on the driver’s retina) and inverse tau (the ratio between the image’s expansion rate and its horizontal optical size), were tested as input to the models. A linear cost function is proposed that can obtain the optimal parameters of the models by computationally efficient linear programming. The results show that the models based on inverse tau fitted the data better than the models that included expansion rate. In general, the models fitted the ND data reasonably well, but not as well the TT data. For the ND data, the models including an accumulative component outperformed the threshold model. For the TT data, due to the poorer fit of the models, more analysis is required to determine the merit of the models. The models fitted to TT data captured the overall pattern of steering onsets in the ND data rather well, but with a persistent bias, probably due to the drivers employing a more cautious strategy in TT. The models compared in this paper may support the virtual safety assessment of ADAS so that driver behaviour may be considered in the design and evaluation of new safety systems.",1369-8478,Not found
To share or not to share: A theoretically guided investigation of factors predicting intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.010,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This study applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to assess individuals’ intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles when they become publicly available. In addition, perceived trust was assessed to examine the extent to which this variable could account for additional variance in intentions above the TPB constructs of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control (PBC). Further, and also guided by the TPB, the study explored the differences in behavioural, normative, and control beliefs between individuals who reported high intentions to use automated passenger shuttles in the future (high intenders) and individuals who reported low intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles in the future (low intenders). Participants (N = 438; 64% female) aged between 17 and 84 years (Mage = 35.42 years) were asked to complete an online questionnaire which took approximately 15 min. The findings revealed that attitudes, subjective norms, and PBC were significant positive predictors of intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles when they become publicly available. When perceived trust was added to the hierarchical regression, this variable was shown to account for additional significant variance in intentions above the TPB constructs and was shown to be a significant positive predictor of intentions. Further, the results revealed significant differences in beliefs held by high and low intenders. Specifically, high intenders held significantly more positive beliefs towards fully automated shared passenger shuttles than low intenders. In turn, low intenders held significantly more negative beliefs towards these vehicles than high intenders. Overall, these findings provide support for the utility of the TPB in examining individuals’ intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles when they become publicly available.",1369-8478,Not found
Methodological considerations for longitudinal investigations of young drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.005,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Introduction Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are the leading cause of mortality among teenagers. Teen driving research has a longstanding history; however, much of this work is cross-sectional. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development funded a study, REACT ( R oadway E xperiences and A ttentional C hange in T eens) which combined factorial and longitudinal designs to investigate the independent and joint effects of age and driving experience on driving attention over time among young drivers. Method Longitudinal methods offer important contributions to teen driving research by enabling characterization of driving trajectories. This paper describes methodological considerations for longitudinal studies of teen drivers. Such considerations are organized into overarching themes, including population, recruitment, enrollment, and retention, throughout this paper. These considerations were compiled as a combination of our own experiences in REACT and previous literature. We elaborate on these considerations below to illustrate the value of each consideration. Results Issues encountered are discussed and strategies for dealing with various issues are described. Transportation barriers, scheduling difficulties, and skipped study milestones were among the most frequent challenges; we outline these and other issues encountered in REACT and corresponding considerations for such issues in Table 2. Sharing these experiences should aid future longitudinal investigations of young drivers, which are critically needed to reduce teen MVCs. Conclusions Studies similar to REACT are considerable undertakings due to the comprehensive nature of longitudinal design. Such investigations must maintain a delicate balance between appropriate amounts of rigor and flexibility in the development of thoroughly defined research questions and theoretically driven frameworks. Key considerations that have contributed to the success of REACT are outlined, challenges encountered throughout data collection are documented, and recommendations based on choices made and lessons learned to inform future longitudinal investigations on young drivers are provided.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors influencing driver behaviour along curved merging interchange terminals,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.006,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Problem statement . To promote safe and comfortable driving operations, design manuals and policies call for merging terminal ramps to be built along straight roadway sections. However, this prescription may need to be overlooked when there is no alternative to terminals being designed along curves. This study aims to assess the impact of design factors on driver behaviour along curved acceleration terminals with continue or reverse curvature prior to joining the motorway. Methodology. A driving simulation experiment was conducted to observe longitudinal and transversal driver behaviour when certain factors (i.e., radius, ramp length, motorway curve direction, and traffic conditions along the motorway segment) were manipulated. The forty-eight drivers involved were separated into groups based on age and gender. Results. The motorway radius has a significant impact on longitudinal performance, while traffic volume impacts on the merging point where vehicles enter the adjoining motorway lane. Compared to linear terminals, the merging abscissa need to be longer on curved ones so as to compensate for the blind spot and enable drivers to identify and accept gaps between vehicles in the traffic flow. The ramp-terminal connection type influences the speed at the beginning of the terminal, the position of the merging point and transversal driver behaviour. Conclusions. Although some limitations in the study were necessary to limit their impact on the experimental design, the results here may prove useful when considering the adoption of appropriate engineering countermeasures at the design stage of entry terminals along curved motorway segments.",1369-8478,Not found
"Reducing uncertainty by anticipation in traffic – The effect of situational characteristics and criticality on behavioral, subjective, and psychophysiological parameters",10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.004,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Uncertainty in traffic may have fatal consequences when operating a vehicle. Enabling drivers to anticipate the behavior of other traffic participants can help reduce uncertainty and thus increase traffic safety. A multi-method approach using behavioral, subjective, and psychophysiological measures was applied to investigate the relation of uncertainty and anticipation. Participants (N = 30) observed simulated, video-based urban traffic scenarios while skin conductance responses were recorded. They had to indicate, by pressing a button, (1) the moment they first thought another vehicle might merge into their lane (low certainty anticipation) and (2) the moment they were sure another vehicle would merge (high certainty anticipation). Situational characteristics served as anticipatory cues that helped predict the other vehicle’s action. On the one hand, in this study, target cues (which are clearly related to the target’s activity) served to indicate an imminent lane change. On the other hand, context cues represented visible precursors in the traffic environment, e.g. a traffic sign pointing to upcoming road work. In addition, causal cues were used to determine a reason for the other vehicle to change lanes (in this instance, a construction site blocking the lane). These situational characteristics, as well as the situational criticality, were manipulated to gain insights into factors influencing the process of anticipation. Results offered an effect of target cue moderated by criticality: especially in more critical situations, the anticipation rate and subjective certainty increased, and physiological activation was reduced with target cues. Overall, the anticipatory performance was found to be a predictor of subjective certainty (through its impact on skin conductance responses). The findings are discussed in the context of the methodological approach for applications in traffic.",1369-8478,Not found
Mild functional decline and driving performance of older drivers without a diagnosed dementia: Study of leukoaraiosis and cognitive function,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.016,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Motor vehicle collisions involving older drivers have increased and become an important social issue. It is known that the decline of cognitive function, including dementia, affects driving performance. A series of studies using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and other tests of dementia have attempted to prevent motor vehicle collisions by identifying as early as possible older drivers who may be unable to maintain their driving performance. Further, the performance of older drivers may deteriorate even if they do not have a diagnosis of dementia. Therefore we focused on the relationship between cognitive functioning assessed by the MMSE and diagnosis of leukoaraiosis (LA), or changes in the cerebral white matter, with different aspects of driving behavior resulting from aging. Qualified driving instructors evaluated participants’ driving behaviors on an outdoor driving course at a driving school. Visual search duration and angle at intersections were obtained by wearable wireless sensors. Vehicle speed and minimum vehicle speed were recorded from vehicle speed pulse signals. Duration of signaling and visual searches at unsignalized intersections were recorded using an in-vehicle camera. We assessed instructors’ evaluations and the scores on two instruments to evaluate the effects of MMSE scores and the grade of LA on driving performance were verified. The results suggest that lower MMSE scores and higher LA grade can predict some aspects of poor driving performance in older drivers before they experience dementia or an evident decline in cognitive functioning. Based on these results, we discuss countermeasures that may prevent motor vehicle collisions involving older drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of auditory continual feedback on take-overs in Level 3 automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.003,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Objective To implement auditory continual feedback into the interface design of a Level 3 automated vehicle and to test whether gaze behavior and reaction times of drivers improved in take-over situations. Background When required to assume manual control in take-over situations, drivers of Level 3 automated vehicles are less likely than conventional drivers to spot potential hazards, and their reaction time is longer. Therefore, it is crucial that the interface of Level 3 automated vehicles will be designed to improve drivers’ performance in take-over situations. Method In two experiments, participants drove a simulated route in a Level 3 automated vehicle for 35 min with one imminent take-over event. Participants’ gaze behavior and performance in an imminent take-over event were monitored under one of three auditory interface designs: (1) Continual feedback. A system that provides verbal driving-related feedback; (2) Persistent feedback. A system that provides verbal driving-related feedback and a persistent beep; and (3) Chatter feedback. A system that provides verbal non-driving-related feedback. Also, there was a control group without feedback. Results Under all three auditory feedback designs, the number of drivers' on-road glances increased compared to no feedback, but none of the designs shortened reaction time to the imminent event. Conclusion Increasing the number of on-road glances during automated driving does not necessarily improve drivers’ attention to the road and their reaction times during take-overs. Application Possible implications for the effectiveness of auditory continual feedback should be considered when designing interfaces for Level 3 automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Self-reported pedestrian behaviour in Australia,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.002,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Internationally, there have been a number of self-reported questionnaires developed to classify pedestrians’ engagement in aberrant behaviours while walking. However, there is yet to be consensus regarding the most appropriate factor structure for these models. Furthermore, to our knowledge, a pedestrian behaviour questionnaire (PBQ) has not been validated to investigate Australian pedestrians. As such, the aim of this research was to build on the previous international instances of pedestrian behaviour questionnaires and validate a questionnaire for a cohort of Australians. Nine hundred and sixty eight participants (80.8% female) completed an online survey which included 128 items describing pedestrian behaviour, identified in international versions of PBQs. A split half analysis was conducted to determine the most appropriate configuration of the scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis conducted on half of the sample identified a 32-item four factor model of pedestrian behaviour. These factors broadly described unintentional errors, deliberate violations, aggression and engagement with technology. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the remaining sample confirmed the proposed factor structure. Across the four factors, pedestrians reported low mean scores for all items; indicating that errors, violations, technology engagement and aggression were rarely exhibited behaviours. The highest mean scores were for engagement with technology. While the least common pedestrian behaviours were errors while walking. Male participants were found to self-report higher rates of all behaviours, while age was negatively associated with violations, errors and technology engagement. Overall, the research presents a validated measure of aberrant pedestrian behaviour in Australia.",1369-8478,Not found
Understanding the impact of heterogeneous rider preferences on a shared autonomous vehicle system,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.017,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"In a ride pooling system, riders may have varied behaviors in seeking pooled or non-pooled rides. It is important to understand the effect of these rider behaviors on the system performance in order to formulate policies to guide ride pooling implementation. Existing literature modeling ride pooling systems using agent-based models only considers the extreme cases in which riders either all participate or not participate in pooling. However, the pooling behaviors could be more complex. This study segments the rides in the system into five types (non-pooling only, non-pooling preferred, indifferent, pooling preferred, and pooling only). We use an agent-based model to simulate these preferences in a system of pooled autonomous vehicles. We use mixture experiments to vary the proportion of riders within these five types and build models to study the interactions among the rider types in terms of the system’s service quality and environmental performance. The results show that higher service level is achieved when all riders in the system are open to pooling, with 30% of pooling only riders and 70% of pooling preferred or indifferent riders providing the maximum value. The results can help formulate incentives and policies to promote ride pooling participation to improve ride pooling system performance.",1369-8478,Not found
Intention of Chinese college students to use carsharing: An application of the theory of planned behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.021,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Carsharing originated in Europe and then expanded to developed countries such as the United States. With the revival and popularity of the “Sharing Economy,” carsharing has remarkably increased in China in recent years. Carsharing has increased convenience for individuals without private cars and is changing the traditional view of car ownership. Chinese college students are a large, highly educated group with low incomes and low rates of car ownership. Understanding the determinants of Chinese college students' intention to carshare is critical to promote carsharing services. In this research, an expanded version of the theory of planned behavior, which contains environmental concern, is the theoretical research framework. The model was empirically tested by using the questionnaire data of 356 college students from four universities in Qingdao, China. The results indicate that subjective norm and the perceived behavioral control are directly and positively associated with Chinese college students’ intention to use carsharing, and attitude and environmental concern have no direct correlation with the intention. Environmental concern has a significant direct effect on attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. In addition, environmental concern indirectly impacts Chinese college students’ intention to use carsharing through subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. The findings yield practical insights for carsharing organizations and transportation planners. Based on these results, limitations of this study and suggestions for further research are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring expert perceptions about the cyber security and privacy of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: A thematic analysis approach,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.019,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) constitute an automotive development carrying paradigm-shifting potential that may soon be embedded into a dynamically changing urban mobility landscape. The complex machine-led dynamics of CAVs make them more prone to data exploitation and vulnerable to cyber attacks than any of their predecessors increasing the risks of privacy breaches and cyber security violations for their users. This can adversely affect the public acceptability of CAVs, give them a bad reputation at this embryonic stage of their development, create barriers to their adoption and increased use, and complicate the business models of their future operations. Therefore, it is vital to identify and create an in-depth understanding of the cyber security and privacy issues associated with CAVs, and of the way these can be prioritised and addressed. This work employs 36 semi-structured elite interviews to explore the diverse dimensions of user acceptance through the lens of the well-informed CAV experts that already anticipate problems and look for their solutions. Our international interviewee sample represents academia, industry and policy-making so that all the key stakeholder voices are heard. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors that reflect and affect CAV acceptance in relation to the privacy and cyber security agendas. Six core themes emerged: awareness, user and vendor education, safety, responsibility, legislation, and trust. Each of these themes has diverse and distinctive dimensions and are discussed as sub-themes. We recommend that mitigating the cyber security and privacy risks embedded in CAVs require inter-institutional cooperation, awareness campaigns and trials for trust-building purposes, mandatory educational training for manufacturers and perhaps more importantly for end-users, balanced and fair responsibility-sharing, two-way dynamic communication channels and a clear consensus on what constitutes threats and solutions.",1369-8478,Not found
Are they really interested but concerned? A mixed methods exploration of the Geller bicyclist typology,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.018,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The Geller typology, which categorizes the population into four types of bicyclists (strong and fearless, enthused and confident, interested but concerned, and no way no how) has gained considerable popularity amongst researchers and planners. One large U.S. study used a survey-derived approach to categorize respondents into Geller’s typology, and found the majority of Americans were “interested but concerned”. While the U.S. findings are widely cited in planning documents, there has yet to be an assessment as to whether this indirect survey-derived categorization into Geller’s typology corresponds with how bicyclists perceive themselves. Using a mixed methods approach, we explored the Geller typology from the view of bicyclists themselves. Our specific objectives were to assess whether the survey-derived categorization method aligned with bicyclists’ perceptions, and to also examine bicyclists’ interpretations of Geller’s typology. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of bicyclists (n = 281) and interviews with a subset of participants (n = 25). According to the survey-derived categorization, the distribution of the sample (n = 25) was: 4% strong and fearless, 12% enthused and confident, and 84% interested but concerned. In the interviews we learned there was only a match between survey-derived and self-perceived bicyclist type for seven of twenty-five (28%) participants. When asked, participants were more likely to categorize themselves to strong and fearless (24% overall) or enthused and confident (52% overall). Our findings suggest that the category titles are intuitive, however, the survey-derived categorization does not necessarily match with how bicyclists perceive themselves. This suggests that, at least for those who currently bicycle, a direct approach of asking people which type of bicyclist they identify with may be preferable.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of a child bike seat and trailer on the objective overtaking behaviour of motorized vehicles passing cyclists,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.014,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Introduction The lateral clearance distance of a motorized vehicle while overtaking a cyclist is a key indicator of safety. This lateral clearance distance has never been measured for cyclists transporting a child. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the behaviour of motorized vehicles in overtaking cyclists with and without a child on the same bicycle. Methods The lateral clearance distance of the overtaking manoeuvres of motorized vehicles was measured using an instrumented bicycle when performing 19 cycling trips on one single road with two different types of cycling infrastructure (a bike lane and shared lane marking) in the Brussels Capital Region (Belgium). Mixed effect regression was used to examine the effect of cycling condition (cyclist without a child [control], cyclist with a child bike seat and cyclist with a child bike trailer) and secondary independent variables (i.e. cycling infrastructure, peak traffic hours and traffic density) on the lateral clearance distance. Results The mean lateral clearance distance in ‘cyclists without child’ was significantly smaller (117.3 cm) than in ‘cyclists with child’ (128.8 cm) (95%CI [7.2;15.9]). Looking at ‘morning peak traffic hours’ (i.e. 7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) a cyclist with child bike seat was overtaken at greater lateral clearance distances than a cyclist with a child bike trailer or a cyclist without child (p=0.041). Furthermore, the percentage of passing manoeuvres under 100 cm was significantly higher in ‘cyclist without child’ (35.3%) in comparison to ‘cyclist with child bike seat’ (21.8%) and ‘cyclist with child bike trailer’ (21.8%) (Chi2=29.19, p<0.001). No significant differences were found between a shared lane marking and bike lane. Conclusion Drivers of motorized vehicles do adapt their overtaking manoeuvre when they overtake cyclists transporting a child, keeping greater and therefore safer lateral clearance distances. In morning peak traffic hours and/or crowded circumstances the child bike seat can be considered as the safest way to transport a child in terms of lateral clearance distance. In general, with 25.3% overtaking manoeuvres under 100cm, police should monitor compliance with the traffic rules with regard to cyclists, and motorists should be more aware of the overtaking traffic rules.",1369-8478,https://github.com/soukhova/Transportation-lit-review
Effects of route familiarity on drivers’ psychological conditions: Based on driving behaviour and driving environment,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.005,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Route familiarity affects a driver’s mental state and indirectly affects traffic safety; however, this important factor is easily overlooked. Previous research on route familiarity has only analysed psychological states in terms of unfamiliarity and familiarity, the influence of driving behaviour and driving environment on psychological states has been ignored. As a result, the mechanisms through which the route familiarity influence driver psychological states, and vice versa, are unclear. This study proposes a quantitative framework for studying driver psychological condition and route familiarity using experimental data from a real driving task and driving environment data. The experimental data included 1022 observations obtained by 23 participants over 7 consecutive trials on 6 unfamiliar experimental routes with large differences in scenarios; environmental data were automatically extracted after segmenting a driving video through the Dilated Residual NetWorks model. The results reveal that (1) the relationship between the driver’s psychological condition and route familiarity is not monotonic and is different for straight and turning sections; (2) the driver’s psychological condition is influenced by the visual scene elements and the type of road section, and the results of the multivariate regression analysis quantified the variability of the influence; and (3) unlike a majority of findings on distracted driving, our study suggest that the driver’s attention to the external environment in the urban distracted driving state will gradually approach a ‘distraction threshold’, and the time and size of the ‘distraction threshold’ are influenced by the driver. This study can further the development of urban traffic safety research and help urban designers plan and improve urban landscapes to ensure drivers maintain stable mental states when they drive.",1369-8478,Not found
Identification of driving simulator sessions of depressed drivers: A comparison between aggregated and time-series classification,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.015,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Depression has been found to significantly increase the probability of risky driving and involvement in traffic collisions. The majority of studies correlating depressive symptoms with driving, pursue to predict the differences in driving behavior if the driver has already been diagnosed. Little evidence can be found, however, on how mental and psychological disorders can be identified from driving data, and usually analyses utilize simple models and aggregated data. This study aims at utilizing microscopic data from a driving simulator to detect sessions belonging to “depressed” drivers by utilizing powerful machine learning classifiers. Driving simulator sessions from 11 older drivers with symptoms of depression and 65 healthy drivers were utilized towards that aim. Random Forests, an ensemble classifier, with proven efficiency among transportation applications, are then trained on highly disaggregated data describing the mean and standard deviation of speed and lateral or longitudinal acceleration of drivers in the simulator. The kinematic data were aggregated in 30-seconds, 1-minute and 5-minute intervals, but the corresponding time-series of the measurements were also taken into account. Furthermore, classifiers were treated with imbalanced learning techniques to address the scarcity of depressed drivers among the healthy. Time-series of mean speed and the standard deviation of longitudinal acceleration even with a duration of 30-seconds have proven to be the best predictors of driving sessions belonging to depressed drivers with a very low rate of false alarms. The results outperform previous approaches, and indicate that naturalistic driving data or deep learning could prove even more efficient in detecting depression.",1369-8478,Not found
On-to-off-path gaze shift cancellations lead to gaze concentration in cognitively loaded car drivers: A simulator study exploring gaze patterns in relation to a cognitive task and the traffic environment,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.013,75,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Appropriate visual behaviour is necessary for safe driving. Many previous studies have found that when performing non-visual cognitive tasks, drivers typically display an increased amount of on-path glances, along with a deteriorated visual scanning pattern towards potential hazards at locations outside their future travel path (off-path locations). This is often referred to as a gaze concentration effect. However, what has not been explored is more precisely how and when gaze concentration arises in relation to the cognitive task, and to what extent the timing of glances towards traffic-situation relevant off-path locations is affected. To investigate these specific topics, a driving simulator study was carried out. Car drivers’ visual behaviour during execution of a cognitive task (n-back) was studied during two traffic scenarios; one when driving through an intersection and one when passing a hidden exit. Aside from the expected gaze concentration effect, several novel findings that may explain this effect were observed. It was found that gaze shifts from an on-path to an off-path location were inhibited during increased cognitive load. However, gaze shifts in the other direction, that is, from an off-path to an on-path location, remained unaffected. This resulted in on-path glances increasing in duration, while off-path glances decreased in number. Furthermore, the inhibited off-path glances were typically not compensated for later. That is, off-path glances were cancelled, not delayed. This was the case both in relation to the cognitive task (near-term) and the traffic environment (far-term). There was thus a general reduction in the number of glances towards situationally relevant off-path locations, but the timing of the remaining glances was unaffected. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind gaze concentration and can contribute to both understanding and prediction of safety relevant effects of cognitive load in car drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Beliefs about riding a bicycle when mildly alcohol intoxicated,10.1016/j.trf.2020.09.012,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Alcohol intoxication appears to be a contributing factor to many bicycle crashes with serious consequences. Despite this, there is no specific limit on the blood alcohol concentration permissible when cycling in Sweden, and there is very little knowledge of the perception of sobriety associated with cycling. The aim of this study is therefore to identify the behavioural, normative, and control beliefs underpinning cyclists’ attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control associated with riding a bicycle when mildly alcohol intoxicated. A total of 34 participants answered questions based on the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). The results indicate that the participants saw great advantages (practical, free, safe, nice, and better than taking the car), but also disadvantages (impaired ability, danger to oneself, and danger to others) from cycling when mildly alcohol intoxicated. Furthermore, they identified both factors making it easier (small amounts of alcohol, bicycle-friendly infrastructure/conditions, poor alternatives, group pressure, and emergency situations) and more difficult (large amounts of alcohol, aggravating circumstances, bicycle-unfriendly infrastructure/conditions, good alternatives, social censure, group resistance, parenthood, and experience) to opt to cycle when mildly alcohol intoxicated. Finally, some participants believed that certain people (e.g. students, people with poor finances, and nearly everyone) think that it is acceptable to cycle when mildly alcohol intoxicated, while others (e.g. parents, responsible people, and nearly no group) think that it is unacceptable. These results support the use of information dissemination/campaigns to reduce the incidence of cycling when alcohol intoxicated and/or the amount of alcohol consumed in connection with cycling. At the same time, they do not support the introduction of a specific limit on the blood alcohol concentration permissible when cycling, and the potential of improved public transport to reduce the number of inebriated cyclists is uncertain.",1369-8478,Not found
On-road study investigating the mode of feedback delivery on young drivers’ speed management,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.009,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Feedback has been shown to be instrumental in learning. Refining how it is delivered in driver training has the potential to reduce crash risk. Therefore, theaim of the present study was to examine the effect of the medium in which feedback is delivered (verbal, written, graphical) on young drivers’ speed management behaviour. Sixty young drivers, randomly allocated to one of four feedback groups (i.e., Control, Verbal feedback, Written feedback, and Graphical feedback) completed one training and two test drives using an instrumented vehicle on-road. After the first (baseline) drive, participants were provided feedback about the number of times they exceeded the speed limit, their maximum speed, as well as the financial penalties associated with such driving behaviour, and safety implications. The content of feedback remained the same for all training groups, except for the manner in which the feedback was presented. Verbal feedback was provided verbally by the researcher; written feedback on paper; and graphical feedback using a series of graphs on a computer screen. Control received no such intervention. Two test drives followed, one immediate post-training, and the second one week post-training. Feedback, irrespective of medium improved young drivers’ speed management. Verbal andgraphical feedback yielded the greatest reduction in speeding behaviour, with graphical feedback having the most impact in the two speed zones under examination (50 km/h & 80 km/h). Control showed the poorest speed management behaviour in all drives.These findings have important implications for the development of a new approach to improve young drivers’ speed management behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found

There are several measures of driving anxiety, but their psychometric properties in non-clinical samples have not been adequately researched. The present study investigated the psychometric properties of three measures of driving anxiety, the Driving Cognitions Questionnaire (DCQ), Driving Situations Questionnaire (DSQ), and Driving Behavior Survey (DBS). In total, 420 participants from the New Zealand electoral roll completed a survey containing the three measures of driving anxiety, a measure of aberrant driving behaviour (the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire) and demographic and descriptive variables. The three driving anxiety scales demonstrated strong concurrent validity and the DSQ had strong discriminant validity. However, the discriminant validity findings for the DCQ and DBS were mixed.

A comparison of experienced and novice drivers’ rear-end collision avoidance maneuvers under urgent decelerating events,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.009,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"A leading vehicle’s sudden deceleration can lead to a rear-end collision. Due to a lack of driving experience, novice drivers have a greater tendency to be involved in these accidents. Most previous studies have examined driver response time and braking behaviors, but few researchers have focused on what experienced and novice drivers did after their feet touched the braking pedal and their hands turned the steering wheel. These braking and steering parameters are essential in understanding driver avoidance behavior during emergencies. We programmed rear-end crash risk scenarios to examine experienced and novice drivers’ behaviors thoroughly using a driving simulator. Twenty experienced and twenty five novice subjects participated in our experiments, and their braking and steering maneuvers were recorded when leading vehicles ran at 60 km/h, 80 km/h and 100 km/h. The results showed that the two groups of subjects tended to execute two kinds of maneuvers to avoid crashes: braking only (novice 33%, experienced 19%) and the combination of braking with steering (novice 22%, experienced 26%). When the novice drivers executed braking with steering, their response time and steering duration were significantly longer than those of the experienced drivers who executed braking with steering. As the speed increased, the novice drivers’ response time, maximum braking force and maximum steering angle were significantly affected. These results showed that novice drivers should brake only when the leading vehicle suddenly decelerates. The experienced drivers executed steadier maneuvers. Their risk perception time was shorter, and their maximum braking force and the maximum steering angles were smaller. The response time, braking intensity and steering wheel angle should be considered when developing rear-end collision warning systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Challenges for automated vehicle driver training: A thematic analysis from manual and automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.011,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Considerable research and resources are going into the development and testing of Automated Vehicles. They are expected to bring society a huge number of benefits (such as: improved safety, increased capacity, reduced fuel use and emissions). Notwithstanding these potential benefits, there have also been a number of high-profile collisions involving Automated Vehicles on the road. In the majority of these cases, the driver’s inattention to the vehicle and road environment was blamed as a significant causal factor. This suggests that solutions need to be developed in order to enhance the benefits and address the challenges associated with Automated Vehicles. One such solution is driver training. As drivers still require manual driving skills when operating Automated Vehicles on the road, this paper applied the grounded theory approach to identify eight “key” themes and interconnections that exist in current manual vehicle driver training. These themes were then applied to the limited literature available on Automated Vehicle driver training, and a ninth theme of trust emerged. This helped to identify a set of training requirements for drivers of Automated Vehicles, which suggests that a multifaceted approach (covering all nine themes and manual and Automated Vehicle driving skills) to driver training is required. This framework can be used to develop and test a training programme for drivers of Automated Vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Hours-of-service compliance and safety outcomes among long-haul truck drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.017,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Introduction U.S. long-haul truck drivers (LHTD) experience the most work-related fatalities of any occupation. Hours-of-service (HOS) regulations constitute key public policies aimed at improving safety outcomes; however, little is known about the factors that are associated with HOS compliance, and questions remain about the efficacy of HOS laws in improving safety. This study seeks to identify factors associated with HOS compliance and to determine the significance of HOS compliance in sleep-related safety risk. Materials and methods Using cross-sectional survey data from 260 U.S. LHTD that measured demographic, work organization, sleep health, hours-of-service compliance, and sleep-related safety performance characteristics, we: 1) compiled descriptive statistics to summarize the variables included in this study; 2) performed bivariate correlation analyses between an HOS composite variable called “Hours-of-Service Violations” and the demographic, work organization, and sleep health variables; 3) conducted an ordinal logistic regression analysis, using the HOS composite variable as the outcome variable; and 4) conducted a multinomial logistic regression analysis, using a sleep-related safety performance composite variable called “Sleep-Related Safety Risk” as the outcome variable. Results Higher scores on the HOS composite variable were significantly associated with more miles driven per week, longer daily work hours, a higher frequency of a fast pace of work, shorter sleep duration, and poorer sleep quality. Statistically significant predictor variables in the Hours-of-Service Violations composite variable model were driving less than 2,500 miles per week (OR = 0.53), working less than 11 h daily (OR = 0.19) or between 11 and 13 h daily (OR = 0.43); a lower frequency of fast pace of work (OR = 0.42); and worknight sleep duration (OR = 0.80). Fewer than 11 h of work daily (OR = 0.37), a higher perception of supervisor support (OR = 0.17), and ever having told supervisor about being too tired to drive (OR = 0.42) were significant predictors in the Sleep-Related Safety Risk composite variable model, while the hours-of-service compliance variables were not. Conclusions Reducing daily work hours and pace of work, strengthening driver-supervisor relationships and improving supervisor leadership and risk management techniques, making driver compensation fairer, and revisiting HOS policies may represent high-leverage targets for improving regulatory compliance and safety outcomes.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of forward collision warning technology in different pre-crash scenarios,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.004,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The forward collision warning (FCW) system is expected to reduce rear-end crashes; however, its effects on driving behavior and safety have not been thoroughly investigated, specifically the effect variations between different pre-crash scenarios. To identify these variations, this study conducted a driving simulator experiment and compared the FCW’s effects between three pre-crash scenarios: the freeway scenario, the arterial scenario and the intersection dilemma zone scenario. Thirty-nine participants were involved in the experiment. The results showed that the adaptation of driver behavior in impending rear-end collision events resulted from both the FCW and the scenario. The intersection dilemma zone scenario has indications of slowing down, which encouraged drivers to take a more aggressive response strategy under the FCW; the arterial scenario might be regarded as an “easy-to-handle” situation in which a significant portion of drivers adopted moderate level of response strategy under the FCW; both the intersection dilemma zone scenario and freeway scenario have burdened driving tasks, and this might deteriorate a driver’s ability to adapt to the FCW. In addition, different types of drivers experienced varied benefits from the FCW in each scenario. The FCW would be particularly recommended for non-experienced drivers in the freeway scenario and for female drivers in the arterial scenario; moreover, in the scenario of the intersection dilemma zone, the FCW would be particularly recommended for drivers who have a crash/citation before. The results also support specific FCW designs which are able to highlight the collision risk. This study demonstrated that it would be better to indicate the effects of the FCW under the restriction of specific scenario features and develop the FCW based on that.",1369-8478,Not found
Acceptance of visual and audio interventions for distracted pedestrians,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.001,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Distraction from mobile devices increases pedestrian risks at intersections. Innovative interventions are currently installed at road and rail intersections to alert pedestrians. These interventions will be effective only if pedestrians modify their behaviour. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) posits that behaviour changes as a result of behavioural intention, which is affected by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. However, the link between intention and actual behaviour is often overlooked. The current study aims to investigate this link and apply this theoretical framework to interventions for distracted pedestrians. We conducted a day-time field study at three railway level crossings in New Zealand with such interventions reminding pedestrians to look for trains: in-ground flashing lights located at footpath level, an audio warning message, and in-ground flashing lights combined with the audio warning message. Participants (N = 34, Mean age 33.6, SD = 8.6 years) walked through level crossings while performing a distractor task (visual and auditory distraction) or when not distracted. Actively checking for trains from both sides of the crossing was used as a measure of actual behaviour. All three interventions were perceived as useful (5.1 ± 0.4) and easy to use (5.6 ± 0.2) and resulted in positive intention to use the technology (5.8 ± 0.3). Statistical analyses confirmed that the TAM constructs - particularly perceived usefulness - affected intention, and intentions lead to behavioural change with improved crossing behaviours. This study highlights the importance of perceived usefulness and intentions to use the interventions with reducing distracted pedestrian behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found

This paper focuses on the use of recently established autonomous buses (self-driving electric shuttle buses) running along a regular public transport line in a residential area of Oslo, Norway. We use a mixed-methods approach based on survey and interview data from two independent studies. The paper examines intentions to use autonomous buses before and after these were introduced in the case area as well as how passengers experience traveling by autonomous bus. Results show that the intention to use the autonomous buses was mostly positive both before and after using them. Most users felt safe while traveling by autonomous bus. Two suggestions for improvement made by the users were to: increase the speed and reduce the abrupt breaking of the autonomous buses. Overall, outcomes from this paper suggest that residents would be willing to use autonomous buses if these offer more frequent bus departures than the existing ones. However, as full automation has not been achieved yet and there is a host on board who can control the vehicle if necessary, passenger experiences and intentions to use should be reassessed with fully automated buses in future studies.",1369-8478,Not found
"Effect of advanced driver-assistance system trainings on driver workload, knowledge, and trust",10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.003,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Older adults are more likely to get severely injured or die in vehicle crashes. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can reduce their risk of crashes; however, due to the lack of knowledge and training, usage rate of these systems among older drivers is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of two ADAS training approaches (i.e., video-based and demonstration-based training) on older drivers’ subjective and objective measures of mental workload, knowledge and trust considering drivers’ demographic information. Twenty older adults, balanced by gender, participated in a driving simulation study. Results indicated that the video-based training might be more effective for females in reducing their mental workload while driving, whereas the demonstration-based training could be more beneficial for males. There was no significant difference between the video-based and demonstration-based trainings in terms of drivers’ trust and knowledge of automation. The findings suggested that ADAS training protocols can potentially be more effective if they are tailored to specific driver demographics.",1369-8478,Not found
"Planning for driving retirement: The effect of driving perceptions, driving events, and assessment of driving alternatives",10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.007,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Most older adults will eventually stop driving, but few engage in planning for driving retirement. This study assessed whether driving stress, enjoyment, confidence, concerning driving events, and assessment of driving alternatives influence planning. Demographic factors were also included. Data were collected via a mailed transportation survey, with a final sample of 551 older adults who currently drive. Linear regression analyses revealed that more driving retirement planning was associated with greater driving stress, less driving confidence, and a more positive view of driving alternatives. Driving enjoyment and recent concerning driving events were not significantly related. Among the control variables, race and income were significantly related to planning, suggesting that lower income and identifying as Black race were associated with more planning. Gender only approached significance, suggesting that females may plan more than males. Overall, these findings suggest that more driving retirement planning is warranted. Some of the groups known to be at increased risk for driving reduction and cessation plan more for that eventuality than their counterparts.

Analysis of the occurrence and severity of vehicle-pedestrian conflicts in marked and unmarked crosswalks through naturalistic driving study,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.008,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Background Although many studies have been conducted on the safety of pedestrian crossings, few researches have been focused on drivers' behavior in unmarked crosswalk and marked crosswalk areas. Considering that statistics of pedestrian accidents are not the same in the two types of crossing area, based on the last report of the World Health Organization, it is very critical to evaluate driver yielding behavior to determine the differences in the actions of drivers when encountering pedestrians in the two areas. Methods This study was conducted based on surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) collected through a Naturalistic Driving Study on 52 participants in Iran. The study was carried out from April 2017 to April 2018 using the installation of cameras in the private vehicle of the participants. The analysis of the recorded films showed that 956 conflicts have occurred in unmarked crosswalks and 392 conflicts in marked crosswalks, respectively. Results A model was developed for driver yielding behavior using binary logistic regression, and showed that yielding rates in unmarked crosswalsk were about fifty percent of the yielding rates in marked crosswalks. Based on the model, it is indicated that the aggressive behavior of pedestrians during the crossing, such as running, zigzag and diagonal crossing, as well as the late detection of pedestrians by drivers resulting from high-speed driving in the unmarked crossing areas, will reduce the yielding behavior rate. Also, using the Swedish traffic conflicts technique, the severity of the conflicts was classified into four general categories: encounter, potential, slight, and serious conflict, through 30 different levels on the basis of conflicting speed and time to the accident. The results showed that pedestrians behavior during conflicts of the group “encounter” and drivers’ behavior during conflicts of the groups of “potential”, “slight” and “serious”, were the principal factors in preventing collision through an evasive maneuver. The results showed that increasing the level of conflict severity, which indicates an increase of the conflicting speed and a decrease of the time remaining to point of a possible collision with pedestrian, causes drivers to yield a harsh-maneuver to prevent collision. Soft-maneuvers such as deceleration and acceleration, as well as harsh-maneuvers such as changing the lane/stop during conflicts were most driver yielding behavior during conflict groups of slight and serious. According to the results of the analysis, the behavior of drivers in marked crossing areas is better than in the unmarked crossing area, leading to safer crossing for pedestrians. Conclusions This study suggests that the significant differences in driver yielding behavior in the two areas is due to the late detection of pedestrians by drivers and also the less proper action by them in unmarked crosswalk areas. Thus, the probability of accidents in Unmarked Crossing areas is higher than in marked crossing areas. Consequently, the design of improved advanced driver assistance systems to identify the risk of pedestrian accident may improve the driver yielding behavior and thus increase the safety of pedestrians.",1369-8478,Not found
A study of the compliance level of connected vehicle warning information in a fog warning system based on a driving simulation,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.012,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The accidents in the freeway are frequent and more serious on foggy days. Connected vehicle (CV) technology as a new technology can inform drivers of fog conditions in advance so the drivers can adjust their driving behaviors through Human Machine Interface (HMI) and Dynamic Message Sign (DMS) in the fog warning system. The level of driver's compliance with a fog warning system is the key to assessing the effectiveness of the fog warning system. To evaluate the compliance level of fog warning system, the study established a CV system testing platform based on driving simulator, and analyzed the changes in driving behavior and influencing factors for drivers under three different visibility conditions (No fog, light fog and heavy fog) based on the platform, finally, comprehensive evaluation of the optimal fog warning system under different foggy conditions based on the compliance level were made. Research indicators are divided into three aspects: 1) the response degree, including the mean speed, the minimum speed in the fog zone, the difference of the speeds when entering and leaving the fog zone, the proportion of speed following, and the speed reduction proportion prompt; 2) the response start time, which is the time to start slowing down to the speed limit; and 3) the response time duration, namely, the time in which the speed limit is followed. The results show that the response degree of the driver to the fog warning system is high, the fog warning system can effectively reduce the driving speed of the drivers and improve the speed following proportion of the drivers, the deceleration ratio of the driver at each warning point is relatively high, and the influencing factors of various indicators are complex but are mostly related to visibility and technical level. Comprehensive evaluation results show that the warning mode of the combined HMI and DMS has the highest level of compliance under light fog conditions, and when fog concentration increases, compliance level of fog warning system with HMI only is higher than others. The study establishes a reference platform for CV system and provides methods and index system for the compliance level of CV research.",1369-8478,Not found
Internal causes of return trip effect based on eye movement and EEG indices,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.013,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"When traveling by car, the driver normally feels that the return trip is shorter than the outbound trip. The reason for this feeling, called return trip effect, is not clear. To explore the internal causes of this return trip effect, an indoor driving simulation experiment and a real car driving experiment were performed in this study. Questionnaires were used to obtain the estimated time of the outbound and return trips of the drivers. An eye tracker and an electroencephalograph equipment were used to record driver's eye movement and EEG data in the real-car driving experiment. The physiological indices and questionnaire results showed that the difference in the driver's cognitive loads of the outbound and return trips was the internal cause of the return trip effect. Drivers who were unfamiliar with the road had a different cognitive load between the two trips, which resulted in the return trip effect. However, drivers who were familiar with the road did not experience a return trip effect due to the close cognitive loads of the two trips.",1369-8478,Not found

Results of 20 studies with over 800 participants in total show a moderate to high mean effect size. That means the n-back task varies cognitive load while driving in a substantial matter. Further analysis reveals several moderator variables: experiments conducted in a driving simulator showed larger effect sizes than on-road studies. This effect decreases with increasing driving simulator fidelity. Furthermore, the specific driving task assignment moderates the effect: lane change task scenarios result in higher effects than other situations. Regarding the different measurement methods of cognitive workload, subjective questionnaires seem to have very high sensitivity. In contrast, n-back performance measures, detection response task measures, and physiological measurements result in moderate effect sizes, and driving performance measures show reduced sensitivity. Regarding different implementations of the n-back task itself, surprisingly, no moderators are found. Overall, the findings highlight the suitability of the n-back task as a method of inducing cognitive load in transportation research. The moderator analysis gives an overview of different methodological designs and how these designs will affect effect sizes.",1369-8478,Not found
Who overtakes more? Explanatory analysis of the characteristics of drivers from low/middle and high-income countries on passing frequency,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.005,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The passing manoeuvre requires a driver to make decisions and take actions which are dependent on his/her behavioural characteristics and driving ability. However, previous works on passing rate models have exclusively considered geometric and traffic-related variables. This study aims at bridging this gap by investigating the influence of driver profile (i.e., age, gender, nationality - Italian or Iranian - aggressive driving scores, driving exposure) on passing frequency. A driving simulation experiment involving 54 drivers (36 Italians, 18 Iranians) was conducted along a 6.67 km segment of a two-lane rural highway with passing manoeuvres permitted along 25% of its length. Controlled factors included traffic flow and speed in the oncoming direction, and speed in the driver direction, with a total of 27 scenarios assigned to drivers based on a 33 confounded factorial design. A Poisson regression model was used to investigate the significance of independent variables. Age and gender and their interaction term were significant, thus the effects of age and gender on the number of passing manoeuvres are mutually interdependent. Furthermore, drivers who drive less often completed fewer overtaking manoeuvres. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to understand the magnitude of change in passing frequency attributable to a variation in the explanatory variables. The findings suggest that driver characteristics have a significant effect on passing frequency and should be considered when conducting a performance and safety evaluation of two-lane roads.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating the effectiveness of Didi ride-hailing security measures: An integration model,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.004,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Security is one of the most critical factors influencing individuals’ mobility. Ensuring security along ride-hailing trips is also a fundamental challenge to service providers. After two cases of rape and homicide, Didi has rectified measures again to meet passengers’ need for security. However, there are few scientific findings concerning the impact of Didi rectified measures on personal perception of security. This study aims to explore critical latent factors that affect individuals’ intentions to use or reuse ride-hailing after the rectification of security measures. This paper examines individuals’ usage intentions by integrating and expanding both the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Research results suggest that perceived security, security risk, and government credibility are correlated with the intentions to use or reuse ride-hailing. Importantly, perceived security and security risk both have a direct impact on behavioral intentions from a different perspective. In contrast, government credibility has an indirect effect. Hence, a mediating effect test is conducted. Government credibility could indirectly influence behavioral intention by affecting trust. Finally, this study verifies that the effectiveness of security measures could be evaluated and improved by studying the influence of latent factors on the intentions to use or reuse ride-hailing.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating temporal variations in pedestrian crossing behavior at semi-controlled crosswalks: A Bayesian multilevel modeling approach,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.002,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"“Semi-controlled” crosswalks are unsignalized, but have clear pavement markings and “yield to pedestrian” signs. At these locations, pedestrians and motorists frequently interact to determine who should proceed first. When interacting with drivers, pedestrian crossing decisions are complex events that involve a variety of human responses, as well as vehicle dynamics, traffic characteristics, and environmental conditions. In addition, these complexities can be subject to temporal effects. Without considering temporal variations in pedestrian-motorist interaction, statistical methods could lead to biased coefficient estimates and inaccurate conclusions. The study developed a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression (BMLR) model to capture heterogeneities in pedestrian interaction behavior during four different time periods. The proposed method incorporates time-specific effects that vary randomly between time-periods based on a weakly informative prior. The results indicate significant factors, some of which confirm previous research and some that are new ways to explain pedestrian behavior at the individual level. The identification of variables such as FlowOn and FlowWait sheds light on the interactions between pedestrians – providing more information than the single GroupSize measure. Some consequent safety implications are discussed from the perspectives of vehicle dynamics, vehicle flow rate and pedestrian volume. The more detailed metrics developed in this paper will provide a valuable starting point. for the design of crosswalk controls that will foster a higher degree of compliance and less delay.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of the cross-section on the driver's behaviour approaching bicycle crossroads,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.003,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"This paper reports on the results of field surveys conducted at the approaching section of two bicycle crossroads in urban environment. The crossing roads are characterised by different cross-sections (one-lane and two-lane configurations) having a same marking scheme. The aim of the surveys was to evaluate the effectiveness of the specific marking scheme for the two different cross-sections and to provide relevant insight to improve the cyclist safety, based on the observed drivers’ behaviours. More specifically, the data analysis was aimed at: (i) studying the yielding behaviour of the drivers on the two bicycle configurations and evaluating the effects of the observed vehicle dynamics constraints in approaching phases; (ii) analysing drivers’ braking during the interaction with cyclist; (iii) defining a logistic regression model for predicting the drivers’ likelihood of yielding as a function of the variables describing his behaviour and the cross-section configurations. Results have stressed out a more critical driver yielding behaviour and braking performance when approaching the bicycle crossroad on the two-lane configuration. The logistic regression model have pointed out the cross-section variable to have the strongest effect on the logit of drivers yielding, determining a significant reduction of the likelihood of yielding if the interaction driver-cyclist occurs in the two-lane configuration. Overall, the obtained outcomes highlight a higher risk exposure of the cyclist crossing the two-lane configuration. The obtained outcomes imply that the same marking scheme on the two different cross-section configurations is inappropriate. It fails to induce proper driver behaviour when he/she approaches the bicycle crossing on the two-lane configuration in order to limit the cyclist's risk exposure to the values observed on the one-lane configuration. Eventually, several measures and recommendations have been defined to reduce the risk conditions identified in two-lane configuration.",1369-8478,Not found

Safety of bicyclists in roundabouts with mixed traffic: Video analyses of behavioural and surrogate safety indicators,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.006,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Although converting an intersection into a roundabout has been shown to result in fewer injury accidents for both motor vehicle drivers and pedestrians, the effect on bicyclists’ safety is unclear or even negative. This study focuses on roundabouts without bicycle facilities (i.e., mixed traffic conditions) and makes use of semi-automated video observation software with the aim of analysing bicyclists’ behaviour and safety on roundabouts with different diameter. Four urban roundabouts in Belgium are observed. Interactions between bicyclists and other vehicles are analysed using speed, lateral position and five indicators to describe the closeness of interactions (TTCmin, PET, T2 min, lateral overtaking proximity and minimum distance headway). Additionally, the lateral position and riding speed of bicyclists that are in interaction with other vehicles is compared with the behaviour of bicyclists that are not in interaction with other vehicles. The behavioural analysis revealed that regardless of the type of condition (free-flow bicyclists or different interactions bicyclist-car), bicyclists always ride faster on roundabouts with big diameter and slower on roundabouts with small diameter. Moreover, bicyclists ride closer to the central island on roundabouts with big diameter compared to roundabouts with small diameter for all the conditions analysed. The analysis of surrogate safety indicators (TTCmin, PET, T2 min) revealed that close interactions between bicyclists and cars are relatively frequent at both small and big roundabouts. The percentages of close interactions are more or less equal for roundabouts with big diameter (7.86% of observed interactions) and roundabouts with small diameter (8.24%). The analysis of the indicators to describe the closeness of interactions also showed that the closest interactions at roundabouts are all situations where the bicyclist has a leading role. The analysis of the most common types of close interactions revealed indeed that the most common close interactions are interactions where the bicyclist is entering the roundabout. The analysis of lateral overtaking proximity showed that bicyclists who overtake a car take smaller lateral overtaking proximities compared to cars overtaking a bicyclist. The analysis of minimum distance headway finally revealed that bicyclists who ride behind a car take smaller distance headways compared to cars driving behind a bicyclist.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving and gaze behavior while texting when the smartphone is placed in a mount: A simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.014,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The aim of this study was to investigate how texting when the smartphone in a mount next to the wheel, negatively affects safe driving behavior and gaze behavior. In most countries hand-held phone use while driving is prohibited.

The effects on driving and gaze behavior of ‘dashboard-mount’ texting have hardly been investigated. Twenty-seven participants drove three short identical drives in a simulator while their driving behavior and gaze behavior was measured. This was a drive in which participants did not text (baseline drive), a drive while they texted with a smartphone in one hand (hand-held drive), and a drive in which they texted while the phone was placed in a dashboard-mount (dashboard-mount drive). Participants looked significantly more often at the smartphone during the dashboard-mount than during the hand-held drive. Total dwell time at the smartphone was significantly longer during the dashboard-mount than during the hand-held drive. There were no significant differences between the two texting drives in the number of glances longer than 2 s, the longest glance of each participant, and mean fixation duration at the smartphone. Total dwell time in the mirrors was significantly shorter during the two texting drives than in the baseline drive but did not differ between the two texting drives. The drivers showed poorer lateral control and varied their speed more in the two texting drives than in the baseline drive. They also drove significantly slower in the two texting drives than in the baseline drive. Finally, subjective workload was much higher in the two texting drives than in the baseline drive.

Roles of personal and environmental factors in the red light running propensity of pedestrian: Case study at the urban crosswalks,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.001,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Pedestrian is vulnerable to mortality and severe injury in road crashes.

In this study, effects of both personal factors (pedestrians’ demographics and behavior) and environmental factors (presence and behavior of other pedestrians, signal time, and traffic condition) on the individual decision of red light running violation are examined, using the video observation surveys at the signalized crossings that are prone to pedestrian-vehicle crashes and have moderate pedestrian and vehicular traffic volumes in the urban area. Crossing behaviors of 6320 pedestrians are captured. Results of a random parameter logit model indicate that pedestrian gender, age, number of lanes, presence of a companion, number of pedestrians around, presence of other violators in the same cycle, time to green, red time, traffic volume, and percentage of heavy vehicles all affect the propensity of red light running violation of pedestrians. Also, there are significant interaction effects by pedestrian’s gender and age, presence of other violators, with a companion, and traffic volume on the propensity. Findings are indicative to the development of effective engineering, enforcement and educational initiatives combating the red light running violation behavior of pedestrians. Therefore, pedestrian safety level at the signalized intersections can be enhanced.",1369-8478,Not found

As organizational safety strategies were stronger, driving instructors had higher levels of perceptual-motor skills, which resulted in higher violations. On the other hand, as organizational safety strategies were stronger, driving instructors had higher levels of safety skills, which resulted in less violations and lapses. It can be inferred that; organizational stronger safety strategies might have negative influences on road safety through higher perceptual-motor skills; whereas there can be positive influences on road safety through higher safety skills. In addition, both skills are related to organizational safety strategies. Hence, driving schools should consider the asymmetric relationship between perceptual-motor skills and safety skills while improving their safety strategies to decrease violations and lapses. Organizations might also develop interventions to balance the stated skills to increase road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Distracted driving caused by voice message apps: A series of experimental studies,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.008,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Hand-free voice message apps are frequently used by young people while driving. Previous studies have identified voice message apps as a common source of driving distraction. To quantitatively evaluate the factors contributing to driving distractions, three simulated driving experiments were designed using a dual-task experimental paradigm. In Experiment 1, participants completed several common tasks related to voice messages in WeChat with or without manual operations (perceptual-motor distraction). Experiments 2 and 3 further took into consideration the cognitive distraction level, measured by task difficulty and task frequency. The results showed that, in comparison with undistracted driving, the perceptual-motor distraction related to voice message app use significantly (ps < 0.05) weakened young drivers’ driving performance with respect to the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) between two cars (0.24 m), response time (0.21 s) and error rate (0.12) to turning lights, and collision percentage (0.54%), similar to the effects induced by non-voice-based apps. There were also significant differences (ps < 0.05) between driving with secondary tasks with and without continuous manual operations in the SDLP between two cars (0.19 m) and in the response time (0.18 s) and error rate (0.10) to turning lights, which indicates that the distracting effect produced by voice-message apps comes from the related manual operations. The effects of cognitive distraction on driving performance mainly depended on task difficulty level. High-difficulty secondary tasks via a voice message app significantly (ps < 0.05) weakened the driving performance in response time (by 0.13 s and 0.13 s compared to low-difficulty and baseline conditions, respectively) and error rate (by 0.07 and 0.07 compared to low-difficulty and baseline conditions, respectively) to turning lights and collision percentage (by 0.90% and 0.80% compared to low-difficulty and baseline conditions, respectively). The findings provide a theoretical reference for analysing the distracting components of voice messages and suggest that drivers should limit the use of these kinds of apps during driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver conflict response during supervised automation: Do hands on wheel matter?,10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.001,76,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Securing appropriate driver responses to conflicts is essential in automation that is not perfect (because the driver is needed as a fall-back for system limitations and failures). However, this is recognized as a major challenge in the human factors literature. Moreover, in-depth knowledge is lacking regarding mechanisms affecting the driver response process. The first aim of this study was to investigate how driver conflict response while using highly reliable (but not perfect) supervised automation differ for drivers that (a) crash or avoid a conflict object and (b) report high trust or low trust in automation to avoid the conflict object. The second aim was to understand the influence on the driver conflict response of two specific factors: a hands-on-wheel requirement (with vs. without), and the conflict object type (garbage bag vs. stationary vehicle). Seventy-six participants drove with highly reliable but supervised automation for 30 min on a test track. Thereafter they needed to avoid a static object that was revealed by a lead-vehicle cut-out. The driver conflict response was assessed through the response process: timepoints for driver surprise reaction, hands-on-wheel, driver steering, and driver braking. Crashers generally responded later in all actions of the response process compared to non-crashers. In fact, some crashers collided with the conflict object without even putting their hands on the wheel. Driver conflict response was independent of the hands-on-wheel requirement. High-trust drivers generally responded later than the low-trust drivers or not at all, and only high trust drivers crashed. The larger stationary vehicle triggered an earlier surprise reaction compared to the garbage bag, while hands-on-wheel and steering response were similar for the two conflict object types. To conclude, crashing is associated with a delay in all actions of the response process. In addition, driver conflict response does not change with a hands-on-wheel requirement but changes with trust-level and conflict object type. Simply holding the hands on the wheel is not sufficient to prevent collisions or elicit earlier responses. High trust in automation is associated with late response and crashing, whereas low trust is associated with appropriate driver response. A larger conflict object trigger earlier surprise reactions.",1369-8478,Not found
Smartphone Use While Driving: An Investigation of Young Novice Driver (YND) Behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.013,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Road traffic collisions are the leading cause of death for those between the ages of 15–29, according to the World Health Organisation. This study investigates one of the primary reasons for the high fatality rate amongst Young Novice Drivers (YNDs) – their use of smartphones while driving. We gathered responses from a representative sample of YNDs on their behaviour while driving using an updated version of the ‘Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale’. Survey responses totalled 700 YNDs situated throughout Germany. From these responses, we examined the prevalence of certain driving behaviours that are described as ‘distracting’ and compared these driving behaviours to the respondents’ use of specific smartphone features. The responses report that music-related activities (e.g. changing music on a smartphone) are most common amongst YNDs. Speaking on the phone is seldom-reported, although more males than females indicated engagement in this behaviour. We further carried out a correlation analysis and correspondence analysis. On that basis we found that those who report speaking on a smartphone are significantly more likely to engage in driving behaviours with potentially fatal consequences, such as speeding and driving while impaired by prohibited substances (drugs, alcohol). We propose that the results could be used by policymakers for public information implications and to tailor financial penalties for those engaging in smartphone behaviours that are linked to harmful driving behaviours. In addition, our findings can also be used in a Usage-based Insurance (UBI) context to financially incentivise safer driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Parents’ perceptions of driver education: A theoretically guided qualitative investigation,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.009,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"In many jurisdictions with Graduated Driver Licensing systems, such as those in North America, Australia, and New Zealand, parents play an important role in teaching their child how to drive and facilitating their access to formal driver education. This study explored parents’ views on these processes in a theoretically grounded manner using the Goals for Driver Education (GDE) Framework. The GDE framework groups influences on young driver behaviour into four interconnected hierarchical levels: vehicle manoeuvring (Level 1), mastery of traffic situations (Level 2), goals and contexts for driving (Level 3) and goals for life and skills for living (Level 4). Fourteen parents of novice drivers participated in five focus groups held in urban and regional locations in South East Queensland, Australia. A six-step thematic analysis was used consisting of (1) familiarisation with the data, (2) generation of initial codes, (3) searching for themes, (4) reviewing themes, (5) defining and naming themes and (6) producing the report. Parents indicated that they were more likely to outsource the teaching of skills at Levels 1 and 2 of the GDE to professional driving instructors as they were concerned that they would pass bad habits onto their child or they were unaware of the road rules that their child was required to follow. Parents believed that they were able to more effectively teach skills located on Levels 3 and 4 of the GDE framework because they had a greater knowledge of their child when compared with professional educators. The study findings can be used to develop an intervention that would support parents to more effectively supervise learner drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of the frequency of cannabis use and of the five impulsivity traits on risky driving behaviors among young drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.002,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Concerns about road safety are at the forefront of discussions given the recent legalization of cannabis in many areas. Some studies have demonstrated that the frequency of cannabis use is a significant predictor of risky driving among young drivers. However, it is difficult to isolate the specific contribution of substance use from the influence of certain individual personality traits such impulsivity. Indeed, impulsivity traits (i.e., positive urgency, negative urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, sensation seeking) are also correlated with risky driving. The present study examined the effect of the frequency of cannabis use on risky driving while taking into account the effect of five impulsivity traits. A community sample of 209 young drivers (aged 17–25 years) completed self-report questionnaires about their road behaviors, their cannabis use, and their impulsivity traits. The results showed that the frequency of cannabis use was significantly associated with risky driving beyond the five impulsivity traits measured. Positive urgency was the only impulsivity trait that remained significantly associated with risky driving once all covariates were entered into the model. Moreover, the frequency of cannabis use acted as a mediator in the relationship between sensation seeking and risky driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Behind the wheels with autism and ADHD: Brain networks involved in driving hazard detection,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.007,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Driving is a cognitively challenging task, and many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) struggle to drive safely and effectively. Previous evidence suggests that core neuropsychological deficits in executive functioning (EF) and theory of mind (ToM) may impact driving in ASD and ADHD. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study compares the brain mechanisms underlying ToM and EF during a hazard perception driving task. Forty-six licensed drivers (14 ASD, 17 ADHD, 15 typically developing (TD)), ages 16–27 years, viewed a driving scenario in the MRI scanner and were instructed to respond to driving hazards that were either “social” (contained a human component such as a pedestrian) or “nonsocial” (physical objects such as a barrel). All groups of participants recruited regions part of the “social brain” (anterior insula, angular gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, right cuneus/precuneus, and right inferior frontal gyrus) when processing social hazards, and regions associated with motor planning and object recognition (postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, and supplementary motor area) when processing nonsocial hazards. While there were no group differences in brain activation during the driving task, years licensed was predictive of greater prefrontal and temporal activation to social hazards in all participants. Findings of the current study suggest that high-functioning ASD and ADHD licensed drivers may be utilizing similar cognitive resources as TD controls for decisions related to driving-related hazard detection.",1369-8478,Not found
Clearing the path to transcend barriers to walking: Analysis of associations between perceptions and walking behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.003,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Walkability is much studied, but the relative importance of perceptions and motivations is still not consensual. This study took a holistic approach to examine the comparative importance of a range of possible perceptions, motivations and individual characteristics on walking levels. Data from Auckland Transport's Active Modes online survey (AT survey, N = 4,114) captured environmental perceptions and travel behaviour. Machine learning (gradient boosting) was used to predict walking levels from perceptual data and individual characteristics and determine the relative importance of each variable. Strong predictors of walking included the use of public transport, walking perceived as saving money and avoiding parking hassle, age group, and overall satisfaction with walking. Surprisingly, the importance of expected dimensions such as perceived availability of destinations or internal motivations was null in the general model. These findings suggest a more holistic view of walking behaviour is needed, one that moves beyond the pure availability of destinations.",1369-8478,Not found
Do drivers accept cooperative behavior of their automated vehicle on highways?,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.002,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Automated cooperatively interacting vehicles will change the future of traffic completely. Such vehicles will be capable of planning and carrying out maneuvers based on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, enabling a safer driving experience. However, this gain of safety will only be effective if drivers use and accept the decisions made by advanced automated technology. Especially when drivers are cognitively distracted, new strategies might be necessary, e.g., by further explaining the reason for a cooperative decision. In a driving simulator study, we investigated the acceptance of lane change maneuvers in cooperative situations carried out by an automated vehicle on a two-lane German highway. When the automated system detected a potential lane change ahead, it carried out one of three possible maneuvers: accelerate, decelerate, or maintain speed. Participants (N = 20) were asked whether they accepted the system’s behavior either while being cognitively distracted or in an attentive state. Thus, we investigated the influence of a cognitively demanding secondary task and, in addition, further situational characteristics (Scope of action, Criticality for the lane-changing vehicle, Display of intention) on the acceptance towards the system’s behavior. Moreover, participants had to rate the perceived situation’s criticality. Results underlined the importance of explicit indication of the intention to change lanes. Furthermore, increased cognitive load led to a higher acceptance of the defensive system behavior. This study contributes to the development of a user-centered interface and interaction strategy for cooperative interacting vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of a driver assistance system with foresighted deceleration control on the driving performance of elderly and younger drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.017,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"It is imperative to enhance the safety of elderly individuals on the roads to ensure the quality of their daily life. Near-miss incidents or accidents at blind intersections often result from a conflict between the behaviors of the driver and of other road users (pedestrians and cyclists). The failure to search for potential conflict in the context of blind intersections is a concern pertaining to road safety. The proposed assistance system performs a proactive braking intervention to achieve a referenced velocity in uncertain situations, such as one in which an unobserved pedestrian might initiate a road crossing. The proactive braking intervention attempts to manage the potential risk of crashing with respect to covert hazards. Because an automated system may impair a human’s ability to perceive and respond to hazardous situations while driving, this study was designed to examine the effects of proactive braking intervention and visual support cues on elderly and younger drivers’ ability to respond to information about potentially hazardous situations. We conducted a public-road driving experiment involving 108 elderly and younger drivers from two non-overlapping age groups. It was observed that the vehicle slowdown realized through the proactive braking intervention enabled the drivers to perform safety confirmation near blind spots and caused them to be more sensitive to and wary of potential hazards. This approach could be effective not only for elderly drivers, but also for young or inexperienced ones.",1369-8478,Not found
"Competence, equipment and behavioural adaptation on Norwegian winter roads: A comparison of foreign and Norwegian HGV drivers",10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.004,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"There seems to be a widespread view that foreign lorry drivers’ lack of competence on Norwegian roads, especially related to winter driving, is a significant safety problem. It has, however, been suggested that foreign heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers perform better than expected on Norwegian winter roads, as they feel less safe than Norwegian drivers, and adapt by driving slower and more carefully. The aim of the present paper is twofold. First, we examine whether foreign HGV drivers in Norway actually have poorer competence on, training for, experience with and equipment for winter driving than Norwegian HGV drivers. Second, we discuss whether the expected negative effect of these safety challenges is mitigated, as foreign HGV drivers adapt their behaviours. We use four data sources to shed light on the aims: (1) interviews, (2) roadside inspections, (3) small-scale survey and (4) towing incidents. Our data support the hypothesis about behavioural adaptation, indicating that foreign HGV drivers experience winter driving as more difficult or unsafe, as they have supposedly less suitable vehicles and equipment, less experience, training and competence for winter driving. They are therefore more likely to get stuck while driving uphill on winter roads, supposedly as they drive more carefully and slower than Norwegian HGV drivers. Norwegian HGV drivers feel safer and more confident while driving on winter roads, because of their equipment and their experience.",1369-8478,Not found
What is the role of narcissism in the relationship between impulsivity and driving anger expression?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.008,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The contributing factors of aggressive driving have been studying in the last decades. Both impulsivity and narcissism are associated with aggressive driver behaviors. Although the role of these two factors were examined in the same studies, the combined role of these two factors hasn’t been studied yet. To understand the combined effect of them, in the present study, the moderated mediation model for examining the relationships of narcissism, impulsivity, and aggressive driver behavior was developed and tested. Three hundred and four participants completed an online survey battery comprised of Demographic Information Form, Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory-Short Form, Barrat Impulsiveness Scale- Short Form, and Driving Anger Expression Inventory. The moderated mediation analyses were conducted using PROCESS macro developed by Hayes and Preacher (2013). The results revealed that only the relationship between vulnerable narcissism and the use of vehicle to express anger is mediated by attentional impulsiveness. Also, this relationship is moderated by grandiose narcissism. In detail, grandiose narcissism moderates the direct effect of vulnerable narcissism on attentional impulsivity and also the direct effect of attentional impulsivity on the use of vehicle to express anger. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings and recommendations for future studies are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
An empirical investigation into carpooling behaviour for sustainability,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.005,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Carpooling is a sustainable, economical, and environmental friendly solution that can significantly reduce air pollution and traffic congestion in urban areas. In spite of its numerous benefits, commuters are still skeptic about adopting it as a routine choice for transportation. This study attempts to map commuters’ attitude towards carpooling services. The study has focused on a few motivational constructs that can have an influence on commuters’ behavior. The study has looked at the role of cognitive complexity and empowerment perceptions of commuters to check if these constructs significantly intervene in the behavioral outcomes. The methodology used is a scenario-based 2 × 2 survey design where the sample is an individual who has experience with carpooling. The survey has used two levels (high, low) each of cognitive complexity and psychological empowerment to give rise to four scenarios. The final sample consisted of 400 carpoolers selected from an IT park having more than 5000 employees. MANOVA analysis showed that cognitive complexity and psychological empowerment had significant influence on the motivational constructs used in the study. Value beliefs, safety and platform quality perceptions were found to have a direct impact on attitude formation and intention to engage in carpooling behavior.

Effectiveness of the compensatory strategy adopted by older drivers: Difference between professional and non-professional drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.006,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"It has been a controversial issue for the effect of ageing population on driving safety. Apparently, drivers’ physiological and cognitive performances deteriorate with age. However, older drivers may compensate for the elevated risk by adjusting their behaviors, known as compensatory strategy. Despite the extensive research on this topic, the compensatory strategy of older professional drivers is not well understood since many studies focused on the differences in compensatory behavior between older and young drivers. Professional drivers tend to be more skillful and able to cope with the unfavorable driving environments, thus presenting a higher capability to mitigate the risk. This study attempts to examine the compensatory behavior and its safety effect amongst older professional drivers, as compared to those of older non-professional drivers, using the driving simulator approach. In the driving simulator experiment, participants were asked to follow a leading vehicle for one hour, and two sudden brake events were presented. 41 (mid-aged and older) drivers completed the driving tests. Each participant was required to complete a car-following test, either under high or low traffic flow conditions. Performance indicators include driving capability (i.e. lateral control, longitudinal control, and brake reaction time) and compensatory behavior (i.e. average speed, and time headway). Additionally, two modified traffic conflict measures: time exposed time-to-collision (TET) and time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) are applied to indicate the traffic conflict risk. The random parameter Tobit models were estimated to measure the association between conflict risk and driver attributes, and random intercept models were used to assess other driving performance indicators. Results show that despite the impaired lateral control performance and longer brake reaction time of older drivers, the likelihood of severe traffic conflict of older drivers is lower than that of mid-aged drivers. Furthermore, though both older professional and older non-professional drivers adopted longer time headway, the reduction in the risk of severe traffic conflict is more profound among the older professional drivers. Such findings suggest that older professional drivers are more capable of mitigating the possible collision risk by adopting the compensatory strategy, as compared to older non-professional drivers. This justifies the existence of compound effect by the compensatory strategy of older driver and better driving skills of professional driver. This research provides useful insights into driver training and management strategies for employers, as older drivers would become a major cohort in the transportation industry.",1369-8478,Not found

Results The lack of traffic sounds did not influence the inter-vehicle gap size that children crossed into but it did result in slower initiations and, ultimately, more high-risk outcomes (close calls and hits). Conclusion Traffic sounds significantly contribute to enhance children’s safety when crossing streets.

A home-based approach to understanding the effect of spatial autocorrelation on seat belt non-use,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.016,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Roadside observations indicate that seat belt use rates are often spatially correlated with nearby areas. However, very few studies have examined the effects of spatial autocorrelation on seat belt use. This study used exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) to explore spatial autocorrelation in Tennessee, which has a lower seat belt use than the United States national average. We geocoded home-addresses of vehicle occupants involved in traffic crashes between 2014 and 16 (n = 1,251,901) and projected them to the census tract corresponding to their home address. This projection reveals information about the spatial distribution of seat belt non-use and socioeconomics of the areas surrounding the crash victim's home. The presence of highly spatially correlated observations (i.e., a significant positive Moran’s I) suggests that seat belt non-use is not produced solely by the internal structural factors represented in the non-spatial models. ESDA reveals a distinctive regional imprint for spatial autocorrelation, in which Southern-metropolitan areas’ (Southern-MPOs) in Tennessee census tracts have higher than average seat belt non-use compared to Non-Southern-MPOs (16% vs. 9%). The spatial error model was suitable for Non-Southern-MPOs, whereas the spatial lag model was more suitable for Southern MPOs. Comparison of the estimated models indicates that in the Non-Southern MPOs, percentage of the White population, percentage of the population with Bachelor's degree, median household income, vehicle ownership, and population density are significant predictors of seat belt non-use. On the other hand, median household income, vehicle ownership, and percentage of population aged between 16 and 42 years old predict seat belt non-use in Southern MPOs. The study results could be used to identify seat belt non-use clusters at the state level and identify seat belt non-use hot zones. Furthermore, this analysis indicates that the relationship between demographic variables and seat belt non-use varies across regimes. Failing to consider the spatial regimes in the analysis would lead to falsely prioritizing groups prone to seat belt non-use.",1369-8478,Not found

To this end, a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data on the respondents’ seatbelt use, demographic characteristics, driving behavior, past penalization history, and perceived effectiveness of enforcement of seatbelt laws. The study results revealed that there is a lower likelihood of wearing seatbelt among male drivers, taxi drivers, drivers with a low level of education, drivers with no crash or injury history, drivers that violate speed limits and are never penalized on seatbelt violation, and drivers with no seatbelt reminder installed in their vehicles. Respondents who believed that there is low effectiveness of the enforcement of seatbelt laws had the highest impact on seatbelt use whereas, the presence of seatbelt reminders in the vehicle had the least impact on seatbelt use. The findings of this study suggest the need for awareness campaigns for taxi drivers with the intent to educate them about the potential benefits of using a seatbelt in the case of a crash event; improved awareness and strict vigilance of male drivers; strict enforcement of posted speed limits and seatbelt laws; legislation for the mandatory installation of a seatbelt in all the new vehicles, and organizing mass outreach campaigns to improve the overall safety environment. Most importantly and widely applicable to the developing world, this study necessitates a depiction of strong resolve on the part of government agencies regarding the strict enforcement of seatbelt laws. Given a substantial difference in the social, cultural, and legislative outfit of the developed and developing worlds, factors influencing the compliance/defiance of seatbelt use among drivers differ significantly. It is, therefore, important to explore the local contributory factors as the results are not necessarily transferable across the regions.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of speed feedback signs and law enforcement on driver speed,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.011,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This study analyzes the effects of implementing three speed management strategies, namely speed feedback signs, periodic law enforcement, and speed feedback sign supported with periodic law enforcement on driver speed behavior and compliance. To analyze the effectiveness of each strategy, nine locations in Pima County, Arizona, were studied in a cross-sectional framework. For each study site, the driver’s speed, date, time, and vehicle’s length were collected at a location prior to the speed management zone as the baseline, at the speed management zone, and downstream of the speed management zone. The general effect showed that all the strategies were effective in reducing average speed and the proportion of drivers exceeding the speed limit. In addition, the results of the robust heteroscedastic ANOVA test showed that among all the strategies, the speed feedback sign supported with periodic law enforcement was the most effective one. Moreover, it was shown that by supporting the speed feedback sign with periodic law enforcement, the reduction in average speed and proportion of drivers exceeding the speed limit would last, even after passing the speed management strategy. In other words, the existence of periodic law enforcement could potentially modify drivers’ behaviors and increase the spatial effectiveness of speed feedback signs. Comparing the behavior of truck and passenger car drivers also revealed similar results. That is, both truck and passenger car drivers tend to slow down after observing the speed management strategy. The experimental evidence indicates positive benefits for reducing excessive speeding behaviors at the sites.",1369-8478,Not found
The role of attitudes in perceptions of bicycle facilities: A latent-class regression approach,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.006,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"While many professionals support bicycling for transportation to reduce traffic congestion and improve public health, many potential cyclists see the risks from traffic injuries as a major barrier. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of bicycle facilities on perceptions of bikeability, and how these perceptions vary among different groups. Data comes from surveys (N = 2157) deployed in ten study neighborhoods as part of two research projects. Respondents were asked to rate a series of images of hypothetical roadways in terms of perceived comfort, perceived safety, and willingness to try bicycling. Latent-class regression was used to model these responses, with bicycle facility type and roadway characteristics as explanatory variables and sociodemographics and attitudinal factors (car preference, bike enjoyment, risk tolerance, and anti-exercise) as covariates for class membership. A recurring theme among the presented solutions is the emergence of two pro-bicycle classes - risk-embracing and risk-cautious - together with a pro-car class. Results indicate that the impact of protected bicycle facilities on perceptions are much higher for the pro-bike/risk-cautious group. The major implication of these findings is that there likely exists a sizeable segment of the population that, although perhaps just as interested in bicycling as the typical pro-bicycle class, is more cautious in their perceptions of comfort and safety. Those belonging to this subgroup generally view minimal facilities as much more unsafe and uncomfortable than their risk-accepting counterparts, but have comparable perceptions regarding high-quality protected bicycle facilities.",1369-8478,Not found
Modeling dispositional and initial learned trust in automated vehicles with predictability and explainability,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.015,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Technological advances in the automotive industry are bringing automated driving closer to road use.

With the help of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we were able to interpret the trust predictions of XGBoost to further improve the explainability of the XGBoost model. Compared to traditional regression models and black-box machine learning models, our findings show that this approach was powerful in providing a high level of explainability and predictability of trust in AVs, simultaneously.",1369-8478,Not found
Influence of following vehicle's tailway and classification on subject driver's response to the circular yellow indication,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.016,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Traffic crashes at signalized intersections are frequently linked to driver behavior at the onset of the circular yellow (CY) indication.

Driver performance data from 53 participants were collected in the Oregon State University Driving Simulator, simulating scenarios of driving through high-speed intersections under various conditions. Data included interactions where the driver stopped at the stop line (n = 644) or proceeded through the intersection (n = 628) in response to a CY indication. Data were analyzed as panel data while considering 12 indicator variables related to the driver’s stop/go decision. These indicator variables included time to stop line (TTSL), tailway time, following vehicle type, vehicle speed at the onset of the CY indication, and demographics (age, gender, driving experience, level of education, personal vehicle type, number of times driving per week, number of miles driving last year, participation in previous simulation studies. A random-parameter binary logit model was used to determine contributing factors for driver decision making at the onset of CY indication while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. Four indicator variables were significantly related to the driver’s stop/go decision, but three factors varied across observations. Findings showed that a driver’s stop/go decision in response to a CY indication was associated with the time to the stop line (TTSL), tailway time to the following vehicle, subject vehicle speed at the onset of the CY indication, and driver’s age (20–36 years), but was not significantly associated with classification of the following vehicle. Also, the findings indicated that a shorter tailway increased a subject driver’s red-light running frequency. These findings provide insights into variables that affect driver decisions in a vehicle-following situation at the onset of the CY indication. This information can help make better decisions in smart traffic control systems such as to extend/decrease the green interval slightly to avoid decisions that are more difficult.",1369-8478,Not found
Implicit and explicit attitudes in transportation research: A literature review,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.014,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Dual-Process Models of Attitudes (DPMA) have provided new concepts and methods for attitude-behavior research in the field of transportation. Notwithstanding, there is a lack of critical reviews on this topic; leaving researchers with an unclear picture of the key issues to consider in developing new research. This paper reviews previous studies on DPMA in traffic and transportation research. A systematic review of English and non-English language articles using Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) as main database was conducted. Additional studies were identified by searching in ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. A total of 1674 references were revised. Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria. Four central issues were examined: (a) the role of implicit and explicit attitudes in transport behavior, (b) the degree of relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes, (c) the types of measures used to assess implicit attitudes, and (d) the malleability of implicit attitudes. The review has identified that: (a) implicit attitudes were associated with a wide variety of transport-related behavior, (b) implicit and explicit attitudes were weakly correlated (mean correlation, weighted by sample size was r = 0.11), and little knowledge exists on factors moderating the implicit-explicit relationship, (c) the evidence on the indirect measures’ better resistance to social desirability bias as compared with traditional techniques is scant and inconclusive, (d) some studies exhibit problems in the application of indirect measures, and (e) few studies (n = 2) aimed to evaluate interventions for attitude change. The analysis showed the sustained growth of the applications, the potential of DPMA, and the need for more rigorous research. Most studies of areado not consider the theoretical and methodological shortcomings of the DPMA, and tend to be based on a controversial notion of implicit and explicit attitudes.",1369-8478,Not found
A systematic review of definitions of motor vehicle headways in driver behaviour and performance studies,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.011,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Headway is a safety measure commonly used to investigate driving behaviour and driver performance. Its purpose is to reflect the following distance or time between a leading and following vehicle in traffic. It is therefore associated with drivers’ response time, such as in braking or swerving, during safety critical events. In the literature, distance and time headway are defined in different ways, despite standard definitions in the traffic engineering literature, which prompted this systematic review of headway definitions across a range of study designs, in order to recommend approaches to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of headway definitions used in road safety contexts. PRISMA guidelines were followed to search four databases (EMBASE, COMPENDEX, SCOPUS and MEDLINE) for studies that reported on headways or discussed methodological approaches. The search and filtering of abstracts identified 110 articles for a qualitative synthesis. Four broad approaches to measuring headways were detected: studies using simulation, roadside external features, on-road features, and on-vehicle features. Studies were coded as to whether they included written explanation, mathematical statements, or pictorial depictions of headway. Only 49.6% of studies contextualised headway sufficiently for reproducibility. Reproducibility is crucial for accurate interpretation of research findings and comparisons across studies. It is recommended that headway definitions should a) exclude vehicle or parts of vehicle lengths, b) include reference points (e.g., bumper/axle/rear), c) have a consistent terminology, and d) include the accuracy of headway measuring devices to report the precision of a study’s findings.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of self-control and texting-related accidents on the relationship between mindfulness and mobile texting while driving behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.012,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Distracted driving behavior often occurs when drivers mindlessly send or receive text messages with their mobile devices. It is imperative to understand the relationship between mindfulness and texting while driving behavior because distracted driving behavior has led to a reported increase in texting related accidents and mortalities. Based on this report, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between mindfulness, self-control, frequency of texting-related accidents, near-miss accidents, and texting while driving behavior. Using a total of 609 adults with an average age of 34.11 (SD = 12.21), results showed that observe, aware, and describe were related to texting while driving. Additionally, we found evidence that self-control partially mediated the relationship between mindfulness and texting while driving. Results also showed that near-miss texting while driving accidents moderated the relationship between mindfulness and texting behavior while driving. The observed inverse relationship between mindfulness and texting while driving can increase researchers’ understanding of self-control’s role in vehicular accidents triggered by texting. Implications and limitations are offered, along with suggestions for future research.",1369-8478,Not found
Pedestrian interaction with automated vehicles at uncontrolled intersections,10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.005,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Automated Vehicles (AVs) are being developed rapidly and tested on public roads, but pedestrians’ interaction with AV is not comprehensively understood or thoroughly investigated to ensure safe operations and the public’s trust of AVs. In this study, we aimed to provide another research evidence to enhance such understanding with the use of external interfaces for facilitating the interaction between pedestrians and AVs. We developed five external interfaces, including text, symbol, animated-eye, a combination of text and symbol, and speed. These interfaces communicated five types of information, including (1) intent of AV; 2) advice to pedestrians of what to do, (3) AV’s awareness of pedestrians, (4) combination of intent and advice, and (5) vehicle movement (i.e., speed). We tested the interfaces through two field studies at uncontrolled intersections with crosswalks. The Wizard of Oz method was used, in which an experimenter worked as a driver in an instrumented vehicle and wore an outfit to be invisible to the pedestrians, thus rendering the set-up to simulate an AV interacting with a pedestrian. The interfaces were displayed on an LED panel mounted on the AV. Results showed that the AV’s external interface did not change pedestrians’ response time in comparison with the baseline without any interface. There was no statistically significant difference in response time among the external interfaces either. According to the post-experimental interview, vehicle movement pattern (e.g., vehicle speed) continued to be a significant cue for pedestrians to decide when to cross the intersections. Participants perceived the communication of the AV’s intent and vehicle speed as more beneficial than the communication of AV’s awareness. The subjective ratings showed positive effects of those interfaces that were easy to understand (e.g., text interface and speed interface), which also helped pedestrians feel safer when interacting with the AV.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of explanation-based knowledge regarding system functions and driver's roles on driver takeover during conditionally automated driving: A test track study,10.1016/j.trf.2020.11.015,77,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The present study was designed to examine the influence of explanation-based knowledge regarding system functions and the driver’s role in conditionally automated driving (Level 3, as defined in SAE J3016). In particular, we studied how safely and successfully drivers assume control of the vehicle when encountering situations that exceed the automation parameters. This examination was conducted through a test-track experiment. Thirty-two younger drivers (mean age = 37.3 years) and 24 older drivers (mean age = 71.1 years) participated in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Adopting a between-participants design, in each experiment the participants were divided into two age- and sex-matched groups that were given differing levels of explanation-based knowledge concerning the system limitations of automated driving. The only information given to the less-informed groups was that, during automated driving, drivers may be required to occasionally assume control of the vehicle. The well-informed groups were given the same information, as well as details regarding the auditory-visual alerts produced by the human–machine interface (HMI) during requests to intervene (RtIs), and examples of situations where RtIs would be issued. Ten and nine RtI events were staged for each participant in Experiment 1 and 2, respectively; the participants performed a non-driving-related task while the automated driving system was functioning. For both experiments it was found that, for all RtI events, more participants in the well-informed groups than the less-informed groups successfully assumed control of the vehicle. These results suggest that, in addition to providing information regarding the possible occurrence of RtIs, explanations of HMI and RtI-related situations are effective for helping both younger and older drivers safely and successfully negotiate such events.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating pedestrian interaction preferences with a game theoretic autonomous vehicle in virtual reality,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.017,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Localisation and navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in static environments are now solved problems, but how to control their interactions with other road users in mixed traffic environments, especially with pedestrians, remains an open question. Recent work has begun to apply game theory to model and control AV-pedestrian interactions as they compete for space on the road whilst trying to avoid collisions. But this game theory model has been developed only in unrealistic lab environments. To improve their realism, this study empirically examines pedestrian behaviour during road crossing in the presence of approaching autonomous vehicles in more realistic virtual reality (VR) environments. The autonomous vehicles are controlled using game theory, and this study seeks to find the best parameters for these controls to produce comfortable interactions for the pedestrians. In a first experiment, participants’ trajectories reveal a more cautious crossing behaviour in VR than in previous laboratory experiments. In two further experiments, a gradient descent approach is used to investigate participants’ preference for AV driving style. The results show that the majority of participants were not expecting the AV to stop in some scenarios, and there was no change in their crossing behaviour in two environments and with different car models suggestive of car and last-mile style vehicles. These results provide some initial estimates for game theoretic parameters needed by future AVs in their pedestrian interactions and more generally show how such parameters can be inferred from virtual reality experiments.",1369-8478,Not found
Should older people be considered a homogeneous group when interacting with level 3 automated vehicles?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.004,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Exploring the future mobility of older people is imperative for maintaining wellbeing and quality of life in an ageing society. The forthcoming level 3 automated vehicle may potentially benefit older people. In a level 3 automated vehicle, the driver can be completely disengaged from driving while, under some circumstances, being expected to take over the control occasionally. Existing research into older people and level 3 automated vehicles considers older people to be a homogeneous group, but it is not clear if different sub-groups of old people have different performance and perceptions when interacting with automated vehicles. To fill this research gap, a driving simulator investigation was conducted. We adopted a between-subjects experimental design with subgroup of old age as the independent variable. The differences in performance, behaviour, and perception towards level 3 automated vehicles between the younger old group (60–69 years old) and older old group (70 years old and over) was investigated. 15 subjects from the younger old group (mean age = 64.87 years, SD = 3.46 years) and 24 from the older old group (mean age = 75.13 years, SD = 3.35 years) participated in the study. The findings indicate that older people should not be regarded as a homogeneous group when interacting with automated vehicle. Compared to the younger old people, the older old people took over the control of the vehicle more slowly, and their takeover was less stable and more critical. However, both groups exhibited positive perceptions towards level 3 automation, and the of older old people’s perceptions were significantly more positive. This study demonstrated the importance of recognising older people as a heterogeneous group in terms of their performance, capabilities, needs and requirements when interacting with automated vehicles. This may have implications in the design of such systems and also understanding the market for autonomous mobility.",1369-8478,Not found
Staying on or getting off the sidewalk? Testing the Mehrabian-Russell Model on pedestrian behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.007,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Social and environmental psychology provide a variety of models based on which to understand how built environments can elicit people’s behavioral responses. The Mehrabian-Russell model (MRM), initially presented in 1974, provides a framework that explains avoid–approach behavior towards a place based on a primary emotional response (PER) and affective states elicited by the perceived stimuli from the environment. However, despite the potential applications of the MRM in travel behavior studies, traditional models (e.g., discrete choice models and integrated choice latent variable) do not incorporate this specific psychological process that converts environmental stimuli into behavioral responses. Hence, this paper aims to test the applicability of MRM to urban sidewalks. To fulfill this objective, we developed a two-level structural equation model using latent variables (LV) identified from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) based on 1056 in-person surveys on 30 different sidewalks in Bogotá, Colombia. We then evaluated the effect of the PER on declared avoidance as a proxy of behavioral intention. The CFA uncovered three LV equivalent to the three affective dimensions of the MRM—arousal, pleasure, and dominance—followed by a fourth LV, representing the PER, which explains the three previous LVs. This confirms the applicability of these kinds of psychological and environmental models in pedestrian behavior evaluation. We found that PER can explain the declared intention of avoidance towards the sidewalk in an urban setting. Proving that this kind of model can explain the way in which the built environment can elicit pedestrians’ emotional responses and subsequent behaviors, provides information that can be used as input in travel behavior studies focusing on the promotion of active traveling and mode change.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ performances and their subjective feelings about their driving during a 40-min test on a circuit versus a dynamic simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.001,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Car manufacturers expect driving simulators to be reliable research and development tools. Questions arise, however, as to whether drivers’ behavior on simulators exactly matches that observed when they are driving real cars. Drivers’ performances and their subjective feelings about their driving were compared between two groups during a 40-min driving test on the same circuit in a real car (n = 20) and a high-fidelity dynamic simulator (n = 27). Their speed and its variability, the braking force and the engine revolutions per minute (rpm) were recorded five times on a straight line and three times on a curve. The differences observed in these measurements between circuit driving (CD) and simulator driving (SD) from the 6th to 40th minute showed no significant changes during the drive. The drivers also completed the NASA Raw Task Load Index (NASA RTLX) questionnaire and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and estimated the ease and standard of their own driving performances. These subjective feelings differed significantly between the two groups throughout the experiment. The SD group’s scores on the NASA RTLX and SSQ questionnaires increased with time and the CD group’s perceived driving quality and ease increased with time, reaching non-significantly different levels from their usual car driving standards by the end of the drive. These findings show the existence of a fairly good match between real-life and simulated driving, which stabilized six minutes after the start of the test, regardless of whether the road was straight or curved. These objective findings and subjective assessments suggest possible ways of improving the match between drivers’ performances on simulators and their real-life driving behavior.",1369-8478,Not found
Sharing the road with autonomous vehicles: A qualitative analysis of the perceptions of pedestrians and bicyclists,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.008,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Public perception assessment is important for gaining a better understanding of the acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and identifying potential ways to resolve public concerns. This study investigated how pedestrians and bicyclists perceived AVs based on their knowledge and road sharing experiences, applying a combined inductive and deductive data analysis approach. Survey responses of pedestrians and bicyclists in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA collected by Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) in 2019, were analyzed in this research. AVs following traffic rules appropriately and AVs driving safer than the human drivers were the most notable positive perceptions towards AVs. Pedestrians and bicyclists showed comparatively fewer negative perceptions towards AVs than positive perceptions. Negative perceptions mostly included a lack of perceived safety and comfort around AVs and trust in the AV technology. Respondents also concerned about AV technology issues (e.g., slow and defensive driving, disruptive maneuver), while sharing the road with AVs. Perceptions of the respondents were significantly influenced by their views on AV safety, familiarity with the technology, the extent respondents followed AV on the news, and household automobile ownership. Regulating AV movement on roadways, developing safety assessment guidelines, and controlling oversights of improper practices by AV companies were the major suggestions from the survey participants. Findings of this study might help AV companies to identify potential improvement needed in AV technology to increase pedestrians and bicyclists acceptance, and policymakers to develop policy guidelines to ensure safe road sharing among pedestrians, bicyclists, and AVs.",1369-8478,Not found
Support for distracted driving laws: An analysis of adolescent drivers from the Traffic Safety Culture Index from 2011 to 2017,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.022,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Introduction Adolescent drivers are often the focus of traffic safety legislation as they are at increased risk for crash-related injury and death. However, the degree to which adolescents support distracted driving laws and factors contributing to their support are relatively unknown. Using a large, nationally weighted sample of adolescent drivers in the United States, we assessed if perceived threat from other road users’ engagement in distracted driving, personal engagement in distracted driving behaviors, and the presence of state distracted driving laws was associated with support for distracted driving laws. Methods The sample included 3565 adolescents (aged 16–18) who participated in the Traffic Safety Culture Index survey from 2011 to 2017. A modified Poisson regression model with robust errors was fit to the weighted data to examine support for distracted driving laws. Models included age, gender, year, state distracted driving laws, personal engagement in distracted driving behavior, and perceived threat from other road users’ engaging in distracted driving. Results Approximately 87% of adolescents supported a law against texting and emailing compared to 66% who supported a universal handheld cellphone law. Support for distracted driving legislation was associated with greater perceived threat of other road users engaging in distracted driving while accounting for personal engagement in distracted driving, state distracted driving laws, and developmental covariates. Discussion Greater understanding of the factors behind legislative support is needed. Public health interventions focused on effectively translating the risks of cellphone use while driving and effective policy will further improve the traffic safety culture.",1369-8478,Not found
"Biased judgments of the effects of speed change on travel time, fuel consumption and braking: Individual differences in the use of simplifying rules producing the same biases",10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.014,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The main purpose of this study was to identify different cognitive rules that lead to a particular judgment bias. To fulfill this purpose, a new method Spectral analysis was introduced and applied. Participants judged time saved by driving faster, fuel saved by replacing a car and braking capacity at different speeds. These problems invite the time saving bias (e.g., time saved from speed increases at higher speeds overestimated), the miles per gallon, MPG illusion (misjudgment of fuel saved by replacing a car) and the braking capacity bias (overestimation of braking capacity after speed increase). The average results replicated the biases. Spectral analysis of individual participants and problems showed that a speed difference rule explained about half of the time saving judgments and about three fourth of the MPG judgments. A difference between speeds rule described about one third of the biased braking judgments and a ratio/proportion rule about one fifth of the time saving and MPG judgments. All rules give biased judgments in all three domains. The paper ends with a discussion of hierarchies of cognitive rules, applications of the results, and how to mitigate or avoid the biases and the risks associated with the biases.",1369-8478,Not found
Evidence that implementation intentions reduce drivers’ use of mobile phones while driving,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.002,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Implementation intentions are IF-THEN plans that have the potential to reduce mobile phone use while driving and thus contribute towards the prevention of road traffic crashes. We tested whether an intervention, designed to promote the formation of implementation intentions, could reduce drivers’ use of mobile phones. A randomized controlled design was used. The participants (N = 136) were randomised to an implementation intention or a control condition. Self-report questionnaires were administered to all participants at both pre- and one-month post-intervention to measure the use of mobile phones while driving, goal intentions and the theoretically derived motivational pre-cursors of goal intentions (attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control). Immediately following the pre-intervention questionnaire, the participants in the implementation intention condition (n = 67) were given a volitional help sheet, which asked them to form implementation intentions by specifying target driving situations that tempted them the most to use a mobile phone and linking them with goal-directed responses that could be used to resist the temptation. The participants in the control condition (n = 69) were asked to specify target situations that tempted them the most to use a mobile phone while driving and to generally try to avoid using a mobile phone in those situations. One-month post-intervention, the participants in the implementation intention condition reported using a mobile phone less often while driving in their specified target driving situations than did the participants in the control condition. As expected, no differences were found between the conditions in the reported frequency of mobile phone use in unspecified driving situations, goal intentions or any motivational pre-cursor of goal intentions. The implementation intention intervention that was tested in this study is a potentially effective tool for reducing mobile phone use while driving in target driving situations, where behaviour-change is most needed.",1369-8478,Not found
Drink driving during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.020,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, static roadside random breath testing (RBT) was temporarily suspended between 16 March and 12 June 2020 in Queensland, Australia. In addition to restrictions on travel and social interactions, this provided a unique opportunity to examine changes in drink-driving behaviour during and after a reduction in RBT operations in the community. Three cross-sectional surveys were disseminated at different time points to examine these differences. Over three surveys, 1193 Queensland licensed drivers aged 18 years and over (M = 36.9, SD = 16.7) responded. While overall drink driving decreased over the three survey periods, there were groups where drink driving, or the intention to drink drive, increased over the same period. The overall decrease could be expected as a result of community restrictions on socialising and travel behaviours. In each of the surveys, prior engagement in drink driving was the strongest predictor of intention to increase future engagement and actual engagement. These drink drivers were more likely aged 18–24 years, male, and held restricted licensure. Notably, a small number of participants who reported drink driving, and/or intention to drink drive during the survey period, reported not having engaged in this behaviour previously. This suggested an increased likelihood of drink drivers experiencing punishment avoidance which may promote future engagement in this behaviour. Despite a decrease in social opportunities to drink, and the suspension of highly visible roadside breath testing sites, drink driving persisted. This research highlights the importance of RBTs as a general deterrent for drink driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Slow down! Get off that phone! The impact of a high school road safety education program in influencing whether a young person speaks up to a risky driver,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.016,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Risky driving behaviours such as mobile phone use and speeding remain common among young people, thereby contributing to their over-representation in road crashes. There is much evidence that similar-aged peer passengers can have a negative impact on a young driver’s behaviour; however, there is also research that supports the positive influence that peer passengers can have when they speak up about risky behaviours. Road safety education programs, such as the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland’s (RACQ) Docudrama program, aim to help young people understand the important role they play as peer passengers and, thus, the importance of being willing to speak up to a driver who may be engaging in risky behaviours. Extending on a previous evaluation of the RACQ Docudrama program, the current study uses an Extended Theory of Planned Behaviour framework to evaluate the program’s effectiveness in influencing peer passengers’ intentions and self-reported behaviour in speaking up against risky driving behaviours, including mobile phone use and speeding. A repeated-measures design compared participants’ responses over 3 time-points: Time 1 (one month before participating in the program), Time 2 (immediately after having participated in the program), and Time 3 (three months after program participation). The results indicate that levels of anticipated regret for having not spoken up were higher following participation in the program suggesting that it encouraged young people to consider how they would feel if something was to happen and they, as passengers, had not tried to prevent it by speaking up. Three months after participating in the program, the majority of participants reported that they were positively influenced by the program in terms of engaging in safer behaviours as passengers; although the significant effects regarding improvements were observed only immediately after participating in the program. The implications of such findings are discussed in terms of the need for some type of ‘booster’ post-program participation to capitalise on the positive immediate effects that the program evokes.",1369-8478,Not found

The appraisal of roadway environment and infrastructure by drivers with autism: A qualitative study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.016,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"People with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might experience difficulties while driving, for instance, related to hazard perception. These difficulties may be related to cognitive issues (internal) such as attention-shifting, sequential performance, and multitasking. Possibly related to these issues, some people with ASD experience stress and anxiety while driving. Among other reasons, stress could relate to the roadway environment and infrastructure design, e.g., sensory overload due to lighting conditions. Yet, the relationship between roadway environment and infrastructure and driving experiences of people with ASD is somewhat overlooked in previous research. This study aimed to (1) explore how people with ASD experience roadway environment/infrastructure while driving (2) identify coping strategies to deal with interfering elements related to roadway environment/infrastructure. There were twelve participants (mean age: 34.8, of which 66.7% were female), semi-structured interviews to examine the appraisal of roadway environment and infrastructure. The interviews were analyzed based on a phenomenological hermeneutical approach. Each participant reported both positive (e.g., environment and infrastructure can be supporting, enhance predictability) and negative appraisals (e.g., stress, anxiety) to roadway environment/infrastructure. Various elements such as light, noise, and, being rushed caused additional pressure on (1) the driving performance (e.g., driving too slowly, not noticing important elements), (2) traffic analyzing skills (e.g., difficulties in overseeing new situations), (3) and the efficient application of traffic rules. The participants described different coping mechanisms to deal with the influence of interfering elements; for example, alternative transport means or adjusting behavior (e.g., switch off radio, early departure). This demonstrates that besides internal factors such as attention, external factors like roadway environment and infrastructure can also influence the driving experience of ASD drivers, potentially leading to driving-related stress and anxiety. Policymakers could consider the current findings when designing new guidelines and roadway environment and infrastructure design principles.",1369-8478,Not found
Ergonomic Design Improves Cross-Cultural Road Sign Comprehension,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.015,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Background Traffic sign design can have a substantial impact on road safety and traffic flow. The current study had three objectives: 1) Cross-validate the importance of ergonomic sign design; 2) Evaluate the ability of ergonomics experts to predict sign comprehension by the average driver; 3) Offer improved sign designs for poorly designed road signs. In a previous study (Ben Bassat et al., 2019), human factors and ergonomics experts evaluated several alternative designs for 31 different road signs, based on three ergonomics criteria – familiarity, standardization, and message/symbol compatibility. Some of these signs were tested in the current study and the correlation between the results of the two studies was analyzed. Method In this study, 805 licensed drivers from five countries were tested on their comprehension of 24 conventional signs and 32 alternative signs. Signs were individually presented on a screen and as soon as the participant decided on the meaning, the sign disappeared, and an experimenter wrote the stated meaning. The verbal responses were coded as correct (perfectly or partially), wrong, or opposite of the true meaning. Sign identification response time was also recorded. Results In all countries across all signs, more drivers comprehended the alternative ergonomically superior signs, and the identification response times were shorter for these sign designs. Furthermore, the correlation between ergonomics experts' ratings as found in previous study and the percent of comprehension for each sign design was statistically significant and positive with r = 0.61. Conclusions Road signs should be designed according to ergonomics-based criteria. Human factors experts' opinions can be a useful tool in improving the design of poorly comprehended signs (or icons) and in designing new signs (or icons).",1369-8478,Not found

A confirmatory factor analysis (n = 360) was conducted to examine the factorial structure of the SDCaF. The validity of the scale was then evaluated by examining the associations between the SDCaF factors, risky driving behaviours and traffic violations. The CFA results showed that the model fit of the Chinese version of the scale (SDCaF-C) was acceptable. Second, the SDCaF-C factors were weakly or moderately correlated with speeding, self-assertiveness and rule violations. Third, significant gender differences were found for the variables of friend pressure and communication, with male drivers scoring higher than female drivers. Moreover, drivers who had traffic violations in the past year scored higher on friend pressure and lower on both communication and shared commitment to safe driving compared to those who had not had traffic violations. The findings supported the psychological properties of the SDCaF-C and highlighted the importance of concerning the effects of safe diving climate among friends on young drivers’ risky driving behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found
Attitudes and behaviors associated with young drivers’ texting and app use,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.012,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Introduction Distracted driving is a major risk factor for motor vehicle crashes, especially for young drivers. This study examines factors that contribute to the exposure of young drivers to distracted driving behaviors. Methods Data from the 2015 National Survey on Distracted Driving Attitudes and Behaviors was used to determine the influence that perceived safety, likelihood to do or say something, social norms, and demographic variables have on self-reported cell phone distracted driving. Our population included 16–24-year old drivers. Dependent variables were texting (reading and sending a text/email) and smartphone app use while driving. Rao-Scott chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression models were applied. Sampling weights were applied to create nationally representative estimates and all statistical tests accounted for complex survey design. Results Among young drivers who report cell phone use while driving, 42% reported reading a text, 33% reported sending a text, and 23% reported smartphone app use. Multivariate regression results showed that perceived safety had the strongest association with reporting texting and smartphone app use while driving. In addition, social norms and age-education were significantly associated with reporting sending a text/email and reading a text/email while driving, respectively. Conclusions The current study found significant relationships between attitudes and behaviors about cell phone use while driving and self-reported engagement in distracted driving. Practical applications Interventions with an emphasis on changing perceived safety and social norms for young drivers could be beneficial for reducing engagement in cell phone use while driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Sandstorm animations on rural expressways: The impact of variable message sign strategies on driver behavior in low visibility conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.015,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Problem: Evolving sandstorms on rural expressways in desert countries impair drivers' contrast vision and increase the risk of serious crashes due to delayed speed adjustments. Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) such as Variable Message Signs (VMS) conveying warnings can be activated to address drivers’ speed adaptation before entering a low visibility zone. To improve drivers’ understanding of the hazard, a sandstorm animation visualizing turbulent sand and its consequences was designed and compared with a general warning pictogram, which is applied if no specific weather pictogram is available. Moreover, minimum warning distances of the VMS to the low visibility zone were tested (e.g., 300 m or 500 m). Method Sixty-three participants from the State of Qatar drove in a driving simulator through clear, transition, and low visibility conditions on a rural expressway. A repeated analysis of variances was conducted to examine the impact of the two on-road warning displays on driving behavior. Results The results showed that the sandstorm animation was similarly effective as a generic warning pictogram in reducing driving speeds before entering the transition and low visibility zone, irrespective of being displayed 500 m or 300 m away. However, the sandstorm animation resulted in consistent similar speed reductions within the low visibility zone, whereas the generic warning pictogram did either perform better or worse after several encounters with a sandstorm. Drivers did strongly agree that the animation is clearly referring to the issue of low visibility, which can be beneficial for recurring low visibility conditions. Practical applications: 1.) Displaying a sandstorm animation is beneficial for rural expressway sections with recurring degrading visibility and low traffic densities, whereas a warning pictogram can be more effective in speed reductions if drivers expect additional traffic hazards. 2.) Roadway authorities have the flexibility to activate a VMS sandstorm warning even for minimum warning distances.",1369-8478,Not found
How to nudge drivers to reduce speed: The case of the left-digit effect,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.018,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"To decrease the negative consequences of a road crash, even a small reduction in driving speeds can make a significant difference. We examined the possible application of the left-digit effect as a nudge to reduce road speed. In the marketing field, this effect is based on reporting price tags that are characterized by a low leftmost number and a high rightmost number (e.g., a price tag of €14.99 rather than €15.00). We applied the same strategy to improve road safety. Participants were college students (43.75% female, mean age = 24.06 years in Study 1; 50% female, mean age = 23.53 years in Study 2) who were asked to drive in a simulator on a route that had both usual unmodified road signs (e.g., 50 km/h) and the same road signs increased or decreased by one unit (e.g., 49, 51 km/h). We compared the average median speeds in road segments with unmodified road signs with those in road segments with the corresponding modified signs. The average median speeds in the presence of a sign modified by the reduction of 1 km/h were significantly lower compared with the median average speeds recorded with unmodified signs. We showed that the application of psychological insights can reduce driving speeds and therefore increase road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
“They have to be better than human drivers!” Motorcyclists’ and cyclists’ perceptions of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.009,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Road users and the general population by and large recognise the value of vehicles with automated driving systems and features (otherwise typically known as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)) in terms of road safety, reduced emissions and convenience, but are still wary of their capability, preferring the ‘comfort zone’ of human operator intervention. Motorcyclists and cyclists conversely, are vulnerable to human fallibility in driving, with the majority of crashes occurring as a consequence of other drivers’ inattention. The transition period associated with the introduction of AVs will require AVs and motorcyclists/cyclists sharing the road for a number of years yet, so we need to understand motorcyclists’/cyclists’ perception of AVs. The question of interest here is whether motorcyclists/cyclists reflect the historical literature in this area by having higher levels of trust for human drivers over AVs, or whether they have higher levels of trust in AVs because it removes the ‘human element’ that has been proven to be particularly dangerous for them. Here we surveyed motorcyclists and cyclists about their trust in human drivers and AVs, and developed a novel suite of questions designed to interrogate the difference between trust in general versus trust as a concept of their own personal safety. Some of the salient outcomes suggest that motorcyclists have medium to low levels of trust for both human drivers and AVs, but are significantly more likely to believe that AVs are safer in terms of their own personal safety, such as prioritising or detecting the rider, compared to human drivers. This relationship varies with age and crash experience. The results here are consistent with the logic that motorcyclists/cyclists have a heightened sense of vulnerability on the road and welcome the introduction of AVs as a way of mitigating personal risk when riding. This insight will be crucial to the subsequent roll-out of AVs in the future.",1369-8478,Not found
“Don't you want the dream?”: Psycho-social determinants of car share adoption,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.008,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The benefits of car share, in terms of reduced car ownership and sustainable transport use have been widely recognised. Knowledge of motivators and barriers of car share adoption is crucial to inform policy, and yet this aspect has received little attention so far. This paper aims to comprehensively explore the range of psycho-social factors which determine the adoption of car share. In this study, two theoretical approaches were used to explore psycho-social determinants of car share adoption. First, the Theory of Planned Behaviour is used as a theoretical lens to identify the role of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control in car share adoption. Second, the Theory of Innovation Diffusion is used to examine the process of adoption of car share and the barriers at different stages. While the former considers the determinants of the binary decision of becoming a car share, the latter unpacks the process of car share adoption. This qualitative study draws on data from five focus groups and 18 semi-structured interviews, conducted in Melbourne, Australia, with station-based car share member, ex-members and non-members. Insights confirmed that while cost, convenience and environmental concerns are important motivators, others factors also encourage car share use including sharing with the community, reducing/avoiding hassles related to car ownership (e.g. maintenance, parking) and, a desire to own fewer material possessions. Normative beliefs about car ownership, perceived difficulties in using car share (e.g. with children) and the planning and effort required to book and use car share were identified as some of the barriers. Barriers related to car share use varied depending on the stage of car share adoption. Initial barriers related to a lack of knowledge and normative beliefs about car ownership. The study also highlighted how motivators and barriers might vary for peer-to-peer and fleet-based car share. Insights from this study will be useful for car share operators and policymakers to address the practical and social barriers to car share adoption.",1369-8478,Not found
Even experienced phone users drive worse while texting – A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.007,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Several studies have clearly shown that texting on a mobile phone increases crash risk (e.g. Dingus et al., 2006; Victor et al., 2014). However, the frequency of texting while driving still remains high (e.g. Vollrath, Huemer, Teller & Likhacheva, 2016). One reason may be that drivers are convinced that they are able to manage this dual task due to their competency in driving and texting. From a theoretical point of view, this may be true within limits – two well-learned, automatically processed tasks may require so few resources most of the time that interferences may not occur. In order to test this assumption, a study with a standardized driving simulator task (the lane change task, LCT; Mattes, 2003) was done with n = 40 drivers selected for their driving experience and tested for their texting abilities. The effect of driving experience (high vs. low) and texting competence (high vs. low) on driving performance was examined in single (driving only) and dual-task (driving and texting) conditions. Additionally, a subjective assessment of one’s task performance was obtained. Texting on the mobile phone significantly impaired driving performance. While driving experience did not have an influence, the deteriorating effect of texting was significantly less pronounced in highly competent phone users. Interestingly, this objective effect was not found in the subjective assessment. Drivers with a high texting competence felt as impaired as drivers with a low texting competence. This is in line with the finding that even in this simple driving task their performance was still significantly deteriorated as compared to driving, only. Thus, it seems that the reason why people text while driving is not that they are not aware of the performance loss. However, this awareness of the possible risk does not seem sufficient to prevent them from texting while driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Reducing optimism bias in the driver's seat: Comparing two interventions,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.013,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Optimism bias combined with sensation-seeking and risky driving have been proposed to be the main contributing factors to young drivers’ involvement in road traffic collisions. The present study aimed to evaluate how two brief interventions, one based on an unambiguous definition of “good” driving and the other on a hazard perception test, might reduce young drivers’ optimism bias. One hundred and twenty-eight university students were randomly allocated to one of three groups: standard definition, hazard perception or control. Measures evaluating optimism bias were completed before and after the intervention, and questions regarding their sensation-seeking and past risk-taking tendencies were asked at follow-up. Both brief interventions reduced optimism bias levels, but hazard perception had the strongest effect. The effectiveness of the two interventions also differed across individuals depending on their sensation-seeking and past risky driving tendencies. The results provide evidence for the effectiveness of brief interventions to reduce optimism bias.",1369-8478,Not found
Does awareness of penalties influence deterrence mechanisms? A study of young drivers’ awareness and perceptions of the punishment applying to illegal phone use while driving,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.006,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"This research implemented both qualitative and quantitative methods to 1) explore young drivers’ (aged between 17 and 25 years) awareness and perceptions of legal sanctions associated with phone use while driving and 2) identify whether the accuracy of their knowledge influences deterrence-related perceptions. In the qualitative phase, 60 Queensland motorists participated in focus groups. The findings of the focus groups highlighted that greater awareness of the penalty for phone use while driving would enable this punishment to act as a more salient deterrent. More specifically, the penalty for hands-free phone use was considered too high, whereas when the penalty was applied to hand-held phone use it was considered reasonable, with some commenting that increasing the fine could be a greater deterrent. However, the penalty also appeared to be linked to the perceived legitimacy of the rule. The quantitative phase utilised a cross-sectioanl survey design and consisted of 503 drivers. Overall, more participants appear to be underestimating (63% underestimated the fine and 37% underestimated the demerit points) as opposed to overestimating (14% overestimated the fine and 22% overestimated the demerit points) the penalty for phone use while driving. As expected, compared to those who accurately estimated the extent of the punishment (both the monetary sanction and the number of demerit points) associated with phone use while driving, drivers who underestimated the phone punishment (points and fine) had significantly lower perceptions of the severity of punishment. These findings suggest that some young drivers do not have sufficient knowledge of mobile phone sanctions, which has significant implications for ongoing attempts to maximise deterrent mechanisms.",1369-8478,Not found
A brief and unsupervised online intervention improves performance on a validated test of hazard perception skill used for driver licensing,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.003,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Drivers who have higher levels of hazard perception skill also tend to have fewer crashes. Training designed to improve this skill has therefore been proposed as a strategy for reducing crash risk. To date, however, hazard perception training has only been evaluated in supervised settings. This means that improvements in hazard perception skill resulting from such training may not generalize to unsupervised situations, which may limit opportunities for large scale roll-out via automated delivery methods. In the present study, we investigated whether a brief video-based training intervention could improve hazard perception skill when drivers completed it online without supervision. The training involved drivers watching videos of traffic scenes, while generating a commentary of what they were searching for, monitoring, and anticipating in each scene. Drivers then compared their own commentary to a pre-recorded commentary generated by an expert driver, hence allowing for performance feedback without an instructor present. A convenience sample of 93 drivers (who did not receive any performance-related incentives) participated in a randomized control study. The training was found to significantly improve response times to hazards in stimuli from the official hazard perception test used for driver licensing in Queensland, Australia, which is known to predict crash involvement. That is, the training was effective in improving hazard perception skill (Cohen’s d = 0.50), even though participants were aware that no one was monitoring the extent to which they engaged in the intervention. Given that the training could, in principle, be deployed at scale with minimal resources (e.g. via any online platform that allows video streaming), the intervention may represent a practical and effective opportunity to improve road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Adaptations in driver deceleration behaviour with automatic incident detection: A naturalistic driving study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.011,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Traffic congestion and crash rates can be reduced by introducing variable speed limits (VSLs) and automatic incident detection (AID) systems. Previous findings based on loop detector measurements have revealed that drivers reduce their speeds while approaching traffic congestion when the AID system is active. Notwithstanding these behavioural effects, most microscopic traffic flow models assessing the impact of VSLs do not describe driver response accurately. This study analyses the main factors that influence driver deceleration behaviour while approaching traffic congestion with and without VSLs. The Dutch VSL database was linked to the driver behaviour data collected in the UDRIVE naturalistic driving study. Driver engagement in secondary tasks and glance behaviour were extracted from the video data. Linear mixed-effects models predicting the characteristics of deceleration events were estimated. The results show that the maximum deceleration is high when approaching a slower leader, when driving at high speeds and short distance headways, and close to the beginning of traffic congestion. The minimum time headway is short when driving at high speeds and changing lanes. Certain drivers showed higher decelerations and shorter time headways than others. Controlled for these main factors, smaller maximum decelerations were found when the VSLs were present and visible, and when the gantries were within close proximity. These factors could be incorporated into microscopic traffic simulations to evaluate the impact of AID systems on traffic congestion more realistically. Further research is needed to clarify the link between engagement in secondary tasks, glance behaviour and deceleration behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
The self-reported causes of sleepiness in shift-working tram and truck drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.004,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Identifying the causes of sleepiness in various safety-critical work environments is necessary for implementing more efficient fatigue management strategies. In transportation, little is known about drivers’ own perceptions of these causes. Therefore, we instructed shift-working tram (n = 23) and long-haul truck drivers (n = 52) to report at the end of their shifts what made them sleepy if they felt so. These self-reports, measured on-duty sleepiness, and sleep amounts were recorded on every shift over a period of 2–3 weeks per driver. The causes of sleepiness were queried with smartphone applications and sleep logs. Sleepiness was measured with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and sleep with wrist-worn actigraphs. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Sleep loss and insufficient rest breaks were commonly reported as causing sleepiness among the tram drivers, whereas time of day and sleep loss were the leading causes among the truck drivers. Other causes, such as traffic or cabin conditions, were not frequently mentioned. During morning, day, and evening shifts, the truck drivers were less likely to report insufficient rest breaks as causing sleepiness than the tram drivers. Similarly, during morning shifts, the truck drivers were less likely to attribute their sleepiness to sleep loss. In shifts with drives reporting severe sleepiness (KSS ≥ 7 at least once, 18–21% of shifts), sleep loss was significantly reported as causing sleepiness among both groups. Reporting insufficient rest breaks was associated with severe sleepiness among the tram drivers, whereas time of day showed the same among the truck drivers. The results highlight the need for addressing sleep-related fatigue in transportation and provide directions for future research with regard to secondary causes of sleepiness.",1369-8478,Not found
Key factors associated with Australian parents’ willingness to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied children,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.010,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"This study aimed to identify the key factors associated with Australian parents' willingness to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren). Seven hundred and seventy-five participants completed the online survey (M = 40.7 years, SD = 8.9 years, Range = 18.0–65.0 years; Female: 56.4%). Most participants reported that they would 'never' use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren) (43.5%). The results of a logistic regression model showed that participants' age, gender, level of education, propensity for technology adoption, aberrant driving behaviours, awareness of advanced driver assistance safety (ADAS) technologies, perceived knowledge regarding automated vehicles, as well their requirements for assurance-related vehicle features were significantly associated with their willingness to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren), χ2(12) = 137.41, p < 0.001). Overall, the findings suggest that Australian parents are mostly unwilling to use an automated vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren) unless various reassurance features and technologies (i.e., microphones, camera, ability to summon assistance if the vehicle breaks down) are embedded in the vehicle. Therefore, automated vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to consider these requirements when prototyping their designs so that all user groups, including child occupants, can benefit from the impending arrival of automated technologies.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving simulation sickness and the sense of presence: Correlation and contributing factors,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.005,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Driving simulators are useful and effective tools for conducting studies in the field of traffic safety. Simulation sickness (SS) and the sense of presence (SP) are two well-known factors that could affect the results of the driving simulator experiments. This study investigated the relationship between SP and SS in a medium-fidelity driving simulator. Additionally, the impact of the road environment (urban arterials or rural expressways) on these subscales was investigated. Data was collected by means of self-reported questionnaires, which were conducted after the participants have driven the simulation scenarios in a fixed-base medium-fidelity driving simulator. A total of 125 drivers participated in this study. Results showed that females reported significantly higher SS scores than males. An increasing trend in the SS was observed with the increase of age. Importantly, designing buildings that replicate a real-world environment could increase SP and decrease SS. Moreover, designing high quality and resolution scenarios could also increase SP, thus decreasing the severity of SS symptoms. The results of this study can help researchers using medium-fidelity driving simulators to know the influencing factors for each subscale of SP on SS. Adjustments in the driving simulator and scenario settings as well as additional training exercises for higher speed scenarios can be beneficial in reducing the severity of SS.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ self-reported responses to a potentially realistic fabricated road sign message,10.1016/j.trf.2021.02.001,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"This article seeks to understand the potential response of drivers when they encounter compromised Dynamic Message Signs (DMS). The findings are built on the self-reported response of 4,706 participants in a Stated Preference (SP) survey conducted between November 2018 and December 2018 in the United States. The findings show the response of drivers to the “Downtown Under Terrorist Attack” message falls into route divergence, speed change, and distraction, and the likelihood of route divergence, distraction, and a slowdown is significantly more than either stopping or speeding up. The possibility of a response, however, varies depending on socioeconomic characteristics, attitudinal characteristics, and driving behavior. It is highlighted (1) female and young drivers are more probable to detour, to change speed, or to be distracted, (2) drivers who are familiar with DMS, encounter it frequently, or pay attention to its content, have a higher chance of detouring or changing speed, while they are less likely to be distracted, and (3) technology-friendly drivers are likely to detour or slow down. From the distraction model, it is further inferred that drivers are distracted cognitively, visually, and manually. The findings have implications for researchers and federal, state, and local agencies who are aware of the consequences of cybersecurity threats for the operation and profitability of the transport network. They, for example, assist transport planners in prioritizing equipment security efforts and resource allocation to the areas of greatest risk, and help to prepare contingency plans based on drivers’ behavioral response.",1369-8478,Not found
Car-following behavioural adaptation when driving next to automated vehicles on a dedicated lane on motorways: A driving simulator study in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.010,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to improve traffic flow efficiency and safety. The deployment of AVs on motorways is expected to be the first step in their implementation. One of the main concerns is how human drivers will interact with AVs. Dedicating specific lanes to AVs have been suggested as a possible solution. However, there is still a lack of evidence-based research on the consequence of dedicated lanes for AVs on human drivers’ behavior. To bridge this research gap, a driving simulator experiment was conducted to investigate the behavior of human drivers exposed to different road design configurations of dedicated lanes on motorways. The experiment sample consisted of 34 (13 female) licensed drivers in the age range of 20–30. A repeated measures ANOVA was applied, which revealed that the type of separation between the dedicated lane and the other lanes has a significant influence on the behavior of human drivers driving in the proximity of AV platoons. Human drivers maintained a significantly lower time headway (THW) when driving in the proximity of a continuous access dedicated lane as compared to a limited-access dedicated lane with a guardrail separation for AV platoons. A similar result was found for the limited-access dedicated lane in comparison to the limited-access dedicated lane with guardrail separation. Moreover, the results regarding the empirical relationships between THW and sociodemographic variables indicate a significant THW difference between males and females as well as a significant inverse relationship between THW and the years of driving experience.",1369-8478,Not found

This study investigated intraindividual variability in driving simulator measures in healthy drivers of different ages using the coefficient of variation (COV) as a variability measure. Participants were healthy volunteers who were regular drivers, who were divided into a “young” group, a “middle-aged” group, and an “old” group. They drove in two environments (rural, 72 drivers; urban, 60 drivers), under conditions of moderate and high traffic load, without and with distraction (conversation). Significant differences in COV were observed in the rural condition for headway distance and lateral position as a function of traffic load, with high traffic (without and with distraction) resulting in increased COV of headway and decreased COV of lateral position. Significant differences in COV were observed in the urban condition for headway distance only, with high traffic (without and with distraction) resulting in increased COV of headway. No age effects were found for any of the driving conditions. The results indicate that traffic load affected headway distance and lateral position in opposite directions in all three age groups: high traffic resulted in increased variability of headway in both rural and urban conditions but in decreased variability of lateral position in the rural conditions compared to moderate traffic irrespective of distraction. The study indicates that driving conditions affect the intraindividual variability of driving measures in selective ways, which may be linked to the extent of automatization of the driving variables and to adaptive changes to traffic condition challenges.",1369-8478,Not found

Automated vehicle acceptance was modelled as a function of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) constructs performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DIT) constructs compatibility and trialability, as well as trust and automated shuttle sharing. The results show that after adding the DIT constructs, automated shuttle sharing, and trust to the model, the effect of performance expectancy on behavioural intention was no longer significant. Instead, compatibility with current travel was the strongest predictor of behavioural intention to use automated shuttles. It was further found that individuals who are willing to share rides in an automated shuttle with fellow travelers (i.e., automated shuttle sharing) and who trust automated shuttles (i.e., trust) are more likely to intend to use automated shuttles (i.e., behavioural intention). The highest mean rating was obtained for believing that automated shuttles are easy to use, while the lowest mean rating was obtained for feeling safe inside the automated shuttle without any type of supervision. The analysis revealed a preference for the supervision of the automated shuttle via an external control room to the supervision by a human steward onboard. We recommend future research to investigate the hypothesis that compatibility could serve as an even stronger predictor of the behavioural intention to use automated shuttles in public transport than performance expectancy.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the impact of a novel active gap metering signalization strategy on driver behavior at highway merging sections,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.017,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"A safe headway to the lead vehicle is important to reduce conflicts with merging vehicles from highway on-ramps. Previous research has outlined the advantage of gap metering strategies to yield sufficient space to merging vehicles and improve highway capacity during peak hours. However, prevailing gap metering systems fail to indicate the minimum required gap and leave it to the drivers’ judgment to adjust their headway. This paper proposes a new Active Gap Metering (AGM) signalization that helps outer lane drivers to adjust their headway to the lead vehicle when approaching highway ramps with incoming vehicles. This AGM signalization represents a combination of pavement markings and an innovative Variable Message Sign (VMS). The AGM system was tested alone and in combination with additional variable speed limits (VSL) in distinct environments of the Doha Expressway in the State of Qatar using a driving simulator. The driving behavior of 64 drivers was analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. The results showed that the AGM effectively influenced the drivers’ behavior on the right stream lane. Drivers did gradually increase the distance to the lead vehicle, which resulted in optimal headways to merging on-ramp vehicles. Most importantly, the minimum time-to-collision (TTCmin) to the merging vehicle was increased by an additional 1–1.5 s as compared to no treatment. The proposed AGM signalization can, therefore, be considered by policymakers to influence drivers’ headways at critical merging sections.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating the impact of real-time coaching programs on drivers overtaking cyclists,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.014,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Innovative motor insurance schemes involve the use of on-board devices to collect kinematic driving data as part of the so-called ‘Pay-How-You-Drive’ schemes, which charge premiums based on drivers’ behavior. Some of these schemes also involve on-board coaching programs, which give real-time feedback to users. Here, we aimed to investigate the influence of motor insurance on-board real-time coaching programs on drivers’ behavior while overtaking cyclists, as motor vehicle/bicycle interactions are a relevant issue in road safety. The tested programs give real-time feedback to users on their acceleration, promoting smoother and safer driving styles. Data were collected with a driving simulator experiment involving 67 young drivers. The experiment was divided into two trials: in the first, participants drove as normally as possible without receiving any type of feedback; in the second, which took place one month later, they received feedback based on their driving behavior. Using data from the first trial, participants were clustered (k-mean approximation) into two groups, according to their driving style (aggressive vs. defensive). For each group, half of the drivers received contingent positive feedback (when a smooth driving event occurred) and the other half received contingent negative feedback (when a harsh driving event occurred). Feedback was presented in the form of auditory cues (for half of one group) or as visual cues (for the others). Thus, there were eight groups based on driving style, feedback type, and feedback modality. Multiple kinematic variables were studied with mixed ANOVA, and included not only clearance distances, speeds, and acceleration, but also the chosen overtaking strategy (accelerative vs. flying). Driving style, gender, car usage, feedback type and modality were considered as factors in the analysis. Results showed that the coaching programs had a significant positive effect, in terms of safety, reducing acceleration and speeds during the overtaking and inducing drivers to adopt the safer accelerative strategy. It was also particularly effective in improving the performance of aggressive drivers. These results are of high interest for real-world applications because they were obtained with a general-purpose coaching program; conversely, it might be impractical to develop dedicate programs for specific situations such as drivers overtaking cyclists.",1369-8478,Not found

We performed an experiment to examine the effects of images depicting eHMI messages of different perspectives (egocentric from the pedestrian’s point of view: WALK, DON’T WALK, allocentric: BRAKING, DRIVING, and ambiguous: GO, STOP) on participants’ (N = 103) crossing decisions, response times, and eye movements. Considering that crossing the road can be cognitively demanding, we added a memory task in two-thirds of the trials. The results showed that egocentric messages yielded higher subjective clarity ratings than the other messages as well as higher objective clarity scores (i.e., more uniform crossing decisions) and faster response times than the allocentric BRAKING and the ambiguous STOP. When participants were subjected to the memory task, pupil diameter increased, and crossing decisions were reached faster as compared to trials without memory task. Regarding the ambiguous messages, most participants crossed for the GO message and did not cross for the STOP message, which points towards an egocentric perspective taken by the participant. More lengthy text messages (e.g., DON’T WALK) yielded a higher number of saccades but did not cause slower response times. We conclude that pedestrians find egocentric eHMI messages clearer than allocentric ones, and take an egocentric perspective if the message is ambiguous. Our results may have important implications, as the consensus among eHMI researchers appears to be that egocentric text-based eHMIs should not be used in traffic.",1369-8478,Not found
Gender differences in the use of ADAS technologies: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.011,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Background In recent years, Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been significantly progressed, opening novel horizons in reducing traffic accidents. Driver gender can be an affecting factor in the utilization of these systems. The purpose of this study is to review articles examining the effect of gender on the use of ADAS technologies. Methods This systematic review was conducted in Scopus, Science Direct and PubMed databases using defined key-words in 2018. The retrieved articles were managed and screened through PRISMA-P protocol using EndNote X7 software. The extracted variables were divided into three categories of reaction, behavior, and outcome and also the relevant subgroups. The results for each subgroup were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed to obtain a definite conclusion for each category. Results Totally, 1039 articles were retrieved from which 27 were included. The analysis of results in reaction category indicated that in almost all of the variables, there was no significant difference between male and female drivers. In the behavior category, gender showed a significant effect on variables within the subgroups of driving speed, longitudinal distance, and lateral motion. The gender had also significant effect on the variables of the outcome category. Conclusions The present review showed that there was no significant difference between male and female drivers in reaction to sudden traffic events alarmed by warning systems. However, in terms of driving behavior, males behaved more dangerous than female. The findings also revealed that the number of crashes in critical situations was higher for female drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Young drivers’ takeover time in a conditional automated vehicle: The effects of hand-held mobile phone use and future intentions to use automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2021.01.012,78,2021-04-01,2021,4,"This research aimed to assess the extent to which using a hand-held mobile phone affected young drivers’ (aged 17–25 years) takeback control of a simulated conditional automated vehicle (AV), relative to an auditory working memory n-back task and monitoring the road environment (control condition). In addition to takeback control, this study also applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to assess if there were any differences in future intentions to use AVs after participants had experienced the automated functions of the vehicle compared to pre-drive (baseline). Trust was also measured pre-and post-drive. These additional constructs were included to further assess if the predictors of intentions to use AVs changed after participants had experienced a simulator drive which involve non-driving related tasks (NDRT). Thirty-three young Australian drivers (Mage = 20.97 years, 17 females) took part in the one-hour within groups study which comprised pre-and post-drive self-report questionnaires and operating the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator. In contrast to previous research on NDRT and takeback control (see Zhang et al., 2019), the results revealed that there were no significant differences in takeback control of the vehicle when drivers were using their hand-held mobile phone compared to completing the working memory n-back task or monitoring the road environment. However, a hierarchical regression revealed that participants reported significantly higher ratings that important others would approve of them using a conditional AV and greater control over whether or not they would intend to use an AV in the future post-drive compared to pre-drive, providing partial support for hypothesis 2. Overall, these findings suggest that using a hand-held mobile phone does not negatively influence young drivers’ takeback control of an AV. Further, the study highlights the influence that important others may have in determining whether young drivers intend to use AVs in the future.",1369-8478,Not found
How is emotion associated with driving speed? A study on taxi drivers in Japan,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.020,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Drivers’ emotions significantly affect their driving performance and thus are related to driving safety issues. The objective of this study is to examine how taxi drivers’ on-duty emotional states are associated with their driving speed in real driving situations. An experiment was conducted among 15 taxi drivers in Hiroshima, Japan for 15 consecutive days in 2019. A biometric device was used to track drivers’ emotional states while on duty; the five examined states included happy, angry, relaxed, sad, and neutral. Random effects panel regression results revealed that negative emotions of taxi drivers (angry and sad) have significant impacts on increasing driving speed. In contrast, a neutral emotional state is related with decreased speed, while happy and relaxed emotional states show no significant impact. Moreover, we found that factors such as driving with customers, driving long hours, and number of break hours are significantly associated with driving speed. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the roles that emotional states play in explaining driving speed in real-life driving situations, in contrast to studies that use simulated driving or mood induction procedures.",1369-8478,Not found
Comparing user acceptance of integrated and retrofit driver assistance systems – A real-traffic study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.012,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The path towards a transport system with fully automated vehicles entails a transitioning period where manual and automated vehicles will coexist in traffic for many years. To realize the many suggested benefits of automated transport, such as lower emissions and improved safety, there is a need for more knowledge concerning the user experience of both manual and automated systems. This study measures and compares driver acceptance of an integrated driver assistance system and a retrofit system based on geofence technology. We focus on two use cases: low-emission zones and school zones. The integrated system was tested by 43 participants driving on a pre-defined test route, using an assisting and visual system with HMI integrated in the dashboard. The retrofit system involved 42 participants and was implemented with an on-board unit with a visual system, using an external screen as HMI. Participants tested the system for eight weeks, including two weeks in black mode. Participants in both trials were experienced drivers and likely to be “early adopters”, and the acceptance of the systems was evaluated through a survey. Although the research design for the two driver assistance systems was not identical, similar questions were given, making it possible to compare driver acceptance and workload. The analysis shows overall high acceptance among the users for both trials. However, the results show that the integrated system had greater levels of satisfaction, usefulness and usability for low emission zones, as well as greater levels of satisfaction and usefulness for school zones. We also conclude that retrofit systems must improve HMI satisfaction to constitute a viable option for transport authorities when integrating novel ITS technologies.",1369-8478,Not found

In this study, we focused on two potentially interrelated individual difference variables that may play a role in determining dual-task interference: working memory capacity and the driver’s experience with the relevant secondary task. We used a driving simulator to measure interference, comparing single-task performance (driving alone) with driving performance during three secondary tasks: conversing on a handsfree cellphone, texting, and selecting a song on a touchscreen Mp3 player. Drivers also rated the difficulty of driving while carrying out each secondary task. For the individual difference variables, working memory was measured using the Operation Span test (OSPAN), and experience was assessed in terms of self-reported daily driving exposure and exposure to the relevant secondary tasks (frequency, duration). Overall, we found evidence of dual-task interference, though interference varied between tasks; the texting and Mp3 tasks produced significantly more interference than handsfree cellphone conversation. For the texting and Mp3 song selection tasks, interference was apparent in terms of increased steering variability, but for the Mp3 task there was also compensatory slowing, with drivers slowing down while carrying out the task. OSPAN performance and daily driving exposure were both covariates in predicting the amount of dual-task interference. However, our results suggest that in all but two cases, both involving the texting task, the effects of the OSPAN and the driving and secondary task exposure variables were independent rather than interrelated.",1369-8478,Not found
"Aggressive driving: Do driving overconfidence and aggressive thoughts behind the wheel, drive professionals off the road?",10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.008,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Aggressive driving has emerged as one of the most studied behaviors in the traffic psychology context due to its association with odds of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) and especially fatal ones. Nevertheless, behavioral (aggression) and affective (anger) aspects of aggressive driving have been deeply studied; its cognitive part hasn’t gained much attention; However, its role in understanding the process of aggression and designing interventions couldn’t be neglected. This research investigated the contribution of overconfidence (as the driver’s cognitive bias), aggressive thoughts, driver’s aggression, and risk perception in driver’s performance and the number of self-reported active accidents. The unique contribution of this study is its sample of urban bus drivers that have less been studied to date. Structural equation modeling (SEM), and mediation analysis revealed that overconfidence contributes to aggressive driving through aggressive thoughts behind the wheel. Moreover, overconfidence decreased the risk perception and driving performance of individuals, which were associated with a higher number of driver’s accidents. Besides, aggressive thoughts behind the wheel predicted physically aggressive expression and using the vehicle to express anger, which were associated with a decreased level of driving performance and an increased number of accidents. This study brings further evidence, supporting the importance of cognition in understanding and preventing aggressive driving and its adverse outcomes.",1369-8478,Not found
A study identifying the origins of different types of drink driving events through the lens of deterrence: Is it alcohol abuse or avoiding detection?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.016,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Background While attempts to identify the mechanisms to effectively deter drink driving remains a central focus for road safety researchers, scant scientific enquiry has simultaneously examined perceptions of apprehension risk in combination with substance abuse. This may be considered a significant oversight given that such constructs may create opposing forces, or alternatively, alcohol abuse and punishment avoidance may create cumulative effects and promote offending behaviours. Method This paper reports on an investigation of 718 Queensland motorists' self-reported perceptions of classical and reconceptualised deterrence constructs (as well as alcohol consumption) in order to determine what factors have the greatest effect on promoting drink driving, particularly alcohol consumption or punishment avoidance. The sample completed an online or paper version of the questionnaire. Results “Possible” drink driving events were slightly more common (25.5%) than “acknowledged” drink driving events (16.6%). Future intentions to drink and drive (23.4%) were more common among those who reported an “acknowledged” drink driving event (63.5% reported future intentions to drink drive) than a “possible” drink driving event (47.5%). Sequential binary logistic regression models conducted for each drink driving category revealed that having “risky” drinking behaviour and both direct personal and indirect experience of punishment for a drink driving offence were predictors of “possible” drink driving events. Similarly, “acknowledged” drink driving had the same significant predictors with the addition of increases in age and punishment severity reducing the likelihood of drink driving and direct punishment avoidance having a positive effect. However, and importantly, only direct punishment avoidance and past “possible” and “acknowledged” drink driving events predicted future intentions to offend in the final model, which further reinforces that drink driving is a deliberate decision (rather than stemming primarily from impairment). Practical applications: The findings provide support for increased policing efforts to identify drink drivers.",1369-8478,Not found

We conducted a field observation study to investigate the risk behavior characteristics of meal delivery couriers riding electric bicycles at urban intersections in China. We selected 4 typical signalized urban intersections in Beijing, and video recorded traffic behaviors of meal delivery riders for eight hours. A total of 1891 couriers crossing intersections on electric bicycles were observed, categorized, and analyzed. The results showed that red-light-running and riding-on-the-motor-lane were the most frequent risky traffic behaviors. The ratios of risk behaviors from delivery couriers were almost all significantly higher than those of normal riders (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in these risk behaviors for riders across different platforms. The findings provide valuable insights for understanding couriers’ risk behaviors at intersections and make useful suggestions for improving traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Fatigue risk management based on self-reported fatigue: Expanding a biomathematical model of fatigue-related performance deficits to also predict subjective sleepiness,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.006,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Biomathematical models of fatigue can be used to predict neurobehavioral deficits during sleep/wake or work/rest schedules. Current models make predictions for objective performance deficits and/or subjective sleepiness, but known differences in the temporal dynamics of objective versus subjective outcomes have not been addressed. We expanded a biomathematical model of fatigue previously developed to predict objective performance deficits as measured on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) to also predict subjective sleepiness as self-reported on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Four model parameters were re-estimated to capture the distinct dynamics of the KSS and account for the scale difference between KSS and PVT. Two separate ensembles of datasets – drawn from laboratory studies of sleep deprivation, sleep restriction, simulated night work, napping, and recovery sleep – were used for calibration and subsequent validation of the model for subjective sleepiness. The expanded model was found to exhibit high prediction accuracy for subjective sleepiness, while retaining high prediction accuracy for objective performance deficits. Application of the validated model to an example scenario based on cargo aviation operations revealed divergence between predictions for objective and subjective outcomes, with subjective sleepiness substantially underestimating accumulating objective impairment, which has important real-world implications. In safety-sensitive operations such as commercial aviation, where self-ratings of sleepiness are used as part of fatigue risk management, the systematic differences in the temporal dynamics of objective versus subjective measures of functional impairment point to a potentially significant risk evaluation sensitivity gap. The expanded biomathematical model of fatigue presented here provides a useful quantitative tool to bridge this previously unrecognized gap.",1369-8478,Not found
Can prosocial attitude reduce the risk behavior in simulated driving?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.003,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"High traffic density may lead to more traffic accidents because of more frequent lane change and overtaking behaviors, but drivers with different characteristics may exhibit different driving behaviors. The present study explored the difference in driving behaviors between drivers with a high/low prosocial attitude under high/low traffic density. In this study, a 2 (high/low prosocial attitude) *2 (high/low traffic density) mixed design was used to investigate the interaction between prosocial attitude and traffic density on lane change and overtaking behavior. The implicit association test paradigm was used to measure prosocial attitude, and drivers were divided into two groups. Forty subjects were asked to complete simulated driving tasks under the two conditions of high and low traffic density, and driving behaviors were recorded by driving simulators. The results show that high traffic density leads to more lane change and overtaking behavior. Drivers with a high prosocial attitude have better driving performance under both high and low traffic density, but drivers with a low prosocial attitude maintain a smaller transverse distance from adjacent vehicles in high traffic density, which may increase risk. This study provides support for the selection, training and intervention of professional drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Disparity of motorcycle helmet use in Nepal – Weak law enforcement or riders' reluctance?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.005,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Like many low- and middle-income countries, Nepal is experiencing a massive motorization, predominantly from increased use of motorcycles which is driving a surge in road-related injuries and fatalities. Motorcycles and their riders have been identified as a focal point for road traffic injury prevention measures. While helmet use is mandatory for both motorcycle drivers and passengers, fines for helmet non-use are only levied on drivers, not on passengers, and it is unclear how this unequal enforcement translates to helmet use rates in Nepal. Hence, a video-based observation on motorcyclists’ helmet use was conducted alongside a questionnaire survey on fatalism, perceived police enforcement, risk-taking personality, and perceived usefulness of helmets. For the observation and questionnaire survey, seven rural and urban sites were selected from all seven provinces of Nepal, representing varied populations, road environments, and elevations. The observation of the helmet use behavior of 2548 motorcycle riders revealed an alarming picture of helmet use in Nepal. While more than 98% of observed motorcycle drivers in Nepal used a motorcycle helmet, less than 1% of observed passengers did so. Interviews of 220 riders show that the absence of a fine for helmet non-use by passengers is accompanied by an unawareness of the traffic law, where only 11.8% of respondents knew about the mandatory helmet use law for passengers. Unhelmeted riders had a significantly higher attribution of road related crashes to fate, compared with riders that used a helmet. Results of this study can serve as an evidence base for revisions of Nepal’s Vehicle and Transportation Management Act in regard to traffic rule enforcement and fines. They further show the global importance of comprehensive regulation on safety related behaviors of road users. The feasibility of more comprehensive enforcement is discussed against the background of helmet availability for passengers.",1369-8478,Not found

The current research aimed to explore the mediation effect of emotion regulation in this relationship. The sample consisted of 472 Spanish drivers, who completed a set of self-reports regarding trait driving anger, frequency of aggressive behaviours at the wheel, and difficulties in emotion regulation. The results showed significant relationship among the variables in almost all the cases. Furthermore, a SEM analysis showed that difficulties in emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between trait driving anger and each way of the aggressive behaviours (verbal, physical, using own vehicle, and displaced). These results have important implications in the design of strategies focused on the improvement of emotion regulation to reduce aggressive behaviours in drivers.

Keeping the driver in the loop in conditionally automated driving: A perception-action theory approach,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.003,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"In this paper we investigated if keeping the driver in the perception–action loop during automated driving can improve take-over behavior from conditionally automated driving. To meet this aim, we designed an experiment in which visual exposure (perception) and manual control exposure (action) were manipulated. In a dynamic driving simulator experiment, participants (n = 88) performed a non-driving related task either in a head-up display in the windshield (high visual exposure) or on a head-down display near the gear shift (low visual exposure). While driving, participants were either in an intermittent control-mode with four noncritical take-over situations (high manual control exposure), or in a continuous automation-mode throughout the ride (low manual control exposure). In all conditions, a critical take-over had to be carried out after an approximately 13 min ride. Measurements of take-over behavior showed that only high visual exposure had an effect on hands-on reaction time measurements. Both visual exposure and manual control exposure had small to medium sized main effects on time to system deactivation, the maximum velocity of the steering wheel, and the standard deviation of the steering wheel angle. The combined high visual – and high manual control exposure condition led to 0.55 s faster reaction time and 37% less steering variability in comparison to the worst case low visual – and low manual control exposure condition. Together, results corroborate that maintaining visual exposure and manual control exposure during automated driving can be efficacious and suggest that their positive effects are additive.",1369-8478,Not found
Lessons learned from pedestrian-driver communication and yielding patterns,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.011,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Understanding the hidden patterns of tacit communication between drivers and pedestrians is crucial for improving pedestrian safety. However, this type of communication is a result of the psychological processes of both pedestrians and drivers, which are very difficult to understand thoroughly. This study utilizes a naturalistic field study dataset and explores the hidden patterns from successful and failed communication events using a pattern recognition method known as Taxicab Correspondence Analysis (TCA). The successful communication scenarios indicate the combinations of variable attributes such as eye contact, facial expression, the assertion of crossing, and effective traffic control devices are strongly associated with successful scenarios. The patterns for failed scenarios are most likely to be on the roadway with a relatively higher speed limit (e.g., 35 mph) and a relatively lower speed limit (e.g., 15 mph) under different conditions. On roadways with a higher speed limit, the failed scenarios are highly associated with passive and undecisive pedestrians, pedestrians far away from the crosswalk, regardless of pedestrian-driver eye contact and facial expression of the pedestrians. Instead of waiting for pedestrians to making a crossing decision, overspeeding drivers are more likely to speed up and pass the crosswalk. On roadways with a lower speed limit, the failed scenarios are often associated with distracted pedestrians, vehicles having the right of way, and the absence of effective traffic control devices. These findings could help transportation agencies identify appropriate countermeasures to reduce pedestrian crashes. The findings on driver-pedestrian communication patterns could provide scopes for improvement in computer vision-based algorithms designed for autonomous vehicle industries.",1369-8478,Not found
Visualizing the autonomous vehicle's maneuvers – Does an ecological interface help to increase the hedonic quality and safety?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.005,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"This paper examines whether ecological speed information describing ongoing driving maneuvers during automated driving enhances the hedonic quality and driving safety immediately after a driving takeover. Visualizing maneuvers and trajectories has already proven effective. However, planned acceleration and deceleration in an automated vehicle have not yet been investigated. Therefore, this paper assesses how an automated vehicle’s speed control information might be presented by an ecological interface. Besides a possible increase in the hedonic quality, this information might enhance safe behavior of the human driver when it comes to a takeover. To assess these two aspects, 43 drivers participated in a dynamic driving simulator study. Using a within-subject design, two scenarios were used to compare an ecological interface, dynamically visualizing speed changes, to a conventional pop-up interface, using pop-up icons to visualize speed changes. The experimental results indicate that ecological feedback and conventional pop-up feedback do not differ regarding the hedonic quality, which was reflected by the state anxiety, usefulness, and satisfaction with the overall human-machine interface (HMI). Nonetheless, the post-hoc questionnaire on situational awareness showed a significantly lower rating for the ecological interface which may be the result of a more automatic and subconscious processing of the information given. Analyzing the takeover performance, the initial takeover time was comparably low for both interfaces. However, concerning safety, the ecological interface significantly enhanced the lateral control after takeover, and the drivers looked at the vehicle mirrors significantly earlier. In conclusion, the results show that the information given by the ecological interface may help drivers cope with a sudden takeover in a faster and more controlled way. Future applications of these findings might serve to enhance the acceptance and safety of semi-autonomous vehicles by implementing ecological interfaces.",1369-8478,Not found
The predictive role of achievement goals adoption on sensation-seeking and risk taking in driving,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.006,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Risk taking in driving is a major road safety issue. Understanding the individual psychological differences that may influence risk taking may contribute to better overcome its negative consequences. Recently, four achievement goals were highlighted in the driving domain: striving to drive well or to improve as much as possible (mastery-approach goals), to avoid driving badly or to avoid being a worse driver than before (mastery-avoidance goals), to outperform other drivers (performance-approach goals), and to avoid being a worse driver than other drivers (performance-avoidance goals). The first purpose of the present study was to examine the predictive role of these achievement goals in driving on self-reported drivers’ risk taking (ordinary and aggressive violations) and sensation-seeking. The second purpose of the study was to test the mediating role of sensation seeking between achievement goals adoption in driving and violations. A total of 341 French drivers voluntarily filled out the questionnaires assessing the variables of interest. The main results showed that performance-approach goals adoption was found to positively predict sensation seeking, ordinary and aggressive violations, whereas mastery-avoidance goals adoption was found to negatively predict these variables. The results also highlighted that sensation seeking was a significant mediator of the relationships between the two previous achievement goals (performance-approach and mastery-avoidance goals) and ordinary and aggressive violations. In conclusion, the achievement goal model may now be considered a relevant theoretical framework in the driving literature focusing on risk taking, sensation seeking, and road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Refining distraction potential testing guidelines by considering differences in glancing behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.009,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Driver distraction is a recognized cause of traffic accidents. Although the well-known guidelines for measuring distraction of secondary in-car tasks were published by the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2013, studies have raised concerns on the accuracy of the method defined in the guidelines, namely criticizing them for basing the diversity of the driver sample on driver age, and for inconsistent between-group results. In fact, it was recently discovered that the NHTSA driving simulator test is susceptible to rather fortuitous results when the participant sample is randomized. This suggests that the results of said test are highly dependent on the selected participants, rather than on the phenomenon being studied, for example, the effects of touch screen size on driver distraction. As an attempt to refine the current guidelines, we set out to study whether a previously proposed new testing method is as susceptible to the effects of participant randomization as the NHTSA method. This new testing method differs from the NHTSA method by two major accounts. First, the new method considers occlusion distance (i.e., how far a driver can drive with their vision covered) rather than age, and second, the new method considers driving in a more complex, and arguably, a more realistic environment than proposed in the NHTSA guidelines. Our results imply that the new method is less susceptible to sample randomization, and that occlusion distance appears a more robust criterion for driver sampling than merely driver age. Our results are applicable in further developing driver distraction guidelines and provide empirical evidence on the effect of individual differences in drivers’ glancing behavior.",1369-8478,Not found
The safety performance of connected vehicles on slippery horizontal curves through enhancing truck drivers’ situational awareness: A driving simulator experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.017,79,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Although drivers can adequately adjust their operating speed according to the road curvature, they show a lack of recognition regarding the pavement friction conditions. In this regard, inappropriate speed selection on Horizontal Curves (HCs) with reduced surface friction can lead to a remarkable rate of run-off-road, sideswipe, head-on, and rollover crashes, especially on rural highways. Aligned with the Connected Vehicle (CV) Pilot Program on Interstate-80 in Wyoming, this study scrutinizes how CV advisory/warning messages can enhance traffic safety on slippery HCs. To this aim, a roadway consists of two HCs with regular and slippery pavement conditions was designed in a high-fidelity driving simulator experiment. A total of 24 professional truck drivers were recruited to drive the simulated roadway under CV and non-CV environments. In the CV scenario, drivers were informed about the pavement conditions and the advisory speeds before entering HCs. In contrast, no messages were given to non-CV drivers. Truck drivers' behaviors in both scenarios were quantified using four Kinematic-based Surrogate Measures of Safety (K-SMoS), including deviation from the pathway, instantaneous acceleration, lateral speed, and steering angle. CVs’ trajectories were statistically compared to non-CVs in terms of the central tendency and dispersion using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (WSRT) and Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), respectively. The results of WSRT depicted, under the effect of CV advisory/warning messages and throughout the slippery HC, the central tendency of four K-SMoS could be shifted toward zero by 23% up to 99%. This shifting is associated with a significant safety enhancement that potentially can reduce the likelihood of curve-related crashes on slippery HCs. It was revealed that the variation in drivers’ behavior on the slippery HC could be minimized in the CV environment, where 54% up to 95% reduction in the dispersions of four K-SMoS were observed, leading to more certainty in drivers’ behavior.",1369-8478,Not found

Research on AV trust has centered on trust in vehicle performance. However, trust evaluation may include AV manufacturers and developers, and regulation pertaining to AVs; thus, we expand our measurement of trust to include beliefs based on manufacturers and regulation. In this experiment, we manipulate information regarding manufacturer focus (i.e., an emphasis on standards, regulations, and research (SRR) versus speed to market) to determine its effect on trust. When information focused on SRR, we found higher levels of trust in AV performance and in manufacturers, compared to when it focused on speed to market. In addition, information regarding passenger control (i.e., the ability to take over for the vehicle and to determine privacy settings) was manipulated to yield either high or low passenger control conditions. Behavioral Intention (BI) to use AVs was lowest when speed to market was emphasized and when passenger control was low. Furthermore, trust was tested as a mediator between perceived risk and BI. Trust in AV performance partially mediated the relationship between perceived AV performance risk and BI. In addition, trust in AV regulation partially mediated the relationship between AV privacy/security risk and BI. Researchers should continue to examine trust beyond the AV itself to encompass trust in manufacturers and regulations. Those designing and marketing AVs should carefully consider decisions that influence manufacturer/developer reputation and passenger control due to their effect on intention to use AVs.",1369-8478,Not found

Τhe aim of this paper is to present a thorough, overarching structure of relationships correlating various unsafe stated PTW rider behaviors (riding after alcohol consumption, speeding, helmet use and texting) with several self-reported attitude parameters and factors regarding rider perspectives on traffic rule strictness and social desirability. A structural equation model (SEM) was developed using data from the ESRA2 survey, which provided a broad sample encompassing 5,958 respondent riders from 32 countries. Numerous statistical relationships were discovered and quantified correlating the four examined unsafe rider behaviors with eight latent unobserved variables. All covariances between unsafe behaviors were found to be positive and statistically significant, indicating that a rider who will engage more frequently in every single one of the four examined unsafe riding behaviors is more likely to also engage in all the others as well.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessing crossing and communication behavior of pedestrians at urban streets,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.001,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Pedestrians belong to the most vulnerable road users and in order to reduce accidents and fatality rates, research on pedestrian crossing behavior is necessary. However, findings on pedestrians’ crossing, gaze and gesture behavior are heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory. Different methods that are used to assess pedestrian behavior might provide an explanation. In a field study, we measured pedestrian behavior in real traffic by making use of instructed and non-instructed pedestrians, combining and comparing objective and subjective data. Instructed pedestrians deliberately interacted with a research vehicle in urban traffic and filled in 2687 self-report questionnaires about experienced scenarios from their point of view. Interaction scenarios focused on instructed pedestrians either crossing or not crossing the street when the research vehicle passed by. In addition, 75 h of video-recorded interaction scenarios with instructed and non-instructed pedestrians were gathered using a camera placed on the inside of the research vehicle. Self-report and video data were matched (N = 644) and evaluated regarding instructed pedestrians’ crossing, gaze and gesture behavior. Substantial agreement was found between self-reported and video-observed data for crossing action and gesture occurrence and somewhat lower agreement for gaze occurrence. Furthermore, the crossing, gaze and gesture behavior of instructed pedestrians (N = 1423 situations) and non-instructed pedestrians (N = 369 situations) was compared and no major discordance was reported. Therefore, instructed pedestrians can be an externally valid method to assess crossing behavior while implications are given on how self-reported and observational data can mutually supplement each other.",1369-8478,Not found
The effects of message threat on psychological reactance to traffic safety messaging,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.013,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Psychological reactance to persuasive messages can undermine and contradict the goals of those messages. This study examined the effect of message characteristics (forcefulness and framing) on psychological reactance to traffic safety messages that promoted safe behavior (seat belt wearing) and prohibited risky behavior (distracted driving) in terms of threat appraisal, emotional reaction, and message attitude. The study also included perceiver characteristics (reactance proneness, behavior attitude, and risk-taking propensity). Using a within-subject design, subjects completed an online experiment that presented short traffic safety messages followed by questions that measure psychological reactance. The results demonstrated that forceful messages could increase psychological reactance. However, the perceiver characteristics were often significant as covariates affecting this relationship. The study concludes that the design of effective traffic safety messages must consider both the characteristics of the message content and the characteristics of the message audience.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the effects of EEG signals on collision cases happening in the process of young drivers’ braking,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.010,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Detecting mental states in drivers offers an opportunity to reduce accidents by triggering alerts and signaling the need for rest or renewed focus. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain signals in young drivers operating a driving simulator to detect mental states and predict accidents. We measured reaction times to unexpected hazardous events and correlated them with EEG signals measured from the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices as well as the central sulcus (corresponding to motor cortex). We found that EEG signals in the relative beta (power in beta (13–30 Hz) relative to total power of the EEG (0.5–30 Hz)), alpha/delta, alpha/theta, beta/delta, beta/theta frequency bands were higher for collisions than successful collision avoidance, and that the key decision-making period is the 2nd second before braking. Importantly, a decision tree classifier trained on these neural signals predicted collision avoidance outcomes. Then based on random forest model, we extracted three critical neural signals (beta/delta_frontal, relative beta_parietal and relative beta_central Sulcus) to classify collision avoidance outcomes. Our findings suggest measuring EEG during driving may provide useful signals for enhancing driver safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Multimodal traffic safety concerns in a university population,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.013,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Travelers have different concerns about traffic safety, which may affect their transportation choices and risk-taking behaviors as well as the overall safety performance of multimodal transportation systems. The objective of this study was to examine factors associated with stated concerns surrounding traffic safety among travelers using multiple transport modes. The analysis used data from an online questionnaire survey completed by over 2,000 students and employees at Utah State University in Logan, Utah, US. Four latent variables—concerns about pedestrians and cyclists, auto drivers, modal interactions, and roadway conditions—were confirmed using factor analysis from 16 questions about traffic safety concerns. These four types of safety concerns were then analyzed to understand their associations with mode choice, commuting behavior, and socio-demographics using a structural equation model. Results showed that safety concern varied systematically among different mode users and demographic groups. Auto drivers perceived interactions with pedestrians and cyclists as concerning, while non-auto users felt more concerned by automobile traffic. Commuters who were recently involved in a crash were especially concerned with non-motorized modes. Women, lower-income, and non-white road users were more concerned with traffic safety overall. Findings about multimodal traffic safety concerns provide insights into people’s perceptions, which can be useful in developing designs, plans, and policies for making a safer transportation system for all road users.",1369-8478,Not found
What makes a good driver on public roads and race tracks? An interview study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.019,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Future vehicles may drive automatically in a human-like manner or contain systems that monitor human driving ability. Algorithms of these systems must have knowledge of criteria of good and safe driving behavior with regard to different driving styles. In the current study, interviews were conducted with 30 drivers, including driving instructors, engineers, and race drivers. The participants were asked to describe good driving on public roads and race tracks, and in some questions were supported with video material. The results were interpreted with the help of Endsley’s model of situation awareness. The interviews showed that there were clear differences between what was considered good driving on the race track and good driving on the public road, where for the former, the driver must touch the limit of the vehicle, whereas, for the latter, the limit should be avoided. However, in both cases, a good driver was characterized by self-confidence, lack of stress, and not being aggressive. Furthermore, it was mentioned that the driver’s posture and viewing behavior are essential components of good driving, which affect the driver’s prediction of events and execution of maneuvers. The implications of our findings for the development of automation technology are discussed. In particular, we see potential in driver posture estimation and argue that automated vehicles excel in perception but may have difficulty making predictions.",1369-8478,Not found
Younger drivers executive functioning and the relationship with experiencing signs of sleepiness,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.003,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Young drivers are more likely to continue driving when experiencing signs of sleepiness and are over-represented in sleep-related crashes. Adolescence and early adulthood are characterised by comparatively poor executive functioning, and while previous research has demonstrated a link between poor executive functions and several risky driving behaviours, the relationship with sleepy driving is not well understood. Accordingly, the first aim of the current study was to examine the association between executive functions and experiencing the signs of driver sleepiness in a sample of young adult drivers. Additionally, young drivers who have less experience with driving while sleepy, may attribute less importance to the signs of sleepiness as an indicator of underlying sleepiness level. To test this assumption (aim two), the impact of experiencing signs of sleepiness on perceptions of the importance of those signs was examined. Participants included 118 young adults aged between 17 and 25 years, who completed an online survey measuring experiences with the signs of sleepiness while driving, executive functions, and demographic characteristics. This sample of young adults reported having considerable experience with several signs of sleepiness (i.e., yawning, mind wandering, and difficulty keeping eyes while driving). A linear regression analysis found that the demographic variables of age and hours driven per week, as well as the executive function constructs of organization, strategic planning, and impulse control were associated with experiencing signs or sleepiness. Moreover, having experienced more signs of sleepiness was associated with an increased likelihood in rating those signs as important indicators of sleepiness. The current findings suggest both that several high-level cognitive processes as well as levels of experience with driving when experiencing signs of sleepiness contribute to young peoples’ sleepy driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Behaviour and perceptions of powered two-wheeler users in street designs with elements of shared space,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.007,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Inspired by developments in urban planning, the concept of “shared space” has recently emerged as a way of creating a better public realm by facilitating pedestrian movement and lowering vehicle traffic volumes and speeds. Previous research looked at how the behaviour and perceptions of pedestrians, vehicle drivers and pedal cyclists, vary with the introduction of elements of shared space. The aim of this study is to extend this analysis to Powered Two-Wheeler (PTW) riders, who are a road user group that is often overlooked. The study consists of two parts. The first one conducts a video observation analysis of the behaviour of PTW riders before and after the redevelopment of the Exhibition Road site in London’s South Kensington area to a layout with shared space elements, and looks at changes in key variables, such as flow and speed. The second part, then, provides an insight into the perceptions of PTW riders through a generic stated-preference survey investigating their “willingness to share space” with vehicles and pedestrians. The results show that PTW riders appear to treat shared space features more like motorised users rather than non-motorised ones. Indeed, lower PTW flows and speeds and fewer overtaking manoeuvres are recorded on Exhibition Road post-redevelopment, while lower willingness to share is expressed when large numbers of pedestrians and static obstacles (such as trees, seating and fountains) are present. On the other hand, PTW riders are more positive towards shared space elements if the design provides ample space and a smooth pavement surface.",1369-8478,Not found
How accurate are memories of traffic accidents? Increased false memory levels among motorcyclists when confronted with accident-related word lists,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.015,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Previous studies have found that false memories increase when people receive stimuli which is related to their knowledge base. In the current set of four experiments, we examined how accident experience affected false memory production among motorcyclists using different types of false memory word lists. Specifically, Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were conducted involving motorcyclists with and without accident experience, whereas Study 4 was conducted on non-motorcyclists without accident experience. In all experiments, participants were given associatively-related word lists known to foster false memory creation. Different types of word lists were used consisting of accident-related words, emotionally-negative words, and neutral words. Levels of false memory were measured using recall and recognition tests. We found consistent results in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 in which among motorcyclists, accident-related words produced higher levels of false memory than emotionally-negative and neutral words. This pattern was not observed in Experiment 4 where non-motorcyclists were involved. Our results shed light on the role of previous experience on false memory formation. One implication could be that the police should be careful with reports of motorcyclists' experiences about their accidents as motorcyclists may spontaneously come up with false, but related details concerning these experiences.",1369-8478,Not found
The fast and the female: Gender differences in wellbeing and wage consequences of commute impedance,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.002,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"At equal distance, the impedance created by traffic congestion strongly affects the duration of commute. Extant literature indicates that commute impedance negatively affects wellbeing, distinctly from the distance and the duration of commute. These negative effects are reported to be larger for women. Consequently, workers, especially females, must be willing to accept lower wages if reaching the job location entails fewer traffic congestions and accommodates a speedier commute. Using the Canadian General Social Survey of 2015 and the Census of 2016, the present paper assesses the wellbeing and wage consequences of commute impedance on men and women who drive to work. The study first demonstrates that the negative impact of commute impedance on wellbeing is greater for women. Second, consistent with the greater negative effect of traffic congestion on their wellbeing, women appear to pay a price off their wages, in order to avoid commute impedance. The policy implications are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
An exploratory investigation into the self-regulatory processes influencing drug driving: Are young drivers more externally regulated?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.011,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"An upward trend in drug driving has been observed in several countries around the world. Research suggests that younger drivers are more likely to engage in drug driving compared to older drivers. There is also evidence to suggest young drivers differ from older drivers in their capacity for self-regulation. Despite this, research has yet to explore the impact of age on the self-regulatory processes with regard to decisions to drug drive among drug users. A total of 507 Queensland drivers (72.8% female), who reported ever taking an illegal drug, were involved in the research. Participants completed an online questionnaire, which collected demographic and drug consumption information, as well as items assessing the self-regulatory processes influencing drug driving, and drug driving behaviour. Regardless of age, participants reported a tendency towards internalised regulation. However, results suggest that young drivers (aged 18–24 years) feel greater belongingness to people who promote safe transport decisions after taking drugs, compared to drivers aged 25 years and over. Interaction effects revealed that for young drug takers, feeling greater relatedness, along with perceiving competence and importance in planning alternative transport after taking drugs, can be protective against drug driving behaviours. Significant predictors of drug driving were lower relatedness, greater perceived pressure to drug drive, lower effort/importance to plan safe alternatives after taking drugs, being of older age, and greater drug abuse. Counterintuitively, perceiving more options (choice) to take alternative transport after taking drugs also predicted the offending behaviour. The results of this study suggest that enhancing drivers’ competency to make (and value) safe driving decisions is a critical step for road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the benefits of conversing with a digital voice assistant during automated driving: A parametric duration model of takeover time,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.012,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Vehicle automation allows drivers to disengage from driving causing a potential decline in their alertness. One of the major challenges of highly automated vehicles is to ensure a timely (with respect to safety and situation awareness) takeover in such conditions. For this purpose, the current study investigated the role of an in-vehicle digital voice-assistant (VA) in conditionally automated vehicles, offering spoken discourse relating specifically to contextual factors, such as the traffic situation and road environment. The study involved twenty-four participants, each taking two drives (counterbalanced): with VA and without VA, in a driving simulator. Participants were required to takeover vehicle control following the issuance of a takeover request (TOR) near the end of each drive. A parametric duration model was adopted to find the key factors determining takeover time (TOT). Paired comparisons showed higher alertness and higher active workload (mean NASA-TLX rating) during automation when accompanied by the VA. Paired t-test comparison of gaze behavior prior to takeover showed significantly higher instances of checking traffic signal, roadside objects, and the roadway during the drive with VA, indicating higher situation awareness. The parametric model indicated that the VA increased the likelihood of making a timely takeover by 39%. There was also some evidence suggesting that male drivers are likely to resume control 1.21 times earlier than female drivers. The study findings highlight the benefits of adopting a digital voice assistant to keep the drivers alert and aware about the recent traffic environment in partially automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Bio-inspired intent communication for automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.021,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Various external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been proposed that communicate the intent of automated vehicles (AVs) to vulnerable road users. However, there is no consensus on which eHMI concept is most suitable for intent communication. In nature, animals have evolved the ability to communicate intent via visual signals. Inspired by intent communication in nature, this paper investigated three novel and potentially intuitive eHMI designs that rely on posture, gesture, and colouration, respectively. In an online crowdsourcing study, 1141 participants viewed videos featuring a yielding or non-yielding AV with one of the three bio-inspired eHMIs, as well as a green/red lightbar eHMI, a walk/don’t walk text-based eHMI, and a baseline condition (i.e., no eHMI). Participants were asked to press and hold a key when they felt safe to cross and to answer rating questions. Together, these measures were used to determine the intuitiveness of the tested eHMIs. Results showed that the lightbar eHMI and text-based eHMI were more intuitive than the three bio-inspired eHMIs, which, in turn, were more intuitive than the baseline condition. An exception was the bio-inspired colouration eHMI, which produced a performance score that was equivalent to the text-based eHMI when communicating ‘non-yielding’. Further research is necessary to examine whether these observations hold in more complex traffic situations. Additionally, we recommend combining features from different eHMIs, such as the full-body communication of the bio-inspired colouration eHMI with the colours of the lightbar eHMI.",1369-8478,Not found

Cargo TTW riders’ psychological factors and risky behaviors lead to a number of accidents. A questionnaire is designed by comprehensively considering these factors and behaviors of cargo TTW riders that includes eleven risk factors to quantitatively analyze the risky behaviors based on structural equation modeling (SEM). One thousand three hundred nineteen participants reported using cargo TTWs on a questionnaire distributed across the country. The characteristics of riding behavior data are analyzed to verify the three-layer risk theoretical framework of “Psychological factors (Personality traits/specific factors) - Psychological acceptability of risks (confidence/perception/attitude) - Risky behaviors”. The results show that anger has a strong direct effect on riding violations, while normlessness and altruism have a direct effect on riding errors. Workload has a weak but direct effect on risky behaviors, and riding feedback has a weak and mixed effect. In addition, high-risk groups are identified by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with rider population attributes. These quantitative analyses can help guide safety countermeasures to mitigate accidents involving cargo TTWs.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of time pressure on steering control of the drivers in a car-following situation,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.007,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The current study focused on analyzing steering control of the drivers during a car-following situation under increasing time pressure conditions. A driving simulator experiment was conducted on ninety-two participants to assess steering performance measures. Five different steering control measures: Variability in Steering Angle (VSA), Steering Reversal Rate (SRR), Steering Speed (SS), Stability of Steering Control (SSC), and Maximum Steering Swerve (MSS) were examined under No Time Pressure (NTP), Low Time Pressure (LTP), and High Time Pressure (HTP) driving conditions. Repeated measures ANOVA (for continuous data) and Friedman’s test (count data) with post-hoc analysis and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) modeling technique were used to investigate the influence of time pressure and different predictor variables. The statistical analysis showed that time pressure driving conditions significantly affected steering control of the drivers. The pairwise comparison of time pressure conditions revealed that HTP significantly affected most of the steering control measures as compared to LTP. Further, a GEE model also exhibited similar results where steering control measures were substantially influenced by HTP as compared to LTP. Moreover, in addition to time pressure conditions, demographic characteristics showed significant influence on steering control measures. The GEE model results showed that female drivers performed 13% more steering corrections (5° SRR) which led to better SSC by 124.44% than male drivers. Additionally, it was discovered that young-aged and experienced drivers took extra steering efforts to control lateral position of the vehicle by increasing 53.50% SS and 1% SRR compared to middle-aged and inexperienced drivers. The findings from the current study revealed that drivers undergo fast and abrupt steering maneuvers under time pressure conditions. The research approach demonstrated in the current study can be beneficial to discriminate minimum requirement of steering efforts and set-up threshold values for various steering evasion techniques to control and maintain safe lateral position during car-following maneuvers.",1369-8478,Not found
The role of drivers’ social interactions in their driving behavior: Empirical evidence and implications for car-following and traffic flow,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.002,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Models for describing the microscopic driving behavior rarely consider the “social effects” on drivers’ driving decisions. However, social effect can be generated due to interactions with surrounding vehicles and affect drivers’ driving behavior, e.g., the interactions result in imitating the behavior of peer drivers. Therefore, social environment and peer influence can impact the drivers’ instantaneous behavior and shift the individuals’ driving state. This study aims to explore empirical evidence for existence of a social effect, i.e., when a fast-moving vehicle passes a subject vehicle, does the driver mimic the behavior of passing vehicle? High-resolution Basic Safety Message data set (N = 151,380,578) from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment program in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is used to explore the issue. The data relates to positions, speeds, and accelerations of 63 host vehicles traveling in connected vehicles with detailed information on surrounding environment at a frequency of 10 Hz. Rigorous random parameter logit models are estimated to capture the heterogeneity among the observations and to explore if the correlates of social effect can vary both positively and negatively. Results show that subject drivers do mimic the behavior of passing vehicles –in 16 percent of passing events (N = 18,099 total passings occurred in freeways), subject vehicle drivers are observed to follow the passing vehicles accelerating. We found that only 1.2 percent of drivers normally sped up (10 km/hr in 10 s) during their trips, when they were not passed by other vehicles. However, if passed by a high speed vehicle the percentage of drivers who sped up is 16.0 percent. The speed change of at least 10 km/hr within 10 s duration is considered as accelerating threshold. Furthermore, the acceleration of subject vehicle is more likely if the speed of subject driver is higher and more surrounding vehicles are present. Interestingly, if the difference with passing vehicle speed is high, the likelihood of subject driver’s acceleration is lower, consistent with expectation that if such differences are too high, the subject driver may be minimally affected. The study provides new evidence that drivers’ social interactions can change traffic flow and implications of the study results are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Bicyclists’ behavioral and physiological responses to varying roadway conditions and bicycle infrastructure,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.004,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Population growth increase of vehicle ownership, and development patterns have resulted in greater levels of congestion, pollution, and crash frequency. A proposed solution to lessen current transportation system demands is to increase the share of bicycle trips. Furthermore, as cycling is perceived by some as both a dangerous and stressful mode of transportation, understanding the factors that lead to less comfortable and stressful riding, can help drive bicycle infrastructure development. To establish a more robust understanding of the behaviors of bicyclists and how infrastructure design and operations influence them, a bicycle simulator was used to evaluate bicyclist performance measures of velocity, horizontal displacement, and physiological responses (i.e., galvanic skin response) while riding in varying roadway conditions. Results showed that bicyclists in the bike lane condition, had a GSR reading 1.77 peaks per min less than when cycling in the no bike lane condition. When bicyclists were in no bike lane condition, the GSR reading was not affected by vehicle speed but it was affected by the vehicular volume. Additionally, females felt less comfortable when riding in either bike condition, even though they reported that they were “Strong and Fearless” riders.

This work sought to investigate the influence of two types of task-related mental fatigue on eye movement by examining 8 saccade-based, 3 blink-based, and 1 pupil-based metrics. We propose that two types of task-related fatigue caused by cognitive overload and prolonged underload will induce different physiological responses to eye-motion features. Twenty participants completed a vigilance task before and after a 1-h driving with a secondary task in a virtual simulation environment, while forty participants, divided equally into two groups, finished the same task before and after a 1-h and 1.5-h monotonous driving. T-test was applied to analyse the eye-motion, subjective and vigilance data during vigilance task. We found that overload driving made drivers vigilance ability decrease. The eye metrics showed different changes in underload and overload scenario. The blink duration, the mean velocity of saccade and saccade duration increased after 1-h overload driving, while the pupil diameter decreased. However, none of those changes were observed in 1.5-h underload driving, but saccade duration had a significant increase. The fatigue response to heavy demands over short periods of driving is different from the lighter demands over long periods in terms of eye-motion metrics.

"Higher order training supporting competence, autonomy, relatedness (HOT-CAR): A model to improve learner drivers' higher order skills",10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.013,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Approaches to teaching young Learners to drive on-road often lack a strong, overarching theoretical framework. This paper proposes a transtheoretical model to guide instruction of higher-order skills – that are associated with reduced crash risk in young drivers – including established teaching techniques for effective instruction. Learnings from Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Goals for Driver Education framework (widely identified as best-practice but not effectively translated into practice) were integrated into the Higher Order Training supporting Competence, Autonomy, Relatedness (HOT-CAR) model. The model was empirically informed from naturalistic observation of professional in-vehicle lessons (n = 110) and a survey of young adolescent drivers (n = 1627). The HOT-CAR model is presented as a three-component framework that recognises learning to drive occurs within a broader system beyond the Learner and the instructor. The foundation of the model identifies the nature of the relationship between the Learner and the instructor that underlies the success of all other elements. The core of the model is the higher-order driving instruction approach including teaching strategies informed by SDT’s needs-supportive model. The context for the model incorporates some of the immediate considerations relevant to instruction; for example, the graduated driver licensing system, automated vehicle features, and peer influence. An example of the application of the model is provided to reflect the immediate practicality of the HOT-CAR model to driver training. This contributes to the limited road safety literature providing a practical solution to Learner driver training that has potential to reduce the crash risk of young novice drivers. Importantly, the model has potential to be applied and adapted to education and other training environments where higher-order skills are a safety–critical component.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring multi-homing behavior of ride-sourcing drivers via real-world multiple platforms data,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.017,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Multi-homing behavior refers to the behavior that ride-sourcing drivers simultaneously register and sequentially provide services on multiple ride-sourcing platforms. The multi-homing behavior of ride-sourcing drivers significantly impacts the competition among multiple ride-sourcing platforms in a competitive market. To better understand the multi-homing behavior, we present exploratory evidence on the factors that influence drivers' platform switching behavior. The RF-MNL (random forest multinomial logistic regression) framework is applied to analyze multi-homing driver behavior in a competitive ride-sourcing market. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) is adopted to model the platform switching behavior of multi-homing drivers. The random forest is employed to seek the best combination of variables for the MLR model, which is calibrated by using the one-month multi-platform ride-sourcing data in Hangzhou, China. A variety of explanatory variables that influence ride-sourcing drivers' multi-homing behavior are estimated. The results show that the driver's socio-demographic characteristics, income level, bonus income (e.g., long-distance price rise), and work time related factors (e.g., the time gap of order dispatching, and wait time) play an essential role in determining the platform switching decision. This study corroborates the evidence of significant factors that impact drivers' switching from one ride-sourcing platform to another, which can support decision-making for ride-sourcing platforms to attract drivers serving the platform exclusively. We also examine how heterogeneity in drivers' multi-homing tendencies affects the platform's policy. To our best knowledge, this paper is one of the first quantitative studies that empirically reveal the commonly observed multi-homing behavior of ride-sourcing drivers by exploring real-world city-wide data collected on multiple platforms.",1369-8478,Not found
Different level automation technology acceptance: Older adult driver opinion,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.010,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The increase in the number of older adult drivers in developed countries has raised safety concerns due to the decline in their sensory, motor, perceptual, and cognitive abilities which can limit their driving capabilities. Their driving safety could be enhanced by the use of modern Automated Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) and might totally resolved by full driving automation. However, the acceptance of these technologies by older adult drivers is not yet well understood. Thus, this study investigated older adult drivers’ intention to use six ADASs and full driving automation through two questionnaires with 115 and 132 participants respectively in Rhode Island, USA. A four-dimensional model referred to as the USEA model was used for exploring older adult drivers’ technology acceptance. The USEA model included perceived usefulness, perceived safety, perceived ease of use, and perceived anxiety. Path Analysis was applied to evaluate the proposed model. The results of this study identified the important factors in older adult drivers’ intention to use ADASs and full driving automation, which could assist stakeholders in improving technologies for use by older drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Surrendering personal control to automation: Appalling or appealing?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.018,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"There has been a growing interest in Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology worldwide over the last decade. Nevertheless, various studies have noted some potential socio-psychological challenges to AV use and ownership. These challenges can be mitigated by designing AV that accounts for users’ personalities, such as their perceived control and power. The complex relationship between personal control and automation, two concepts that intuitively sound contradictory to each other, is less explored. In this study, two dimensions of personal control, the desire for control and the driver locus of control, were hypothesized to influence the attitude toward AV. The relationships were moderated by power distance, a cultural factor related to one’s sense of control. The hypotheses were tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach via the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) software. As many as 457 respondents from two sample groups, Hungarian and Indonesian drivers were gathered via an online questionnaire and compared. The results reveal that 1) the higher the desire for control, the more negative the attitude toward AV 2) the higher the external driver locus of control, the more positive the attitude toward AV 3) the more positive the attitude toward AV, the higher the intention to use AV and 4) power distance moderates the relationship between the desire for control and the attitude toward AV, such that the negative effect of the desire for control is strengthened in high power distance orientation. This study also provides theoretical contributions and managerial implications, especially to AV designers.",1369-8478,Not found
Avoidance and personal and occupational quality of life in French people with driving anxiety,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.019,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Driving anxiety can have a significant impact on one’s quality of life, particularly for those who experience intense levels. However, to date there are limited data about the perceived impact of driving anxiety on occupational life, and driving anxiety remains under-researched in France. To address this gap, an online survey assessing self-reported driving anxiety, how it manifests and its links with some aspects of personal and occupational life was designed. The survey was administered in France to respondents who identified as experiencing driving anxiety. Responses were obtained from 304 people aged 18 years or older. In the sample, 32.2%, 44.7% and 23% respectively reported mild, moderate and extreme levels of driving anxiety. In the extremely anxious group, males were under-represented, whereas people aged 35–44 and unlicensed drivers were over-represented. People who were unemployed (excluding students and retired people), reported that their anxiety had been a barrier to getting a job and a high percentage of these respondents had also previously considered leaving a position because of their anxiety. Respondents also reported their anxiety had a negative impact on their perceived quality of life in general. People who categorised as extremely anxious reported a negative impact four times higher than those in the mildly anxious group. The results highlight for the first time the perceived impact of driving anxiety on daily and occupational life in a French population. Further, the results demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between moderately and extremely anxious drivers as the intensity level has differential impacts on personal and work life quality.",1369-8478,Not found
Icy roads and urban environments. Passenger experiences in autonomous vehicles in Finland,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.015,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This study focused on identifying customerś real-life experiences, perceptions and feelings about travelling in different autonomous vehicles and in various operating conditions in Finland in 2018. Quantitative convenience sample (n = 141) were collected from passengers travelling on an autonomous shuttle bus in Helsinki. Qualitative data (n = 70) were gathered by interviewing passengers of a driverless shuttle bus in Helsinki and passengers of an autonomous car in winter conditions in Lapland. This research was first one which included passengers’ real-life experiences after using autonomous vehicles in winter conditions. We applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The research questions were (a) What beliefs about outcomes and evaluation of outcomes do passengers have and carry out when they travel in an autonomous vehicle, irrespective of vehicle type or operating conditions? (b) What key factors influence people’s positive or negative attitudes towards autonomous vehicles? (c) What key factors could induce people to use autonomous vehicles? The quantitative data were analysed by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test and qualitative data by inductive content analysis. According to the results, trust, safety and security were the main factors influencing people’s positive attitudes towards using autonomous vehicles. Results from passengers travelling in heavy winter conditions indicate that winter conditions do not significantly influence passengers’ attitudes towards using autonomous vehicles. There were no significant differences between gender regarding passengers’ perceptions of traffic safety, personal security and emergency management. However, younger passengers felt their personal security on board to be significantly better than older and students their possibilities to act in a case of emergency significantly better than employed people.",1369-8478,Not found
Antecedents of consumer loyalty in ride-hailing,10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.016,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The rise of the sharing economy has remarkedly shifted consumers’ traffic behaviour, which gave rise to successful start-up businesses, such as Uber and Grab, that offer innovative transport alternatives through car and ride sharing. This study investigates consumers’ traffic attitudes and behavioural responses to on-demand ride-hailing. Using structural equation modelling, our survey findings showed that price consciousness, perceived usefulness, ease of use, safety risk and customer value exert significant influences on word-of-mouth (WOM), a manifestation of attitudinal loyalty towards ride-hailing. Contrary to findings in previous studies, our study found insignificant effects of personal innovativeness, subjective norm and perceived privacy security on WOM. In addition, although environmental consciousness is a predictor of WOM, its significant effect on WOM is negative. WOM is found to significantly impact purchase intention which is an indicator of behavioural loyalty. By identifying the antecedents of consumer loyalty in ride-hailing, this study provides recommendations for the ride-hailing ecosystem to generate more sustainable urban transport solutions.",1369-8478,Not found
“Pédaler en toute sécurité”: The Cycling Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) in Belgium – A validation study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.014,80,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Introduction: During the last few years, the use of behavioral questionnaires for assessing risky behaviors of road users different from motor-vehicle drivers has grown considerably in applied research for road safety. In this regard, recent tools such as the Cycling Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) are gaining ground, being adapted and tested in further languages, thus getting useful to address the case of countries whose language is different to the English and Spanish. Therefore, and in order to extend the use of the CBQ, this study aimed (i) to develop the validation of the CBQ to the French and Dutch languages, in order to cover the population of Belgian cyclists and (potentially) other countries speaking these languages, as well as (ii) to explore demographic and cycling-related differences in cycling behaviors. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, data was collected from a full sample of 1,897 adult cyclists (50.9% males; 48.7% females; 0.4% others) from various regions of Belgium, with a mean age of 41.71 years. Results: The results suggest the CBQ, in its French and Dutch versions, has a strong factor composition, fair psychometrical properties and good convergent validity. Further, gender and cycling pattern-related differences were found in regard to the three dimensions measured by the scale. Conclusion: The results of this study support the value of the Cycling Behavior Questionnaire to be used for researchers studying road cyclists’ behavior from the human factors perspective in French and Dutch-speaking countries.",1369-8478,Not found
Hybrid route choice model incorporating latent cognitive effects of real-time travel information using physiological data,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.021,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The proliferation of information systems is enabling drivers to receive en route real-time travel information, often from multiple sources, for making informed routing decisions. A robust understanding of route choice behavior under information provision can be leveraged by traffic operators to design information and its delivery systems for managing network-wide traffic. However, most existing route choice models lack the ability to consider the latent cognitive effects of information on drivers and their implications on route choice decisions. This paper presents a hybrid route choice modeling framework that incorporates the latent cognitive effects of real-time information and the effects of several explanatory variables that can be measured directly (i.e., route characteristics, information characteristics, driver attributes, and situational factors). The latent cognitive effects are estimated by analyzing drivers’ physiological data (i.e., brain electrical activity patterns) measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG). Data was collected for 95 participants in driving simulator experiments designed to elicit realistic route choices using a network-level setup featuring routes with different characteristics (in terms of travel time and driving environment complexity) and dynamic ambient traffic. Averaged EEG band powers in multiple brain regions were used to extract two latent cognitive variables that capture driver’s cognitive effort during and immediately after the information provision, and cognitive inattention before implementing the route choice decision. A Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes model was used to test the effects of several explanatory factors on the latent cognitive variables, and their combined impacts on route choice decisions. The study results highlight the significant effects of driver attributes and information characteristics on latent cognitive effort and of route characteristics on latent cognitive inattention. They also indicate that drivers who are more attentive and exert more cognitive effort are more likely to switch from their current route by complying with the information provided. The study insights can aid traffic operators and information service providers to incorporate human factors and cognitive aspects while devising strategies for designing and disseminating real-time travel information to influence drivers’ route choices.",1369-8478,Not found
Student driver propensity to engage with distractions – a self-report survey,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.008,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This paper reports a survey of engagement with, and ratings of, driver distraction, for undergraduate student drivers. Survey data was collected using an anonymous online questionnaire. 530 respondents contributed to the survey during a seven-year data collection period. Results indicate that the three internal-to-vehicle behaviours rated as most distracting when driving were ‘writing text messages’, ‘internet use’, and ‘reading text messages’. The three most frequently undertaken distractions were, ‘(interactions with) adults’, ‘daydreaming’, and ‘eating, drinking or smoking’. Considering external-to-vehicle distractions, the top three rated were ‘environmental conditions’, ‘unexpected objects or events’, and ‘animals behaving unexpectedly’; while the most frequently experienced external distractions were ‘people (behaving normally), ‘busy roads’ and ‘official signage’. Some evidence was found that internal-to-vehicle distractions were relatively more distracting than external-to-vehicle ones, along with limited findings showing significant variation in the amount of engagement with distractions over time. Significant predictive models for engagement with distraction were calculated (for both work-related and non-work-related driving) and found to be broadly in agreement with previous research, although accounting for less variance in the models. Significantly greater engagement with distractions was found during non-work-related driving, when compared to work-related. The data present a picture of ongoing and substantial engagement with distracting behaviours for this population over the data collection period. For example, on a daily or weekly basis, more than three-fifths of respondents reported willingness to read text messages with the vehicle in motion; while just under half indicated that they typically write text messages in the same circumstances. However, the findings do offer some promise that interventions targeted towards non-work-related driving behaviours may be effective to reduce volitional engagement with distractions.",1369-8478,Not found
A cross-cultural comparison of where drivers choose to look when viewing driving scenes,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.013,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"A substantial proportion of road accidents occur as a result of drivers having poor or insufficient visual search strategies. However, the majority of research into drivers visual search comes from high income Western countries where roads are relatively safe, with less being known about the visual search of drivers from non-western, low and middle income countries with much higher crash rates. This is despite the fact that cross-cultural studies have shown differences in visual search outside of driving between Western and Eastern individuals. The current study aimed to see whether these differences were present in driving by asking UK and Malaysian drivers to select where they would look when viewing images of roads from the perspective of a driver. Results showed that all drivers selected a similar number of focal objects, however there was a difference in the type of background information drivers chose to attend to, with Malaysian drivers selecting more task irrelevant information at the expense of task relevant information. Results suggest that there are cultural differences in what drivers choose to attend to which may contribute to the increased crash rate amongst drivers from low and middle income countries.",1369-8478,Not found
Mapping drivers’ mental models of adaptive cruise control to performance,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.012,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Driver support features (DSF) have the potential to improve safety, but they also change the driver-vehicle relationship —as well as their respective roles and responsibilities. To maximize safety, it is important to understand how drivers’ knowledge and understanding of these technologies—referred to as drivers’ mental models—impact performance and safety. This simulator study examined how drivers with different mental models of adaptive cruise control performed in edge cases. The study compared the responses of groups of drivers, with strong and weak mental models of ACC, established through a combination of screening, training, and exposure, in edge case situations in a high-fidelity driving simulator. In general, participants with strong mental models were faster than those with weak mental models to respond in edge-case situations—defined as cases where the ACC did not detect an approaching object, such as a slow-moving motorcycle. The performance deficits observed for drivers with weak mental models appear to reflect uncertainty surrounding how ACC will behave in edge cases.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of visual factors during automated driving of mobility scooters on user comfort: An exploratory simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.011,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"An automated mobility scooter is expected to provide convenient and safe transportation for users in their living area. However, there is limited research on user comfort compared to that on user safety for the automated driving of mobility scooters. Because the user does not perform driving tasks in automated driving, the visual information from the peripheral environment and visual behavior is expected to closely affect the psychological comfort of the user. This study clarifies the effects of factors related to the automated driving of mobility scooters and the peripheral environment on the visual behavior and psychological comfort of the user. Effects of driving velocity and pedestrian density on the visual behavior and psychophysiological responses of users were investigated via a driving simulator. The results showed that automated driving in an environment with a high pedestrian density can result in a decrease in fixation duration, deactivation of visual processing, sympathetic activation, and feeling of negative emotion. This implies that the assessment of visual behaviors of users is important for the design of automated mobility scooters to improve user comfort.",1369-8478,Not found
On the way to autonomous driving: How age influences the acceptance of driver assistance systems,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.006,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Driver assistance systems have the potential to create the basis for future mobility solutions. They enable older generations in need of assistance to maintain their mobility even in the case of physical deficits. Therefore, we conducted a literature review and identified factors that may influence the acceptance of driver assistance systems. Based on the technology acceptance model and other influencing factors, we developed a research model that was validated with the help of a study (n = 227). The results show that, depending on age, there are differences in the acceptance of driver assistance systems and their influencing factors among old and young people. The five determinants of acceptance, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and trust in technology are viewed as equally important for all age groups. Differences emerge within the group of older vehicle drivers with varying weighting. For the 50–59 age group, perceived ease of use and social norm are most important, while for the 60–69 age group, perceived usefulness and trust in technology are very important. Among 70–90-year olds, trust in technology is emphasized as most important. Our results show how important it is to increase the confidence of older drivers in age-appropriate driver assistance systems, using target-group-specific advertising and public relations work.",1369-8478,Not found

Eighteen drivers participated in focus groups designed to probe more deeply into survey responses. Results of the survey showed that participant ratings of trust increased significantly with longer vehicle ownership, but participants who experienced unexpected ADAS technology behavior rated their trust over time significantly lower on ADAS technologies with the exception of rear collision avoidance. The majority (75.8%) of participants reported receiving some ADAS instruction at their vehicle dealership, but only 16.6% indicated it was formal. Participants who received formalized training reported it to be significantly more effective than those who received informal overviews of their systems. Use of trial and error and the owner’s manual were the most frequently reported methods of learning outside of dealership training. Responses indicated that the lack of content tailored to trim-specific vehicle features in owner’s manuals was a barrier to effective use.",1369-8478,Not found

However, a critical evaluation of the existing evidence is required to project the current status and provide directions for future investigations. The present study conducts a comprehensive systematic review of the research examining the effects of alcohol on simulated driving performance. The literature search was conducted in academic databases such as Google Scholar, SCOPUS, Transportation Research Information Database (TRID), PubMed, and Web of science. In total, 1015 articles were identified from the initial database search along with 14 additional articles from other sources (Articles Plus, Cochrane Library, Medline, National Technical Information Services, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Medline Grey Literature Report), out of which 110 articles were included in the systematic review. The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States of America (45%), followed by Australia (15%). These studies were reviewed based on the following aspects: type of driving simulator, study design, Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) or alcohol dose used in the experiments, driving environment characteristics, driving performance measures, data analysis techniques, and additional factors affecting driver behaviour under the influence of alcohol. Overall, the evidence regarding driving performance under the influence of alcohol shows that the majority of the previous studies have found a significant impact of alcohol on the various aspects of driving behaviour.

Driver's avoidance characteristics to hazardous situations: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.004,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"When analyzing the causes of an accident, it is critical to determine whether the driver could have prevented the accident. In previous studies on the reaction times of drivers, the definition and values of reaction times vary, so applying reaction time is difficult. In such analysis, the driver’s reaction time from perception is required to determine whether the driver could have prevented the accident, but past studies are difficult to utilize in accident analysis as reaction time measurements were taken after the occurrence of hazardous situations. In this study, 93 subjects from age groups ranging from 20 s to 40 s participated in an experiment inside a full-scale driving simulator, to determine reaction time values that can be practically applied to accident analysis. A total of 4 hazardous accident situations were reproduced, including driving over the centerline, pedestrian jaywalking, a vehicle cutting in, and intersection traffic signal violation. The Time-To-Collision (TTC) was 2.5 s and the driving speed was set to the common city road speed limits of 60 and 80 km/h. An eye tracker was used to determine the driver’s Saccade Latency (SL) during hazardous situations. Brake Reaction Time from Perception (BRTP), Steer Reaction Time from Perception (SRTP), and Driver Reaction Time from Perception (DRTP) were derived, and the measurements were statistically analyzed to investigate differences by age group, gender, speed, and type of hazardous situation. Most participants were found to avoid collisions by braking first rather than steering for the presented hazardous situations, except for the cutting in situation. Also, to determine a reaction time that would cover most drivers, the 85th percentile of DRTP was calculated. The 85th percentile of DRTP was in the range of 0.550 – 0.800 s. Specifically for each hazardous situation, it was 0.650 s for driving over the centerline, 0.800 s for the pedestrian jaywalking, 0.660 s for cutting in, and 0.550 s for the intersection traffic signal violation. For all 4 hazardous situations combined, the 85th percentile of DRTP was 0.646 s. The findings can be utilized to determine the driver’s likelihood of avoiding accidents when faced with similar hazardous situations.",1369-8478,Not found
How to improve the walking realm in a car-oriented city? (Dis)agreements between professionals,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.011,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Purpose Urban environments and transport systems can enable and encourage walking, and therefore play a key role in climate action, public health, equity of access, and population wellbeing. The question, especially in cities that have been dominated by car traffic, is how? The challenge is heightened by the multidisciplinary involvements in the design, operation, and maintenance of urban infrastructure. This study examines the views of professionals from different disciplines involved in delivering walking environments in Auckland, New Zealand. The study examines agreements and disagreements regarding users’ needs, priorities, challenges, and evidence gaps for delivering quality walking environments in a car-dominated city. Methods Primary data were collected through an online survey (N = 28) and a focus group, both involving professionals active in urban design, road safety, transport planning, public health, urban development and strategy. Analysis involved content coding and comparing the frequency of responses across professional groups. Results The results indicated a consensus on the complexity associated with providing walking environments, as well as the importance of the quality of street environments. The lack of priority given to walking, car-dominated environments, and the inability to deliver change were seen as challenges. The inputs suggested a negative chain reaction linking the low priority of walking and the lack of consensus relative to users’ experience. There appeared to be a lack of common understanding of users’ needs and experiences and a paucity of evidence on this topic. Conclusion The findings suggest the need for urban retrofit rooted in a sound understanding of users’ needs and experiences, and walkability as a sub-system of the urban environment. Recommendations include higher interdisciplinary collaboration at the policy and practice level, reviewed delivery processes, and better-quality data.",1369-8478,Not found
Impact of interface design on drivers’ behavior in partially automated cars: An on-road study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.019,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In partially automated vehicles, the driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Consequently, the driver may have to switch between driving and monitoring activities. This can critically impact the driver’s situational awareness. The human–machine interface (HMI) is responsible for efficient collaboration between driver and system. It must keep the driver informed about the status and capabilities of the automated system, so that he or she knows who or what is in charge of the driving. The present study was designed to compare the ability of two HMIs with different information displays to inform the driver about the system’s status and capabilities: a driving-centered HMI that displayed information in a multimodal way, with an exocentric representation of the road scene, and a vehicle-centered HMI that displayed information in a more traditional visual way. The impact of these HMIs on drivers was compared in an on-road study. Drivers’ eye movements and response times for questions asked while driving were measured. Their verbalizations during the test were also transcribed and coded. Results revealed shorter response times for questions on speed with the exocentric and multimodal HMI. The duration and number of fixations on the speedometer were also greater with the driving-centered HMI. The exocentric and multimodal HMI helped drivers understand the functioning of the system, but was more visually distracting than the traditional HMI. Both HMIs caused mode confusions. The use of a multimodal HMI can be beneficial and should be prioritized by designers. The use of auditory feedback to provide information about the level of automation needs to be explored in longitudinal studies.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating driver comprehension of the roadway environment to retain accountability of safety during driving automation,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.007,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Driver comprehension is a substantial component of situation awareness that involves the ability of an individual to understand the significance of an object, traffic sign, or hazard while driving. An increase in crashes related to autonomous driving systems has raised a concern regarding the safety of other roadway users due to the diminishing accountability resulting from a general lack of understanding of the limitations or disregard of the safety protocols by users. To keep drivers vigilant when engaged in partial automated systems, a methodology to monitor real-time driver comprehension was proposed. A driving simulator study consisting of 90 participants, equally split between males and females, was executed to establish driver comprehension in six different variations of driving difficulty. Joint probability density functions were created by considering percent time spent gazing, answers to probe questions, and driving performance. Based on these density functions, five levels of comprehension were devised and assigned thresholds. Overall, as task difficulty increased, a non-linear deterioration in driving speed along with an increase in total gaze duration was observed before comprehension was attained. A two-step validation protocol was also proposed to ensure similar levels of comprehension to non-automated driving from the human driver, when engaged in early forms of automation. The proposed real-time driver comprehension monitoring constitutes a first step toward developing a methodology to reinstate the accountability of safety of other roadway users when engaged in driver-in-the-loop automation systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Safety of autonomous vehicles: what are the insights from experienced industry professionals?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.005,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Many drivers support the push towards the automation of transportation. Technology and automotive companies, the general public, and governments are all seen as the main groups pushing the automation revolution forward. The key to this revolution's success will rest with the perception of the professionals in the field as their perception will affect the way that Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are adopted. This study surveyed 185 experienced industry professionals to gather their comments and opinions on AVs' purported safety benefits and drawbacks. The results in this paper illustrate that the ‘incorrect understanding of the surrounding objects by AVs’ could be the most significant technical concern and may lead to accidents. Some professionals had concerns about trusting the AVs’ safe operation without steering wheels, while some others believed that there is a chance that having steering wheels may increase safety concerns. The findings also suggest that while AVs might reduce the number of accidents, this may not necessarily be the case for the severity of any accidents. The severity may remain unchanged or even increase as a result of the adoption of AVs. This paper's results show that the majority of the professionals consulted agreed that AVs have the potential to increase road safety significantly. However, the consensus was that more research and testing is needed in this field.",1369-8478,Not found
Complex and underreported? A study into the prevalence of suicide by motor vehicle in the state of Queensland,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.015,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"While suicide is recognised as one of the leading causes of death in Australia, it is often presumed that fatal road crashes are primarily accidental in nature. However, international research has indicated that deliberate attempts at self-harm while driving may account for between 1.1% and 7.4% of road crashes. Despite the personal and financial costs associated with such events, few studies have examined the extent of motor vehicle suicides (MVS) or the circumstances surrounding such incidents in Australia. Given this, the current study reviewed coronial, police and toxicology findings of 762 motor vehicle fatalities in Queensland (Australia) during the period 2011 to 2015 to determine the frequency of confirmed cases and explore the prevalence (and characteristics) of possible MVS that remain undetected. In total, 22 confirmed cases were identified, and such events shared significant similarities with 14 possible events, including evidence of recent emotional upset, adversity and mental health diagnoses. In contrast, differences between the groups were limited to confirmed cases being more likely to involve males and contain a suicide note or evidence of past suicidality, while possible cases were more likely to involve a multiple vehicle impact with a truck. Importantly, crucial information regarding the deceased’s psychological state and life circumstances (e.g., psychological autopsy) was not reported in many cases. Corresponding qualitative analysis of the coroners final determination (between the two groups) revealed the occurrence of the word suicide to occur seven times (31.8%) among confirmed cases and five times (35.7%) for possible casers. Furthermore, the coroners final determination of intent to suicide was open or undetermined in six of the possible cases (43%), which further suggests a reluctance (or procedural uncertainty) to categorically identify MVS. The paper further reviews the main findings, illuminates core challenges associated with identifying MVS and proposes a need for future investigations to incorporate a more standardised and evidence-based approach in order to effectively identify such events.",1369-8478,Not found
“Going through a little bit of growing pains”: A qualitative study of the factors that influence the route choice of regular bicyclists in a developing cycling city,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.005,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"As cities make concerted efforts to become more bicycle-friendly through policy changes and infrastructure, it is important that such efforts ultimately support people who currently bicycle and remove barriers that may prevent more people from bicycling. Travel surveys can reveal the nature and distribution of bicycling trips, but perceptions and behaviours of bicyclists are better understood through qualitative methods. In particular, developing cycling cities are unique settings to examine how the built environment supports bicycling as changes are made to increase bicycling levels. Through semi-structured interviews, this research explores the case of Hamilton, Ontario and the factors that influence route choice from the perspective of regular bicyclists. Major themes were identified using thematic analysis: (i) exclusion from road space; (ii) infrastructure; and (iii) streetscape. Bicyclists highly value infrastructure and seek routes that minimize interactions with cars, while avoiding many arterial roads that prioritize motorists. Routes that appear to be more human-oriented or that have nature are also attractive. Many regular bicyclists report that current bicycle infrastructure does not meet their preferences. Despite building nearly half of the planned infrastructure network, our findings suggest the built environment is not perceived to be oriented to bicycling. This study provides policy and practice recommendations for developing cycling cities in North America as they transition towards established cycling cities.",1369-8478,Not found
Who's more angry? Comparing driver anger and aggression within work and personal driving contexts,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.002,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Anger and driver aggression increase crash risk. However, how these manifest according to the purpose of the journey (work vs personal) and the unique relationships between sources of anger and aggressive expressions of that anger is under-researched. The current study examined the relationships between different types of anger and aggression, recent crashes and infringements between drivers who drive mainly for work with those who drive mainly for personal reasons. Participants (N = 630) completed an online questionnaire reporting their driving anger tendencies across situations of travel delays, danger and hostility from others, frequency of aggressive driving (using the vehicle, verbal or physical) and crash and infringements in the previous year. Drivers were classified as work or personal drivers based on the percentage of the time they drove for each reason. Relationships between anger sources and aggression types were examined using Structural Equation Modelling, comparing models between the two groups. The relationships between aggression and safety outcomes were explored using Mann-Whitney U tests. The relationships between anger and aggression were similar across work and personal drivers. However, some group differences in the situations that contributed to anger and aggression were identified. Aggression was more frequent for drivers who drove mainly for work and had received a traffic violation, compared to those who had not received a traffic violation. These findings can inform the development of targeted interventions to manage the triggers of anger and aggression. Interventions are likely to impact work and personal drivers; thus, could target employers and road transport authorities.",1369-8478,Not found
Communicating safety with drivers via dynamic message signs,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.010,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In recent years numerous transportation agencies have begun displaying creative safety messages like “get your head out of your apps” on dynamic message signs (DMS). DMS have been used traditionally to provide real-time information about travel times, weather conditions, construction, and incidents. Applying emotional and consequential concepts from protection motivation theory, which has a track record of leading to behavioral changes from public awareness campaigns, this study evaluates how the use of safety messages on DMS impacts driver perceptions. We find that emotions, but not consequences, impact self-reported driving behavior. Further, while drivers reported negative emotions would change their driving habits, positive messages were recalled far more often. Cell phone related messages were recalled most frequently despite being rarely displayed along roadways in Michigan where the study is conducted. Thus, the results support the use of positively themed messages with consequences that drivers perceive as realistic.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of music genres on the driving behaviour of young drivers and their visual scanning of the environment,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.001,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Recently, distractions have been recognized as a significant risk factor in road traffic. This simulator study aims to investigate how different music genres affect the driving behaviour of young drivers and their visual scanning of the environment in urban settings. The genres considered were Croatian pop, foreign pop, classical music, metal, and Balkan folk music, while on one road section there was no music. The research sample consisted of 61 participants (44 males and 17 females) with a mean age of 24.58 years and a mean driving experience of 5.25 years. The influence of music on the drivers’ behaviour was analysed on the basis of the data collected from the driving simulator, eye tracking glasses, and structured observation during driving sessions. It was found that the highest average speed (around 60 km/h) was recorded while the participants were listening to Balkan folk and metal music, while other music genres, as well as the “no music” condition, influenced driving speed in a similar way to one another and the participants drove at 50 km/h on average. Furthermore, the results suggest that the music genre also affects how drivers visually scan the environment (the number of gazes classified as fixations and number of road signs looked at). The findings obtained may be used in road safety work and practical recommendations and further research are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver speeding typologies by roadway behaviours and beliefs: A latent class analysis with a multistate sample of U.S. adults,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.016,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Speeding has consistently contributed to a high number of motor vehicle crashes and subsequent injuries and deaths in the U.S. Identifying types of drivers related to speeding behaviour may help target interventions to reduce speeding. Typology of U.S. driver speeders have examined very specifically speeding behaviours and speeding-related attitudes. This exploratory work used latent class analysis (LCA) to examine how other driving behaviours and attitudes cluster around speeding behaviours to determine speeder typologies, which may lend a more holistic perspective to speeder types. Predicted class assignments were evaluated for associations with demographic and personality factors. The LCA resulted in four driver typologies, which we labelled: Externally Motivated (40.7%), Non-Reactors (26.2%), Perceived Invulnerable (24.3%), and Perceived Vulnerable (8.9%). The Externally Motivated and Non-Reactors typologies had the highest probability of reporting extreme speeding. The Externally Motivated may be intervened upon with messaging about reducing risks crashes and injuring passengers, while the Perceived Vulnerable class already exhibit several risk-averse behaviours that self-limits their speeding behaviour. Class placement was associated with age, self-reported speeding frequency, receipt of speeding violations. The resulting U.S. driver typologies advances the literature by demonstrating that non-speeding driver behaviours and attitudes cluster with speeding behaviours, which altogether can inform more nuanced and effective anti-speeding campaigns.",1369-8478,Not found
Developing human-machine trust: Impacts of prior instruction and automation failure on driver trust in partially automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.013,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"To prompt the use of driving automation in an appropriate and safe manner, system designers require knowledge about the dynamics of driver trust. To enhance this knowledge, this study manipulated prior information of a partial driving automation into two types (detailed and less) and investigated the effects of the information on the development of trust with respect to three trust attributions proposed by Muir (1994): predictability, dependability, and faith. Furthermore, a driving simulator generated two types of automation failures (limitation and malfunction), and at six instances during the study, 56 drivers completed questionnaires about their levels of trust in the automation. Statistical analysis found that trust ratings of automation steadily increased with the experience of simulation regardless of the drivers’ levels of knowledge. Automation failure led to a temporary decrease in trust ratings; however, the trust was rebuilt by a subsequent experience of flawless automation. Results showed that dependability was the most dominant belief of drivers’ trust throughout the whole experiment, regardless of their knowledge level. Interestingly, detailed analysis indicated that trust can be accounted by different attributions depending on the drivers’ circumstances: the subsequent experience of error-free automation after the exposure to automation failure led predictability to be a secondary predictive attribution of drivers’ trust in the detailed group whilst faith was consistently the secondary contributor to shaping trust in the less group throughout the experiment. These findings have implications for system design regarding transparency and for training methods and instruction aimed at improving driving safety in traffic environments with automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Objective and perceived risk in overtaking: The impact of driving context,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.018,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The assistance and autonomous performance of overtaking manoeuvres can offer significant safety benefits. The impact of driving context on perceived risk emphasises the benefits of using contextual information to adjust the manoeuvring behaviour. This paper follows a mixed approach, addressing two main objectives: identifying factor combinations related to overtaking crashes (objective risk) and exploring their relationship to perceived risk. Factor combinations were extracted from a multi-year dataset, acquired from the UK in-depth study RAIDS (Road Accident In-depth Studies). Selected factors were used to create motorway overtaking scenarios with different manoeuvring behaviour (pull-out distance, manoeuvre duration, speed) and driving context (day/night, overtaking car/truck), while 237 participants assessed their impact on perceived risk through an online survey. The findings highlight the strong impact of manoeuvre characteristics on perceived risk, mediated or intensified by the driving context. Long pull-out distance and short manoeuvre duration time were preferred; under night conditions, short pull-out distances were perceived as riskier compared to daytime, while the opposite effect appeared for high speed, which was considered safer. The results can inform future research on motorway overtaking safety perception and acceptability, as well as the design of systems that assist or autonomously perform overtaking. Specifically, they can be used as guidelines for incorporating context related information to adjust overtaking behaviour according to user preferences and create a positive passenger experience.",1369-8478,Not found
Examining the efficacy of improved traffic signs and markings at flashing-light-controlled grade crossings based on driving simulation and eye tracking systems,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.019,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The majority of the collisions at grade crossings occurred at flashing-light-controlled grade crossings. Understanding drivers’ behaviors and visual performances in the process of approaching the crossings is the foundation of improving crossing safety. This study aims at utilizing driving simulation and eye tracking systems to investigate the efficacy of improved traffic signs and pavement markings (PSM) at flashing-light-controlled grade crossings. The improved signs and markings were modeled in a driving simulation system and tested with a series of flashing light trigger time (FLTT) ranging from 2 s to 6 s with 1 s interval increment. Foggy conditions and drivers’ genders and vocations were considered in experiment design. Thirty-six fully-licensed drivers between 30 and 48 years participated in the experiment. Several eye-movement and behavioral measures were adopted as reflections of the subjects’ performances, including the first fixation time on signs and signals and distance to stop line, total fixation duration, compliance rate, stop position, average speed at the stop line, maximum deceleration rate and brake response time. Results showed that compared with traditional grade crossings signs and pavement markings, drivers could perceive signs timelier and fixate on the flashing-light signal earlier in PSM, especially in the scenarios of earlier FLTTs. The improvement in fixation performance and sign design contributed to a higher stop compliance rate. Importantly, it was found that drivers would hesitate to decide whether to stop or cross facing with flashing red lights, which is similar to the dilemma zone of roadway intersections. Drivers were more likely to fall into the dilemma zones when FLTT was <4 s. When FLTT was 2 s, it was particularly difficult to stop in front of the stop line. Moreover, under a foggy condition, drivers had a difficulty in searching signs and had a longer brake response time compared with a clear condition. For the characteristics of drivers, male drivers had longer fixation duration on signs than females. Professional drivers had a higher maximum deceleration rate compared with non-professional drivers. Above findings implied that improved traffic signs and markings would have a potential to improve traffic safety and deserve a field implementation in the future.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving anger scale validation: Relationship of driving anger with the aberrant driving behaviour of truck drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.018,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Truck-related accidents in China have substantially increased. Truck driver safety issues have elicited considerable attention from transportation safety researchers. Driving anger is one of the most important factors that influence driving behaviour. However, little knowledge about the driving anger of truck drivers was available in the relevant literature. This study aimed to (1) provide empirical data about the driving anger of truck drivers, (2) examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the driving anger scale (DAS) with a sample of truck drivers and (3) explore how the driving anger of truck drivers predicts their aberrant driving behaviour. The three-part survey data from 475 randomly selected truck drivers were collected in this study. The self-reported aberrant driving behaviour that was measured with the driving behaviour questionnaire was predicted by the drivers’ DAS ratings. One-factor structure and three-factor structure of the DAS were tested for Chinese truck drivers. Results indicated that the one-factor structure of the six-item DAS was more suitable for truck drivers than the three-factor structure. The factor structure of the DAS for Chinese truck drivers was consistent with the structure of the original version by Deffenbacher, Oetting, and Lynch (1994). The internal consistency, convergent validity and criterion-related validity of the six-item DAS were acceptable. Driving anger amongst truck drivers can be used to predict their aberrant driving behaviour. This study identified several practical implications to reduce the driving anger of truck drivers and consequently improve their driving behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Eye movements predict driver reaction time to takeover request in automated driving: A real-vehicle study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.017,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"For automated driving at SAE level 3 or lower, driver performance in responding to takeover requests (TORs) is decisive in providing system safety. A driver state monitoring system that can predict a driver’s performance in a TOR event will facilitate a safer control transition from vehicle to driver. This experimental study investigated whether driver eye-movement measured before a TOR can predict driving performance in a subsequent TOR event. We recruited participants (N = 36) to obtain realistic results in a real-vehicle study. In the experiment, drivers rode in an automated vehicle on a test track for about 32 min, and a critical TOR event occurred at the end of the drive. Eye movements were measured by a camera-based driver monitoring system, and five measures were extracted from the last 2-min epoch prior to the TOR event. The correlations between each eye-movement measure and driver reaction time were examined, and a multiple regression model was built using a stepwise procedure. The results showed that longer reaction time could be significantly predicted by a smaller number of large saccades, a greater number of medium saccades, and lower saccadic velocity. The implications of these relationships are consistent with previous studies. The present real-vehicle study can provide insights to the automotive industry in the search for a safer and more flexible interface between the automated vehicle and the driver.",1369-8478,Not found

Should I Drive Today? Development of a daily driving decisions model for older adults,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.015,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Background Older adults in communities make daily decisions about how to meet their transportation needs so they can access services and stay socially connected. With the aging of populations in developed countries, the travel decisions of older adults will have increasing impacts. Research studies have identified different sets of factors that contribute to certain travel decisions, but little research has been directed towards understanding how individuals select information from all available factors, what information they include in their decisions under different circumstances, and the processes they use in making their transportation decisions. Methods This exploratory study involved 20 men and 17 women, mean age 78.6 years (range 70–96), who drove weekly. All participants were involved in each phase of the 3-phase study. In Phase 1, a review of the literature and interviews with the participants was used to collect information, and inductive thematic analysis was employed to construct a draft conceptual model of older driver decision-making. In Phase 2, participants completed a stated preference task of written scenarios to demonstrate their decision-making strategies. Results were tabulated and used to refine a final Daily Driving Decisions model. In Phase 3, a card sorting decision task was used to test the model with participants. Results The final dynamic Daily Driving Decisions Model was confirmed to describe decision processes used by the participants in making decisions about how they would meet their transportation needs. The model describes three categories of factors used in decisions, labelled Motivators, Constraint/Enablers and Context, each containing four attribute themes. A significant finding was the variable use of the same item to either constrain or enable the decision to drive depending on the variation of other factors in the scenario. Participants demonstrated use of compensatory and noncompensatory (heuristic, habitual) decision processes that were accommodated by the model. Conclusion The proposed Daily Driving Decisions Model addresses a gap in our understanding of how older drivers make their decisions about meeting their transportation needs. The model presents a template for classifying the types of information used, ignored or discarded by older adults, and the pathways that they take to arrive at their decisions. The model provides opportunities for further research in testing the influence of other factors such as urban/rural residence, income, health status and culture on driving decisions. Further, the model can be used by practitioners to gain insight into the decision-making behaviours of individuals and to develop interventions to enhance their decision-making skills.",1369-8478,Not found
What is the best way to promote cycling? A systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.002,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Cycling has the potential to address a number of personal and societal challenges, not least with respect to health and the need for more sustainable modes of transport. However, the best way(s) to promote cycling is still unclear. In an effort to answer this question, we identified 39 interventions designed to promote cycling, with a total sample of 46,102 participants. Random effects meta-analysis estimated a small but statistically significant effect of interventions on cycling behaviour (g + = 0.14, 95% CI [0.05, 0.23]). To identify the most effective intervention strategies, we coded the behaviour change techniques used within each of the interventions. Interventions that prompted people to self-monitor their behaviour or added objects to the environment (e.g., provided shared bikes) were more effective than those that did not use these strategies. Interventions that restructured the physical environment (e.g., built new cycle paths) were less effective than the studies that did not do this. We also identified a number of factors that moderated the effect of the interventions on outcomes; specifically, interventions that targeted a specific group, used objective measures of cycling such as accelerometers, and that were tested using independent groups designs typically yielded stronger effects. The findings should help to guide interventions to promote cycling in the future.",1369-8478,Not found
Effectiveness of risk awareness perception training in dynamic simulator scenarios involving salient distractors,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.009,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The Risk Awareness Perception Training (RAPT) has been shown to improve latent hazard anticipation in young drivers. However, previous evaluation scenarios in a driving simulator often lacked either dynamic road environment features or control for such variations. The current study investigated whether the effectiveness of RAPT persists even in the presence of dynamic and salient distractors. Twenty RAPT-trained drivers and twenty-one Placebo-trained young drivers (aged 18–21) drove through eight simulated driving scenarios with latent hazards. A pedestrian avatar served as a distractor and was placed across from the latent hazard location. In half of the scenarios, the pedestrian remained static while in the other half the pedestrian started to move, without potential interference with the driver’s travelling path, as the drivers approached the latent hazard. Consistent with previous research, RAPT-trained drivers demonstrated better latent hazard anticipation performance than Placebo-trained drivers regardless of dynamic movement of the pedestrian avatar. Additionally, RAPT-trained drivers adopted wider scanning patterns and fixated more frequently on both the latent hazard and the pedestrian compared to Placebo-trained drivers. The results imply that RAPT may protect drivers from being distracted by dynamic stimuli and allow them to scan safety–critical areas containing latent hazards. Furthermore, RAPT may not only improve tactical hazard anticipation skills, but also modal hazard anticipation skills in young drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
The effectiveness of “Soft-blocking” for reducing clicking on-screen while driving,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.003,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Smartphone usage while driving is recognized as a compromise on road safety. We investigated if silencing and hiding of notifications from drivers (soft blocking) can reduce clicks on the screen while driving and if the effect of the soft blocking would be different for different speed thresholds (STs) (i.e., at driving speed greater than 0 km/h, greater than 1 km/h….and greater than 90 km/h). Drivers installed a smartphone application, which continuously monitored their phones. In the intervention group (N = 22), the application switched to the soft blocking mode during the study's intervention period, while in the control group (N = 29) it remained in a recording-only mode. We ran a Poisson regression model on the click events frequency (CEF) to estimate the soft blocking effect for each of the STs between 0 and 90 km/h. Our analyses indicated that the soft blocking effectiveness was indeed speed-dependent and pointed to a decline in CEF from ST > 55 km/h and to mixed results if ST < 55 km/h. We identify a potential of soft blocking to reduce phone usage while driving and recommend ST-dependent soft blocking. We also recommend using different STs in future investigations on the effectiveness of soft blocking.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving anger in Germany: Validation of the driving anger scale for German drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.006,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In 1994, Deffenbacher et al. published the Driving Anger Scale (DAS), a tool for assessing a driver’s propensity to experience anger in road traffic. Since then, much research has used this scale to measure the driving anger experienced in various countries around the world. This study examines the scale’s validity for German drivers. It also relates their experiences of anger while driving to their experiences and expressions of anger in general, as well as to certain demographic variables. In addition, it compares German drivers’ experiences of driving anger to those reported by drivers from other countries. We distributed a German version of the DAS and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) to a sample of 1136 German drivers. Results showed that a 22-items version of the DAS with six factors produced good fit indices for German drivers. Furthermore, data analysis revealed small to moderate significant relationships between German drivers’ driving anger experiences and their experiences and expressions of anger in general, underlining the idea that driving anger is a personality characteristic that is related to one's general experience and expression of anger. Finally, German drivers' driving anger experiences differed from those of drivers from other countries in that German drivers reported less driving anger than drivers from Spain and New Zealand, comparable levels to those from Turkey, Malaysia, and the United States, and more driving anger than drivers from France, Australia, China, and the United Kingdom. In addition, discourteous driver actions and hostile gestures consistently triggered highest driving anger ratings whereas police presence was rated lowest. Given these results, we conclude that the DAS can be applied to German drivers in its modified version.",1369-8478,Not found
Psychological and psychophysiological effects of music intensity and lyrics on simulated urban driving,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.022,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of musical characteristics (i.e., presence of lyrics and loudness) in the context of simulated urban driving. Previous work has seldom isolated musical characteristics and examined these both singularly and interactively. We investigated the potentially distracting effects of processing lyrics through exposing young drivers to the same piece of music with/without lyrics and at different sound intensities (60 dBA [soft] and 75 dBA [loud]) using a counterbalanced, within-subjects design (N = 34; M age = 22.2 years, SD = 2.0 years). Six simulator conditions were included that comprised low-intensity music with/without lyrics, high-intensity music with/without lyrics, plus two controls – ambient in-car noise and spoken lyrics. Between-subjects variables of driving style (defensive vs. assertive) and sex (women vs. men) were explored. A key finding was that the no lyrics/soft condition yielded lower affective arousal scores when compared to the other music conditions. There was no main effect of condition for HRV data (SDNN and RMSSD). Exploratory analyses showed that, for assertive drivers, NASA-TLX Performance scores were lower in the no lyrics/soft condition compared to the lyrics/loud condition. Moreover, women exhibited higher mean heart rate than men in the presence of lyrics. Although some differences emerged in subjective outcomes, these were not replicated in HRV, which was used as an objective index of emotionality. Drivers should consider the use of soft, non-lyrical music to optimise their affective state during urban driving.",1369-8478,Not found

This study used a high-fidelity 6-degree-of-freedom driving simulator to evaluate the impact of an independently-designed vehicle driving condition prompt (DCP) systems on subjective passenger comfort and motion sickness. The experiment showed that when future driving information is obtained through the vehicle DCP systems, the passengers' subjective comfort is improved, motion sickness is alleviated, and the degree of passenger posture instability is reduced.

Effect of multiple traffic information sources on route choice: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.008,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"With the arrival of new technologies more en-route traffic information sources have become available, especially in-car information sources. The aim of this study is to gain more insight into the effect of multiple, and possibly conflicting, sources of information on route choice and driver behaviour. In a driving simulator experiment, participants were required to make multiple drives, each of which ended with a choice between the normal and an alternative route. On each trial participants received traffic information from a Variable Message Sign (VMS), i.e. a dynamic sign above the road providing descriptive traffic information in the form of expected travel times (ETTs), a navigation device providing in-car prescriptive route advice, or information from both sources. In the latter type of trial the information could be congruent or conflicting with regards to ETTs on the VMS and advise from the navigation. After each trial, participants indicated how much trust they had in the traffic information and their primary information source. A Bayesian model was used to quantify the propensity to switch to the alternative route. Results indicate that overall compliance was very high for the primary source even when the other source did not corroborate this information and that most participants preferred to use the information from a VMS. However, when both the VMS and the navigation device provided information and the VMS indicated the same ETTs for the normal and alternative route, route choice was influenced by the advice provided by the navigation device. Also, in this type of trial mean speed was significantly lower compared to trials in which the two sources were in conflict, indicating increased mental workload, most likely due to attentional dissonance: a situation in which stimuli compete for attention resulting in cognitive conflict and the need to inhibit non-relevant information. A deeper understanding of how drivers use multiple traffic information sources and cope with irrelevant information could support driver safety and comfort, increase the usability of information sources, and help reduce stress, anxiety, and information overload while driving.",1369-8478,Not found

In the present study, human factors of driving were studied by investigating sex differences and gender roles in relation to impulsive driving and driving anger expression. A total of 425 drivers between the ages of 18 and 56 (M = 25.46, SD = 7.58) participated to the study and completed a series of questionnaires including a demographic information form, the Bem Sex Roles Inventory, the Impulsive Driver Behaviour Scale and the Driving Anger Expression Inventory. According to the ANCOVA results, male drivers showed higher functional impulsivity, lack of premeditation and use of the vehicle to express anger than female drivers. Additionally, hierarchical regression analyses showed that masculinity was positively associated with functional impulsivity, urgency and the dimensions of aggressive anger expression. However, femininity was positively associated with functional impulsivity and adaptive/constructive anger expression, but negatively associated with the dimensions of dysfunctional impulsivity and aggressive anger expression. Overall, the results showed the significant solo effects of masculinity and femininity on impulsive driver behaviours and driving anger expression, over and above the effects of sex, and the interaction between sex and gender roles. In the present study, previously reported findings indicating the relationships between sex and gender roles and driving anger expression were supported and extended by providing the literature with the contribution of answering the question how sex and gender roles are related to impulsive driver behaviours. The findings of the two related concepts of impulsive driving and driving anger expression were discussed in light of the current literature.

Tactile encoding of directions and temporal distances to safety hazards supports drivers in overtaking and intersection scenarios,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.014,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Safe traffic participation requires continuous monitoring of the environment for potential safety hazards. Here we investigate, to what extent an interface using directed tactile stimuli to communicate temporal distances to approaching objects can make drivers feel supported and influence their driving safety. In contrast to previous studies, we focus on conditions in which the driver has relatively high levels of control over the criticality of evolving hazards as well as on scenarios with laterally approaching hazards. In a dynamic driving simulator experiment, 33 participants completed a selection of overtaking and intersection scenarios with and without sensory support. Furthermore, two novel variants of the interface which differed in the resolution of the temporal distance encoding were utilized. We measured safety, quantified as minimum time-to-contact (mTTC) and rate of critical situations, and assessed the participants’ subjective understanding, acceptance and perceived helpfulness of the support functions. Participants understood the system in both variants after brief exposure. The subjective evaluation was positive with regard to helpfulness, acceptance, and custom questionnaire responses. While mTTC values did not differ between supported and baseline drives, the availability of the system reduced the occurrence of safety–critical situations in intersection scenarios. Driving statistics further reveal that the availability of the system increased the likelihood for entering system-relevant signaling ranges in overtaking scenarios. In sum, the presented work extends previous findings by showing that the subjective utility of the investigated tactile interface applies beyond critical situations and that it can also provide a safety advantage at intersections.",1369-8478,Not found
Modeling the influence of mobile phone use distraction on pedestrian reaction times to green signals: A multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival model,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.020,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Understanding and modeling the influence of mobile phone use on pedestrian behaviour is important for several safety and performance evaluations. Mobile phone use affects pedestrian perception of the surrounding traffic environment and reduces situation awareness. This study investigates the effect of distraction due to mobile phone use (i.e., visual and auditory) on pedestrian reaction time to the pedestrian signal. Traffic video data was collected from four crosswalks in Canada and China. A multilevel mixed-effects accelerated failure time (AFT) approach is used to model pedestrian reaction times, with random intercepts capturing the clustered-specific (countries) heterogeneity. Potential reaction time influencing factors were investigated, including pedestrian demographic attributes, distraction characteristics, and environment-related parameters. Results show that pedestrian reaction times were longer in Canada than in China under the non-distraction and distraction conditions. The auditory and visual distractions increase pedestrian reaction time by 67% and 50% on average, respectively. Pedestrian reactions were slower at road segment crosswalks compared to intersection crosswalks, at higher distraction durations, and for males aged over 40 compared to other pedestrians. Moreover, pedestrian reactions were faster at higher traffic awareness levels.",1369-8478,Not found
Urgent and non-urgent takeovers during conditional automated driving on public roads: The impact of different training programmes,10.1016/j.trf.2021.06.001,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Supplying training to drivers that teaches them about automated driving and requests to intervene may help them to build and maintain a mental representation of how automation works and thereby improve takeover performance. We aimed to investigate the effect of different types of training programmes about the functioning of automated driving on drivers’ takeover performance during real driving. Fifty-two participants were split into three groups for training sessions: paper (short notice), video (3-minute tutorial) and practice (short drive). After the training, participants experienced automated driving and both urgent and non-urgent requests to intervene in a Wizard-of-Oz vehicle on public roads. Participants’ takeover time, visual behaviour, mental workload, and flow levels during the requests to intervene were assessed. Our results indicated that in urgent circumstances, participants’ takeover response times were faster in the practice training condition compared to the other training conditions. Nevertheless, the practice training session did not present any other positive effect on drivers’ visual behaviour. This could indicate that prior training, particularly when reinforcing drivers' motor skills, improved their takeover response time at the latest motor stages rather than in the early sensory states. In addition, the analysis of in-vehicle videos revealed that participants’ attention was captured in the first place by the in-vehicle human-machine interface during the urgent request to intervene. This highlights the importance for designers to display information on the HMI in an appropriate way to optimise drivers’ situation awareness in critical situations.",1369-8478,Not found
Validating a methodology for understanding pedestrian – vehicle interactions: A comparison of video and field observations,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.006,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The successful deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) will depend on their capacity to travel within a mixed traffic environment, adopting appropriate interaction strategies across different scenarios. Thus, it is important to gain a detailed understanding of the specific types of interactions that are most likely to arise. The overall purpose of this paper was to present a methodology designed to facilitate the systematic observation of pedestrian-vehicle interactions, and to validate its use for both onsite and video based observations. A detailed observation protocol was developed to capture pedestrian and vehicle movement and communication patterns across four interaction phases. Onsite coders completed field observations of 50 pedestrian-vehicle interactions at a UK intersection, while video coders observed the same interactions recorded through a wireless camera mounted on a nearby rooftop. Results show that the observation protocol provides a reliable methodology for capturing patterns of pedestrian-vehicle interactions, with high levels of inter-coder consistency emerging across all categories of codes. A detailed examination of the specific descriptors selected suggests that onsite coding may be particularly beneficial in situations where the aim is to capture any explicit, and perhaps subtle, communication cues, whereas video based coding may be more appropriate in situations where exact sequences of behaviours or measurements of timings are desired. It is anticipated that this type of observation tool will be beneficial for AV developers to increase their understanding of how to interpret the movements of road users, along with increasing knowledge of when implicit and explicit communication techniques should be used.",1369-8478,Not found
Autonomous vehicle safety: Understanding perceptions of pedestrians and bicyclists,10.1016/j.trf.2021.04.018,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies have been rapidly advancing. One benefit of AVs is that the technology could eliminate many driver errors and also mitigate many pedestrian and bicyclist collisions. Real-world AVs have been tested in many cities. Five companies are running around 50 AVs in Pittsburgh, following the autonomous testing guidelines. BikePGH, a non-profit organization located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania conducted a follow-up survey in 2019 (the first survey was conducted in 2017) to understand non-motorists’ opinions of AVs. This study examined how pedestrians and bicyclists perceived AV safety based on their understanding and experiences. At first, this study performed a comparison group test to determine which questions vary by participants’ AV safety rating. The responses were later analyzed with a data mining method known as ‘association rules mining.’ A new performance measure, known as the rule power factor, was then used to identify the significant patterns in the form of rules. The participants also provided their thoughts in responses to the open-ended questions. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling algorithm, 40 topic models were developed based on five open-ended questions. The findings show that the non-motorists showed comparatively fewer negative opinions towards AVs than positive assessments. The results also show that perception patterns vary by the participant’s rating on AV safety. Findings of this study would be beneficial for the AV stakeholders in making AVs and roadways safer for non-motorists.",1369-8478,Not found
Are novice drivers competent to take over control from level 3 automated vehicles? A comparative study with experienced drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.012,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"With level 3 automated vehicles poised to appear on the roads soon, takeover remains a major challenge. At present, the effect of manual driving experience on takeover performance is unknown. Therefore, a simulator study was conducted to investigate the influence of driving experience (novice and experienced) on takeover performance in different takeover time budgets (7 s and 5 s) and in combination with a visual secondary task (i.e., surrogate reference task). Data from 48 young and middle-aged participants consisting of 24 novice and 24 experienced drivers were used for this study. Researchers found that the overall stability of evasive maneuvers by novice drivers was considerably worse than that by experienced drivers. A detailed analysis showed that the influence of driving experience on takeover stability was mainly reflected in longitudinal control rather than lateral control. A significant interaction between driving experience and visual secondary task showed that the latter had a substantial impact on the takeover stability of experienced drivers but not on that of novice drivers. Researchers also found that rich manual driving experience cannot make the takeover process of experienced drivers more stable than that of novice drivers under conditions of eye-off-road. In addition, no significant difference was found between novice and experienced drivers in automation disengagement time, takeover time and minimum time to collision. Results indicate that novice drivers have poor takeover stability and weak adaptability, but their longitudinal collision risk is not deteriorated by the lack of manual driving experience.",1369-8478,Not found
Repeated usage of a motorway automated driving function: Automation level and behavioural adaption,10.1016/j.trf.2021.05.017,81,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The user’s perspective on highly automated driving systems is mostly studied during first contact/single usage. However, with repeated usage, acceptance and usage of automated driving systems might change. For advanced driving assistance systems, change with growing system usage is studied as behavioural adaptation. This concept of behavioural adaptation is applied to highly automated driving systems. In a driving simulator study, N = 61 drivers used an automated driving system for motorways during six experimental sessions. The drivers were free to activate / deactivate the function as they liked and to spend driving time on self-chosen side tasks. Automation level was varied as a between-subject factor (L3 vs. L4). Results show a more positive evaluation of the L4 system and behavioural adaptation for both levels over the course of the six sessions. For most aspects, behavioural adaptation is independent of system level (e.g., for system evaluation, distribution of attention). Only for drivers’ reaction to requests to intervene, a strong impact of system level on the occurrence behavioural adaption can be found. The results are discussed with regard to the theory of behavioural adaptation.",1369-8478,Not found

However, theories about trust (development) in technology generally vary and an in-depths study about trust in ABs specifically is still outstanding. The present study fills this gap by presenting results from focus group interviews to trust (development) in shared automated buses prior to exposure. The objectives of this study are to contrast participants’ naïve concepts of trust with theory and to identify underlying factors influencing a-priori trust in ABs. Results show that the N = 21 focus group participants use different strategies to familiarise themselves with the new technology of ABs, e.g., comparisons with familiar technologies, fundamental tendencies to approach or avoid, additional information seeking, or anthropomorphisation. These strategies largely support existing theories on trust (development) in technology. Differences between naïve interpretations of trust and its theoretical assumptions were found in focus group debates where more control over technology limited uncertainty and led to more trust. While theories suggest control and trust to be incompatible opposites, participants see control as a way to enhance trust. We provide starting points for further theory development and expansion and stress the importance of explanations in emerging technologies for trust and acceptance building.",1369-8478,Not found

Users’ comments were classified in categories as follows: system capabilities, purpose and benefits, travel destination and encouraging remarks. Major results show that participants felt safe, where only 1.01% of comments denoted apprehension despite the increase of speed (up to 50 km/h) with respect to other studies. Users’ were satisfied with the automated vehicle (AV) performance, where only 3.5% criticized the system, denoting they expected a higher level of autonomy. 22% of users mentioned train stations as useful application (i.e. potential destination) for an automated on-demand mobility service. More than 200 comments were related to travel destinations, pointing towards various scenarios where an AV service could be useful for them.

Measuring optimism bias among military personnel,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.005,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"High numbers of young military personnel die due to road traffic collisions (RTCs). Yet, there is a paucity of research related to the contributing factors (i.e., optimism bias and willingness to take risks) associated with RTCs and the examination of road safety education program tailored at reducing young military fatalities. In order to address this gap in the literature, we examined one specific road safety educational intervention tailored for the UK military personnel and investigated their attitudes towards the program, optimism bias and willingness to take risks. Measures evaluating their optimism bias, willingness to take risks and attitudes towards the program were asked after the participants attended the road safety interventions. The results revealed that young military personnel, aged 18–25, had higher optimism bias and willingness to take risks compared to older military personnel, and that this effect diminishes with age. The results provide importance evidence related to military personnel’s attitudes to risk-taking.",1369-8478,Not found
An exploration of the effectiveness of in-person and online versions of the induced hypocrisy paradigm to reduce smartphone use among young drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.015,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Worldwide, smartphone use is a major contributing factor to road crash among young drivers. While young drivers may be aware of their heightened crash risk and the legal penalties associated with this behaviour, young drivers continue to engage with their smartphones. The development of novel interventions targeting this behaviour is therefore crucial. The current 2 × 2 between groups experimental study (N = 153, 107F, 43 M, 1 other) investigated the concept of cognitive dissonance in relation to smartphone use among young drivers aged 17–25 years (M age = 20.66 SD = 2.26). Specifically, it applied the induced hypocrisy paradigm to this context. The induced hypocrisy paradigm elicits cognitive dissonance by asking participants to both advocate for the desired behaviour and identify their engagement in the undesired behaviour. Participants are then motivated to change their behaviour to reduce the feelings of dissonance. The current study investigated the efficacy of both the traditional in-person methodology with a new online methodology. Analyses (e.g., ANCOVA) found that the online conditions were more effective than the in-person groups at eliciting dissonance and that the intervention conditions were more effective in reducing both intention and change in behaviour (from pre- to post-intervention) than the control groups. The intervention groups were also more likely to take/request a flyer about driver distraction. While more research is needed to corroborate these findings, these initial results suggest that cognitive dissonance occurs when young drivers use their smartphones and that the induced hypocrisy paradigm may be an effective intervention. In particular, this study’s findings suggest that an online version of the induced hypocrisy paradigm has merit and may form part of future cost-effective, mass interventions.",1369-8478,Not found
"Exploring the interactions between modal options, destination access, and travel mood",10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.012,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"A good understanding of subjectively experienced well-being in daily travel is critical for the design and evaluation of transportation policies and programs. Numerous studies have examined the relationship between how we travel and how we feel during travel. However, people’s travel mood is not only determined by their trip characteristics but also their potential mobility—the capacity of being mobile.Using the data collected via a smartphone application in Minneapolis-St. Paul area, we measure potential mobility in two aspects—modal options and destination access and reveal that people in households with better access to cars and alternative transportation modes are, all else equal, more likely to report more positive moods and fewer negative moods during travel. In addition, people living in neighborhoods with greater access to destinations are less likely to feel stress when traveling. We also find that associations between mode and mood are moderated by modal options and destination access. These findings confirm the importance of explicitly considering modal options and destination access in policy debates and planning initiatives addressing transportation and well-being. In doing so, they demonstrate the relevance of Sen’s Capabilities Approach to transportation planning.",1369-8478,Not found

The instrument development process comprised two phases: instrument development and psychometric evaluation. Data were collected from September to October 2020 using the “Invite” panel aggregator. The link to the online questionnaire was sent via smartphone text message to 400 young adults aged 18–39 years and yielded 398 valid responses. We randomly selected 200 participants for the exploratory factor analysis; the remaining 198 participants were selected for confirmatory factor analysis. The Smombie Scale comprises 15 items and four factors: (a) perceived risk; (b) stationary smartphone use, always on the smartphone; (c) pending instant message; and (d) smartphone dependency. Model fit was statistically significant (χ2/df = 2.20). The analyses indicated a sufficient goodness-of-fit index of 0.93, a comparative goodness-of-fit index of 0.95, a normed fit index and Tucker–Lewis index of 0.91, and a root mean square error of approximation of 0.07. The scale was also found to have sufficient reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83). The newly developed Smombie Scale is valid and reliable in measuring pedestrians’ smartphone use among young adults.

Understanding and modelling risky driving behaviour on high-speed corridors,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.009,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This study explores the relationships among various factors influencing risky driving behaviours, particularly on high-speed corridors (expressways). A total of 546 samples are collected from licenced drivers through an online survey. Exploratory factor analysis confirms the four-factor solution and the same is verified using confirmatory factor analysis. These factors are individual aberrant driving behaviour (violations and errors), risky driving behaviour performed by surrounding vehicles and dangerous manoeuvres due to prevailing road environment. Structural equation modelling is used to establish the relationships amongst the aforementioned factors. The results of the study describe that observed risky driving behaviour on expressways is mostly affected by drivers’ individual aberrant driving (γ = 0.62) followed by risky driving behaviour performed by surrounding vehicles (γ = 0.39) and least affected by the road environment (γ = 0.36). The individual driving behaviour is mostly affected by violations (γ = 0.47) followed by errors (γ = 0.38). Furthermore, differences in Driving Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) scales are analysed with respect to the demographic variables. Results suggest that male and young drivers report more violations than female and older drivers, respectively, however, female drivers are more error prone than male drivers. The findings of the study can be useful to identify the potential road safety countermeasures to improve the driving style as well as the driving environment.",1369-8478,Not found

This study aimed to understand beliefs of young Ontarian drivers (ages 18–24) towards cannabis use and DUIC. Methods Using a mixed methods design, we conducted an online survey (n = 426, 53% female) and two focus groups (n = 12, 67% female). The survey obtained data in the following sections: demographics, experiences and expectancies related to cannabis use and DUIC, knowledge and credibility of the law, attitudes towards DUIC, and social controls. Quantitative data was analyzed in SPSS using descriptive statistics and chi squares. Two focus groups were then conducted to contextualize quantitative findings. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results 83.6% (356) of survey’s participants had used cannabis, with 69% (296) in the past year.

Those who indicated prior history of DUIC were mostly males, had completed less than a bachelor’s degree, and were students without employment. Qualitative themes included: Being high changes you; it is hard to tell if a driver is high; DUIC is convenient, socially acceptable, and safe; legalization makes cannabis more attractive to use; and there is a need for testing, education, and prevention efforts that are relevant to youth. Conclusions A considerable number of young drivers in Ontario are currently DUIC, many of which underestimate the associated risks.

From sport to eco: A case study of driver inputs on electric vehicle efficiency,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.007,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This study focuses on driver-induced changes to vehicle energy and emissions performance by altering drivetrain configurations. It defines and examines the motivations for the use of drive modes in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Drive modes are defined as user-selectable drivetrain configurations that allow drivers to change vehicle performance aspects such as altering its propulsion status from electric to gas, changing the steering responsiveness, suspension stiffness, and regenerative braking strength. Despite the direct impact they have on the vehicle’s energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions, and local air emissions, the impact of drive modes are not traditionally measured as part of the vehicle’s performance and certification tests. The impact of drive mode choice can explain a portion of the discrepancy between PHEVs expected and on road performance as a recent study by the authors found that the use of certain modes can result in a 15–30% increase in total energy usage in a vehicle traveling at freeway speeds. This is the first study to examine the motivations for the use of these drive modes and provides an overview of PHEV drive modes, classifying them into two main mode categories (propulsion adjustment and driver experience) and eight different mode types based on their intended purpose. This is followed by a logistic regression of 11 indicators for mode usage taken from a survey of over 4,500 PHEV owning households, showing that gender and the number of long-distance trips were the most commonly associated with usage across mode types.",1369-8478,Not found
Disengagement from driving when using automation during a 4-week field trial,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.010,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Introduction A small body of research on the real-world use of commercially available partial driving automation suggests that drivers may struggle with or otherwise lapse in adequately monitoring the system and highway environment, and little is known about key issues such as how behavior associated with system use changes over time. The current study assessed how driver disengagement, defined as visual-manual interaction with electronics or removal of hands from the wheel, differed as drivers became more accustomed to partial automation over a 4-week trial. Methods Ten volunteers drove a Volvo S90 with adaptive cruise control (ACC), which automates speed and headway, and Pilot Assist, which combines ACC and continuous lane centering. Instrumentation captured automation use, secondary task activity, hands-on-wheel status, vehicle speed, and GPS location during all trips. Results The longer drivers used the Pilot Assist partial automation system, the more likely they were to become disengaged, with a significant increase in the odds of observing participants with both hands off the steering wheel or manipulating a cell phone relative to manual control. Results associated with use of ACC found comparable or lower levels of disengagement compared to manual driving as the study progressed. Discussion This study highlights concerns about vehicle control and the degree to which drivers remain actively in the loop when using automation.

The motivations for using bike sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from Lisbon,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.016,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Urban mobility has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, with public transport (PT) particularly affected due to infection risks and fears. The promotion of alternative modes of transport such as bike sharing systems (BSS) has gained a new drive as a possible way of providing an alternative to PT and limit a potential surge in private car use. In this study, we provide insights on the motivations for using bike sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic through a survey to the BSS users of Lisbon (entitled GIRA). Before the coronavirus pandemic, the most influential motivations were those connected to the BSS’ Service Coverage & Quality (such as the convenient location of BSS stations near the users’ destinations or the availability of shared e-bikes) as well as to the Personal Interests & Well-being of BSS users (namely the pleasure of cycling as well as the perceived environmental and health benefits). With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, although the motivations of Service Coverage & Quality continue to be the most valued by respondents, the motivations associated with using BSS to avoid PT and to maintain a social distance during the trip are now as important as the motivations linked to Personal Interests & Well-being. Furthermore, new users who have joined bike sharing during COVID-19 give more importance to the Social Influence (such as seeing other people using the system or the influence of their social circle) comparatively to those who were already users before the pandemic and continue to use BSS. This research provides evidence on the importance of bike sharing to the resilience of urban transport systems, particularly during disruptive public health crises. It supports that BSS should continue to operate during the coronavirus pandemic as such systems offer a transport alternative to PT that is perceived to be capable of preserving a physical distance.",1369-8478,Not found

What is unclear is whether auditory vehicle perception is impacted more by distractions reliant on listening or distractions reliant on speaking (analogous to the two components of a vocal cell phone conversation). In two experiments, adult participants listened for approaching vehicle noises and while performing listening- and speaking-based secondary tasks. Participants were tasked with identifying when they first detect an approaching vehicle and when they no longer felt safe to cross in front of the approaching vehicle. For both experiments, the speaking task resulted in significantly later detection of approaching vehicles and riskier crossing thresholds than in the no-distraction and listening conditions. The listening secondary task significantly differed from the control condition in experiment 1, but not experiment 2. Overall, our results suggest auditory distractions, particularly those reliant on speaking, negatively impact pedestrian safety in situations where visual information is minimal.

Influence of the median opening length on driving behaviors in the crossover work zone—A driving simulation study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.001,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Work zone safety has been a major concern for drivers and transportation agencies. Considering the severe consequences of crossover work zone crashes coupled with the limited literature on the median opening length, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the median opening length on driving behaviors from a behavioral perspective in crossover work zones. A driving simulation study with 32 participants was carried out to investigate the driving performance by metrics (speed, acceleration, maximum steering wheel speed, and lane-changing trajectory) with respect to five median opening lengths. The significant differences of each driving performance metric among various median opening lengths were found in the process of crossing through the median opening on the entrance by-pass and exit by-pass. The results indicated that drivers’ speeds were always higher than the speed limits for all median opening lengths. A narrower median opening may induce risky driving behaviors such as sharp deceleration and decelerating while lane-changing, which may increase speed variance. When crossing through the median opening with a larger length, high speed variance, sluggish lane-changing operations, and improper lane-using behaviors were observed because the excessive lane-changing space provided by the larger median opening length would decrease the situation awareness and increase the speed preference heterogeneity among drivers. Finally, some traffic management strategies were proposed, which can improve the safety and mobility of crossover work zones and further provide a basis for the formulation of related standards.",1369-8478,Not found
Interaction between pedestrians and automated vehicles: Exploring a motion-based approach for virtual reality experiments,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.018,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"External human machine interfaces (eHMI) might contribute to an enhanced traffic flow and road safety by providing relevant information to surrounding road users. To quantify the effect of eHMI on traffic flow, the majority of studies required participants to indicate their crossing decision in an explicit manner, such as pressing a button. While this approach proved to be efficient, the transfer to real-world behavior is unclear. Here, we propose a more realistic, motion-based approach allowing pedestrians to actually cross the road in front of a vehicle in a virtual reality environment. Participants (N = 51) encountered simulated automated vehicles (AVs) in two scenarios. We investigated the effect of different eHMIs on traffic flow and road safety. Pedestrians’́ body movements were obtained using a motion capturing system with six sensors. Our approach was validated using a two-step procedure. First, we assessed crossing behavior and subjective safety feeling while approaching AVs with and without eHMI. Second, we tested to which extent objective crossing behavior matched self-reported safety feeling. For this purpose, we evaluated if subjective safety feeling can be reliably predicted from actual crossing behavior using a functional data analysis. The proposed motion-based approach proved a valid investigation method for eHMI designs. The results indicated that eHMIs have a beneficial effect on traffic flow and road safety. Regarding traffic flow, participants crossed the road earlier and felt significantly safer when encountering an AV with an eHMI compared to no eHMI. In addition, in situations in which only some of the AVs were equipped with an eHMI, participants’ crossing behavior and safety feeling became more conservative for encounters without eHMI, indicating higher road safety. Further, subjective safety feeling was significantly predicted from actual crossing behavior. These findings highlight that eHMIs are beneficial for pedestrians’ crossing decision, both from an objective and subjective perspective.",1369-8478,Not found
Higher investment levels into pre-planned routes increase the adherence of pedestrians to them,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.019,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Extensive research has focused on identifying the principles in pedestrian route choice, often assuming that pedestrians follow an optimal route measured by factors, such as route length and busyness. However, the question of the extent to which pedestrians adhere to their planned route has not been convincingly resolved. Here, we form the hypothesis that the more pedestrians invest into a planned route by walking further along it, the bigger their tendency to stick to this route, even when it becomes less attractive than other options due to congestion, for example. We term this behaviour “route commitment effect” and conduct an online survey with over 300 participants to test and establish the existence of this effect. We propose a novel model to formalise this effect. Using simulations of our model, we give illustrative examples for the consequences of the route commitment effect. Our findings suggest that the route commitment effect can significantly influence pedestrian route choice in a simple scenario with only two possible routes. In more complex scenarios with many routes, the impact of the route commitment effect on the overall dynamics is much weaker, as pedestrians are distributed across routes. In general, we find that the route commitment effect reduces the efficiency of pedestrian flow and leads to more predictable pedestrian dynamics. Our study sheds light on the role of cognitive bias in pedestrian decision-making and may thus be helpful for facility design or operations.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of courteous and discourteous drivers on physiological stress,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.015,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Prior studies into road safety have concentrated largely on studying unsafe forms of driving behaviour such as aggressive, stressed, and risky driving. Little attention has been given to ‘positive’ driving behaviour, such as how pro-social driving may help to promote cooperation with other road users and decrease incidences of aggressive and stressful driving. This study aimed to compare the impact of courteous and discourteous driving on the immediate physical health of other drivers (blood pressure, heart rate, and markers of stress) whilst controlling for other recognized factors responsible for driver stress such as road infrastructure (e.g. roadworks, traffic lights, freeways) and driving maneuvers (e.g. merging, tail-gaiting, navigating roundabouts). Using actors in a deception study, a naturalistic driving scenario was created in a lab-based simulation. All participants (n = 10; 39 ± 14.5 years) drove the same route in a simulator and engaged with the same driving behaviours and other virtual road users on two separate occasions separated by 7 days. The difference between conditions was whether the participant interacted with other drivers who displayed: a) courteous or b) discourteous behaviours. Blood pressure, heart rate variability and salivary hormone concentrations (cortisol and alpha amylase) were measured before and immediately after each simulated drive. After interacting with the discourteous drivers, participants experienced significantly higher mean arterial blood pressure, systolic and diastolic pressure, central systolic and diastolic pressure, and heart rate, and lower heart rate variability (indicative of acute stress) compared to interacting with the courteous drivers. Conversely, these markers of stress were reduced after interacting with the courteous drivers. The results support courtesy on the road to provide short-term benefits for the recipient of the action, while also increasing road safety more generally.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the influence of time pressure on overtaking maneuvers and crash risk,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.017,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The research conducted on overtaking maneuver for evaluating drivers’ safety showed adverse effects of urgency on driving performance and decision making. Therefore, a driving simulator study was designed to examine driving performance of the drivers and its implication on overtaking and crash probabilities under increasing time pressure conditions. Eighty-eight participants data were analyzed in the current study. Three different time pressure conditions: No Time Pressure (NTP), Low Time Pressure (LTP), and High Time Pressure (HTP) were considered for analyzing driving performance of the drivers while executing overtaking maneuvers. The driving performance was assessed using minimum time-to-line crossing and coefficient of variation in speed to dissect the safety margin adopted by the drivers while overtaking the lead vehicle. Further, minimum time-to-line crossing and coefficient of variation in speed were considered as explanatory variables to investigate their influence on overtaking and crash probabilities. Parametric survival analysis and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to assess the driving performance, overtaking and crash probabilities. The parametric survival analysis showed that minimum time-to-line crossing reduced by 36.7% and 63.8% in LTP and HTP driving conditions, respectively. The GLMM results revealed that coefficient of variation in speed increased by 3.437% in HTP (no significant effect in LTP) as compared to NTP driving conditions. Further, the GLMM results showed that overtaking and crash probabilities decreased with increment in minimum time-to-line crossing and coefficient of variation in speed values. Additionally, it was observed that male drivers took risky decisions than female drivers. Nevertheless, the comparative analysis revealed that male drivers were less prone to crashes than female drivers. Overall, it can be inferred that the drivers take risky decisions with increment in time pressure to complete the driving task, even at the expense of their own safety which exposed them to high likelihood of crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors influencing public awareness of autonomous vehicles: Empirical evidence from Brisbane,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.016,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Growing concerns, regarding transport disadvantage and increased socioeconomic disparities, demand innovative ways to improve equity and make transportation systems smarter. One of the most anticipated developments within the field of smart mobility is driving automation systems. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve accessibility, affordability, safety and efficiency of transport systems, but come with risks including the intensification of private vehicle travel. Understanding public awareness is an important step to determine whether motivation and intention to use AVs will impact on its potential. This paper aims to investigate factors influencing public awareness of AVs as a solution to transport disadvantage. The study applies an ordinal logistic regression analysis to analyse survey data collected from the residents of Brisbane (Australia). Our findings reveal that awareness is positively correlated within young and middle-aged adults, low-income residents, disability, public transport users, and those who feel unsafe on public transport, while an increase in the number of household vehicles is negatively correlated. The study provides insights into public awareness towards the potential benefits of AVs, and highlights potential opportunities and challenges associated with these expectations.",1369-8478,Not found
What are the factors determining user intentions to use AV while impaired?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.008,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"In this study, we employ the Integrated Choice Latent Variable (ICLV) framework to model the public’s intention of using Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) while impaired under the influence of alcohol, medicine, or fatigue. We identify five latent constructs from psychometric indicators that define respondent’s perception and attitudes towards AVs which are i) perceived benefits, ii) perceived risks, iii) enjoy driving, iv) wheels public transport attitude, and v) rails public transport attitude. We use these latent variables along with explanatory variables to study user intentions regarding delegation of vehicle control from human driving to autonomous driving. The study uses survey data collected from 1,065 Czech residents between 2017 and 2018. Our findings indicate that user intentions are primarily defined by attitudes rather than socio-demographic attributes. However, the inclusion of both types of variables is crucial in evaluating user intentions. Despite a positive outlook towards AVs, people were found to be reluctant in using AVs while impaired which can be attributed to distrust towards the technology. Our analysis shows that with appropriate efforts from policymakers, the public’s attitude can be changed to promote adoption. The efforts will have to be emphasized towards building positive attitudes (such as perceived benefits) and diminishing existing negative attitudes (such as perceived risks).",1369-8478,Not found

However, there is a need for overarching approaches that take into account the interaction between various influencing factors in order to establish proof of validity. The aim of this study was to explore the validity of our driving simulator in respect of its ability to predict driving behaviour based on participants‘ observed driving errors and driver’s individual characteristics. Method 41 healthy participants were assessed both in a Smart-Realo-Simulator and on the road. By means of linear modelling, the correlation between observed driving errors was investigated. In addition, the influence of self-reported and externally assessed driving behaviour as well as individual parameters (education and training; driving history) were analysed. Results By including these factors, 58% of the variance could be explained. For observed driving errors, a relative validity was established. For self-reported and externally assessed driving behaviour, an absolute to relative validity emerged. The amount of time spent in education and training proved to have a significant influence on driving performance in the simulator, but not on the road. Discussion In general, our results confirmed the validity of our driving simulator with regard to observed and self-reported driving behaviour. It emerged that education and training as potential indicators of cognitive resources played a differential role regarding the study conditions. Since real road driving is considerably automated in experienced drivers, this result suggests that simulation-related behavioural regulation is challenged by additional cognitive demands as opposed to behavioural regulation extending to real road driving. However, the source of these additional cognitive demands remains currently elusive and may form the subject of future research.",1369-8478,Not found
To cross or not to cross: Impact of visual and auditory cues on pedestrians’ crossing decision-making,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.014,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The controlled study of pedestrians’ crossing decision-making is relevant to the search for better safety conditions for this class of vulnerable road users. Several risk factors have been identified in the literature related to the crosswalks’ surrounding environment, the socio-demographic characteristics of the pedestrians crossing the road and the place where the crosswalks are inserted, as well as situational variables, such as speed and distance of the approaching vehicle during the crossing. In this work, the roles of visual and auditory cues in crossing decisions were analysed, comparing different speeds and distances, and taking into consideration different speed patterns of the approaching vehicle, aiming to identify what can affect pedestrians’ crossing behaviour. Experiments were performed in a virtual environment. Participants were presented with 10 different stimuli featuring a vehicle approaching with different speeds and movement patterns, combined with 2 auditory conditions: one concerning a vehicle with a gasoline combustion engine and another one with no sound cues. Participants were tasked with indicating the moment they decided to cross the street when they thought it was safe to do so by pressing a response button. Percentage of crossings, response time (RT), and time-to-passage (TTP) were recorded and subsequently analysed. The results showed that lower speeds and higher distances lead to higher percentages of crossings and RTs. The auditory condition did not significantly affect participants’ responses, leading to the conclusion that participants’ crossing decision was especially based on their visual perception of the movement characteristics of the approaching vehicle, particularly its speed and distance. These results may have relevance for the development of communication strategies between the vehicles, especially the automated ones, and pedestrians.",1369-8478,Not found
Validation of the F-DBQ: A short (and accurate) risky driving behavior questionnaire for long-haul professional drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.013,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Although the Driving Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) remains the most known tool for assessing risky road behaviors among motor vehicle drivers, recent studies have raised several concerns on the specificity of both driving task conditions and behavioral repertory of certain segments of the driving population. Among them, long-haul (cargo) professional drivers constitute one of the “intensive driving” groups for which the existing adapted behavioral research tools are still very scarce. Purpose The aim of the present study was to test and validate the F-DBQ (or “Freight Driving Behavior Questionnaire”), a short version of the DBQ adapted to the occupational driving conditions and typical road risk behaviors of freight drivers. Method For this cross-sectional study, a sample of n = 982 Spanish long-haul drivers with a mean age of 48.5 years was used, responding to a questionnaire composed of measures on road risk behaviors (DBQ), fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength – CIS and Need for Recovery Scale – NFR) and job stress (Effort–Reward Imbalance questionnaire – ERI). Results Through competitive Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) with structural equation models, it was found that the F-DBQ has a clear dimensional structure, a fair goodness-of-fit, high factorial weights, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity and an improved fit to long haul drivers’ working conditions. Also, both (general and work-related) fatigue and job stress have shown to have a significant role in explaining risky road behaviors of long-haul drivers. Conclusion The findings of this study support that an abbreviated version of the Driving Behavior Questionnaire (the F-DBQ) can be used to assess traffic violations and errors among long-haul drivers, in consideration of their specific task-related conditions (that qualitatively differ from other groups of drivers), with potential implications on the enforcement of occupational and road safety research.",1369-8478,Not found

To encourage people’s transition to more active travelling, it is important to understand the decision-making process regarding modal choice. The first aim of this study is therefore to combine a three-stage version of the transtheoretical model of change (TTM; Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983) with the theory of planned behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) to advance our understanding of the nature of the TTM stages. The second aim is to examine certain characteristics (i.e., age, gender, importance of everyday exercise, importance of environmental issues, perceived accessibility, and satisfaction with travel) of these three stages of change. The study used a web-based questionnaire, an app-based questionnaire, and an app-based travel diary completed by 306 people in the Stockholm area. The observed behaviour measured using the app-based travel diary showed that the three-stage model used in this study was consistent with the participants’ self-reported travel behaviour in using bicycles, public transport, and cars. Interventions focusing on attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control appear to have potential to move people from one stage to another regardless of initial stage. To make interventions as effective as possible, the stage of change as well as the behavioural, normative, and control beliefs underpinning attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control must be considered. Finally, more research is needed to advance our knowledge of the relationship between the three stages of change and other variables.",1369-8478,Not found
The differences in hazard response time and driving styles of violation-involved and violation-free taxi drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.011,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between taxi drivers’ traffic violations in past driving and two domains: driving skill (hazard perception skill) and driving style. Five hundred and fifty taxi drivers aged 25 – 59 were recruited to finish a video-based hazard perception test and the Chinese version of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI). The relationships between hazard response time, driving style and traffic violations were examined, and the differences in hazard response times and driving styles of violation-involved drivers (n = 220) and violation-free drivers (n = 330) were compared. The results showed that taxi drivers’ traffic violations are closely related to their driving styles and hazard response time. Violation-involved drivers scored significantly higher in hazard response time and maladaptive driving styles (i.e., anxious, risky and angry styles) and lower in careful driving style than violation-free drivers. More importantly, drivers’ hazard response time and driving styles can effectively predict their violation involvement in the last 12 months with an overall classification accuracy of 66.4%. The findings provide evidence for the usefulness of video-based hazard perception tests and the MDSI in taxi driver testing and training.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of a dedicated lane for connected and automated vehicles on the behaviour of drivers of manual vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.010,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to enhance traffic efficiency by driving at shorter time headways, and traffic safety by shorter reaction times. However, one of the main concerns regarding their deployment is the mixed traffic situation, in which CAVs and manually driven vehicles (MVs) share the same road. This study investigates the behavioural adaptation of MV drivers in car-following and lane changing behaviour when they drive next to a dedicated lane (DL) for CAVs and compares that to a mixed traffic situation. The expectation is that in a mixed traffic situation, the behavioural adaptation of MV drivers is negligible due to lower exposure time and scarce platoons, while concentrating the CAVs on one dedicated lane may cause significant behavioural adaptation of MV drivers due to a higher exposure time and conspicuity of CAV platoons. Fifty-one participants were asked to drive an MV on a 3-lane motorway in three different traffic scenarios, in a fixed-base driving simulator: (1) Base, only MVs were present in traffic, (2) Mixed, platoons of 2–3 CAVs driving on any lane and mixed with MVs, (3) DL, platoons of 2–3 CAVs driving only on a DL. The DL was recognizable by road signs and a buffer demarcation which separated the DL from the other lanes. A moderate penetration rate of 43% was assumed for CAVs. During the drives, the car following headways and the accepted merging gaps by participants were collected and used for comparisons of driving behaviour in different scenarios. Based on the results, we conclude that there is no significant difference in the driving behaviour between Base and Mixed scenarios at tested penetration rate, confirming our research expectation. However, in DL scenario, MV drivers drove closer to their leaders specially when driving on the middle lane next to the platoons and accepted shorter gaps (up to 12.7% shorter at on-ramps) in lane changing manoeuvres. Dedicating a lane to CAVs increases the density of CAV platoons on one lane and consequently their conspicuity becomes higher. As a result, MV drivers are influenced by CAV platoons on a DL and imitate their behaviour. The literature suggests that dedicating a lane to CAVs improves the traffic efficiency by providing more possibilities for platooning. This study shows that implementing such a solution will affect the driving behaviour of human drivers. This should be taken into consideration when evaluating the impacts of dedicated lanes on traffic efficiency and traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found
The contribution of memory to differences in situation awareness in expert and non-expert drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.007,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Situation awareness (SA) is knowing what is going on in the environment: identifying objects, understanding how they interact and predicting future events. It is important in the context of driving as it is related to hazard perception. Driving-related SA may help explain expert drivers’ superior driving skill, but it is important to understand whether this is because expert drivers have better memory for driving-related tasks, whether superior memory performance is task specific, and the degree to which any effect is attributable to experience vs. expertise. On-road paramedics were compared with non-expert drivers. The participants engaged in an SA driving task where they were required to describe a vide taped driving situation after the screen cut to black. We measured their SA, memory and demographic driving variables. The starting SA of World, Action and Schema was re-developed to better reflect driving SA, into World, Action, Other-Agent Action, Projection, and Rationale. Driving expertise predicted each category of SA, except the Action category, independently of other experience variables. Similarly, expertise also predicted SA categories independently of any of the memory tasks. We concluded that expert drivers have better driving-SA than non-expert drivers and this is not due to better memory for driving tasks, or ‘time-on-road’. This finding is important in driver training because if we can harness the SA skills that expert drivers demonstrate, we could potentially implement them in better driver training programs.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors that influence the acceptance of future shared automated vehicles – A focus group study with United Kingdom drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.009,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The development of Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs) is well underway to provide mobility as a service (MaaS) and bring benefits such as reduced traffic congestion, reduced reliance on privately owned vehicles and increased independence to non-drivers. To realise the benefits of SAVs, adoption by private vehicle users is crucial. Previous research has shown this subset of users as the least likely to adopt SAVs, and it is not well understood what factors are important to achieve such adoption. The purpose of this study is to obtain an in-depth understanding of attitudes, perceptions and preferences that influence the acceptance of future SAVs for drivers. This paper presents the results from an online asynchronous focus group study with 21 British drivers as participants. From the analysis, Service Quality, Trust and Price Value emerged as the three most prominent factors to understand user acceptance of SAVs. These three main factors may be of prime importance for convincing naïve private car owners to accept high-speed SAVs. Productive use of travel time has been frequently mentioned in previous research as a benefit of vehicle automation but was scarcely mentioned by participants in this study. Shared Space Quality in introduced as an indicator for Service Quality, together with Security and Trusting Co-passengers as two indicators of Trust.

Differential effects of driver sleepiness and sleep inertia on driving behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.001,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Objectives Driver sleepiness is one of the major safety issues in conventional driving and sleep inertia emerges as a driver state in automated driving. The aim of the present study was to assess the differential impacts of sleepiness and sleep inertia on driving behavior. Method 61 participants completed a 10-min manual driving task during an otherwise automated drive. They completed the task (a) under an alert state, (b) under a sleepy state, and (c) after EEG-confirmed sleep. Driving performance was assessed with the parameters lane-keeping, speed choice, and speed-keeping. The eye-blink-based sleepiness measure PERCLOS (the proportion of time with eyes closed) was compared for the three driver states. Results Lane- and speed-keeping performance were impaired under the sleepy state and after sleep, relative to the alert state. After sleep, lane-keeping behavior recovered rapidly and speed-keeping recovered by trend. Under the sleepy state, performance deteriorated. After sleep, the mean speed was lower than in the sleepy state and in the alert state. PERCLOS was increased after sleep and under the sleepy state, relative to the alert state. Conclusions Although sleep inertia had detrimental effects on driving parameters similar to sleepiness, this effect rapidly vanished. Hence, while brief naps might be suitable to restore alertness in general, the minimal time needed to regain full capacity after napping should be a focus of future research.",1369-8478,Not found
Measuring drivers’ takeover performance in varying levels of automation: Considering the influence of cognitive secondary task,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.005,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Mixed control by driver and automated system will remain in use for decades until fully automated driving is perfected. Thus, drivers must be able to accurately regain control of vehicles in a timely manner when the automated system sends a takeover request (TOR) at its limitation. Therefore, determining the factors that affect drivers’ takeover quality at varying levels of automated driving is important. Previous studies have shown that visually distracting secondary tasks impair drivers’ takeover performance and increase the subjective workload. However, the influence of purely cognitive distracting secondary tasks on drivers’ takeover performance and how this influence varies at different levels of automation are still unknown. Hence, a 5 (driving modes) × 3 (cognitive secondary tasks) factorial design with the within-subject factors was adopted for this driving simulator experiment. The sample consisted of 21 participants. The participants’ subjective workloads were recorded by the NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Results showed that compared to manual driving conditions, the drivers’ subjective workloads were significantly reduced in both partially and highly automated driving conditions, even with a TOR, confirming the benefit of the automated driving system in terms of reducing the driving workload. Moreover, the drivers exhibited a lower takeover behavior quality at high levels of automation than manual driving in terms of increased reaction time, abnormal performance, standard deviation of lane position, lane departure probability, and reduced minimum of time to collision. However, at the highly automated driving condition, the drivers’ longitudinal driving safety and ability to follow instructions improved when performing a highly cognitive secondary task. This phenomenon possibly occurred because automated driving conditions lead to an underload phenomenon, and the execution of highly cognitive tasks transfers drivers into moderate load, which helps with the drivers’ takeover performance.",1369-8478,Not found

There are three important findings in this study. First, although the increase in trust would reduce the privacy risk, the effect is not significant. Second, perceived risk has no impact on consumers’ intentions to use carpooling.

Analysing the influence of attitude and habit on bicycle commuting,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.015,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"New transport trends have emerged in developing countries to promote bicycling due to its individual and societal benefits. Although bicycle infrastructure provision has been one of the most utilised strategies to encourage bicycling, it has had a limited immediate impact on the bicycling modal share. Published research indicates the need to incorporate the psychosocial dimension to understand commuters' transport behaviour and explain why bicycling infrastructure usage is lower than expected. This study highlights the processes behind bicycle mode choice decisions, explicitly incorporating pro-bicycle attitudes and habits, while also considering the influence of socioeconomic, bicycle facilities and bicycling experience variables on shaping that attitude. For this purpose, an online survey was designed and sent to students, faculty members and staff of two Chilean universities to collect ad-hoc data. The modelling used an approach based on an integrated choice and latent variable model. The main findings are: attitude in itself is a relevant construct to explain behaviour; bicycling infrastructure contribute to explain bicycle choice but only indirectly through attitude; socioeconomic characteristics, bicycling familiarity and practical issues have both a direct effect on bicycle choice decision and an indirect one by fostering pro-bicycling attitudes. Additionally, results show that the explicit inclusion of habit reduces the contribution of pro-bicycle attitude in explaining bicycle choice. This might be due to interaction and reinforcement between habit and attitude.",1369-8478,Not found
A two-stage incentive mechanism for rebalancing free-floating bike sharing systems: Considering user preference,10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.003,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Free-floating bike sharing (FFBS) provides citizens with a flexible way for traveling. The operational performance of such systems is impacted by the imbalance problem of demand and supply. This paper proposes the first two-stage incentive mechanism to improve the service quality of FFBS. While inspired by the user-based rebalancing approach in station-based bike sharing (SBBS), our work is different from existing studies because location optimization is a new problem in FFBS and user preference is considered for the first time. We propose three mechanisms that are pick-up incentives, drop-off incentives, and two-stage incentives. When modeling users’ behavioral responses to incentive mechanisms, we think users prefer drop-off incentives to pick-up incentives, which is supported by a survey study. Each incentive offer is composed of a location and a price. To decide the suggested origin or destination, we first figure out the supply and demand of all valid locations based on Radiant Service Theory (RST) and then search the most problematic location comparing current inventory and future demand. The pricing scheme is modified Budgeted Procurement using Upper Confidence Bounds (BP-UCB). Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of incentive mechanisms based on historical data from Capital BikeShare program. Results show that the service level of bike sharing systems can be significantly improved by three incentive mechanisms. The two-stage incentive mechanism unexpectedly shows no advantage over pick-up incentives. Sensitivity analysis further indicates that user preference will influence the ranking of two single-stage incentive mechanisms.",1369-8478,Not found

Sixty people took part in this study and completed a demographic questionnaire, a Driving Behavior Questionnaire, a Pedestrian Behavior Scale and two computerized tests – a Hazard Perception Test for Drivers and a Hazard Perception Test for Pedestrians. We found that the better the participants detect hazards on the road as drivers, the better they detect hazards as pedestrians as well, and that most of the participants’ self-reported values regarding their driving and their road-crossing as pedestrians are correlated.

Effect of external HMI for automated vehicles (AVs) on drivers’ ability to infer the AV motion intention: A field experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.009,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"A field experiment was conducted aiming to shed light on how drivers negotiate anambiguous traffic situation when encountering an autonomous vehicle (AV) in the presence of a yielding intention signal (AV with eHMI) or not (AV without eHMI). A traffic conflict scenario was created with two opposing vehicles instructed to perform a left turn at a four-way junction, at the same point in time. Forty participants were assigned to two groups encountering either an AV with eHMI or an AV without eHMI. To check for equivalence across the two groups, both groups also encountered a conventional vehicle (CV).Results showed that the two groups performed similarly during encounters with a CV. During encounters with AV, however, participants provided with the eHMI maintained higher speed before the AV and finished their maneuver quicker than when they were not provided with eHMI. Additionally participants provided with eHMI rated higher their ability to infer the AV intention before coming to a full-stop than those provided without eHMI. The above findings indicate that the presence of eHMI on AV can accelerate drivers’ inferences about yielding intention of an AV, and have the potential to optimize AV-driver interaction in ambiguous traffic situations.",1369-8478,Not found
Is the street-crossing behavior with a head-mounted display different from that behavior in a CAVE? A study among young adults and children,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.016,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The use of virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular in the field of traffic psychology, where realistic traffic situations can be simulated and pedestrians‘ actual crossing behavior can be studied. There are two main kinds of pedestrian simulators: one uses a technology based on rear-projection screens (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment, or CAVE); the other uses a head-mounted display (HMD). Despite their extensive use, it is yet to determine whether they are equally suitable for studying street crossing. The present study was aimed at comparing street-crossing behavior and subjective evaluations in an HMD-based (HTC vive pro) pedestrian simulator and a CAVE-like pedestrian simulator, among young adults and 12-year-old children. Thirty young adults and twenty-six children performed 36 street-crossing trials (combining different speeds, traffic conditions, and gap sizes) on each of the two simulators. The results indicated that, compared to the CAVE-condition participants, HMD-condition participants accepted more crossing trials (hence, shorter gaps), initiated their crossings sooner, crossed at a slower speed, had shorter safety margins, and caused more collisions. The main difference between the two devices was in crossing initiation, which occurred markedly earlier (1.72 s) with the HMD than in the CAVE: the perception–action coupling was less finely tuned in the CAVE, probably because visual information in front of the pedestrian was missing due the absence of ground projection and 3D rendering. A significant effect of vehicle-approach speed was observed for both devices, with more unsafe behaviors at 60 km/h than at 40 km/h. Children displayed riskier crossing behavior than young adults did, with more accepted crossings, slower crossing speeds, shorter safety margins, and higher collision rates, especially in the HMD. Compared to the CAVE, the HMD received higher ratings for level of presence and a preference for VR, but also higher simulator-sickness scores. No adverse effects of exposure to virtual reality was found on stereoacuity or postural balance. The suitability of using CAVE and HMD simulators is discussed, especially for studying child pedestrians.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors affecting motorcyclists’ behavior in car-following condition,10.1016/j.trf.2021.07.014,82,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Car-following (CF) maneuver plays an important role in both traffic flow analysis and road safety assessment. However, many studies on this issue have focused on the drivers’ behaviour, neglecting the different driving behaviour of the motorcycle riders and the vulnerability of this type of user. The aim of the present paper is to analyse the factors affecting the riders’ behaviour in CF condition, by using two surrogate safety indicators, Time Headway (TH) and Time To Collision (TTC). A field experiment was conducted to collect data. Twenty young motorcyclists participated in the study driving their own motorcycles, which were instrumented with a camera and a global positioning system device (GPS). A digital image processing algorithm was used to obtain CF related indicators. The results of the study showed that Time Headway (TH) and Time To Collision (TTC) are independent of each other, extending the result obtained in the literature for the four wheeled vehicles to the motorcycles. TTC and TH were therefore analyzed separately. As for TTC, it was observed that only in few cases (0.8%) the riders were found in risky condition (TTC < 5 s), confirming the role of this parameter for the detection of an impending risk. On the other hand, TH gives information about a potentially risky situation, and 99% of the riders were found in such condition (TH < 2 s). Due to the few cases in TTC risky conditions, only TH was further modelled by using the hazard-based duration analysis. Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model specification was used, and the Weibull distribution provided the best fit of the data. The model identified four covariates affecting TH and all of them had the effect of reducing TH, increasing the collision risk. The time spent on CF condition, the speed of the motorcycle, the willingness of overtaking and the engine size of the motorcycle were the factors that reduced TH. The findings of this study could be considered in the development of microsimulation models; the factors that were found affecting the motorcyclists’ behavior in car-following condition could be considered for a more realistic simulation of the riders’ choice of Time Headway.",1369-8478,Not found
The power and sensitivity of four core driver workload measures for benchmarking the distraction potential of new driver vehicle interfaces,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.019,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This study evaluated the power and sensitivity of several core driver workload measures in order to better understand their use as a component of future driver distraction potential evaluation procedures of the in-vehicle human machine interface (HMI). Driving is a task that requires visual, manual and cognitive resources to perform. Secondary tasks, such as mobile phone use and interaction with in-built navigation, which load onto any of these three processing resources increase driver workload and can lead to impaired driving. Because workload and distraction potential are interrelated, a comprehensive method to assess driver workload that produces valid and predictive results is needed to advance the science of distraction potential evaluation. It is also needed to incorporate into New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) testing regimes. Workload measures of cognitive (DRT [Detection Response Task] Reaction Time), visual (DRT Miss Rate), subjective (NASA-TLX [driver workload questionnaire]), and temporal demand (Task Interaction Time) were collected as participants drove one of 40 vehicles while completing a variety of secondary tasks with varying interaction requirements. Of the evaluated measures, variance and power analyses demonstrated that Task Interaction Time is the most sensitive in detecting differences in driver workload between different in-vehicle HMIs, followed by DRT Miss Rate, NASA-TLX and finally DRT Reaction Time. There were relatively weak correlations between each of the four measures. These results suggest that Task Interaction Time, coupled with a reliable visual demand metric such as DRT Miss Rate, eye glance coding, or visual occlusion, more efficiently detect differences in driver workload between different HMIs compared to DRT Reaction Time and the NASA-TLX questionnaire. These results can be used to improve the understanding of the utility of each of these core driver workload measures in assessing driver distraction potential.",1369-8478,Not found
Characterization of visual scanning while driving for the identification of drivers’ profiles,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.008,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Assessing the driving skills of people with cognitive or visual impairments is often complex. The analysis of visual exploration strategies can be a good solution to identify the implementation or not of good strategies of information search in the visual scene (adaptation and compensation). In this study, we compared the visual exploration behaviours of 26 healthy, 19 glaucoma and 21 elderly participants. For this purpose, we used a driving simulator for which a visual field measurement test had been adapted to obtain measurements in static and dynamic conditions. The dynamics of the gaze was also measured. Our results showed that each of the three groups of participants had specific characteristics of visual exploration. Using a classification algorithm, we were able to show that it was possible to identify the group which a participant belonged to on the basis of the visual exploration’s characteristics.

Measuring driver-vehicle cooperation: Development and validation of the Human-Machine-Interaction-Interdependence Questionnaire (HMII),10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.003,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The development of partially and highly autonomous vehicles that take over parts of the driving task will result in changes in e.g. the responsibilities, interface and system design, task allocation and communication between driver and automated vehicle. To support this change and the increasing space of cooperative possibilities between driver and vehicle, generally accepted design principles and preconditions for successful driver-vehicle cooperation (Directability, Mutual Predictability, Joint Goals and Mutual Task-Dependency) were defined. However, research lacks validated scales measuring the proposed basic principles of driver-vehicle cooperation. Furthermore, a theory is missing that links those basic principles with a theory that enables an understanding of the influence of drivers' perception of the autonomous vehicle and context on driver-vehicle cooperation. Therefore, this work links the basic theoretical principles of driver-vehicle cooperation with the social psychological Theory of Interdependence and their dimensions (Conflict, Power, Mutual Dependence, Information Certainty, Future Interdependence). Filling the gap of missing validated scales for the principles of driver-vehicle cooperation, this study provides the development and validation of the Human-Machine-Interaction-Interdependence (HMII) questionnaire. In two studies, the new HMII questionnaire to measure drivers' perception in driver-vehicle cooperation was developed. In the first study (n = 94), items for the perception of the situation were transferred from the original Theory of Interdependence to the driver-vehicle cooperation. A 7-dimension model was identified via Explorative Factor Analysis. In the second study (n = 314), the model and items were validated via confirmatory factor analysis. A seven-factor model (Power, Conflict, Mutual Dependence Information Certainty: System to Human, Information Certainty (two levels) Future Interdependence (two levels) with 33 items showed a good fit to the data, chi2 = 841, p < .001, adjusted chi2 = 1.77, SRMR = 0.071.

How do familiarity and fatal accidents affect acceptance of self-driving vehicles?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.004,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Expected benefits of disruptive technologies such as self-driving vehicles may only materialize if they are publicly accepted. Acceptance increases when implementation is experienced as initial concerns become unfounded and individuals become familiar with the new technology. Fatal accidents, however, negatively affect acceptance. This paper examines citizens' acceptance of self-driving vehicles by contrasting pre- and post-implementation of a self-driving shuttle in Switzerland and before and after the first fatal accident involving a self-driving vehicle in Arizona (USA) in 2018 gaining high media attention. To gauge acceptance, a panel survey using a random sample of 1408 Swiss residents was used. The results indicate that news about the fatal accident abroad exerts a stronger effect on acceptance than experiencing a self-driving bus trial. Latent scepticism causes acceptance to decrease in the event of an accident but only lasts short term. However, acceptance levels are stable and at high levels, which also explains the comparably low familiarity effects. As public acceptance is necessary for technology transitions, this article provides policymakers practical insights on how citizens form preferences towards traffic automation and related policy regulations. More specifically, results show how attitudes change over time while residents experience a trial and the first fatal accident with the technology at hand.",1369-8478,Not found
Reliability of variable message signs information: A field experiment study in Chongqing,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.002,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"A variable message sign (VMS), which is a key component of intelligent transportation systems, has been frequently used in the management of urban roads and motorways to provide drivers with real-time traffic condition information about a road section or area. Nevertheless, there is a lack of unified regulations for VMS design, which makes it difficult to accurately determine the understandability and legibility of VMS information. In practice, inappropriate designs of VMSs are common, such as overload of VMS information and excessive number of phases, particularly on the urban roads of China. Building on our earlier findings obtained by surveys, in this study, field tests were conducted to assess the reliability of VMS information in terms of the visual perception characteristics of drivers. For a full visual perception, the information displayed on a VMS must be reliable, i.e., it should be easy for drivers to detect, obtain, and understand the messages they require. Two basic theories—information theory and visual perception theory—were introduced to build a quantification model of VMS information, select evaluation indices, and design the experimental process. A total of 24 drivers participated in the field experiments and questionnaires. Five indices—information obtainment rate, periodic validity, driver subjective scoring and the corresponding UI (represents information intelligibility), and CE (represents information legibility)—were analyzed to evaluate their relationships to VMS information reliability. The results confirmed that the amount of information, and the scrolling period considering redundant distance, significantly affect the reliability of VMSs information. For static VMSs, the information obtainment rate and the subjective scoring decrease with increasing amount of information. The recollection accuracy of the drivers significantly declines when the amount of information shown increases to 90 bits, corresponding to an information obtainment rate of less than 0.8 and UI equal to 0. For dynamic VMSs, the information reliability deteriorates as the scrolling period shortens and the number of phases increases. Unreasonable reliability is found when the periodic validity is less than 0.9, i.e., the actual scrolling period is more than 10% less than the calculated one, corresponding to CE equal to 0. The reliability of information was evaluated by combining the subjective scoring of the drivers and a data-based statistical analysis and considering driving safety. Accordingly, it was recommended that 90 bit is the maximum amount of information to be shown on a VMS and that the preferred scrolling period of each phase of a dynamic VMS is 5 s. The results of this study support the objective of providing reliable information to drivers by addressing the problems related to the amount of information and presentation time for VMSs. These findings provide a basis for determining the thresholds for VMS information to promote practical and user-friendly designs of VMSs on urban roads.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating what makes people walk or cycle using a socio-ecological approach in seven European cities,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.008,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Large efforts and investments have been made into public transport, walking, and cycling in cities around Europe. Yet, cars remain the most ubiquitous mode of travel in urban areas. Often, research into the barriers facing active travel evaluates only one part of the problem, such as a person’s surrounding environment (the macro level), socially embedded practices that define the activity (meso level), or a person’s own beliefs and sense of identity (micro level). However, barriers and enablers to active travel exist on multiple levels, and interventions to increase walking and/or cycling are less likely to work when implemented in isolation. Hence, a multilevel socio-ecological model is developed to demonstrate and test the importance of assessing these barriers together, and identify interrelationships among them. Using the Physical Activity Through Sustainable Transportation Approaches (PASTA) dataset on the travel behaviour of people in seven different European cities, this paper identifies the constructs that correlate with active travel most. Within PASTA, psychosocial constructs influence the decision to take a trip by bicycle or walk more than built environment variables. In addition, trip purpose and the meso level influence the importance of built environment and attitudinal variables in explaining active travel. These relationships do not vary significantly between cities. This research further supports the use of multi-faceted interventions to increase walking and cycling, rather than focussing on a single policy.",1369-8478,Not found

The effect of implementation intention on speeding and acceleration overtime: A simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.011,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Speeding is considered a major risk factor for road safety. In this study, implementation intention, which is a type of cognitive intervention, was designed to reduce speeding. Implementation intentions are self-regulatory ‘if-then’ plans, which are the subordinate concepts of goal intentions. Additionally, the type of goal was considered as a factor that could contribute to the subsequent behavior. An approach-type goal aims to achieve a behavior, whereas avoidance-type goals aim to avoid a negative, undesirable outcome. Following this idea, the present study has two aims: (i) to manipulate intentions towards speeding by using implementation intentions, and second (ii) to manipulate goal types (approaching vs. avoidance) of the intentions towards speeding. At the baseline level, participants in the experimental group were manipulated through implementation intentions by using a volitional help sheet, in which they matched critical items with the appropriate responses, whereas participants in the control group received an irrelevant filler task. After a two-week time interval, a follow-up study was conducted. In order to investigate the first aim, simulated driving behaviors of experimental and control groups were compared at the baseline and follow-up levels. For the second aim, the experimental group was divided into two subgroups, namely, approach-type and avoidance-type goals. The repeated measures mixed-model ANOVA results showed a significant difference between experimental and control conditions, yet the goal type (approaching vs. avoidance) did not differ significantly from one another. The results of the present study revealed that implementation intentions do not reduce speeding, however, they do prevent increased speeding.

Can persuasive normative messages encourage sustainable transportation usage?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.014,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"One way to persuade people to change their travel behaviours is to execute strategies based on the provision of persuasive normative messages. Several studies have reported that providing information on social norms can lead people to perform different pro-environmental actions, such as energy and water conservation. However, in the transportation field, little research has investigated whether normative messages can be used to encourage people to switch from driving cars to using more sustainable means of transport. The aim of the current paper is to explore whether the intention to use different travel modes can be influenced by a persuasive normative message. In particular, we studied the different impacts of descriptive norm and injunctive norm information alongside more traditional factors on the intention to use a car, public transport, or active mobility. To perform our analysis, we developed three integrated choice and latent variables (ICLV) models using the information collected from an experimental study conducted among a sample of 340 individuals living in the area of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy). One of our modelling results indicates that individuals are more likely to use sustainable means of transport if they i) have previously used such means, ii) have a positive attitude toward them, iii) have an interest/involvement in using them, and iv) have been exposed to injunctive norms related to their use. Importantly, the computation of the pseudo-elasticity effect revealed that the impact of past behaviour is much stronger than the impact of normative messages.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of using mobile phones while cycling: A study from the perspectives of manipulation and visual strategies,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.010,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Bicycles have become one of the major modes of urban public travel. Moreover, the high number of bicycle accidents has created challenges for road traffic safety. In addition, a relationship exists between single-handed use of handlebars and the use of mobile phones while cycling, which increases the risk of cycling. The current study considers not only the impact of mobile phone use while cycling on the safety of cyclists but also the impact of the mental load of a distracting task on cycling safety. Thirty-two college students were recruited to participate in a cycling experiment with distractions that was carried out on both campus and off-campus roads. A paired t-test was used to analyze cyclists' performance under different distraction states. The results show that when performing distracting tasks, the speed of cycling is significantly reduced, the acceleration and rate of change in the deflection angle are significantly increased, and the saccade frequency is significantly reduced. In addition, texting while cycling has a greater negative impact on cycling performance than does calling or listening to music. This study reveals the harm of mobile phone use while cycling by analyzing the effects and characteristics of manipulation performance and visual strategy. The study results can contribute to improving cyclist awareness regarding distraction safety and reducing the occurrence of mobile phone distraction issues. Furthermore, this approach provides a theoretical research basis for scientific and effective intervention and improvement measures in the future.",1369-8478,Not found

The current study explored participants’ acceptance of a conditional (Level 3) automated vehicle (AV) before and after riding as a passenger for 10 min on open, public roads in uncontrolled traffic. Additionally, participants were asked to rate the riskiness (perceived risk) of a variety of vehicle maneuvers, such as turning, accelerating, and braking when approaching an intersection. We predicted that participants would report higher acceptance ratings and lower perceived risk ratings after experiencing the AV compared to pre-trip ratings. Further, we predicted that participants riding in the front-passenger seat would report higher ratings for risk compared to participants sitting in the rear-passenger or rear-driver seats. Sixty participants from South-East Queensland, Australia (aged 21–82 years; M age = 45.78; 23 female) took part in the study. Compared to pre-trip responses, participants reported statistically higher ratings for acceptance, as well as statistically lower ratings for perceived risk with respect to specific vehicle maneuvers performed while in automated mode. Differences were detected between seats for perceived risk, but these results were less clear. Increases in acceptance and decreases in risk were also detected as the number of false hazards detected by the vehicle increased. Overall, these findings suggest that acceptance towards AVs may increase, and expectations of risk related to AV maneuvers may decrease, after participants have experienced the vehicles firsthand, on an open, public road in an uncontrolled traffic environment.",1369-8478,Not found

The Chinese version of the DCBS contains seven factors, including three driving cost factors (damage to self-esteem, life endangerment and distress) and four driving benefit factors (impression management, sense of control, thrill and pleasure). Significant associations between the DCBS-C factors and driving styles and traffic violations show that the discriminant validity of the scale is acceptable. Moreover, the driving cost factor of damage to self-esteem and the driving benefit factor of thrill both contributed to drivers’ traffic violations and crashes.

A total of 100 students participated in a controlled driving simulator experiment in an urban environment. Measures of driving performance were collected, as well as eye tracking and EEG as windows into attention allocation. The different types of DBAs investigated were static (a single image), transitioning (one static DBA replaces another), and animated (short videos). The statistical analysis demonstrated that there were significant differences in the effect of each type of DBA on drivers' performance (deviation from the center of the lane and reaction time), visual attention to the road (percent of fixations on the road, percent of fixations on DBAs, fixation duration on DBAs, and number of gazes on DBAs), and the EEG theta band and beta band.

Anticipatory driving is achieved through effective retrieval of prior driving-relevant knowledge using mental models and appropriate cues. Knowing when and which retrieval cues have a critical impact on the anticipation process and how information compatibility affects anticipation can be the basis for supporting people in anticipating and appropriate behavior in road traffic. For generating in-depth insights into the processing of retrieval cues, a video-based experimental study was conducted combining specific compatible and incompatible retrieval cues in urban driving scenarios. From a driver's perspective, participants were asked to anticipate in a two-step approach (measuring low and high certainty anticipation) whether a vehicle ahead would enter their lane or turn onto another street due to a lane blockage ahead. Further, they choose their preferred behavioral intention (accelerate, decelerate or maintain speed). In general, drivers strived for coherent situation representation, and in this process, multiple retrieval cues influenced anticipation in different ways. Participants were more likely to be consistent in their anticipation response. That is, they tend to follow their first intention (equivalent low and high certainty anticipation for either lane change or turn) even in the presence of incompatible stimuli. Inconsistent compared to consistent anticipation responses, however, led to reduced subjective confidence, and in part to increased criticality. Not only anticipation but also intended behavior was influenced by retrieval cues. In accordance, the anticipation of others' behaviors can be considered a predictor of specific intended behavior in road traffic.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of E-bus satisfaction on driving behaviour: A questionnaire-based study on E-bus drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.007,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The aggressive promotion of electric buses (E-buses) is receiving increasing attention as an important measure to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. Electric buses (E-buses) still have some defects, which may reduce driver satisfaction and affect a drivers’ driving behaviour (such as frequent attention to the instrument panel given a lack of energy and overspeeding given the time pressure caused by a lack of energy). In this study, the influencing factors of drivers’ overall satisfaction (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, environmental performance, technology acceptance and line environment) were investigated using the bus driver satisfaction questionnaire. The overall satisfaction level was measured directly by the overall satisfaction scale. Aberrant and positive driving behaviours were observed by the professional driver driving behaviour questionnaire. Taking overall satisfaction as the intermediary variable and driving behaviour (aberrant and positive driving behaviours) as the dependent variable, we established the hypothetical relationships among overall satisfaction, driving behaviour, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, environmental performance, technology acceptance, and line environment and constructed an E-bus driver driving behaviour structural equation model (SEM). Through an online questionnaire survey, the survey data of 313 E-bus drivers were obtained and verified for analysis. The results show that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, environmental performance and technology acceptance have a positive impact on overall satisfaction, and environmental performance has the greatest impact on overall satisfaction; overall satisfaction has a negative impact on aberrant driving behaviour and a positive impact on positive driving behaviour; and the line environment has a positive impact on aberrant driving behaviour. From the driver's point of view, this study plays a positive role in a more comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages, and the factors restricting the application, of E-buses. Meanwhile, it provides a strong basis for government departments, industry management departments and bus companies to formulate policies (such as E-bus driver training and management strategies).",1369-8478,Not found

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between speed indicators (official speed limit, perceived speed limit, preferred speed), as well as their differences, and to determine which road and personality characteristics influence them. Compared to previous studies, we introduced several innovative features, including a richer personality dataset based on three different questionnaires, a focus on all three types of roads (urban, rural, transition), and representative data on observed speeds. Using statistical models of the speed indicators, we found that both speed limit belief and speed choice, as well as their differences, are often influenced by the same characteristics. These are mainly more generous road design (higher road class, higher speed limit, and wider road) and the presence of additional elements (vegetation, pavements, and pedestrian crossings).

The role of feedback in shaping responses to risky road scenarios: Evidence from electrodermal activity,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.001,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"When faced with hazardous driving situations, rapid and effective risk perception and decision-making processes are of crucial importance for avoiding crashes. In these cases, the processes are accompanied and influenced by underlying psychophysiological mechanisms such as electrodermal activity (EDA) modulations. The present work aims to assess the psychophysiological mechanisms underlying participants’ risk perception and decision-making when facing risky road scenarios, as correlated to the feedback role in modulating participants’ behavior. Study 1 (n = 32) explores the behavioral effects of administering a contingent feedback in a decision (decision-making) and an evaluation (risk perception) task in response to a set of risky and not risky images. The behavioral data reveal an effect on the participants’ probability of response, independently from the type of image presented, when the feedback was administered. In the decision task, the effect is accompanied by a change in the amplitude and percentage of the skin conductance responses (SCRs), which are moderated by block of trials. Study 2 (n = 44) better assesses the role of task and block on participants’ physiological activation, as measured by EDA signal. The results show an increase in psychophysiological activation when the feedback is delivered, in the first part of the tasks, both in terms of SCRs amplitude and percentage to the presented road scenarios, followed by a decrease in the second part of the tasks. Moreover, this effect is more evident in the decision task than the evaluation task. These findings suggest that the role exerted by feedback when facing risky traffic images may be described as based on an associative process that, once the correct response has been learned, tends to be reduced as it becomes automatic.

This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate a newly developed protocol for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for driving fear compared with a wait list and to use specific assessment scales. 34 participants (30 women, 4 men) in an outpatient psychotherapy clinic were randomly allocated to either 18 sessions of CBT or a wait list (n = 17 each). After treatment, CBT was significantly more efficacious than the wait list with large effect sizes on the Instrument for Fear of Driving (IFD) (Cohen’s d = 2.58) and on the Driving Cognitions Questionnaire (DCQ) (Cohen’s d = 2.14). Driving fear is a condition treatable by CBT and the suggested protocol is safe, feasible and acceptable. Further studies with larger samples and active controls (e.g., virtual reality therapy) are required to draw generalizable conclusions on effect sizes.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating the impacts of driver's pre-warning cognitive state on takeover performance under conditional automation,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.004,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"To design better fallback procedures and enhance road safety for conditionally automated vehicles (SAE Level 3), it is important to understand the factors that affect driver’s takeover performance (i.e., driving performance while resuming manual control). This study investigates the impacts of driver’s pre-warning cognitive state (i.e., before the issuance of a takeover warning) on takeover performance. Most existing studies assess takeover performance by independently analyzing driving performance indicators (e.g., minimum time-to-collision and maximum deceleration), and thereby ignore their associated interdependencies. This study proposes a novel comprehensive takeover performance metric, Takeover Performance Index (TOPI), that combines multiple driving performance indicators representing three aspects of takeover performance: risk of collision, the intensity of the driver’s response, and trajectory quality. Further, the driver’s pre-warning cognitive state is estimated by analyzing neurophysiological data (i.e., brain electrical activity) measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG) for 118 participants in driving simulator experiments. Linear mixed models are estimated for takeover performance to analyze its linkages to the driver’s pre-warning cognitive state, novelty in takeover experience (i.e., prior experience with a takeover situation), type of takeover warning (i.e., non-mandatory takeover vs. mandatory takeover), age, and driving experience. In this study, most drivers intervened in non-mandatory takeover scenarios and exhibited poor takeover performance. We observed three crashes across 287 runs. The study results show that takeover performance decreases with age but increases with driving experience when the driver is under certain pre-warning cognitive states, including fatigue, drowsiness, passive attention, and low level of alertness. They also illustrate that the novelty in takeover experience and mandatory takeover warning negatively affects takeover performance. The study findings provide insights for developing operator training and licensing strategies, designing regulations for the use of automated vehicles, and factoring driver cognition in designing fallback procedures in automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating the impacts of situational awareness and mental stress on takeover performance under conditional automation,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.002,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Several safety concerns emerge for the transition of control from the automated driving system to a human driver after the vehicle issues a takeover warning under conditional vehicle automation (SAE Level 3). In this context, recent advances in in-vehicle driver monitoring systems enable tracking drivers’ physiological indicators (e.g., eye-tracking and heart rate (HR) measures) to assess their real-time situational awareness (SA) and mental stress. This study seeks to analyze differences in driver’s SA and mental stress over time (i.e., successive experiment runs) using these physiological indicators to assess their impacts on takeover performance. We use eye-tracking measures (i.e., on-road glance rate and road attention ratio) as indicators of driver’s SA during automated driving. Further, we use the pre-warning normalized HR (NHR) and HR variability (HRV) as well as the change in NHR and HRV after the takeover warning as indicators of mental stress immediately before and the change in mental stress after the takeover warning, respectively. To analyze the effects of driver state (in terms of SA and mental stress) on the overall takeover performance, this study uses a comprehensive metric, Takeover Performance Index (TOPI), proposed in our previous work (Agrawal & Peeta, 2021). The TOPI combines multiple driving performance indicators while partly accounting for their interdependencies. Results from statistical analyses of data from 134 participants using driving simulator experiments illustrate significant differences in driver state over successive experiment runs, except for the change in mental stress after the takeover warning. Some significant correlations were found between the physiological indicators of SA and mental stress used in this study. Takeover performance model results illustrate a significant negative effect of change in NHR after the takeover warning on the TOPI. However, none of the other physiological indicators show significant impacts on takeover performance. The study findings provide valuable insights to auto manufacturers for designing integrated in-vehicle driver monitoring and warning systems that enhance road safety and user experience.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving examiners’ views on data-driven assessment of test candidates: An interview study,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.021,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Vehicles are increasingly equipped with sensors that capture the state of the driver, the vehicle, and the environment. These developments are relevant to formal driver testing, but little is known about the extent to which driving examiners would support the use of sensor data in their job. This semi-structured interview study examined the opinions of 37 driving examiners about data-driven assessment of test candidates. The results showed that the examiners were supportive of using data to explain their pass/fail verdict to the candidate. According to the examiners, data in an easily accessible form such as graphs of eye movements, headway, speed, or braking behavior, and color-coded scores, supplemented with camera images, would allow them to eliminate doubt or help them convince disagreeing test-takers. The examiners were skeptical about higher levels of decision support, noting that forming an overall picture of the candidate’s abilities requires integrating multiple context-dependent sources of information. The interviews yielded other possible applications of data collection and sharing, such as selecting optimal routes, improving standardization, and training and pre-selecting candidates before they are allowed to take the driving test. Finally, the interviews focused on an increasingly viable form of data collection: simulator-based driver testing. This yielded a divided picture, with about half of the examiners being positive and half negative about using simulators in driver testing. In conclusion, this study has provided important insights regarding the use of data as an explanation aid for examiners. Future research should consider the views of test candidates and experimentally evaluate different forms of data-driven support in the driving test.",1369-8478,Not found
Development of the Questionnaire on the Acceptance of Automated Driving (QAAD): Data-driven models for Level 3 and Level 5 automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.011,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Automated driving comes with many promises like zero traffic casualties that are, however, only realizable given their technological development and public acceptance for wide-spread deployment. To investigate the potential acceptance, we developed a new data-driven questionnaire focusing on drivers and barriers of the anticipated possible (non-)adoption of automated driving (AD). Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire study with 725 respondents (351 female, 374 male) ranging from 18 to 96 years. We applied exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling, to pursue the overarching goal to develop the QAAD questionnaire (short and long version for SAE Level 3 (L3) and 5 (L5) AD). Hence, we identified the three latent factors PRO (positive aspects), CON (negative aspects), and NDRTs (non-driving related tasks) of L3 (short: 9 items; long: 16) and L5 (short: 11, long: 17), respectively. Additionally, we queried general questions on AD (8 items) and extracted the two factors Early Adoption/Pro AD and Sustainability. Our findings and the goodness-of-fit indices suggest data-driven models for L3 and L5 automated driving and on general aspects focusing on early adoption and sustainability in the context of AD. They can be applied in future research settings, in particular, in (quasi-)experimental L3 and L5 AD studies and in population surveys on AD. The evidence of the presented study should be validated and compared to other questionnaires on AD in different countries around the globe.",1369-8478,Not found

Mindfulness has risen as a method for improving mental and physical well-being and has been hypothesized as potentially beneficial for driving performance. This has led to some commercial ventures based on such hypothesis, despite that the empirical evidence backing up them is still limited. Besides, at the moment there is not yet a clear account of the specific mechanism underlying this proposals. So, it seems plausible that the relationship between mindfulness and driving performance is indirect, and that personality traits such as conscientiousness and neuroticism may play a mediation role between mindfulness and driving performance. A sample of 98 drivers between the ages of 19 and 29 completed questionnaires assessing mindfulness, anxiety trait and anxiety state, and the big five personality traits. Driving performance was assessed in a driving simulator. A mediation model was fitted with conscientiousness and neuroticism set as mediators of the effects of the relationship between the subject’s mindfulness levels and the driving performance.",1369-8478,Not found

Mobile phone use by drivers is widely recognised as increasing crash risk, while many other common distractions, such as eating or adjusting vehicle controls, are also problematic but less well understood. This study was aimed at objectively measuring the prevalence of various in-vehicle distracting driver behaviours in moving traffic. Covert video surveillance was deployed, using specialist video camera systems at four elevated locations on South Australian roads. Video was recorded and then analysed by multiple independent researchers. A total of 920 drivers were observed in the footage, and 8.9% of all drivers were observed to be potentially distracted. The majority of drivers were in passenger vehicles (94.6%) and among these drivers 8.6% were distracted in comparison to 14% of heavy vehicle drivers. The most prevalent driver distractions observed included mobile phone use (2.5%), reaching for, or holding an object (1.8%), eating or drinking (1.5%) and wearing headphones (0.9%). A higher speed zone was associated with a lower proportion of distracted driving behaviour. Reducing mobile phone use in vehicles through blocking technologies and police enforcement will decrease distracted driving and distraction related crashes; however, other in-vehicle distractions are also pervasive and require interventions to reduce distracted driving. Importantly, this methodology can be used to objectively monitor the prevalence of distracted driving behaviours over time and to evaluate interventions aimed at changing distracted driving behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found

To fill this gap, a survey study was conducted on 73 police officers to assess their opinions on various ADAS features as well as their recommendations for improvement. Results of the correlation analyses indicated that officer behavior and opinion on ADAS features were influenced by the trust officers had in the available ADAS systems among other key factors such as ADAS training and perceived usefulness. On this basis, guidelines for future research and development of ADAS were provided to improve officer driving safety in police operations.

Driving without memory: The strength of schema-consistent false memories,10.1016/j.trf.2021.09.018,83,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Drivers’ memory for their recent trips has been shown to be surprisingly poor, with relatively low accuracy of both recall and recollection and substantial levels of false memories. Driving research has suggested that arousal, such as from risk, leads to more accurate memories. Memory research suggests that the typicality of objects and events makes them harder to remember accurately, compared to schema-inconsistent or atypical objects, and leads to greater likelihood of false memories. In contrast, it has been suggested that memory for actions is different to memory for objects, and that typical actions are remembered more accurately than atypical actions. The present research examined the role of typicality or schema consistency in the accuracy of memory for driving. Participants drove a 15 km route in their own cars and then answered questions about their drive. The results showed that atypical objects and actions were recalled with greater accuracy than typical objects and actions. The results also showed that false memories were most common for typical objects, but not for typical actions. We interpret these results in terms of both memory theory and implications for understanding skilled behaviour such as driving.",1369-8478,Not found
What happens when drivers of automated vehicles take over control in critical lane change situations?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.021,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"According to legislation, take-overs initiated by the driver must always be possible during automated driving. For example, when drivers mistrust the automation to handle a critical and hazardous lane change, they might intervene and take over control while the automation is performing the maneuver. In these situations, drivers may have little time to avoid an accident and can be exposed to high lateral forces. Due to lacking research, it is yet unknown if they recognize the criticality of the situation and how they behave and perform to manage it. In a driving simulator study, participants (N = 60) accomplished eight double lane changes to evade obstacles in their lane. Time-to-collision and traction usage were varied to establish different degrees of objective criticality. To manipulate these parameters as required, participants were triggered to take over control by an acoustic cue. This setting shows what might happen if drivers disable the automation and complete the maneuver themselves. The results of the experiment demonstrate that drivers rated objectively more critical driving situations as more critical and responded to the hazard very fast over all experimental conditions. However, their behavior was more extreme with respect to decelerating and steering than necessary. This impaired driving performance and increased the risk of lane departures and collisions. The results of the experiment can be used to develop an assistance system that supports driver-initiated take-overs.",1369-8478,Not found
Behavioural interventions for micro-mobility adoption: Low-hanging fruits or hard nuts to crack?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.011,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This study explores the potential and challenges of applying behavioural interventions to promote micro-mobility adoption.

Moreover, our experiments spanned over the pre-, during- and post- COVID-19 lockdown period in New York City. Findings from this natural experiment revealed that the effect of these behavioural interventions varied significantly during the pandemic, likely due to a heightened level of health consciousness and a new perspective regarding social interactions. Behavioural tools cannot be taken off-the-shelf and applied as a blanket policy. Individual and group characteristics have to be assessed to devise the pre-eminent behavioural interventions for a particular target audience. More experiments across a wide range of economic, social, cultural, and political settings are needed to guide the application of behavioural interventions in transportation studies.",1369-8478,Not found

The three categories “Need”, “Context and Task”, and “Reliability” were associated with Perceived Usefulness while “Increased Effort” and “Aversion” were associated with Perceived Ease of Use (Venkatesh, 2000). In addition, the influencing factors are further extended with the “Preference for Own Action”, “Distrust”, “Safety”, “Knowledge”, and “Habit”.

Other road users’ adaptations to increase safety in response to older drivers’ behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.009,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Changes in physical and cognitive abilities not only challenge the driving ability of older adults, in some situations age-related changes in driving behaviour require other road users to adapt their behaviour to maintain a safe traffic situation. In this study, we aimed to map age-related differences in driving behaviour and assess the impact on other road users. A group younger and a group older adults drove four different routes containing challenging situations (e.g., merging into motorway traffic) in a driving simulator while measures of driving behaviour were collected. Other road users’ deceleration responses to the driver’s behaviour were also collected as a measure of behavioural adaptation. Our results showed similar driving performance between young and older drivers when task complexity was low, but reduced performance in older drivers when tasks requirements increased. Lower driving speed and longer waiting times that were observed in older drivers can be interpreted as compensatory behaviour aimed at creating more time to lower task requirements. Crucially, in a non-time critical situation this compensatory behaviour was found to be successful, however in a time-critical situation (merging onto a motorway) this strategy had negative side effects because other road users had to decelerate in order to keep a safe distance. Our results show the importance of anticipation and adaptation by other road users for the success of older driver’s strategies and traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Impact on driver behaviour of guardrails of different height in horizontal-vertical coordinated road scenarios with a limited available sight distance,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.008,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Drivers consider traffic barriers (e.g., guardrails) a protection system, a hard obstacle and a sight obstruction. Hence, the possibility of using containment level barriers which are higher and superior than the minimum required by current standards should be carefully evaluated. Moreover, research investigations into their impact on driver behaviour should be designed so as to distinguish between the effects associated with each of the three roles cited above. This driving simulation study investigates how drivers adapt their longitudinal and transversal behaviour when negotiating curves with guardrails of different heights on horizontal-vertical coordinated two–lane rural road settings, with consideration given solely to the sight obstruction effect of the guardrails. Fifty-four participants drove four out of the eighteen possible scenarios obtained when the same horizontal alignment is combined with three vertical profiles with three inner roadside treatments (no guardrails, 0.75 m two–wave and 0.95 m three-wave guardrails) and the two driving directions. Research outcomes confirm that guardrail height has a significant impact on lateral and longitudinal behaviour. With the minimum standard, i.e., the minimum height, drivers stay closer to the roadside, while higher guardrails result in drivers increasing their lateral distance. Speeds are influenced by the interaction between the guardrail and other geometric and human factors. Male and female drivers adapt differently to the limitation in the available sight distance caused by the guardrail: males increase their speed, adopting a more aggressive behaviour than females. Important safety implications due to the higher speeds and wider trajectories have to be considered at the design stage.",1369-8478,Not found

"The role of values in road safety culture: Examining the valuation of freedom to take risk, risk taking and accident involvement in three countries",10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.012,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"National focus on individual freedom versus paternalistic values is a fundamental theme, which defines the status of traffic safety in different countries. The present study examines the role of such values in road safety culture based on survey data from car and bus drivers from three countries with distinctly different road safety records: Norway (N = 596), Israel (N = 129) and Greece (N = 386). While Norway has the highest road safety level in Europe, and Israel also performs better than the EU average, the road safety level in Greece was far below the EU average. As these positions reflect differences in policies and national regulations in drivers’ freedom to take risk, we hypothesize a higher focus on individual freedom to take risk and lower focus on paternalism among the Greek drivers. Results indicate, in accordance with our hypothesis, that the Greek drivers value freedom to take risk in traffic higher than drivers from Norway and Israel. Greek drivers also expect higher levels of risk taking from other drivers in their country, they report higher levels of risky driving themselves, and are more often involved in accidents. Thus, it seems that values have an important role in Road Safety Culture (RSC), legitimizing and motivating risky driving, which are related to accidents. We found, however, contrary to our hypotheses, that the Greek drivers also had the most paternalistic attitudes among the drivers in the three countries. In the present paper, we try to solve this Greek paradox.",1369-8478,Not found
Demand for mitigating the risk of COVID-19 infection in public transport: The role of social trust and fatalistic beliefs,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.010,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The rapid surge of COVID-19 cases worldwide drew attention to COVID-19 infection as a new source of risk in transport. The virus introduced a need for viral transmission mitigation as a major priority when selecting a mode of travel, and caused a significant drop in public transport use. The recovery of public transport use in the post-COVID period requires that the transport authorities favourably address people’s demand for mitigation of the risk of COVID-19 transmission in public transport. The present study aims to explore the role of risk perception, worry and priority of COVID-19 risk reduction along with fatalistic beliefs and public trust in authorities in explaining public demand for risk mitigation. The present study is among the first to investigate the role of fatalistic beliefs, social trust and risk perception for public transport and public demand for risk mitigation. The link between priority of infection prevention and demand for risk mitigation has also been less explored in public transport research. An online survey was conducted among university students in Iran between 19th April and 16th June 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, when the country was a major epicentre of the disease. A total of 271 out of 370 respondents whose dominant mode on university travels was public transport were included in the analysis. Results of structural equation modelling confirmed the paradox of trust, indicating that social trust is negatively associated with perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, which in turn may lead people to place less importance on COVID-19 prevention as a priority in travel mode choice, and consequently demand less risk mitigation efforts to prevent COVID-19 infection in public transport. Dissimilar to trust, however, the results revealed no relationship between fatalistic beliefs and risk perception, but a significant direct effect of fatalistic beliefs on demand for risk mitigation. To reinforce public demand for mitigating the risk of COVID-19 in public transport, the study calls on policymakers to exploit public trust resources for more effective risk communication, through disseminating the gradually accumulating evidence-based information regarding the infectivity and the virulence of COVID-19 and the scientific risk of infection. The study also underlined the potential importance of considering fatalistic beliefs when developing effective risk communication policies and practices to enhance public support for COVID-19 risk mitigation in public transport.",1369-8478,Not found

Two independent time-separated studies (study 1 with 522 participants; study 2 with 314 participants) confirm the role of cognitive failures as a mediator between specific personality traits and DDB propensity among young adult drivers. The results of this study suggest drivers’ personality traits such as extraversion, conscientiousness, and neuroticism have a direct impact on DDB propensity. In addition, there is evidence that cognitive failure mediates the relationship between these three personality traits and DDB propensity. Lastly, based on the results, agreeableness moderates the relationship between cognitive failure and DDB propensity. Together, these findings suggest that personality traits should be considered in conjunction with driver’s cognitive failure in explaining DDB propensity. Future research using a combination of self-reported, naturalistic and simulation studies may provide additional insight into the relationships between personality traits, cognitive failures, and the propensity towards DDB.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluation of a dynamic blocking concept to mitigate driver distraction: Three simulator studies,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.004,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"In recent years, the number and complexity of in-vehicle infotainment systems has been steadily increasing. While these systems certainly improve the driving experience, they also increase the risk for driver distraction. International standards and guidelines provide methods of measuring this distraction along with test criteria that help automakers decide whether an interface task is too distracting to be used while driving. Any specific function failing this test should therefore be locked out for use by the driver. This study implemented and tested a dynamic approach to this blocking by algorithmically reacting to driver inputs and the pace of the interaction in order to prevent drivers from having prolonged or too intense sequences of in-vehicle interactions not directly related to driving. Three simulated driving experiments in Germany and the United States were conducted to evaluate this dynamic function blocking concept and also cater for differences in the status quo of either no blocking or static blocking. The experiments consisted of a car following scenario with various secondary interface tasks and always included a baseline condition where no blocking occurred as well as an implementation of the dynamic function blocking. While Experiments 1 and 3 were aimed at collecting and analyzing gaze and driving data from more than 20 participants, Experiment 2 focused on the user experience evaluation of different visual feedback implementations from 13 participants. The user experience as rated by these participants increased throughout the course of all three studies and helped further improve both the concept and feedback design. In the experiments the total glance time towards the road was significantly higher in the dynamic function blocking condition compared to the baseline, already accounting for the increase in total task time inherent to the dynamic condition. Participants developed two strategies of interacting with the dynamic function blocking. They either operated at their normal baseline speed and incurred task blockings or operated slower to avoid the blockings. In the latter strategy, participants chunked their interactions into smaller steps with the present data suggesting that they used the pauses in between chunks to look back onto the road ahead. Theoretical and practical implications of this first evaluation of a dynamic function blocking concept are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
The conditioned anticipation of people (CAP) model of driving in urban spaces,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.012,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Despite significant gains in overall collision rates, pedestrian and bicycle safety in complete street environments remains an on-going challenge. However, urban areas with the most risk exposure for pedestrians continue to maintain lower incident rates than their suburban counterparts (“Dangerous by Design” 2021). Under most driving circumstances, the over-rehearsed nature of driving leads to a psychological state similar to self-hypnosis, where attention is subconsciously maintained on the driving task while metacognitive awareness is minimized or eliminated. This state continues until some type of conflict, uncertainty, and/or novel stimulus is presented. The primary difference in driver attention in urban environments is postulated to result from the Conditioned Anticipation of People (CAP). Based on the human neurological predisposition to recognize and fixate on human faces and figures, we hypothesize that in areas where drivers have been conditioned to expect human presence, low-level metacognition is preemptively re-engaged to address their presence, resulting in higher attentional resource expenditure and increased distraction management. Such conditioning may be generated by contextual features common to pedestrian-friendly environments but, necessarily, must be reinforced over time by the Actual Presence of People (APP). CAP driver engagement is limited by the perceptual abilities of the driver such that at higher speeds or within wider corridors, the presence of pedestrians is more difficult to perceive. This results in a non-CAP attention pattern, exhibiting minimal metacognitive activity, high levels of automaticity, and reduced attention. This model was generated based on the observation that vulnerable user presence and the roadway contextual features that support the driver's ability to see vulnerable users were related to attention data measured during the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study. Visually discernable features that were associated with vulnerable user presence had relationships with attention and large effect sizes (η2 > 0.5). Contextual features that had relationships with vulnerable user presence, but minimal visual impact or interfered with the driver’s ability to see vulnerable users had no relationship to driver attention. This behavioral pattern provides supportive evidence for the proposed model.",1369-8478,Not found
Empirical evidence of bias in public acceptance of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.005,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This study synthesizes 91 peer-reviewed survey studies examining the public acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). The framework of the study is informed by three questions: (1) How well do the collected samples represent the acceptance of the general population? (2) How often does bias exist in measuring public acceptance in AV’s questionnaires? (3) How much bias persists in reporting public acceptance of AV’s research? The findings indicate that (1) people with disabilities and racial minorities are only included in 10% and 20% of the studies, respectively (2) 50% of the studies present their questionnaire, and most are perceived to be biased as a result of systematic errors such as leading questions, missing questions, and suggestive information, and (3) 72% of the studies suffer from the sentiment bias, where the positive tone in the title and abstract is more significant than in the result. This leads to imprecise findings and unrealistic depictions of acceptance of autonomous vehicles by the public. The analysis alerts researchers and practitioners to empirical evidence of bias in public acceptance of autonomous vehicles and recommends preventive actions.",1369-8478,Not found
"Assessing the effect of long-automated driving operation, repeated take-over requests, and driver's characteristics on commercial motor vehicle drivers’ driving behavior and reaction time in highly automated vehicles",10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.015,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Automated Commercial Motor Vehicles (CMVs) have the potential to reduce the occurrence of crashes, enhance traffic flow, and reduce the stress of driving to a larger extent. Since fully automated driving (SAE Level 5) is not yet available, automated driving systems cannot perform all driving tasks under all road conditions. Drivers need to regain the vehicle’s control when the system reaches its maximum operational capabilities. This transition from automated to manual is referred to as Take-Over Request (TOR). Evaluating driver’s performance after TORs and assessing effective parameters have gained much attention in recent years. However, few studies have addressed CMV drivers’ driving behavior after TOR and the effect of long-automated driving and repeated TORs. This paper aims to address this gap and gain behavioral insights into CMV drivers’ driving behavior after TOR and assess the effect of the duration of automated operation before TOR, repeated TORs, and driver characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education, and driving history). To accomplish this, we designed a 40-minutes experiment on a driving simulator and assessed the responses of certified CMV drivers to TORs. Drivers’ reaction time and driving behavior indices (e.g., acceleration, velocity, and headway) are compared to continuous manual driving to measure driving behavior differences. Results showed that CMV drivers’ driving behavior changes significantly after the transition to manual regardless of the number of TORs and the duration of automated driving. Findings suggest that 30 min of automated operation intensifies the effect of TOR on driving behaviors. In addition, repeated TOR improves reaction times to TOR and reduces drivers' maximum and minimum speed after TORs. Driver’s age and driving history showed significant effects on reaction time and some driving behavior indices. The findings of this paper provide valuable information to automotive companies and transportation planners on the nature of driver behavior changes due to the carryover effects of manual driving right after automated driving episodes in highly automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Physiological markers of traffic-related stress during active travel,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.003,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Understanding perceptions of safety and comfort (PSC) while walking or cycling is essential to accommodating and encouraging active travel, but current measures of PSC, primarily surveys, suffer from validity and reliability issues. Physiological markers of stress like electrodermal activity and heart rate variability have been proposed as alternative, objective measures of PSC. This paper presents a literature summary and conceptual framework examining the use of physiological stress markers during walking and cycling. The existing studies of active traveller stress markers report inconsistent findings and account for limited controls. We propose a comprehensive conceptual framework to describe the array of dynamic stimuli experienced during active travel, with complex appraisals and multidimensional stress responses that feedback to travel behaviour and stimuli exposure, and culminate in a set of physiological outcomes triggered by activation of the autonomic nervous system – all moderated by numerous personal and trip-related factors. The key challenge of inferring traffic-related fear or discomfort from physiological markers measured on-road is potential confounding effects of: (1) non-traffic factors that induce or modify stress responses, (2) traffic factors that induce stress responses not associated with safety or comfort, and (3) personal and environmental factors that directly influence physiological measurements outside of a stress response. No physiological stress marker has yet been shown to be reliable for on-road active travellers, particularly not for inter-subject comparisons. Physiological markers have the potential to provide high-resolution, objective information about pedestrian and cyclist PSC, but further research, particularly controlled experiments, and more precise study framing are needed to ensure validity and address moderating and confounding factors.",1369-8478,Not found

One possible explanation for these differences is that distraction prevalence varies with road type. To test this proposal the current study investigated the prevalence of in-vehicle driving distraction in road traffic collisions (RTCs) as recorded in national records from the US and New Zealand. Analysis using odds ratios suggested conversing with passengers to be a more prevalent distraction in RTCs on minor roads than on major roads, and mobile phone use to be a more prevalent distraction on major roads than on minor roads. These results show the importance of considering the type of road when investigating the prevalence of driving distractions in RTCs in future research.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of drivers’ eye contact on pedestrians’ perceived safety,10.1016/j.trf.2021.10.017,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Many fatal accidents that involve pedestrians occur at road crossings, and are attributed to a breakdown of communication between pedestrians and drivers. Thus, it is important to investigate how forms of communication in traffic, such as eye contact, influence crossing decisions. Thus far, there is little information about the effect of drivers’ eye contact on pedestrians’ perceived safety to cross the road. Existing studies treat eye contact as immutable, i.e., it is either present or absent in the whole interaction, an approach that overlooks the effect of the timing of eye contact. We present an online crowdsourced study that addresses this research gap. 1835 participants viewed 13 videos of an approaching car twice, in random order, and held a key whenever they felt safe to cross. The videos differed in terms of whether the car yielded or not, whether the car driver made eye contact or not, and the times when the driver made eye contact. Participants also answered questions about their perceived intuitiveness of the driver’s eye contact behavior. The results showed that eye contact made people feel considerably safer to cross compared to no eye contact (an increase in keypress percentage from 31% to 50% was observed). In addition, the initiation and termination of eye contact affected perceived safety to cross more strongly than continuous eye contact and a lack of it, respectively. The car’s motion, however, was a more dominant factor. Additionally, the driver’s eye contact when the car braked was considered intuitive, and when it drove off, counterintuitive. In summary, this study demonstrates for the first time how drivers’ eye contact affects pedestrians’ perceived safety as a function of time in a dynamic scenario and questions the notion in recent literature that eye contact in road interactions is dispensable. These findings may be of interest in the development of automated vehicles (AVs), where the driver of the AV might not always be paying attention to the environment.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessing the potential impacts of connected vehicle systems on Driver's situation awareness and driving performance,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.016,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Vehicles equipped with connected vehicle technologies are able to communicate with each other and with infrastructures. Compared to Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) using camera systems and sensor technologies, the Connected Vehicle Systems (CVS) leverage the wireless communication networks to detect hazards with a greater range, alert drivers of hazards much earlier, and therefore enhance driving safety. However, drivers’ reliance on the CVS to detect critical situations could negatively affect them maintaining situation awareness (SA) in noncritical situations when no warning is issued by the CVS. The present study conducted a driving simulator experiment with 40 participants to investigate the effect of connected vehicle systems on driver SA in normal, noncritical driving scenarios after they were exposed to the CVS with different designs of collision warning lead time (3 s, 6 s, and no warnings). After drivers experienced the CVS-supported warnings with the assigned design of lead time in critical situations, driver SA was measured in normal driving conditions using the freeze probe technique. Results revealed that drivers who experienced the CVS with early warnings (6 s) showed lower SA for normal driving events compared to those who experienced the CVS with late warnings (3 s) or no warnings. Although early warnings of CVS brought more safety benefits to drivers in critical situations, the degraded driver SA due to drivers’ reliance on such warning systems could endanger drivers when a system failure occurred. These findings highlight the importance of balancing the effects of warning lead time on driver SA and driving performance in designing connected vehicle systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ and cyclists’ safety perceptions in overtaking maneuvers,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.014,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Drivers overtaking cyclists on rural roads are a safety concern, as drivers need to handle the interaction with the cyclist and possibly an oncoming vehicle. Improving the maneuver’s outcome requires an understanding of not only the objective, measurable safety metrics, but also the subjective, perceived safety of each road user. Previous research has shown that the perceived safety of the cyclist is most at risk at the passing moment, when driver and cyclist are closest to each other. However, to develop safety measures, it is necessary to know how both road users perceive safety, by understanding the factors that influence their perceptions during the overtaking maneuver. This study measured the perceived safety of drivers in a test-track experiment in Sweden and the perceived safety of cyclists in a field test in Spain. For both drivers and cyclists, we developed Bayesian ordinal logistic regression models of perceived safety scores that take as input objective safety metrics representing the different crash risks at the passing moment. Our results show that while drivers’ perceived safety decreases when there is an oncoming vehicle with a low time-to-collision, cyclists’ perceived safety is reduced by a small lateral clearance and a high overtaking speed. Although our datasets are heterogeneous and limited, our results are in line with previous research. In addition, the Bayesian models presented in this paper are novel and may be improved in future studies once more naturalistic data become available. We discuss how our models may support infrastructure development and regulation, policymaking, driver coaching, the development of active safety systems, and automated driving by providing a possible method for predicting perceived safety.",1369-8478,Not found

This study investigated the psychological antecedents involved in aggressive driver behaviours. Specifically, the study investigated the relationships between metacognitive beliefs, anger rumination, trait driver anger, and driver aggression; and examined the extent of aggressive behaviours in a sample of Australian drivers (N = 246). An inspection of cross-tabulations indicated that nearly all drivers engaged in verbal driver aggression (94%), approximately half of the drivers engaged in vehicle aggression (53%), and approximately a quarter of the drivers engaged in physical aggression (27%). Driver aggression was more commonly reported from males, open licensed, and middle-aged drivers. Structural path analysis indicated that there was a hierarchical series of relationships present, in that metacognitive beliefs influenced cognitive constructs such as anger rumination and constructive expression. Additionally, such factors were shown to more prominently influence trait driver anger, and the degree to which it was expressed. Bivariate correlations also demonstrated that the relationships carried forward to more specific dimensions of anger rumination and driver aggression styles. The findings of this study may assist to identify the origins of psychological mechanisms involved with anger progression and expression and inform potential interventions for aggressive driving behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluation of two short-term stress interventions in the context of mobility,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.006,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Objectives In our lives we experience different types of stress that emanate from a variety of situations. This stress can potentially spill over into unrelated situations, including the operation of a vehicle in a safe manner. It is not well known which types of countermeasures can actually mitigate such stress during driving. For this purpose, one needs valid stress intervention methods for the different types of stress that commonly occur during driving. In this study, it was therefore evaluated whether or not two stress interventions were effective in reducing stress. These two stress interventions were Positive Psychology–i.e., being an activity to reflect about thankful moments–and Biofeedback–i.e., being an activity aimed at continued relaxation based on the display of the participants own stress level. Methods A study with 41 (n = 21 male) participants was conducted in a stationary vehicle to evaluate the effectiveness of Positive Psychology and Biofeedback on stress reduction. Stress was induced using the Stroop Task. During a Stroop Task high stress is caused by naming color words displayed in another, incongruent color. In the Baseline Condition, participants looked at neutral images, which were expected to have no effect on stress levels. These conditions were then compared. Findings The results revealed that participant stress levels were significantly higher during each stress induction period in comparison to each stress intervention period. This indicated that a reduction of stress is possible by administering stress interventions in a stationary setting. Yet, there was no difference between Positive Psychology, Biofeedback, and the Baseline Condition, supposedly due to the short administration, stress-reducing attributes of the Baseline Condition itself, or regression to the mean effects. Novelty The overall goal of this research is the development of stress interventions to target different types of stress that can occur in the context of mobility, an application context not yet investigated. These interventions are expected to improve well-being and safety inside the vehicle by improving concentration, attention, and psychomotor control, which can be reduced by high stress. The study took a first step to achieve this goal by developing and evaluating Positive Psychology and Biofeedback as stress intervention activities to mitigate stress in a stationary vehicle–a situation comparable to automated driving. The developed interventions showed stress-reducing effects in the stationary setting whereas looking at neutral pictures–although serving as the baseline–was similarly stress-reducing. This enables the next step–adding the task of manual driving to the interventions to look into both the effectiveness of the interventions during manual driving and driving safety at the same time.",1369-8478,Not found
"Supporting cooperative driving behaviour by technology – HMI solution, acceptance by drivers and effects on workload and driving behaviour",10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.017,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The paper compares and evaluates three different HMIs (Human Machine Interface) for an ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) supporting cooperative interactions between drivers while merging and turning left. In road traffic, cooperation means that drivers (cooperation partners) coordinate their driving behaviour in a way that they facilitate each other’s intended driving manoeuvres. An experimental study was conducted with 30 participants in a static high-end simulator. The test scenarios included merging onto a motorway and turning left at a rural intersection. As independent variables, the HMI (Baseline vs. Sensor vs. C2X (Car-to-everything)) was varied in addition to the cooperation situation (merging vs. turning left). All HMI variants were based on a HUD (Head-Up Display). In the Baseline condition, the HMI only showed information about speed and navigation. The Sensor HMI visualised additionally the driving situation as it can be detected by the vehicle's own sensors. The C2X HMI was based on C2X communication and also represented the different phases of manoeuvre coordination with the cooperation partner. The traffic flow and the behaviour of the surrounding traffic did not differ between the different HMI variants, in order to ensure that the traffic situation did not influence the participants’ evaluation of the HMI variants. The dependent variables included subjective (e.g. acceptance, usability) and objective measures (e.g. driving and gaze behaviour). The results showed that a system supporting cooperative interactions is generally accepted by drivers. The most preferred system was the C2X HMI. The advantages of a C2X based HMI were an improved user experience leading to a greater intent to use the ADAS for cooperative driving interactions, increased system trust, and an easier handling of the system. The workload of the C2X HMI did not exceed the level reported for the Baseline or the Sensor HMI – although the C2X HMI presented more information. The results are used to derive indications for the design of assistance systems supporting cooperative driving behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found

Eco-driving improves the vehicle’s fuel or energy economy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We investigated the motivational predictors of eco-driving based on the theory of self-concordance (i.e., the consistency between a behavior/goal with the person’s pre-existing values and interests). Data from a cross-sectional online survey with 536 German drivers revealed that self-reported eco-driving was significantly predicted by sustained effort towards eco-driving, which in turn was predicted by self-concordance variables. Therefore, individuals pursuing eco-driving out of strong interest or deep personal beliefs (i.e., autonomous motivation) as opposed to external forces or internal pressures (i.e., controlled motivation) reported greater effort towards this behavior. Furthermore, biospheric striving coherence, i.e., the coherence between personal valuable biopsheric values (i.e., values addressing the well-being of the environment/biosphere) and eco-driving, significantly predicted effort towards eco-driving. In sum, our results suggest that autonomous rather than controlled motives and coherence between behavior and intrinsic rather than extrinsic values are relevant predictors for eco-driving. We discuss implications for future strategies and interventions fostering eco-driving in the long term.",1369-8478,Not found

This is important as negative public responses have been reported to limit the implementation of transport policies and may reduce the effectiveness of the policy. The Speed Limits Perception Survey (SLiPS) was developed to assess changes in public perceptions from baseline to 6 and 12 months post-implementation. We collected 3,485 individual responses to the survey, 64.6% (n = 2,253) of which included complete perceptions data. Using exploratory factor analysis, the following perception factors were identified: i) Detraction and resistance, ii) Support, iii) Rule following, iv) Child safety, and v) Walking safety. Following the 20mph implementation at 6–12 months: Support (ii) and Rule following (iii) had increased; Detraction and resistance (i) had decreased; and Child safety (iv) and Walking safety (v) had not changed significantly. These findings indicate that the public in Edinburgh became more positive towards the policy once it was implemented. However, more extensive policy or ongoing communication of the safety benefits of 20mph limits are needed to increase perceptions of safety that might lead to increased walking and cycling. Future research should aim to understand how those implementing speed limit interventions can positively influence public perceptions and how public perceptions about speed limits influence behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found

However, few studies have manipulated social evaluation contexts and individual susceptibilities to peer influence, such as physiological arousal, to measure effects on driving. The current study explored whether social evaluation affects driving outcomes and if the type of evaluation affects perception of peer norms. Young drivers (N = 75) were randomized to control, social acceptance, or social rejection conditions and observed risky or risk-averse driving norms. Results indicated that peer passengers and peer driving norms, regardless of the social-evaluative context, affected variability in driving outcomes, particularly in intersections. Physiological arousal and perceptions of social acceptance also predicted more variability in driving outcomes. These findings suggest that passengers increase irregular driving patterns, perhaps due to passengers distracting young drivers from road conditions. Further, social acceptance increases the strength of the relationship between the presence of peer passengers and inconsistent driving patterns, indicating that social rewards may precede risky behavior more often than social threats do.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver social desirability scale: A Turkish adaptation and examination in the driving context,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.009,84,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Self-report data collection methods are widely used techniques to gather information in studies related to road safety. One of the most considerable limitations of self-reports is social desirability bias. One way to overcome the possible detrimental effects of socially desirable responding is to control it by using social desirability scales. With respect to that, the present study aims to adapt the Driver Social Desirability Scale into Turkish, examine its construct validity, and investigate the relationship between social desirability and driving-related measures. A total of 351 drivers between the ages of 19 and 59 completed a questionnaire including a demographic information form, the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), the Driver Skill Inventory (DSI), the Two-Dimensional Social Desirability Scale (SDS), and the Driver Social Desirability Scale (DSDS). Factor analysis supported the two-factor structure of the DSDS in the Turkish sample. Social desirability correlated positively with age and driving experience. Female drivers reported higher levels of driver impression management, while male drivers scored higher on self-deception. Driver impression management was associated negatively with violations and perceptual-motor skills and positively with safety skills. Lastly, driver self-deception was positively related to violations, positive driver behaviors, perceptual-motor skills, and safety skills. The study shows that the Turkish version of the DSDS is a reliable and structurally valid instrument with incremental validity compared to the general social desirability measure in predicting driving-related outcomes.",1369-8478,Not found
Do cyclists need HMIs in future automated traffic?

On-bike human–machine interfaces (HMIs) and connecting cyclists to AVs and the road infrastructure may have the potential to enhance the safety of cyclists. This study aimed to identify cyclists’ needs in today’s and future traffic, and explore on-bike HMI functionality and the implications of equipping cyclists with devices to communicate with AVs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 cyclists in Norway and 15 cyclists in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis was used to identify and contextualise the factors of cyclist-AV interaction and on-bike HMIs. From the analysis, seven themes were identified: Interaction, Bicycles, Culture, Infrastructure, Legislation, AVs, and HMI. These themes are diverse and overlap with factors grouped in sub-themes. The results indicated that the cyclists prefer segregated future infrastructure, and in mixed urban traffic, they need confirmation of detection by AVs. External on-vehicle or on-bike HMIs might be solutions to fulfil the cyclists’ need for recognition. However, the analysis suggested that cyclists are hesitant about being equipped with devices to communicate with AVs: Responsibility for safety should lie with AV technology rather than with cyclists. A device requirement might become a barrier to cycling, as bicycles are traditionally cheap and simple, and additional costs might deter people from choosing cycling as a transport mode. Future studies should investigate user acceptance of on-bike HMIs among cyclists on a larger scale to test the findings’ generalisability, and explore other, perhaps more viable solutions than on-bike HMIs for enhancing AV-cyclist interaction.",1369-8478,Not found

Prosocial attitudes and time pressure have a significant main effect on driving behaviour. Drivers with high prosocial attitudes made lane changes at a greater distance from pedestrians and decelerated to a greater degree than drivers with low prosocial attitudes when interacting with pedestrians. Under time pressure, people drive faster and accelerate more quickly. Specifically, we found an interaction between time pressure and prosocial attitudes on driving behaviour. Drivers with low prosocial attitudes showed higher speeds than drivers with high prosocial attitudes under the time pressure scenario on foggy roads. The results showed that high prosocial attitudes lead to friendly interactions with pedestrians and careful driving in specific situations, even under time pressure.

However, assisting the drivers at an operational level did not enhance their capability of addressing a more complex task, presented as a lane change. In fact, it was more task-specific assistance (Blind-spot assist) that allowed drivers to better cope with the tactical decision that the lane change required.

Effect of speed on flow and enjoyment for driving and rollercoasters,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.001,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Worldwide, road traffic injuries are the eighth highest cause of death, and campaigns targeting excessive speed are a common approach to tackling this issue. Yet one element missing from these campaigns is acknowledgment that speed is inherently enjoyable. This study of UK road users was designed to assess whether flow theory predicts the enjoyment of the sensation of speed in the contexts of road driving and riding a rollercoaster. In a repeated measures experimental design, participants viewed 5 first-person videos from a car-driver perspective under the conditions: congested traffic, 20 mph, 25 mph, 30 mph, 35 mph. As a counterpoint to road driving, comprising an experience designed for enjoyment of rapid speed, they also viewed 3 rollercoaster videos under the conditions: 0.5x normal speed, normal speed and 1.5x normal speed. Participants rated experience of flow and enjoyment after each video. Flow and enjoyment ratings were increased at faster speeds compared with slower speeds for the road and rollercoaster contexts. Sensation seeking moderated flow scores for road driving such that higher sensation seekers rated higher levels of flow at 20–35 mph, but not in congestion, compared with lower sensation seekers. Findings are consistent with a flow explanation of speeding, such that increased speed leads to increased flow experience. Sensation seekers may be more prone to such motivation to speed, although further research is needed to verify this. We recommend for enjoyment and flow to be considered in anti-speeding campaigns and for driving to be re-designed to facilitate flow at slower speeds.",1369-8478,Not found

This paper is the first to combine stated preference (SP) and revealed preference (RP) data to evaluate the impact that individual attributes, trip characteristics, built environment, strategies to prevent unauthorized crossing, and traffic flows have on pedestrians crossing decisions in an urban context. SP and RP surveys were designed and collected in Barranquilla (Colombia) near pedestrian bridges or signalized intersections where direct crossings and a high concentration of pedestrian fatalities related to traffic accidents exist. A logit model was estimated using the data enrichment paradigm. Results show that pedestrians weigh risks and costs when choosing how to cross the road. The trajectories observed in the RP component suggest that people prefer direct crossings; nevertheless, pedestrian bridges and signalized intersections can be attractive alternatives if their location matches the origin or destination of the crossing, and no detour is needed to use them. Waiting time; safety; the fine imposed for jaywalking; personal security, and previous decisions are also variables that influence pedestrian behavior when crossing urban roads. These results can be helpful to urban planners and decision-makers interested in proposing appropriate pedestrian infrastructure. The data pooling technique and the inclusion of a cost-related variable (i.e., fine) allowed computing the willingness to pay and marginal substitution rates for attributes of the built environment and other characteristics associated with the crossing decision. Also, the inclusion of several crossing alternatives and situations allowed assessing pedestrian crossing preferences under different scenarios.",1369-8478,Not found

Significant gender differences were found on the DSII factors, with male drivers scoring higher on the impulsive driver factor and lower on the cautious driver factor than female drivers. The validity of the DSII was supported by significant associations between the DSII factors and personality traits, driving style and number of traffic violations and accidents in the previous 12 months. Moreover, drivers with traffic accidents scored significantly lower on the cautious driver factor and higher on the impulsive driver factor than those without traffic accidents. These findings indicate that the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the DSII are acceptable.",1369-8478,Not found
A novel conceptual framework investigating the relationship between roadside advertising and road safety: The driver behaviour and roadside advertising conceptual framework,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.002,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"This paper proposes a conceptual framework to understand the relationship between roadside advertising signs, driver behaviour, and road safety outcomes. Roadside advertising signs are external distractions that may take a driver's attention away from safety-critical driving tasks, potentially increasing crash risk through driver distraction and inattention. Although studies report safety concerns, as a whole, the body of research in the field is inconclusive with inconsistent quality, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Definitive links between roadside advertising and road trauma are not yet evident, which has major consequences for road regulators' capacity to develop evidence-based policy to safely administer public roads. However, a lack of consistent evidence does not indicate an absence of risk but underscores its complexity. To address this problem, the Driver Behaviour and Roadside Advertising Conceptual Framework (DBRA framework) was developed to strategically investigate and conceptualise the phenomena of roadside advertising. A new term – “extended engagement” – has also been proposed to account for situations of prolonged attentional engagement with a roadside advertising sign. Further, it is posited that important variations in driving performance may be associated with a driver's extended engagement with a roadside advertising sign. Built on extant theories of driver behaviour and empirical research, the DBRA framework is designed to be a robust tool that encourages a common agenda for future roadside advertising research.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of partial sleep deprivation: A comparative assessment of young non-professional and professional taxi drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.01.008,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Aim This study aims to determine the effects of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on driving performance of professional and young non-professional drivers. Methods The study included fifty participants (20 professional taxi drivers and 30 young non-professional drivers) driving the simulator-cab in three conditions. The first test session (TS1) was conducted after one night of PSD followed by the second test (TS2) after two consecutive nights of PSD. The driving performance metrics in two conditions of PSD (i.e., sleep duration = 4.25 ± 0.5 h) were compared with the baseline drive with no sleep loss. Sleep restriction was monitored using Actiwatch. Drivers subjectively self-reported their alertness using Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Driving performance metrics and reaction time to emergency events were collected during each drive. Results A preliminary mixed-design ANOVA showed deterioration in driving performance of all drivers in terms of speed (p < 0.1), speed variability (p = 0.06), standard deviation in lateral positions (SDLP) (p < 0.001) and delayed reaction time (p < 0.05). Separate Mixed-Effects Generalized Linear Models for professional and non-professional drivers showed that speed variability, SDLP and reaction time increased from baseline during both the PSD tests, among both the driving groups. The speed variability, SDLP and reaction time of professional drivers differed significantly from other drivers under PSD conditions. Contrary to the existing belief, the professional drivers had significant decrements in driving performance due to PSD. Conclusion A critical and comparative analysis revealed that driving experience/skill of professional drivers does not improve their resistance to deteriorating effects of sleep loss.",1369-8478,Not found
Examining U.S. drivers’ characteristics in relation to how frequently they engage in speeding on freeways,10.1016/j.trf.2022.01.006,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Speeding and speed-related crashes have consistently represented over 25% of all traffic fatalities over the past two decades. The severity of these speed-related incidents not only impact the drivers but all road users. Thus, characterizing drivers who speed, understanding their motivations, and identifying the types of risky driving behaviors associated with speeding play a critical role in developing, implementing, and sustaining effective countermeasures. Using a survey administered to a U.S. nationally representative sample (N = 2,930 licensed drivers aged 16 or older), this study develops a partial proportional odds model to examine differences in characteristics between types of speeders – frequent, occasional, and non-speeders – and explores characteristics and risk driving behaviors that are most associated with speeding behavior. Additionally, motivations for speeding are examined for drivers who frequently speed compared with those who occasionally speed. Results show speeders tended to engage in other unsafe driving behaviors, such as distracted, aggressive, unbelted, and alcohol-impaired driving. Among demographic and socio-economic variables examined in this study, drivers’ age was the greatest associated determinant. The association with engagement in red-light running, however, outweighed that with drivers’ age. Interestingly, the interaction between educational attainment and engagement in aggressive driving was also predictive of speeding behavior. For motivations for speeding, frequent speeders were more likely to report enjoying driving fast and disagreeing with speed limits compared with occasional speeders. The findings of this study are useful towards identifying the various characteristics and behaviors of drivers who engage in speeding, which can provide future insights into where effective countermeasures and prevention efforts should be focused.",1369-8478,Not found
"Investigating relationships among perceptions of yielding, safety, and comfort for pedestrians in unsignalized crosswalks",10.1016/j.trf.2022.01.007,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Interactions with other road users influence the perceived safety and comfort of pedestrians. Yet the relationships among perceptions of yielding, safety, and comfort are poorly understood. To enhance understanding of these key concepts, the objectives of this study are to determine how perception of pedestrian safety at unsignalized crosswalks differs from perception of comfort, and the relationship of each with perception of yielding. A generalized structural equations model is developed using data from an online survey in which 366 participants (i.e., “perceivers”) rated yielding, safety, and comfort for sample videos of pedestrian interactions with motor vehicles and bicycles. Results show that an individual’s perception of yielding plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of interaction attributes (e.g., vehicle speed, proximity) and perceiver attributes (e.g., travel habits) on their perceptions of pedestrian safety and comfort. For example, people who bicycle more frequently perceive pedestrians as more comfortable than people who walk more frequently, rooted in misalignment on what constitutes adequate yielding. Strategies to address pedestrian comfort can focus on a set of key yielding behaviors by drivers and cyclists – particularly allowing the pedestrian to cross first. Motor vehicle drivers must exhibit stronger yielding behavior (e.g., allow a larger time gap) than bicycles to achieve the same level of perceived pedestrian safety and comfort. Although perceptions of safety and comfort are strongly related and similarly impacted by yielding, researchers should be cautious about using the concepts interchangeably because they are differently impacted by attributes of the interaction and perceiver.",1369-8478,Not found
How to identify the take-over criticality in conditionally automated driving? An examination using drivers’ physiological parameters and situational factors,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.007,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance technology are growing exponentially, and vehicles equipped with conditional automation, which has features like Traffic Jam Pilot and Highway Assist, are already available in the market. And this could expose the driver to a stressful driving condition during the takeover mission. To identify stressful takeover situations and better interact with automated systems, the relationship and effect between drivers’ physiological responses, situational factors (e.g., takeover request [TOR] lead time, takeover frequencies, and scenario types), and takeover criticality were investigated.34 participants were involved in a series of takeover events in a simulated driving environment, which are varied by different TOR lead time conditions and driving scenes. The situational factors, drivers’ skin conductance (SC), heart rate (HR), gaze behaviors, and takeover criticality ratings were collected and analyzed. The results indicated that drivers had a higher takeover criticality rating when they experienced a shorter TOR lead time level or at first to fourth take-overs. Besides, drivers who encountered a dynamic obstacle reported higher takeover criticality ratings when they were at the same Time to collision (TTC). We also observed that the takeover situations of higher criticality have larger driver’s maximum HR, mean pupil size, and maximum change in the SC (relative to the initial value of a takeover stage). Those findings of situational factors and physiological responses can provide additional support for the designing of adaptive alert systems and environmental soothing technology in conditionally automated driving, which will improve the takeover performances and drivers’ experience.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploration of mental envelope determinants when pedestrians interact with various mobilities on mixed streets,10.1016/j.trf.2022.01.002,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Mixed traffic of multiple road users may increase when machines and future mobilities are gradually introduced in human society to satisfy the travel and service needs of people. For providing a safe and comfortable walking environment for pedestrians in the mixed streets with various mobilities, this study proposes the envelope theorem based on the contributions and limitations of the previous explorations in human–machine coexistence. The envelope is divided into physical and mental envelopes. The main focus of this study is the mental envelope (ME) which is a psychological boundary used to distinguish the range of comfort and unpleasantness in people’s minds. ME as the expansion of previous interpersonal distance can explain the pedestrian perceptions from different perspectives. This paper discusses the definition, expressions, and applications of ME, and then explores its determinants and relationships by conducting structural equation modeling (SEM) based on the questionnaire survey. The findings may assist to create better road allocation in the future.",1369-8478,Not found
Non-Driving Related tasks and journey types for future autonomous vehicle owners,10.1016/j.trf.2022.01.004,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Highly automated vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve the journey experience for all users by allowing them to partake in Non-Driving Related Tasks (NDRTs). Using a 42-question online survey of drivers (n = 1378, 59% males, 40% females), and in-depth interviews (n = 18, 56% males, 44% females), this study investigated NDRTs and the motivations for private ownership of highly automated vehicles (AVs). 42% of participants were identified to be more likely to own an AV and, believed that they were safer, would reduce congestion and the risk of accidents. There was also a genuine desire to actively fill the non-driving time being productive or using a device rather than passive tasks such as listening to music or watching their surroundings. Commuting was reported to be the most likely journey type amongst those more likely to own an AV. The commuting journey also showed the most diverse range of NDRTs including social (e.g., conversation, playing games), wellbeing (e.g., eating a meal, sleep), leisure (e.g., watching a video), and being productive (e.g., working on a laptop). This study provides insights into NDRTs to inform future interior vehicle design and motivations for owning highly automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
A method to improve the hazard perception of young novice drivers based on Bandura's observational learning theory: Supplement to expert commentary training,10.1016/j.trf.2022.01.005,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Compared with experienced drivers, young novice drivers are more likely to have traffic accidents. The main reasons are that they lack experience, their hazard perception is weak, and their visual search strategy is underdeveloped. Research shows that hazard perception training can improve the visual search strategy of young novice drivers and enhance their hazard perception ability. We propose that a driver's visual search behaviour, like any other action, can be developed by observing the behaviour of a role model. In an experiment based on a driving simulator, we clustered the visual search paths of 20 experienced drivers, selected the drivers with the best visual search behaviour, and obtained visual search path video footage to produce hazard perception training videos. Using these videos, we applied Bandura’s observation learning theory to train 20 young novice drivers. We call this approach “training based on experienced drivers' performance”. To determine the effects of training based on experienced drivers' performance, 20 young novice drivers were given the usual expert commentary training, and 20 young drivers were given no training. The results showed that training based on experienced drivers' performance and expert commentary training had positive effects on the average speed of young novice drivers through hazard sections. Compared with untrained young novice drivers, trained young novice drivers decreased their speed in response to dangerous road sections. Compared with young novice drivers who received expert commentary training and those who did not receive training, young novice drivers who received training based on experienced drivers' performance showed significant improvements in visual search. These results suggest that training based on experienced drivers' performance can help young novice drivers improve their hazard perception, especially in visual aspects. This training method can complement existing training methods for young novice drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Sexual behaviours among dyadic vehicle occupants,10.1016/j.trf.2021.11.020,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Sexual activity while driving is a risky behaviour frequently found across media. However, much is unknown about the practices and roles that dyadic occupants of vehicles (i.e. a driver and passenger) perform when engaging in sexual activity while driving. To cover this gap, a content analysis of sexually explicit media (SEM) was conducted on a sample of 208 videos taken from Pornhub.com. The videos portrayed a naturalistic driving situation of a driver of a moving vehicle engaging in sexual activity with a passenger. Videos were coded for sexual behaviours and characteristics of the vehicle occupants (gender and role). Drivers were generally male, while passengers were female. A range of sexual activities while driving were coded, including oral sex, unclothed and clothed masturbation, varying levels of nudity, and ejaculation. Drivers appear to be the focus of sexual attention, as they are generally the ones receiving sexual acts from the passenger, and predominantly ejaculating. Additionally, female passengers perform oral sex on drivers more often than male passengers, and female vehicle occupants tend to have greater levels of nudist exposure than males. This study highlights the complexities of sexual activity while driving and patterns for consideration when developing interventions.",1369-8478,Not found
Utilizing driving simulators for persons with multiple sclerosis: A scoping review,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.006,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Objective This scoping review synopsized and mapped the evidence on the utility of driving simulators for drivers with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) including participant characteristics (e.g., demographic, clinical) suited to simulator use; and driving scenario environments, maneuvers, and outcomes reflective of driving performance. Data Sources The research team searched six databases for English studies on driving simulator performance in drivers with MS. Study Selection Four reviewers independently screened 976 unique titles, 148 abstracts, and 18 full-text sources for study inclusion or exclusion. Inclusion criteria ensured that studies utilized measures of driving simulator performance in adults 18 years or older with MS. Data Extraction Reviewers independently charted, verified, and achieved consensus on 100% of the data in the extraction table. Data Synthesis The scoping review included thirteen studies (twelve assessment, one intervention), published between 2001 and 2021. Studies included small samples (N = 11–50) of adults (M age = 36–50 years; 40–91% female), mostly with a relapsing-remitting (53–100%) diagnosis and low to moderate physical disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score < 6.0). The assessment studies utilized driving scenarios to assess pre-driving (n = 1) or driving abilities (n = 2), responses to hazardous events in suburban (n = 1) or urban environments (n = 4), or the ability to maintain speed or lateral lane positioning during monotonous highway drives (n = 7), with four scenarios also including responses to secondary divided attention tasks. The intervention study utilized driving simulation as a training program to improve driving-related skills. Conclusions The evidence on the utility of driving simulators for adults with MS is limited to assessment of driving performance, mostly during monotonous highway drives. Further research should consider exploring how driving simulators can be utilized to assess driving performance in other environments or for intervention.

Effect of verbal messages with reminders to communicate driving situations to alter driver behavior in conditional driving automation,10.1016/j.trf.2022.01.003,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"In conditionally automated driving, drivers are relieved of steering (hands-off), accelerating, and braking actions as well as of continuous monitoring of driving situations and the system operation status (eyes off). This enables continuously engagement in non-driving-related activities. Managing the allocation of a driver’s attention to the surrounding environment and automation status presents a major challenge in human–machine system design. In this study, we propose a verbal message with a reminder (monitoring request) to divert the driver’s attention from non-driving-related activities to peripheral monitoring under conditionally automated driving. When the system encounters events related to weather, traffic, and road geometry, it provides a verbal message pertaining to the road surroundings (e.g., “It is foggy outside”) to the driver. After three seconds, the system provides a reminder message (i.e., “Did you confirm it?”) to the driver. We explore two questions: (1) how does the message with the reminder affect the driver’s attention allocation, and (2) how does the message with the reminder affect the driver behavior in response to a request to intervene (RTI). With a driving simulator, we designed a repeated measures mixed design with a between-participant factor of “Driving condition” and within-participant factors of “Event type” and “Measurement time”. Three driving conditions were established as follows: no messages, messages without reminders, and messages with reminders. Twenty-seven drivers participated as participants in the driving simulator experiment. Results showed that the reminder message was effective in allocating the participants’ attention to the surrounding environment, and the participants took over the driving task after spending more time understanding the take-over situation in the condition of messages with reminders compared to those in the condition of no messages. We conclude that the proposed reminder message can direct drivers’ attention to the road surroundings during conditionally automated driving. In the future, we plan to design adaptive verbal monitoring requests to adjust the reminder message according to the situation.",1369-8478,Not found
A data–information–knowledge cycle for modeling driving behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.017,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"When talking about automation, “autonomous vehicles”, often abbreviated as AVs, come to mind. In transitioning from the “driver” mode to the different automation levels, there is an inevitable need for modeling driving behavior. This often happens through data collection from experiments and studies, but also information extraction, a key step in behavioral modeling. Particularly, naturalistic driving studies and field operational trials are used to collect meaningful data on drivers’ interactions in real–world conditions. On the other hand, information extraction methods allow to predict or mimic driving behavior, by using a set of statistical learning methods. In simple words, the way to understand drivers’ needs and wants in the era of automation can be represented in a data–information cycle, starting from data collection, and ending with information extraction. To develop this cycle, this research reviews studies with keywords “data collection”, “information extraction”, “AVs”, while keeping the focus on driving behavior. The resulting review led to a screening of about 161 papers, out of which about 30 were selected for a detailed analysis. The analysis included an investigation of the methods and equipment used for data collection, the features collected, the size and frequency of the data along with the main problems associated with the different sensory equipment; the studies also looked at the models used to extract information, including various statistical techniques used in AV studies. This paved the way to the development of a framework for data analytics and fusion, allowing the use of highly heterogeneous data to reach the defined objectives; for this paper, the example of impacts of AVs on a network level and AV acceptance is given.

The waiting time for a pedestrian at intersections is crucial in street-crossing decision-making. Once pedestrians terminate their waiting behaviour during the red-light period, they would cross in the red light and put themselves in danger. A total of 2089 red-light arriving pedestrian observations were made at eight intersection crosswalks across Kolkata city (India). With the help of hazard-based duration models, the waiting duration till signal violation has been analysed. Kaplan–Meier curve has been plotted to understand the survival probabilities. A semi-parametric Cox Proportional Hazard model was used to understand the different factors influencing signal violation behaviour. However, the proportional hazard assumption was not satisfied. Therefore, a parametric Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model was used to understand the various covariates that affect the waiting duration. The results highlighted that 49.5% of pedestrians crossed immediately after arriving at the intersection in the red-light phase. A pedestrian’s probability of crossing the road when it is unsafe, i.e., motor vehicles still have green or yellow, varies with the waiting time. As waiting time increases, pedestrians get impatient and violate the traffic signal. This violation places them at an increased risk of being struck by a motor vehicle. The covariate analysis using the AFT model showed that pedestrian glance/looking behaviour, different types of distractions, signal cycle length, carrying luggage, and traffic plying on the road impacted signal violation behaviour. Signal modifications by reducing red-light phase length for pedestrians might be the most efficient means of reducing the likelihood of signal violation and being hit by a motor vehicle.",1369-8478,Not found
How does emotional intelligence predict driving behaviors among non-commercial drivers?,10.1016/j.trf.2021.12.013,85,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Dangerous driving behaviors have been found to be a leading contributor to vehicle crashes and fatalities, with more than 2.7 million people injured and 36,560 people killed in the United States in 2018 (NHTSA, 2020). Drivers’ emotions have been found to be among the leading contributors to dangerous driving behaviors. Emotions can be measured and understood through one’s emotional intelligence (EI). Previous research has confirmed the relationship between EI and dangerous driving behaviors among general driving populations in limited scope. This study analyzed dangerous driving behaviors (e.g., aggressive driving) among non-commercial US drivers. 615 US drivers ages 18 to 65 (M = 31.14, SD = 11.15) with valid US driver’s licenses (non-commercial) participated in this study. Participants completed an online survey through Qualtrics that included the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue-SF) to measure different dimensions of EI and the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI) and the Driving Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) to measure dangerous driving behaviors. Furthermore, participants reported their demographic information, including age, sex, and location. Correlation analysis revealed that significant associations exist between dangerous driving behaviors and EI. The emotionality component of EI was found to be the strongest predictor of dangerous driving behaviors. The findings concluded that participants with higher EI scores engaged in less dangerous driving behavior, resulting in fewer crashes and fatalities. Thus, promoting and improving EI may be useful in preventing risky driving among non-commercial drivers. Incorporating emotional intelligence education in driver’s education, workplace training, and licensing procedures can be helpful to develop safer drivers. Further research is needed to investigate commercial drivers’ behaviors in relation to EI.",1369-8478,Not found

So far, little is known about the influence of contextual cues like regulatory elements or (presumed) model behavior of fellow road users on the comprehension of eHMIs. In order to investigate possible effects of such contextual cues on comprehension, we conducted a picture-based online study among German residents (N = 175). Participants repeatedly interpreted three eHMI icons (“you can cross”, “do not cross”, and “pedestrian detected”) either without any context (control group) or within varying degrees of relevant context (experimental group). Context facilitated comprehensibility in terms of accuracy and subjective certainty. Relevant context was especially beneficial at first encounter. As soon as an icon’s meaning was internalized, the necessity of relevant context decreased. The effect of context should therefore be considered in future eHMI research as real-world comprehension might be underestimated otherwise.",1369-8478,Not found

Whereas most of research has focused on both contextual and personality (proximal) variables, the current research aimed to explore the relationship between attachment styles (distal variables) and aggressive behaviour on the road, hypothesizing the mediation effect of mentalization. Then, a sample of 469 drivers (M age = 35.60, SD age = 12.38; 66.1% female) taken from the general Spanish population completed a set of measures about their attachment styles (secure, anxious, avoidant, and disorganized), mentalization (alexithymia, mindful attention, empathy, and emotion recognition), and aggressive behaviour on the road (verbal, physical, vehicle-use related, displaced, and adaptive aggression). The results showed that driving aggression variables were significantly associated with self-sufficiency attachment style, as well as with empathy, alexithymia, and mindful attention. A further SEM analysis suggested that mentalization did not mediate in the relationship between self-sufficiency and driving aggression, but significant indirect effects were obtained in the case of the association between preoccupation attachment style and each one of the ways of aggression. Clinical implications of the results are discussed, in terms of the possible effectiveness of mentalization-based therapies to reduce aggression on the road, especially those which refer to alexithymia and mindful attention.",1369-8478,Not found

Participants were exposed to scenarios in which a character is driven by an SAE Level 3 automated car in different combinations of conditions (e.g., highway × heavy rain × very congested traffic × vehicle following prescribed speed). They were asked to rate their perceived comfort as if they were the protagonist. Results showed that comfort was negatively affected by driving in downtown (vs. highway), heavy rain, and congested traffic. Interaction analyses showed that reducing the speed of the vehicle improved comfort in these two last conditions, considered either individually or in combination. Cluster analysis revealed four profiles: trusting in automation, averse to speed reduction, risk averse, and mistrusting automation. These profiles were all influenced differently by the driving conditions, and corresponded to varying levels of trust in automated cars.

Curve proximity had a significant effect on approach speeds, with drivers in the high proximity curve drive showing significantly lower mean and maximum approach speeds before entering the curve. However, they also showed an unexpected tendency to higher speeds while negotiating the curve itself. The current study provides direct empirical evidence that driving behaviour on approach to a given curve is significantly affected by the proximity of other curves, and therefore highlights the need to factor in the characteristics of the road on approach to the curve, as well as the features of the curve itself when assessing risk.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of chevron design on driver behaviour when encountering and passing through a dangerous curve,10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.010,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Horizontal curves are locations on the road network with a high road accident risk. In order to provide drivers with timely and proper information about the upcoming curve, road authorities often use chevron signs. Although the main design of chevrons is similar in most countries (one colour for the background and another for the arrow), the combination of colours differs. The aim of this simulator study is to investigate how different colour combinations affect drivers when they encounter and drive through horizontal curves on rural roads at daytime. Overall, each of the tested chevrons reduced the driving speed (between 25 and 29 km/h), although not to the speed limit level (60 km/h). However, for curves marked with chevrons with fluorescent or white background the driving speed was the lowest at all measuring points, regardless of the curve direction. The observation of lateral movement shows that there are no significant differences in the way the vehicle is positioned when approaching and driving through curves marked with different chevrons. Based on the obtained results, practical recommendations and potential future research activities are presented.",1369-8478,Not found
Rear-view perception in driving: Distance information is privileged in the selection of safe gaps,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.015,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Selecting a safe gap before merging into the traffic is a crucial driving skill that relies on images provided by rear-view mirrors or, recently, camera-monitor systems. When using these visual aids, some drivers select dangerously small gaps to cut in front of faster vehicles. They may do so because they base their decision either on information about distance or object size, or on miscalculated information about time-to-passage (TTP). Previous experiments have been unable to compare the role of TTP, speed, and distance information for drivers’ gap selection, as they did not investigate them in the same experimental regime. The present experiments seek to determine the perceptual variables that guide drivers’ rearward gap selection. Using short videos of an approaching vehicle filmed from three different camera heights (low, conventional, high), a total of 61 subjects either made gap safety decisions (Experiment I), or estimated the TTP, speed, and distance of an approaching vehicle (Experiment II). An effect of camera height was found for gap selection, TTP, and distance estimation, but not for speed estimation. For the high camera position, smaller gaps were selected as safe, TTP estimates were longer, and the distance to the approaching vehicle was perceived as farther. An opposite pattern was found for the low camera. Regression analyses suggested that distance is an important player. The subjects strongly relied on distance information when estimating TTP, and perceived distance dominated subjects’ gap selection. Thus, drivers seem to employ distance-based strategies when selecting safe gaps in rear-view mirrors or monitors.",1369-8478,Not found
Perceived risk vs actual driving performance during distracted driving: A comparative analysis of phone use and other secondary distractions,10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.001,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"The present study attempts to explore the association of drivers’ risk perception towards phone usage as well as other everyday distractions (operating a music player and eating during driving), and their driving performance observed during these distracted conditions. For this purpose, driving simulator experiments were conducted with 90 participants to collect their driving performance data and a questionnaire was conducted to obtain their basic details along with their risk perceptions. Firstly, the driving performance was divided into clusters using hierarchical clustering and the clustered subgroups were compared for crash and non-crash cases to identify the groups having significant performance degradation. Based on this comparison, the driving performance subgroups were then divided into the following crash risk probabilities: High risk, Moderate risk and Low risk. Further, the associations of perceived risk with these performance subgroups and other potential factors were analyzed using association rules mining technique. Most of the drivers (72.06%) reported texting as an extremely risky task. But, surprisingly none of them considered conversation as an extremely risky task. However, in case of conversation, it was found that even though the professional drivers reported the task to be not at all risky, the observed crash risk was high for them (S = 5.21%, C = 67.86%), indicating an underestimation of the associated risk by the drivers. Similarly, the results revealed that for music player and eating tasks, drivers reported the distracting tasks to be less risky, but, in some instances, their driving performance was associated with higher chances of crash occurrence. Many interesting associations of risk perception and driving performance with respect to demographic and driving characteristics were also obtained. The findings can be useful while designing the awareness programs related to distracted driving with an aim to reduce such practices.",1369-8478,Not found

There are two main beliefs: entity beliefs (i.e., driving ability is a gift) and incremental beliefs (i.e., driving ability is improvable through effort). Implicit theories have been studied in various domains (e.g., education, sport), but never in driving, even though they could improve the knowledge of drivers’ psychological characteristics. The first objective of the present study was to develop and validate a questionnaire measuring implicit theories in driving. The second objective was to assess the predictive role of implicit theories on violations and driving self-efficacy, and the moderating role of gender. In study 1, confirmatory factor analysis, analyses of gender invariance, and concurrent validity were assessed to validate the questionnaire named Implicit Theories in Driving Questionnaire (ITDQ). In study 2, the predictive role of implicit theories on violations and driving self-efficacy was evaluated using multiple regression analyses. Moderation analyses evaluated the moderating role of gender on the relationships between implicit theories and violations, along with driving self-efficacy. The ITDQ showed acceptable psychometric properties. The results highlighted that entity beliefs positively predicted aggressive violations and negatively predicted driving self-efficacy. Conversely, incremental beliefs negatively predicted ordinary violations and positively predicted driving self-efficacy. The ITDQ is a valid scale now available for assessing implicit theories in driving, that have been shown to influence self-reported driving behavior. Future research on implicit theories in driving may help to better understand the psychological characteristics of at-risk drivers and improve driver’s training, to reduce the number of road accidents.",1369-8478,Not found

Results indicate that up to 55% of people prefer driving with highly automated control, and 30% prefer partially automated control. Behavioural beliefs (e.g., attitudes toward highly automated control) are not as critical to driving control as habits. People with stronger driving habits are less likely to use highly automated controls. A one-unit increase in worry could reduce driving in highly automated control by 5.5% and increase manual control by 4.5%, and those who welcome the new technologies are more likely to prefer highly automated control.

Nine hundred and ninety participants completed an online survey (Female: 68.6%; Age: M = 51.2 years, SD = 15.7, Range = 18.0–84.0 years) that assessed mindfulness, nomophobia, technology engagement while driving, aberrant driving behaviour, and self-reported crashes and infringements during the past two years. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships between mindfulness and nomophobia, on one hand, with self-reported engagement with technology while driving and general aberrant driving behaviours (combination of errors, lapses and violations) on the other. The results of the SEM showed that, as expected, mindfulness shared negative relationships with nomophobia, engagement with technology and aberrant driving behaviours, while all other relationships were positive. In terms of engagement with technology, there were direct and indirect paths between nomophobia and mindfulness and engagement with technology. The results of this study demonstrate the positive influence mindfulness can have on nomophobia, engagement with technology while driving, and dangerous driving behaviours that have been associated with crash risk. Mindfulness practices may reduce the effect of nomophobia on engagement with technology while driving and increased dangerous behaviours as a result. This will be increasingly important as modern work and social practices encourage people to increasingly use the phone while driving, and the technology within smart devices, and connectivity of these to the vehicle, increase. More research is needed to understand whether mindfulness-based interventions can reduce nomophobia, and thereby improve driving behaviours and reduce crash rates.",1369-8478,Not found

Based on a survey of 240 U.S. residents, a structural equation modeling analysis was performed. Our results suggest the behavioural intention to use fully AVs depends on fulfilling instrumental (i.e., performance expectancy and hedonic motivation), symbolic (i.e., personal innovativeness and social influence) and affective motives (i.e., trust and performance risk).

The suitability of 11 existing subjective instruments is evaluated, but none of the instruments matches all of the proposed requirements for this specific scenario. Therefore, a new subjective one-item measure is presented. The one-item measure is based on the mental dimension of the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire. It combines the discussed requirements for IVIS research, e.g., time-efficiency and descriptiveness for non-expert participants. A series of three studies with 107 participants overall was conducted to verify the suitability of the measure.

It's about time! Earlier take-over requests in automated driving enable safer responses to conflicts,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.014,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Automated driving (AD), which takes full responsibility for the driving task in certain conditions, is currently being developed. An important concern in AD is how to design a take-over request (TOR) that mitigates automation effects (e.g., delayed responses to conflict scenarios) that previous literature from simulator experiments has shown can occur. To address this concern, this study aims to investigate and compare driver responses to TORs and a lead-vehicle cut-out scenario under three conditions: (1) after a period of AD with a TOR issued early (18 s time-to-collision), (2) same as (1) except with a TOR issued late (9 s time-to-collision), and (3) baseline, with adaptive cruise control (ACC). This paper also compares the results to those of a previous study using the same conflict scenario but with near-perfect assisted driving system (SAE Level 2). The lead-vehicle cut-out scenario was encountered on a test track after 30 minutes driving with either ACC or AD. In AD the TOR was issued prior to the conflict object was revealed to the participants when the lead vehicle performed the cut-out (at conflict onset). This TOR strategy differed from previous driving-simulator studies that issued the TOR at conflict onset. The participants had to respond by steering and/or braking to avoid a crash. Our findings show that, independent of TOR timing, the drivers required similar amounts of time to 1) direct their first glance to the human–machine interface, 2) look forward, 3) end their secondary task, 4) put their hands on the steering wheel, and 5) deactivate automation. However, when the TOR was issued early rather than late, they started to brake earlier (even before conflict onset). All participants successfully managed to avoid crashing with the object, independent of the condition. AD with an early TOR resulted in the earliest response, while ACC drivers responded slightly earlier than the drivers in AD with the late TOR. Our findings do not support the findings of severe automation effects in previous driving-simulator studies. One reason for the difference is that when a TOR is issued prior to conflict onset, drivers are given the time needed for their preparatory actions (e.g., placing hands on the wheel, deactivating AD) that is not needed when driving with ACC or in manual driving (baseline), before having to respond to the conflict scenario. Thus, at conflict onset the drivers in AD are as ready to act (hands on wheel, eyes forward) as the drivers in the baseline and can perform an avoidance manoeuvre similar as to the baseline drive. Overall, the present study shows that AD does not need to end up in a highly critical situation if the TOR is issued early enough. In fact, AD with an early TOR may be safer than driving with ACC, because in the former drivers are more likely to brake earlier in preparation for the conflict. Finally, a TOR clearly communicates the need for drivers to resume manual control and handle potential events when AD has been deactivated. In our study, once the drivers had taken control, they clearly understood their responsibilities to respond to the conflict, in contrast to a previous study with a similar, near-perfect assisted driving system.",1369-8478,Not found
"Assessment of driver's attentional resource allocation to visual, cognitive, and action processing by brain and eye signals",10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.009,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Driving a vehicle is comprised of multiple tasks (e.g., monitoring the environment around the vehicle, planning the trajectory, and controlling the vehicle), and requires the allocation of capacity-limited attentional resources to visual, cognitive, and action processing; otherwise, the quality of task performance will deteriorate, increasing the risk of near-accidents or crashes. The present study proposes that variations in the total amount as well as the individual amounts of attentional resources allocated to visual, cognitive, and action processing depending on the driving situations could be objectively estimated by the combined use of three physiological measures: (1) the duration of eye blinks during driving, (2) the size of eye-fixation-related potentials (EFRPs), i.e., event-related potentials (ERPs) that are time-locked to the offset of saccadic eye-movements during driving, and (3) the size of auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs), i.e., ERPs time-locked to the onset of task-unrelated auditory stimuli discretely presented during driving. We implemented these measures when participants (N = 16) drove a vehicle on a slalom course under four driving conditions defined by a combination of two levels of speed requirement (fast and slow) and two levels of path width (narrow and wide). The findings suggested that, (1) when driving at fast compared to slow speeds, the total amount of resources allocated to overall processing increased, which consisted of an increase in the amount of resources allocated to cognitive (and possibly action) processing and a decrease in the amount of resources allocated to visual processing, and (2) when driving on narrow compared to wide paths, the total amount of resources allocated to overall processing remained almost the same (due to complementary speed reduction), which consisted of an increase in the amount of resources allocated to visual processing, a decrease in the amount of resources allocated to cognitive processing, and almost the same amount of resources allocated to action processing. The driver’s resource management strategies indicated by these results as well as the utility and limitations of the proposed method are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Modelling perceived risk and trust in driving automation reacting to merging and braking vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.016,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Perceived risk and trust are crucial for user acceptance of driving automation. In this study, we identify important predictors of perceived risk and trust in a driving simulator experiment and develop models through stepwise regression to predict event-based changes in perceived risk and trust. 25 participants were tasked to monitor SAE Level 2 driving automation (ACC + LC) while experiencing merging and hard braking events with varying criticality on a motorway. Perceived risk and trust were rated verbally after each event, and continuous perceived risk, pupil diameter and ECG signals were explored as possible indictors for perceived risk and trust. The regression models show that relative motion with neighbouring road users accounts for most perceived risk and trust variations, and no difference was found between hard braking with merging and hard braking without merging. Drivers trust the automation more in the second exposure to events. Our models show modest effects of personal characteristics: experienced drivers are less sensitive to risk and trust the automation more, while female participants perceive more risk than males. Perceived risk and trust highly correlate and have similar determinants. Continuous perceived risk accurately reflects participants’ verbal post-event rating of perceived risk; the use of brakes is an effective indicator of high perceived risk and low trust, and pupil diameter correlates to perceived risk in the most critical events. The events increased heart rate, but we found no correlation with event criticality. The prediction models and the findings on physiological measures shed light on the event-based dynamics of perceived risk and trust and can guide human-centred automation design to reduce perceived risk and enhance trust.",1369-8478,Not found
Cyclists’ handheld phone use and traffic rule knowledge,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.004,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Phone use is likely to distract cyclists and possibly increase crash risk. Therefore, handheld phone use among cyclists is forbidden by law in some countries, even though cyclists use compensatory strategies to attempt to mitigate distractions and related effects. Both demographic, environmental, and psychological factors have been associated with cyclists’ phone use. This study extends the existing literature by including traffic rule beliefs as an explanatory measure in predicting cyclists’ handheld phone use and additionally explores how well cyclists know these rules in different legislative contexts. Online questionnaire responses were collected in 2019 among 1055 cyclists living in Denmark (N = 568), where handheld phone use for cyclists was forbidden, and in the Netherlands (N = 487), where it was legal. Responses on phone use, traffic rule knowledge, cycling behaviour, demographic, and psychological measures were used to identify factors contributing to the likelihood of handheld phone use in three regression models; one for all respondents and one for each country. In the combined model, believing there are no rules on handheld phone use increased the likelihood of handheld phone use while cycling. Other significant factors were subjective norm, perceived behavioural difficulty, self-identity as a safe cyclist as well as demographic factors. The country-specific models found that male gender was only associated with more handheld phone use in the Netherlands, while believing there was no ban was only connected to an increase in the likelihood of using handheld phone in Denmark. Correct traffic rule knowledge was almost three times higher in Denmark, where handheld phone use was forbidden. The results identify subjective norms, potential overconfidence, and traffic rule awareness (when there is a ban) as relevant factors in reducing the likelihood of cyclists’ handheld phone use. Findings from country-specific models possibly point to a connection between culture and traffic rules. Future research should focus on underlying mechanisms and awareness of traffic rules.",1369-8478,Not found
"Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS): Demographics, preferred sources of information, and accuracy of ADAS knowledge",10.1016/j.trf.2021.08.006,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in passenger vehicles can improve highway safety. ADAS place powerful, yet imperfect, automation in the hands of drivers who hold both misconceptions and reservations about ADAS. There is little previous research on drivers’ knowledge of ADAS, and even less on sources of information drivers use to inform their knowledge. The present study addressed this gap, testing hypotheses about influences on understanding of seven ADAS in 634 licensed US drivers (aged 18–82). Multiple regression to predict self-assessed driver characteristics revealed: (a) Drivers who rated themselves as more technically sophisticated tended to be young and male, to be at once less objectively knowledgeable and more confident of their knowledge of ADAS, to avoid car dealers for ADAS information, and to value brand status; (b) Drivers who rated themselves as faster to adopt new technology also tended to be male but to be more objectively knowledgeable about ADAS and to prefer learning about ADAS from owner manuals; (c) Drivers who rated themselves as more confident in using novel vehicle technology tended to be young males with greater objective knowledge of ADAS who valued “hands-on” ADAS experience; (d) Drivers who rated themselves as more concerned about vehicle safety tended to be female, to value crash data, and to rely on hands-on experience to learn about ADAS; (e) Drivers who rated themselves as having greater aesthetic concerns tended to rely on information on styles, colors, wheels when buying a new car and preferred specific ADAS components. Neither of the latter two differed in objective ADAS knowledge. These results make a novel contribution in revealing how driver demographics and characteristics are related to preference for specific sources of information on ADAS and objective knowledge of ADAS. These results can inform future efforts to increase driver understanding of the capabilities and limitations of ADAS and hence increase public safety.",1369-8478,Not found
The effects of adaptive cruise control (ACC) headway time on young-experienced drivers' overtaking tendency in a driving simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.008,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"The preference to maintain a certain desired speed is perhaps the most prevalent explanation for why a driver of a manually driven car decides to overtake a lead vehicle. Still, the motivation for overtaking is also affected by other factors such as aggressiveness, competitiveness, or sensation-seeking caused by following another vehicle. Whether such motivational factors for overtaking play a role in partially automated driving is yet to be determined. This study had three goals: (i) to investigate whether and how a driver's tendency to overtake a lead vehicle changes when driving a vehicle equipped with an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. (ii) To study how such tendencies change when the headway time configuration of the ACC system varies. (iii) To examine how the manipulation of the speed and speed variance of the lead vehicle affect drivers' tendencies to overtake a lead vehicle. We conducted two different experiments, where the second experiment followed the first experiment's results. In each experiment, participants drove three 10–12 min simulated drives under light traffic conditions in a driving simulator under manual and level one (L1) automation driving conditions. The automation condition included an ACC with two headway time configurations. In the first experiment, it was 1 sec and 3 secs, and in the second, it was 1 sec and 2 secs. Each drive included six passing opportunities representing three different speeds of the lead vehicle (−3 km/h, +3 km/h, +6 km/h relative to the participant), with or without speed variance. Results show that drivers tended to overtake a lead vehicle more often in manual mode than in automated driving modes. In the first experiment, ACC with a headway time of 1 sec led to more overtaking events than ACC with 3 secs headway time. In addition, the relative speed of the lead vehicle and its speed variability affected overtaking tendencies. In the second experiment, the relative speed of the lead vehicle and its speed variability affected overtaking tendencies only when interacting with each other and with driving configuration. When the speed of the lead vehicle was +3 km/h and included variability, more overtaking events occurred in manual mode than both automation modes. This work has shown that driving with ACC might help reduce overtaking frequencies and more considerable when the headway time is set to 3 secs.",1369-8478,Not found

How is the visual working memory load of driver influenced by information density of traffic signs?,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.007,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"The rapid development of urban roads has resulted in an increase in the amount of information that needs to be displayed on traffic signs. The overloading of information on traffic signs may increase drivers’ visual cognition burden and cause driving errors. It could be an important factor affecting driving safety and result in accidents. To enable drivers to cognize traffic signs, the information density that they could endure under reasonable workload levels should be determined. In this study, we designed and implemented trials to analyze drivers’ visual working memory load (VWML) caused by different information densities (including stimulus intensity (SI) and interval time of stimulus (IS)) of traffic signs. Twenty-four paid participants (12 females) with a mean age of 23.38 years (SD = 1.38) participated in laboratory simulation trials based on the memory retrieval approach. Subjective ratings (rating scale mental effort (RSME)), and performance measurement based on reaction time and accuracy of information-matching task were measured to reflect drivers’ VWML at different information densities. The results show that information density is an important factor affecting drivers’ VWML. The following are the significant observations of the study: (1) The subjective ratings on mental effort increased with increase in the SI. Meanwhile, it first decreased and then increased with increase in the IS. (2) The response accuracy results show that a high accuracy (≥0.7) was achieved by drivers in an IS of 15 s when the SI was at most 14.16 bit/m2. Correspondingly, the drivers underwent less mental workload as a result of their better short-term memory characteristic. (3) The mean reaction time was over 1800 ms when the SI was over 14.16 bit/m2. This indicated a reduction in the information-processing capability of the drivers. The results indicate that cognition of information of unreasonable density on traffic signs would increase drivers’ VWML. This would, in turn, result in an increase in their reaction time and decrease in accuracy. The threshold of information density was also determined through the experiment. It would satisfy the information demand of drivers and prevent information redundancy. The results contribute to an understanding of drivers’ VWML while cognizing traffic signs with different information densities and provide safety, effectiveness, and information continuity considerations for the design and setting of traffic signs.",1369-8478,Not found

To this end, a lab-based experiment was conducted with a medium-fidelity driving simulator using actor-recorded voice agents. Twenty-two female and nineteen male driver-licensed participants were recruited to drive simulated vehicles with voice agents and evaluated. The results demonstrated that compared with the dominant voice, the agent with a submissive voice significantly increased ER in both manual and automated driving. Furthermore, the submissive voice significantly increased trust in automated driving compared with the dominant agent. Cross and synergistic interaction effects exist between voice dominance and driving automation in SA and ER, respectively. This study revealed that both the content of the messages of the IVAs and their voice characteristics are essential for modulating the driver’s SA, ER, and trust in driving. It is expected that larger-scale future studies with simulation or on a real road would increase the validity of this study.",1369-8478,Not found

A field test was conducted in the Netherlands with 18 participants focusing on gap acceptance, car-following, and overtaking behaviors to understand such behavioral adaptations. The participants were asked to drive their vehicles in a controlled environment, interacting with an HDV and a Wizard of Oz AV. The effects of positive and negative information regarding AV behavior on the participants’ driving behavior and their trust in AVs were also studied. The results show that human drivers adopted significantly smaller critical gaps when interacting with the approaching AV as compared to when interacting with the approaching HDV. Drivers also maintained a significantly shorter headway after overtaking the AV in comparison to overtaking the HDV. Positive information about the behavior of the AV led to closer interactions in comparison to HDVs. Additionally, drivers showed higher trust in the interacting AV when they were provided with positive information regarding the AV in comparison to scenarios where no information was provided. These findings suggest the potential exploitation of AV technology by HDV drivers.",1369-8478,Not found

To do so, an online questionnaire was conducted to assess how respondents perceived risk and how worried they were when exposed to different hazards (traffic accident, harassment, and theft). Another online questionnaire was used to calculate the walkability index at different areas of Kuwait. From the results, it was shown that worry had influenced the pedestrian’s behavior as walking frequencies had dropped among respondents who had higher levels of worry. Cohen’s d showed a large difference in worry levels between those who walk daily and those who rarely walk. People reporting high levels of worry from experiencing accidents, harassment, and theft during nighttime were around 15 to 20% higher than those during daytime. The results from the second questionnaire showed that the area with the highest walkability index was Sabah Al-Salem as it was rated as the safest, the highest density of interesting businesses, and the best public transit area. These observations showed that major improvements are needed in Kuwait to increase the modal shift from cars to walking. In order to induce healthier lifestyles and improve the pro-environment by reducing the emissions linked to car usage.",1369-8478,Not found
Understanding the immediate aftereffects of road traffic crashes in Argentina: The role of injury,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.005,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"The current paper reports a field study of 132 Argentinian individuals who experienced a road traffic crash (RTC), focusing on the role of physical injury in the early aftermath of the crash. Three groups of participants were studied: 1) individuals who were <1 month post-RTC who were not injured (<1 mo, Not Injured, n = 89), 2) individuals who were <1 month post-RTC who were injured (<1 mo, Injured, n = 15), and 3) individuals who were 1–3 months post-RTC who were injured (1–3 mo, Injured, n = 28). Examination of PTSD symptoms indicated that with several exceptions, most PTSD symptoms were endorsed at higher levels by the two injured groups, relative to the not injured group. Consideration of post-RTC cognitive and interpersonal factors indicated that the two injured groups reported lower self-efficacy and higher levels of rumination, relative to the Not Injured group. Additionally, the 1–3 mo Injured group reported being more socially isolated, relative to the two other groups. Results are discussed in light of related literature, with elaboration of potential public health interventions designed to target injured survivors of RTCs.",1369-8478,Not found
How the initial level of trust in automated driving impacts drivers’ behaviour and early trust construction,10.1016/j.trf.2022.02.006,86,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Trust in Automation is known to influence human-automation interaction and user behaviour. In the Automated Driving (AD) context, studies showed the impact of drivers’ Trust in Automated Driving (TiAD), and linked it with, e.g., difference in environment monitoring or driver’s behaviour. This study investigated the influence of driver’s initial level of TiAD on driver’s behaviour and early trust construction during Highly Automated Driving (HAD). Forty drivers participated in a driving simulator study. Based on a trust questionnaire, participants were divided in two groups according to their initial level of TiAD: high (Trustful) vs. low (Distrustful). Declared level of trust, gaze behaviour and Non-Driving-Related Activities (NDRA) engagement were compared between the two groups over time. Results showed that Trustful drivers engaged more in NDRA and spent less time monitoring the road compared to Distrustful drivers. However, an increase in trust was observed in both groups. These results suggest that initial level of TiAD impact drivers’ behaviour and further trust evolution.",1369-8478,Not found
"Humanizing autonomous vehicle driving: Understanding, modeling and impact assessment",10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.008,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The advent of autonomous vehicles brings major changes in the transportation systems influencing the infrastructure design, the network performance, as well as driving functions and habits. The penetration rate of this new technology highly depends on the acceptance of the automated driving services and functions, as well as on their impacts on various traffic, user oriented and environmental aspects. This research aims to present a methodological framework aiming to facilitate the modelling of the behaviour of new AV driving systems and their impacts on traffic, safety and environment. This framework introduces a stepwise approach, which will be leveraged by stakeholders in order to evaluate the new technology and its components at the design or implementation phase in order to increase acceptance and favor the adoption of the new technology. The proposed framework consists of four sequential steps: i. conceptual design, ii. data collection, processing and mining, iii. modelling and iv. autonomous vehicles impact assessment. The connection between these steps is illustrated and various Key Performance Indicators are specified for each impact area. The paper ends with highlighting some conceptual and modeling challenges that may critically affect the study of acceptance of autonomous vehicles in future mobility scenarios.",1369-8478,Not found
Road signs depicting childrens's book illustrations temporarily reduce speed on urban roads,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.005,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Speeding on urban roads is a major road safety problem. Police enforcement and speed humps are effective measures to prevent drivers from speeding. However, these measures may also elicit none compliance because of their restrictive nature. Therefore, non-compulsive measures that nudge drivers to adopt low speeds are also required. One such a nudge was evaluated: road signs displaying children’s book illustrations. These signs display illustrations which were created by the late illustrator and writer of books for toddlers, Dick Bruna, and are named ‘Dick Bruna signs’. The idea of the developers of these signs was that they will evoke feelings of caution and care in drivers and this will make them drive slower. To evaluate the effect, two studies were conducted. In the first study participants watched photos from the driver’s perspective. They had to report how fast they expected others would drive and how fast they themselves would drive. Participants reported speeds of others higher than their own speeds but the pattern was the same: speeds on photos with a Dick Bruna sign were approximately 4 km/h lower than on the same photos without a Dick Bruna sign and speeds were not significantly lower when a neutral sign such as an advertisement was visible. In the second study speeds were measured during seven consecutive weeks on five experimental roads and five comparison roads. On the experimental roads, during the week 3–5 a Dick Bruna sign was placed. Controlled for developments in speed on the comparison roads in the same period, mean speed was marginally significant lower, and the V85 speed and the proportion of speed offenders were significantly lower in only the first week after placement of the signs.",1369-8478,Not found
Delay or travel time information? The impact of advanced traveler information systems on drivers’ behavior before freeway work zones,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.001,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Peak travel times contribute to congestion formation at freeway work zones. Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) can inform drivers in real-time about the delays and travel times en-route and can provide information about an alternative route to a destination. Different ATIS display strategies are available; however, road authorities lack insights into how time display methods and sign characteristics influence the driving behavior (decelerations, lateral position), the drivers’ attention allocation ability and the subsequent route choice before the freeway diversion. A driving simulator study was conducted with 80 drivers in the State of Qatar to investigate drivers' behavior and voluntary route choices when encountering total travel time (default setting) or delay time updates for two freeway routes on Variable Message Signs (VMS) and Graphical Route Information Panels (GRIP). The GRIPs are a graphical alternative to conventional VMS that can provide drivers with a visual map of the most direct route or an alternative less congested route to a destination using different color schemes. The time difference ratio between the two routes was kept constant to compare the effectiveness of the information designs and investigate the drivers’ attention towards the signs with an eye-tracker. The results showed that the display of zero delays for a detour did influence 74–83% of the drivers to take the alternative route when being displayed on a VMS and a GRIP with free flow attribute framing. When displaying equal total travel times, the GRIP did influence 25% more drivers to follow the alternative route than the VMS. Generally, displaying zero delays for the alternative route resulted in an efficient attention allocation to the first ATIS location and fewer mean decelerations before the repeated ATIS location nearing the diversion. Road authorities are advised to activate the display of delay times to support efficient route choices among freeway drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
On-Road vehicle study of the experience of automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.014,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Prior studies of automated driving have focused on drivers’ evaluations of advanced driving assistance systems and their knowledge of the technology. An on-road experiment with novice drivers who had never used automated systems was conducted to examine the effects of the automation on the driving experience. Participants drove a Tesla Model 3 sedan with level 2 automation engaged or not engaged on a 4-lane interstate freeway. They reported that driving was more enjoyable and less stressful during automated driving than manual driving. They also indicated that they were less anxious and nervous, and able to relax more with the automation. Their intentions to use and purchase automated systems in the future were correlated with the favorableness of their automated driving experiences.

Cyclists' perception of cycling infrastructure – A Repertory Grid approach,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.012,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Previous research indicate that cyclists prefer safe and comfortable infrastructure. However, concepts like safety or comfort may be understood and defined in different ways by different individuals. Moreover, these concepts are so broad that it is unclear to which specific characteristics of the traffic infrastructure they are linked. Therefore, the aim of this study is to inductively examine individual evaluation criteria that cyclists use to perceive and evaluate certain route attributes. Using the Repertory Grid technique, we elicited the personal constructs of 23 participants about given route attributes and asked them to rate every attribute on every construct. The constructs were categorized and clustered resulting in five evaluation criteria, namely Mental Comfort, Physical Comfort, Interaction, Environment, and Ease of Use. Both comfort clusters were rated the most relevant for route choice, but they strengthen the suggestion of two distinct aspects of comfort, one referring to mental stress, the other referring to physical effort. Furthermore, the analyses revealed Interaction as a relatively new route criterion which also raises a new view on the negative evaluation of motor traffic and expands the concept of stress. Regarding the evaluation of route attributes, a high traffic volume and cobbled stone were rated the most negative, whereas separated cycling facilities were evaluated as most positive. Findings of this study expand existing research by qualitative insights and provide a more detailed understanding of route criteria like comfort or safety. This can be used to enhance cycling facilities and to offer preferable infrastructure for cyclists.",1369-8478,Not found
External communication of automated vehicles in mixed traffic: Addressing the right human interaction partner in multi-agent simulation,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.017,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The urban traffic system is most likely to change in the next years to a mixed traffic with human drivers, vulnerable road users, and automated vehicles. In the past, the development of external communication approaches for automated vehicles focused on scenarios where an automated vehicle communicates with either a pedestrian or a human driver. However, interactions with more than one traffic partner are more realistic. Therefore, a study with 42 participants was conducted with a multi-agent simulation in which an automated vehicle interacted simultaneously with two participants, a pedestrian and a driver of a manual vehicle. In this study, two main scenarios were investigated in order to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the interactions and to determine whether the human road users feel correctly addressed. In one scenario, the pedestrian had to cross the road in front of the automated and the manual vehicle, which were approaching from different sides. In the other, the manual vehicle had to drive through a bottleneck in front of the oncoming automated vehicle, while the pedestrian had to cross the road after both vehicles passed. The communication approach of the automated vehicle consisted of implicit signals using a speed profile and lateral offset within its lane, and explicit signals using an external human–machine interface. The results of the study show that no collisions were observed in terms of safety and no significant negative effects on efficiency were measured. However, in contrast to single agent interactions, a majority of participants felt wrongly addressed in situations where the automated vehicle signals the right-of-way to the other human road user. It can be concluded that the communication approach of the automated vehicle needs to be modified in order to address certain road users more clearly.",1369-8478,Not found
Revisiting the level-of-service framework for pedestrian comfortability: Velocity depicts more accurate perceived congestion than local density,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.007,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The evaluation of pedestrian comfortability is important for the construction and management of walkable spaces. Pedestrian level-of-service (LOS), which is mostly categorized by density, has been widely applied and is believed to be capable of indicating the comfortability of the crowd. However, there is a lack of evidence that physically measured LOS reflects psychological comfortability, let alone the comparison between the performances of different candidate indicators, including the velocity and different local densities. Here, we show that walking velocity depicts pedestrian perceived congestion more accurately than density. In our experiments on pedestrians in a room-egress scenario with an inner obstacle, we obtained objective physical trajectory data from video analysis as well as subjective perception data from a questionnaire survey. The performance of the velocity and four types of local densities in reproducing pedestrian perceptions were numerically evaluated. We found that the velocity outperformed the local density. The lower performance of local densities was mainly caused by the pedestrians located at the back of the crowd, who walked at lower velocities and perceived higher congestion, despite their lower local densities that would correspond to less crowdedness from a physical viewpoint. Besides, the perceived congestion of pedestrians was shown to be affected by the initial pedestrian positions at the crowd, the obstacle layout, and the pedestrians’ age and gender. Furthermore, we suggest that the larger the gap between the desired and actual velocities, the larger the extent of the perceived congestion. We expect that our findings will contribute to a more accurate evaluation of pedestrian comfortability, which could help improve the walkable spaces of various infrastructures.",1369-8478,Not found
Manual drivers’ experience and driving behavior in repeated interactions with automated Level 3 vehicles in mixed traffic on the highway,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.019,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"In the near future, conditionally automated vehicles (CAVs; SAE Level 3) will travel alongside manual drivers (≤ SAE level 2) in mixed traffic on the highway. It is yet unclear how manual drivers will react to these vehicles beyond first contact when they interact repeatedly with multiple CAVs on longer highway sections or even during entire highway trips. In a driving simulator study, we investigated the subjective experience and behavioral reactions of N = 51 manual drivers aged 22 to 74 years (M = 41.5 years, SD = 18.1, 22 female) to driving in mixed traffic in repeated interactions with first-generation Level 3 vehicles on four highway sections (each 35 km long), each of which included three typical speed limits (80 km/h, 100 km/h, 130 km/h) on German highways. Moreover, the highway sections differed regarding the penetration rate of CAVs in mixed traffic (within-subjects factor; 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%). The drivers were assigned to one of three experimental groups, in which the CAVs differed regarding their external marking, (1) status eHMI, (2) no eHMI, and (3) a control group without information about the mixed traffic. After each highway section, drivers rated perceived safety, comfort, and perceived efficiency. Drivers were also asked to estimate the penetration rate of CAVs on the previous highway section. In addition, we analyzed drivers’ average speed and their minimum time headways to lead vehicles for each speed zone (80 km/h, 100 km/h, 130 km/h) as well as the percentage of safety critical interactions with lead vehicles (< 1 s time headway). Results showed that manual drivers experienced driving in mixed traffic, on average, as more uncomfortable, less safe and less efficient than driving in manual traffic, but not as dangerous. A status eHMI helps manual drivers identify CAVs in mixed traffic, but the eHMI had no effect on manual drivers’ subjective ratings or driving behavior. Starting at a level of 25% Level 3 vehicles in mixed traffic, participants' average speed decreased significantly. At the same time, the percentage of safety critical interactions with lead vehicles increased with an increasing penetration rate of CAVs. Accordingly, additional measures may be necessary in order to at least keep the existing safety level of driving on the highway.",1369-8478,Not found
Does age matter?

The current study estimated differences in at-fault motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) between older drivers who had attended in the course and older drivers who had not attended the course. Methods Two samples of drivers were selected from the database of an insurance company and were sent a questionnaire in the mail. The first sample consisted of 2039 car owners aged 70 years or older who had reported a collision to the insurance company during the last 24 months. The second sample consisted of 1569 drivers aged 70 or older who had not reported any collisions during the last 24 months. Results The results indicated an age-dependent effect; drivers attending the course before 75 years of age had a significantly lower risk of being the at-fault driver in a multi-MVC than older drivers who did not attend the course. Conclusion The results indicate that the refresher course had a beneficial effect on collision risk for drivers who attended the course before reaching 75 years of age. One possible explanation of this age-dependent effect is that a certain level of visual, cognitive, and motor functioning is needed to implement the strategies learned in the course. However, the design of the study makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions about the causal relationship between course attendance and later collision involvement.",1369-8478,Not found
Impact of the driver's visual engagement on situation awareness and takeover quality,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.018,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"During automated driving (SAE Level 3), drivers can delegate control of the vehicle and monitoring of the road to an automated system. They may then devote themselves to tasks other than driving and gradually lose situational awareness (SA). This could result in difficulty in regaining control of the vehicle when the automated system requires it. In this simulator study, the level of SA was manipulated through the time spent performing a non-driving task (NDRT), which alternated with phases where the driver could monitor the driving scene, prior to a critical takeover request (TOR). The SA at the time of TOR, the visual behaviour after TOR, and the takeover quality were analysed. The results showed that monitoring the road just before the TOR allowed the development of limited perception of the driving situation, which only partially compensated for the lack of a consolidated mental model of the situation. The quality of the recovery, assessed through the number of collisions, was consistent with the level of development of SA. The analysis of visual behaviour showed that engagement in the non-driving task at the time of TOR induced a form of perseverance in consulting the interface where the task was displayed, to the detriment of checking the mirrors. These results underline the importance of helping the driver to restore good SA well in advance of a TOR.",1369-8478,Not found
Takeover performance of older drivers in automated driving: A review,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.015,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Introduction The introduction of automated vehicles to the road environment brings new challenges for older drivers. Level 3 of conditional automation requires drivers to take over control of their vehicle whenever the automated system reaches its limits. Even though autonomous vehicles may be of great benefit to older drivers in terms of safely maintaining their mobility, a better understanding of their takeover performance remains crucial. The objective of this review of the literature is to shed more light on the effects that aging has on takeover performance during automated driving. Methods Three database searches were conducted: PsychINFO, Web Of Sciences, and TRID. Studies from the last decade which included groups of older drivers were reviewed. Results After checking through abstracts and texts of articles, 9 articles, 4 proceedings papers, and 1 technical report were included in this review. All studies included a driving simulator that refers to level 3 of automation (which requires supervision by the driver). Five out of fourteen studies showed that older adults had poorer takeover performance (in terms of takeover time and takeover quality) than younger adults. However, several factors, such as the type of non-driving related task (NDRT), were seen to influence takeover performance in older adults. Speed, type and duration of notification interval, distribution and duration of driving modes, and number of takeovers were all also factors of influence. Conclusion This review synthesizes the results of 14 articles which investigate the effects of age-related changes on takeover performance. Various external factors as NDRTs, speed, type and duration of notification to take over, duration of the automated phase, distribution of the automated/manual phases may affect takeover performance in older adults. Even if the majority of articles showed that older adults are globally slower at taking over a vehicle than younger adults, findings concerning take over quality yield divergent results. It's probably due to age related cognitive changes, particularly in executive functions or to a great heterogeneity in this population. This literature review highlights the need to develop new research on the impact of aging on takeover performance.",1369-8478,Not found

However, the influence of the built environment (BE) on pedestrians’ perceptions of the walking environment has not been fully understood. To address this gap, the present research investigates how BE characteristics of a suburban walking environment are associated with the perceptions of attractiveness (i.e., pleasantness, friendliness), safety, and security. Using a cross-sectional design, 995 participants reported their perceptions about the attractiveness, safety, and security of different suburban BE scenarios in Brisbane (Australia). Univariate and bivariate random effect ordered probit models were estimated to identify the associations between BE characteristics and perceived attractiveness, safety, and security whilst controlling for psychosocial factors. Results indicated that perceived attractiveness (i.e., pleasantness and friendliness) was higher for recreational areas than residential land use. Women perceived the walking environment as more pleasant with trees. The perception of safety was higher for recreational and vacant land compared to residential areas. Young pedestrians perceived that the likelihood of being assaulted/robbed/harassed at night was lower if they walked through an area with commercial and mixed land use. Women pedestrians perceived that the corresponding risk at night was higher in recreational areas. Overall, the findings suggest that urban design strategies such as increasing land use diversity and providing adequate trees enhance perceived environmental attractiveness, safety, and security, ultimately resulting in more walking for transport.",1369-8478,Not found
Novel use of a virtual driving assessment to classify driver skill at the time of licensure,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.009,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Motor vehicle crash rates are highest immediately after licensure, and driver error is one of the leading causes. Yet, few studies have quantified driving skills at the time of licensure, making it difficult to identify at-risk drivers before independent driving. Using data from a virtual driving assessment implemented into the licensing workflow in Ohio, this study presents the first population-level study classifying degree of skill at the time of licensure and validating these against a measure of on-road performance: license exam outcomes. Principal component and cluster analysis of 33,249 virtual driving assessments identified 20 Skill Clusters that were then grouped into 4 major summary “Driving Classes”; i) No Issues (i.e. careful and skilled drivers); ii) Minor Issues (i.e. an average new driver with minor vehicle control skill deficits); iii) Major Issues (i.e. drivers with more control issues and who take more risks); and iv) Major Issues with Aggression (i.e. drivers with even more control issues and more reckless and risk-taking behavior). Category labels were determined based on patterns of VDA skill deficits alone (i.e. agnostic of the license examination outcome). These Skill Clusters and Driving Classes had different distributions by sex and age, reflecting age-related licensing policies (i.e. those under 18 and subject to GDL and driver education and training), and were differentially associated with subsequent performance on the on-road licensing examination (showing criterion validity). The No Issues and Minor Issues classes had lower than average odds of failing, and the other two more problematic Driving Classes had higher odds of failing. Thus, this study showed that license applicants can be classified based on their driving skills at the time of licensure. Future studies will validate these Skill Cluster classes in relation to their prediction of post-licensure crash outcomes.",1369-8478,Not found

Whilst increasing vehicle automation is argued to reduce road crashes via decreased driver involvement, automation also raises concerns around driver blame and stakeholder responsibility. This study examines blame for crash scenarios across four different forms of driver distraction behaviours (phone, sleep, work and driving under the influence), and across four levels of vehicle automation (no automation [manual], partially automated, highly automated, fully automated), using a mixed (qualitative and quantitative) methods approach. Participants (n = 205) were randomised into one of the four levels of vehicle automation and were presented with vignette crash scenarios involving a pedestrian being hit by a vehicle. Results revealed that scenarios varying driver behavior at the time of the crash, had no significant impact on participants’ blame attribution or selected course of action. The qualitative analysis revealed that despite semantic distinction between some driver behaviours, drivers were deemed responsible for the crash. As automation increased, attribution of blame towards the driver decreased, but did not disappear. Blame simultaneously increased towards other stakeholders including the manufacturer and the government, as level of automation increased. These findings mirror that of previous research and further highlight the need for legal frameworks for crashes with automated vehicles, irrespective of driver behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found
Safety at first sight? – Manual drivers’ experience and driving behavior at first contact with Level 3 vehicles in mixed traffic on the highway,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.004,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Soon, manual drivers will interact with conditionally automated vehicles (CAVs; SAE Level3) in a mixed traffic on highways. As of yet, it is largely unclear how manual drivers will perceive and react to this new type of vehicle. In a driving simulator study with N = 51 participants aged 20 to 71 years (22 female), we examined the experience and driving behavior of manual drivers at first contact with Level 3 vehicles in four realistic driving scenarios (highway entry, overtaking, merging, introduction of a speed limit) that Level 3 vehicles may handle alone once their operational domain extends beyond driving in congested traffic. We also investigated the effect of an external marking via a visual external human–machine interface (eHMI), with participants being randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (none, correct, incorrect marking). Participants experienced each driving scenario four times, twice with a human-driven vehicle (HDV), and twice with a CAV. After each interaction, participants rated perceived driving mode of the target vehicle as well as perceived safety and comfort. Minimum time headways between participants and target vehicles served as an indicator of safety criticality in the interactions. Results showed manual driver can distinguish CAVs from HDVs based on behavioral differences. In all driving scenarios, participants rated interactions with CAVs at least as safe as interactions with HDVs. The driving data analysis showed that manual driver interactions with CAVs were largely uncritical. However, the CAVs’ strict rule-compliance led to short time headways of following manual drivers in some cases. The eHMI used in this study neither affected the subjective ratings of the manual drivers nor their driving behavior in mixed traffic. Thus, the results do not support the use of eHMIs on the highway, at least not for the eHMI design used in this study.",1369-8478,Not found
An evaluation of the effectiveness of countermeasures for improving the safety of dilemma zones: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.013,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The main objective of this driving simulator study is to analyze the behavior of the driver at the start of the yellow signal of a signalized rural intersection and identify the most effective countermeasures for tackling the dilemma zone, namely an area on the intersection approach where vehicles at the start of the yellow phase can neither safely stop before the stop line nor cross the intersection. The following countermeasures were tested in the study on a sample of 48 drivers: green signal countdown timers, GSCT (C1); a new pattern of vertical and horizontal warning signs (C2); and an advanced on-board driver assistance system based on augmented reality (AR) and connected vehicle technologies (C3). These countermeasures were tested and compared to a baseline condition (B) where no countermeasures were applied. Based on the results of this study, the C2 and C3 countermeasures have proven to be valid tools for reducing driver indecision when approaching signalized intersections at the start of the yellow signal. In fact, using C2 and C3, the length of the dilemma zone was equal to 30 m and 36 m, respectively, with a reduction of about 50%, as compared to the baseline condition (B). Moreover, a reduced number of false behaviors was recorded, as well as a greater consistency in driver decision-making behaviors. Conversely, the C1 countermeasure did not lead to a significant improvement in the dilemma zone: an unnecessary increase in early stop rates was recorded, resulting in reduced intersection efficiency and operations.",1369-8478,Not found
Active vehicle pitch motion for communication in automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.011,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The number of automated vehicles (AVs) is expected to successively increase in the near future. This development has a considerable impact on the informal communication between AVs and pedestrians. Informal communication with the driver will become obsolete during the interaction with AVs. Literature suggests that external human machine interfaces (eHMIs) might substitute the communication between drivers and pedestrians. In the study, we additionally test a recently discussed type of communication in terms of artificial vehicle motion, namely active pitch motion, as an informal communication cue for AVs. N = 54 participants approached AVs in a virtual inner-city traffic environment. We explored the effect of three communication concepts: an artificial vehicle motion, namely active pitch motion, eHMI and the combination of both. Moreover, vehicle types (sports car, limousine, SUV) were varied. A mixed-method approach was applied to investigate the participantś crossing behavior and subjective safety feeling. Furthermore, eye movement parameters were recorded as indicators for mental workload. The results revealed that any communication concept drove beneficial effects on the crossing behavior. The participants crossed the road earlier when an active pitch motion was present, as this was interpreted as a stronger braking. Further, the eHMI and a combination of eHMI and active pitch motion had a positive effect on the crossing behavior. The active pitch motion showed no effect on the subjective safety feeling, while eHMI and the combination enhanced the pedestrianś safety feeling while crossing. The use of communication resulted in less mental workload, as evidenced by eye-tracking parameters. Variations of vehicle types did not result in significant main effects but revealed interactions between parameters. The active pitch motion revealed no learning. In contrast, it took participants several trials for the eHMI and the combination condition to affect their crossing behavior. To sum up, this study indicates that communication between AVs and pedestrians can benefit from the consideration of vehicle motion.",1369-8478,Not found

Thus, we explored the prevalence of three misconceptions: “AVs are already available in the market,” “AVs do not need to be driven manually at all,” and “Mature business models for AVs have been established.” We investigated these misconceptions’ correlations with several cognitive (i.e., benefit and risk perceptions), affective (i.e., positive and negative affect), and behavioral components (i.e., behavioral intention and willingness to pay) of attitudes and trust in AVs. Our online survey in China (N = 1,026) indicated that more than 70% of participants hold one or more of the three misconceptions, with one-third believing that AVs are already available in the market. Furthermore, participants believing one or more of the three misconceptions were more positive regarding specific attitudinal factors (e.g., those who believed that AVs are already available reported greater behavioral intention to use and willingness to pay for AVs than those who rejected this misbelief). This finding indicates that people who are more wrong about AVs might be more positive toward AVs. We need effective and accurate public communication to dispel public misconceptions about AVs and build rational expectations.",1369-8478,Not found
Parents’ self-efficacy and the quality of supervised driving practice they provide for their children,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.006,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Learner drivers must gain supervised driving practice in a wide variety of driving situations to prepare them for independent driving. This study investigated the way that sociodemographic factors, parental self-efficacy and driving self-efficacy of parents are associated with the quality of supervised driving practice they provide to their learner driver children. An online survey was completed by 293 fully licensed parents (female = 86%) of learner (52%) and provisional (intermediate; 48%) drivers from Queensland, Australia. A variable indicating quality of supervised practice was defined based on the understanding that higher frequency and greater variety of driving situations and environments represents higher quality supervised practice. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyse parent responses. As predicted, driving self-efficacy was significantly and positively associated with quality of supervised practice. However, no significant association was found between parental self-efficacy and quality of supervised practice. Parent gender and perceived level of involvement were also important predictors of supervised practice quality. The association between previous experience with providing supervised practice and supervised practice quality was unclear. A key implication of this research is that devising methods to improve the driving self-efficacy of parents may contribute to provision of more frequent and varied supervised practice.",1369-8478,Not found
User gesticulation inside an automated vehicle with external communication can cause confusion in pedestrians and a lower willingness to cross,10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.011,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Automated vehicles are expected to require some form of communication (e.g., via LED strip or display) with vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. However, the passenger inside the automated vehicle could perform gestures or motions which could potentially be interpreted by the pedestrian as contradictory to the outside communication of the car. To explore this conflict, we conducted an online experiment (N = 59) with different message types (no message, intention, command), gestures (no gesture, wave, stop), and user positions (driver, co-driver) and measured the pedestrian’s confidence in crossing. Our results show that certain combinations (e.g., car indicates cross while the user in the driver seat gestures stop) confused the pedestrian, resulting in significantly lower confidence to cross. We further show that designing intention-based external communication led to less confusion and a significantly higher intention to cross.",1369-8478,Not found
"Please stop now, automated vehicle! – Passengers aim to avoid risk experiences in interactions with a crossing vulnerable road user at an urban junction",10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.001,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The success of highly automated vehicles (HAVs; SAE Level 4) will depend to a large extent on how well they are accepted by their future passengers. This is especially true for the interaction of these vehicles with other human road users in mixed traffic. In future urban traffic, passengers of HAVs will observe from a passive position how the automated system resolves space-sharing conflicts with crossing vulnerable road users (VRUs; e.g., pedestrians and cyclists) at junctions. For one such crossing-paths conflict, we investigated when passengers would want the HAV to start braking and how much perceived risk passengers accept in the interaction of their vehicle with VRUs. To this end, we conducted 1) an online video study (N = 118), 2) a driving simulator study (N = 28), and 3) a human&vehicle-in-the-loop (Hu&ViL) study at a test site (N = 10). We varied the speed of the HAV (30 km/h vs. 50 km/h), the type (cyclist vs. pedestrian), and crossing direction of the VRU (left vs. right). During the approach to the junction, passengers' task was to trigger the HAV's braking maneuver, in a first trial at the point they considered ideal and in a second trial at the last point they still considered safe enough to decelerate and come to a stop at the stop line. For each braking maneuver, we analyzed the HAV’s distance and time-to-arrival (TTA) to the VRU at braking onset, as well as passengers’ perceived risk in the VRU interaction. The results showed that most passengers preferred harmless interactions with VRUs (at the ideal braking onset time), and accepted unpleasant, but not dangerous interactions at most (at the last acceptable braking onset time). Methodologically, the results were very similar in the three different environments (online, driving simulator, real vehicle). These results clearly show that, in addition to the technical considerations of safe automated driving, passengers’ perception and evaluation of HAV driving behavior should also be taken into account to achieve a satisfying level of acceptance of these vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Physiological indicators of driver workload during car-following scenarios and takeovers in highly automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.002,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This driving simulator study, conducted as a part of Horizon2020-funded L3Pilot project, investigated how different car-following situations affected driver workload, within the context of vehicle automation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA)-based physiological metrics were used as objective indicators of workload, along with self-reported workload ratings. A total of 32 drivers were divided into two equal groups, based on whether they engaged in a non-driving related task (NDRT) during automation (SAE Level 3) or monitored the drive (SAE Level 2). Drivers in both groups were exposed to two counterbalanced experimental drives, lasting ∼ 18 min each, of Short (0.5 s) and Long (1.5 s) Time Headway conditions during automated car-following (ACF), which was followed by a takeover that happened with or without a lead vehicle. Results showed that driver workload due to the NDRT was significantly higher than both monitoring the drive during ACF and manual car-following (MCF). Furthermore, the results indicated that a lead vehicle maintain a shorter THW can significantly increase driver workload during takeover scenarios, potentially affecting driver safety. This warrants further research into understanding safe time headway thresholds to be maintained by automated vehicles, without placing additional cognitive or attentional demands on the driver. Our results indicated that ECG and EDA signals are sensitive to variations in workload, which warrants further investigation on the value of combining these two signals to assess driver workload in real-time, to help future driver monitoring systems respond appropriately to the limitations of the driver, and predict their performance in the driving task, if and when they have to resume manual control of the vehicle after a period of automated driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Compensatory behaviour of visually impaired cyclists in everyday settings,10.1016/j.trf.2022.04.003,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This study investigated whether visually impaired cyclists, compared to cyclists without visual limitations, take other, potentially safer routes to destinations in their own living environment and whether they ride at a lower speed. In total, 19 matched pairs of a visually impaired cyclist and a normally sighted peer from the same neighbourhood recorded their everyday bicycle rides, using GPS action cameras. In addition, they completed an ‘assigned ride’, a ride for which only a starting and an ending point were provided by the researcher. A risk-assessment procedure showed that the route taken by visually impaired cyclists during this assigned ride was not less risky than the route taken by the normally sighted cyclists. Analysis of the everyday rides showed that, on average, cyclists with a visual impairment more frequently (i.e. for longer periods) cycled at a speed below 10 km/h compared to cyclists without visual impairment. Also, the visually impaired participants’ cruising speed was 1.4 km/h lower than that of their normally sighted counterparts. In conclusion, no evidence was found that visually impaired cyclists compensate strategically by taking different, potentially safer routes than normally sighted cyclists when riding in their own environment. They may (unconsciously) compensate tactically for their visual function limitations by riding at a lower speed when necessary. Mobility trainers in vision rehabilitation as well as road designers could apply these findings to optimise the cycling mobility of visually impaired people.",1369-8478,Not found
Eliciting attitudinal factors affecting the continuance use of E-scooters: An empirical study in Chicago,10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.019,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"As e-scooters become more popular, service providers and policymakers are seeking ways to retain the existing customers and encourage them to continue to use e-scooters in the future. In this study, we extend the concepts of the technology acceptance model to identify the factors that affect the intention to continue using e-scooters. We build our findings based on survey data including 2126 shared e-scooter users in Chicago. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, we analyzed the data and 10 proposed hypotheses. Our empirical results substantiate that the proposed model provides a theoretical framework to understand the continuance intention of shared e-scooter users. According to the findings, the most salient factor determining users’ decisions is perceived usefulness, followed by perceived reliability. The significance of reliability necessitates taking measures to guarantee the availability of e-scooters in times and places they are needed, particularly for mandatory trips. Additionally, social influence, perceived ease of use, variety seeking, and perceived enjoyment, are evinced to represent the other critical drivers of using e-scooter in the future, and in order of precedence. The insights from this study can assist shared e-scooter operators, transportation planners, and policymakers in making informed decisions and pave the way for a greater inclination to continue using shared e-scooters and move toward smart cities.",1369-8478,Not found
Human machine interface design for continuous support of mode awareness during automated driving: An online simulation,10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.020,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"In the transition towards higher levels of vehicle automation, one of the key concerns with regards to human factors is to avoid mode confusion, when drivers misinterpret the driving mode and therewith misjudge their own tasks and responsibility. To enhance mode awareness, a clear human centered Human Machine Interface (HMI) is essential. The HMI should support the driver tasks of both supervising the driving environment when needed and self-regulating their non-driving related activities (NDRAs). Such support may be provided by either presenting continuous information on automation reliability, from which the driver needs to infer what task is required, or by presenting continuous information on the currently required driving task and allowed NDRA directly. Additionally, it can be valuable to provide continuous information to support anticipation of upcoming changes in the automation mode and its associated reliability or required and allowed driver task(s). Information that could support anticipation includes the available time until a change in mode (i.e. time budget), information on the upcoming mode, and reasons for changing to the upcoming mode. The current work investigates the effects of communicating this potentially valuable information through HMI design. Participants received information from an HMI during simulated drives in a simulated car presented online (using Microsoft Teams) with an experimenter virtually accompanying and guiding each session. The HMI either communicated on automation reliability or on the driver task, and either included information supporting anticipation or did not include such information. Participants were thinking aloud during the simulated drives and reported on their experience and preferences afterwards. Anticipatory information supported understanding about upcoming changes without causing information overload or overreliance. Moreover, anticipatory information and information on automation reliability, and especially a combination of the two, best supported understandability and usability. Recommendations are provided for future work on facilitating supervision and NDRA self-regulation during automated driving through HMI design.",1369-8478,Not found
Analyzing driver's response to the yellow onset at signalized intersections,10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.016,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Intersections are critical points within the highway system at which the risk of crashes increases. This study seeks to better understand drivers’ behavior at an intersection by examining the relationship between their observed driving behavior, psychological attributes and decision to proceed through an intersection. A driving simulator and self-report questionnaire were used to understand driver decision-making at the onset of the yellow phase across several signalized intersections. The simulator measured driving outcomes such as speed, braking, and throttle as drivers cross through four increasingly difficult intersections. The questionnaires measured demographics, psychological traits including mindfulness and impulsiveness along with self-reported driving behaviors. A total of 102 participants completed the questionnaire as well as the driving simulator experiment. Hierarchical clustering served to classify drivers into four groups on the basis of their observed driving in the simulator: the safest drivers, safe drivers, speed demons, and aggressive drivers. These driving styles moderated the relationship between the drivers’ psychological traits and their decision to stop or proceed at each intersection. Results showed that mindfulness was highly related to the safest drivers’ decision to stop at the first intersection, while impulsiveness and anxiety were related to the speed demons’ decision to stop at the third intersection. These findings lay a strong foundation for developing progressive educational campaigns incorporating driver psychology in their methodology. Findings also provide support for research linking driving performance and psychological traits with implications for intersection design.",1369-8478,Not found
An eye-tracking study of the effects of dimensions of speed limit traffic signs on a mountain highway on driverś perception,10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.013,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Signs control and regulate traffic, anticipating potential dangers, prescribing correct behaviors, and disambiguating likely conflicts in priority. In Brazil, traffic accidents on highways located in mountain rural areas are mainly related to the design of roads and speeding, rather than to the impact of traffic flow. Since drivers highly depend on their visual perceptions for adopting driving behaviors, this study analyzes driver perception during a trip and the response of this parameter to changes in the diameter of vertical speed limit signs in a driver simulator equipped with an eye-tracking system. The objective was to investigate whether an increase in the plate size would enhance driver perception and influence drivers’ compliance with speed limits. Fifty-five volunteers were asked to drive twice on a 10-km mountain route, after which one of the diameters, namely 75, 100, 120, and 150 cm, used according to several Brazilian and American standards, was randomly chosen. The results showed the size of the traffic signs did not affect dependent variables number of fixations, percentage of perceived signals, time of observation, perception distance, and non-compliance with the speed limit. The most significant result was the relationship between speed variability and guided round, since the driver’s performance was improved with the distance along the studied stretch. The outcomes can be useful for the development of strategies that manage speeding on roads by improving and implementing low-cost interventions in low-income countries.",1369-8478,Not found
"An online hazard perception training course reduces heavy braking, speeding, and over-revving rates during everyday driving",10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.018,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"In essence, driver training involves learning the skills required to drive safely and avoid dangerous events. However, in traditional on-road driver instruction, drivers virtually never accrue experience of the most significant types of events that they are learning to avoid: crashes. One means of providing this experience safely is to present novice drivers with video clips of real crashes, as part of structured learning exercises. A six-week automated online hazard perception training course for drivers, incorporating evidence-based training methods and over a hundred crash clips, was previously found to improve novice drivers’ hazard perception skill, which is known to be an important attribute for avoiding crashes. However, since hazard perception was measured using computer-based methods, the possibility remained that the training effect might not transfer to actual driving. We report a randomized control trial in which novice drivers were recruited to assess everyday driving behaviour objectively, using g-force triggered dashcams and GPS trackers installed in their vehicles. On-road data were collected for a one-month baseline period, and for a further two months after half of the sample completed the hazard perception training course. Drivers who completed the course significantly reduced their rate of heavy-braking events, their speeding behaviour, and their rate of over-revving events. These findings support the proposal that a relatively inexpensive and highly scalable hazard perception training intervention can improve on-road driving behaviour, with the clear potential to impact real-world driver safety.",1369-8478,Not found

This area is under-researched in Australia, despite international research suggesting that most drivers experience some level of anxiety over driving. Objectives This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of driving anxiety by 1) confirming the factor structure of two questionnaires designed to understand the concerns (Driving Cognitions Questionnaire: DCQ) and avoidance behaviours (Driving and Riding Avoidance Scale: DRAS); 2) providing evidence of anxiety manifestations in Australian drivers, and 3) understanding whether these differ according to the initial onset of this anxiety. Methods A total of 1,600 people (77% females; age ranging from 18 to 89 [M = 27.92; ± 13.49], 75% licenced, 20% learning, 5% unlicenced) in Australia who identified as having “some” level of anxiety over driving, completed an online questionnaire regarding their anxiety. Results Confirmatory Factor Analyses showed the two-factor structure of the DRAS (general and traffic avoidance; and weather and riding avoidance) and the two-factor structure of the DCQ (crash-related concerns and social and panic related concerns) best fit the data. The most common anxiety onsets were crash involvement (14%), knowing someone who had been in a crash (9%) and due to criticism from others (9%). While no differences emerged between these groups on avoidance behaviour nor on crash concerns, social and panic concerns were higher for the criticism onset group. Conclusions The results demonstrate difference sources of anxiety and provide evidence of the importance of interactions with passengers in determining how a driver feels about the driving task. Practical implications Avenues for the reduction or avoidance of anxiety are proposed. These include better awareness and education for drivers regarding the importance of positive interactions and/or well as better journey management to avoid triggers of anxiety.",1369-8478,Not found
"A double-edged sword?

Further, it is not clear as to whether social media independently affects such behaviour, when accounting for the influence of mass media and peers. As a result, this study examined the relative influence of exposure to content that encourages phone use while driving via these three mediums in order to identify the most salient stimuli. A total of 509 participants (aged 17–88 years, M = 33, SD = 17) from the state of Queensland, Australia, were included in this study. Participants completed an online survey, which examined self-reported levels of exposure to material encouraging hand-held mobile phone use while driving from three sources: mass media (e.g., television, movies and gaming), social media, and peer behaviour (descriptive norms). Results indicated that participants on average engaged in illegal mobile phone use while driving 16% of the time they drive. Exposure to material encouraging phone use while driving was significantly higher from mass media (M = 32% of the time) and via peers (M = 30%) compared to social media (M = 27%). However, only social media and peer behaviour (the frequency with which participants believed that their peers engage in the behaviour) significantly predicted engagement in self-reported illegal mobile phone use, such that increasing levels of exposure were associated with more frequent use while driving. These findings: (a) support an emerging body of evidence indicating that both peer behaviours and social media messages are highly salient and influential and (b) are the first to suggest that such exposure might directly affect road safety. Nonetheless, further research is warranted to elucidate the nature and direction of the relationship between social media and driving behaviour, and the mechanisms through which such messages influence behaviour. Such lines of enquiry would have important implications for road safety (e.g., by informing the development of countermeasures/interventions delivered via social media).",1369-8478,Not found
Impact of time pressure on acceleration behavior and crossing decision at the onset of yellow signal,10.1016/j.trf.2022.03.014,87,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This study investigates acceleration behavior and crossing decision of the drivers under increasing time pressure driving conditions. A typical urban route was designed in a fixed-base driving simulator consisting of four signalized intersections with varying time to stop line (4 s and 6 s) and maneuver type (right-turn and go-through). 97 participants’ data were obtained under No Time Pressure (NTP), Low Time Pressure (LTP), and High Time Pressure (HTP) driving conditions. The acceleration behavior was examined at the onset of yellow signal in four ways: continuous deceleration, acceleration-deceleration, deceleration-acceleration, and continuous acceleration. A random forest model was used to build an acceleration behavior prediction model for identifying the significant explanatory variables based on variable importance ranking. Further, a Mixed Effects Multinomial Logit (MEML) model was developed using the explanatory variables obtained from a random forest model. Additionally, a generalized linear mixed model was incorporated for estimating the likelihood of crossing an intersection by considering all the explanatory variables. A MEML model result revealed that the odds of adopting acceleration-deceleration, deceleration-acceleration, and continuous acceleration instead of continuous deceleration increased by 63 %, 123 %, and 77 %, respectively under HTP driving conditions. Moreover, the likelihood of crossing a signalized intersection increased by 2.73 times and 4.26 times when the drivers were under LTP and HTP driving conditions, respectively as compared to NTP driving condition. Apart from this, time to stop line (reference: 6 s) and age showed negative association with crossing probability. Overall, the findings from this study revealed that drivers altered their acceleration behavior for executing risky driving decisions under increasing time pressure driving conditions.",1369-8478,Not found

The current study used simulated driving scenarios to determine how the type of navigation aid device used (i.e., paper map, electronic map, and AR system) affected driving performance and route learning of 62 driving adults. Route learning was examined at landmark, route, and survey levels. The hypotheses tested were that AR would improve driving performance but diminish route learning compared to paper map use; and that AR would outperform electronic map use in both driving performance and route learning. Results indicated that paper map use led to poorer driving performance and greater route learning. However, map recognition may have been a confounding factor in higher level spatial knowledge acquisition with paper map use. Driving performance and route learning were similar for drivers using the electronic map and AR, but some differences suggested that drivers have reduced uncertainty and hesitation while using AR to navigate in unfamiliar areas.",1369-8478,Not found
Why male adolescent bicyclists perform risky stunts? A qualitative study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.003,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Stunts are one of the main reasons for traffic accidents, particularly among male adolescent bicyclists (ABs). Nonetheless, there are limited data about the theoretical framework of its contributing factors. Moreover, the theoretical frameworks explaining the factors contributing to other risky behaviors have not been used in the area of risky bicycle stunts. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the factors contributing to risky stunts among male ABs in Iran. This qualitative study was conducted from September 2019 to December 2020 using conventional content analysis. Participants were 29 male ABs purposively selected from Isfahan, Iran. Data were collected through eighteen interviews with sixteen ABs and three focus group discussions with thirteen ABs. Data analysis was conducted concurrently with data collection through conventional qualitative content analysis. The mean of participants’ age was 16.4 ± 1.1 years. Factors contributing to their engagement in risky stunts were grouped into three main themes, namely predisposing personal factors (such as risk underestimation, perceived superiority, sensation seeking, emotional condition, and previous stunt-related experiences), reinforcing social factors (such as supportive social norms and weaknesses of traffic regulations), and environmental conditions (such as time conditions and structural factors). This study provides a new classification of the facilitators to risky stunts among male ABs and reveals new facilitators to these stunts, namely perceived superiority and police non-deterrent reactions to stunts. Therefore, programs on the improvement of safe bicycling should focus not only on perceptual and emotional factors and correction of false perceived superiority through education, but also on social norms and beliefs, regulations, and environmental factors.",1369-8478,Not found

The knowledge of how these values influence attitudes and behaviors specifically pertain to the environment is limited. Understanding individuals’ values and attitudes should be addressed in travel mode choice based on possible impacts of transportation on the environment. This study investigates the effect of cultural values on pro-environmental attitude and the influence of this attitude on travel mode choice in light of a hierarchical latent choice model. The model is estimated using data from a random sampling in CBD (Central Business District) of Tehran, Iran. The pro-environmental attitude, which is postulated to be affected by cultural values, is considered as the latent variable directly affecting travel mode choice. The cultural values drivers of pro-environmental attitude have been seen in a hierarchical structure. The estimated results show that hierarchical cultural tendency has the strongest and positive effect on being pro-environmental. Also, individualistic culture indicates a positive trend in being pro-environmental. On the other side, people with egalitarianism value tend to report an orientation towards pro-environmental attitude. Moreover, pro-environmental attitude increases the utility of public and active modes of transportation and a negative significant effect is found on the utility of private car and motorcycle.",1369-8478,Not found

Based on the findings from human-computer interaction (HCI) and time estimation theories, the potential may be affected by feedback frequency. This study tested how the feedback frequency of countdown progress bar in traffic light influenced time estimation in a field experiment, and further explored its mechanism in a laboratory experiment. In both experiments, participants estimated various durations (30 s, 45 s, 60 s) under three levels of feedback frequency: low (0.5 Hz), medium (1 Hz), and high (2 Hz). The results showed that although waiting time was underestimated in all conditions, lower feedback frequency led to shorter estimated duration, with slight changes in different contexts. In the traffic context, the effect of feedback frequency was comparable across different countdown duration, but it became stronger at longer countdown duration in the non-traffic context. Overall, the effect of feedback frequency was accompanied by changes in neither arousal level (measured by the subjective scale and physiological indices) nor internal clock speed, which are two critical determinants of time perception.

Interaction strategies with advanced driver assistance systems,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.013,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"When using advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) drivers need to calibrate their level of trust and interaction strategy to changes in the driving context and possible consequent reduction of system reliability (e.g. in harsh weather conditions). By investigating and identifying categories of drivers who choose inadequate interaction strategies, it is possible to address unsafe usage with e.g. tutoring lessons tailored to the respective driver category. This paper presents two studies investigating categories of drivers who apply different interaction strategies when using ADAS. Study I was designed as an exploratory field study with 37 participants interacting with a SAE level 2 system. For the exploratory study, it was important to observe and understand the interaction strategies in a driving context which entails the real complexity of the driving task. The experimental set-up of study II (simulator study), however, allowed to clearly interpret the interaction strategies as either calibrated or un-calibrated by varying the situational risk. Participants (N = 33) were driving in a situation where the system was either working reliably (low-risk condition) or in a situation where the system displayed repeatedly errors under harsh weather conditions (high-risk condition). Cluster analyses with the variables trust, monitoring behavior towards the system and usage behavior were performed to analyze potential categories of drivers. Extreme driver categories with interaction strategies indicative for both misuse and disuse were observed in both studies. In study I, drivers were categorized as either highly trusting attentive, moderately trusting attentive, moderately inattentive, inattentive or skeptical. In study II, drivers were categorized as either un-calibrated, calibrated, inconsistent or skeptical. Taken together, results underline the need of tutoring systems that are tailored for different driver categories.",1369-8478,Not found

The study had a mixed factorial design with automation being the between-participants factor with two levels, SAE Level 1 vs. SAE Level 3. Urgency (High vs Low) and Take-Over Mode (Manual, Automated Stop) were the within participants factors. Dependent variables were: i) Minimum Time-to-Collision (TTC), ii) Self-reported Situation Criticality and Perceived Safety and iii) Percentage of Gazes to [the] Road Centre. Overall, 36 participants took part, with half assigned to either level of the Automation factor. The automated driving experience was designed to fail during participation. This required the driver to take-over manual control or have the system bring the vehicle to an automated stop. Results revealed that during manual take-over of control, measures of time-to-collision, perceived criticality and safety were worse and fixations to the forward view increased when compared to the Automated stop condition. Manual take-over of control in a high-urgency situation revealed higher criticality (shorter time-to-collision and lower perceived safety) and more difficulty (increasing fixations to the road centre) than in a low-urgency situation.

The 53 participants ranged in driving experience from learners through to 5+years post licensing, and in age from 16 to 30 years. They viewed 14 day- and night-time video clips of a diverse range of driving situations, pausing the video whenever they identified a hazard and then explaining why they had paused it at that point. Their responses were recorded. Content analysis of responses showed that more experienced drivers reported visibility-related hazards significantly more often than inexperienced ones, and significantly more so at night. They also commented significantly more on hazards related to tight bends in the road and significantly less on hazards concerning compliance with rules. Comments tended to be fewer with higher vehicle speeds, particularly for the least experienced drivers. Results are discussed in terms of how experience-related differences in drivers’ cognitive schemata and mental models are likely to affect hazard perception and crash risk, particularly at night. Some implications for driver training and license testing are suggested.",1369-8478,Not found
The role of trait emotional intelligence in driving anger: The mediating effect of emotion regulation,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.024,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Emotions during driving have an essential impact on driving safety. This study aims to explore the relationships among emotional intelligence, emotional regulation, driving anger and related behaviour. A total of 304 drivers (aged 18–57) completed online questionnaires, including the trait emotional intelligence (TEI) scale, difficulties in emotional regulation scale (DERS), driving anger scale (DAS) and driver anger expression inventory (DAX). The results showed that the influence of TEI on maladaptive driving anger expression was negative, and individuals with higher emotional intelligence showed less maladaptive expressions of driving anger. Difficulties in emotion regulation played a mediating role between emotional intelligence and driving anger. These results suggest that drivers with high emotional intelligence and emotion regulation may face driving situations calmly and with a high level of driving safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Why people fail to bike the talk: Car dependence as a barrier to cycling,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.025,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Antecedent conditions of cycling have been extensively studied, yet barriers that prevent individuals from choosing bicycle transportation are less known. The present study, conducted on a sample of individuals who were both cyclists and drivers (N = 280), investigated whether dependence on car transportation significantly reduces cycling frequency. It also assessed the predictive validity of a larger set of cycling determinants that included moral, objective environmental, demographic and car-related variables. Responses were analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach. Results show that moral considerations do little to predict cycling frequency and that car-related factors such as perceived behavioral control to reduce car use (β = 0.28) and car use habits (β = -0.27) have the strongest predictive power. Objective environmental factors such as temperature (β = -0.13) and altitude (β = -0.15) or demographic factors such as gender (β = 0.19) were also significant predictors of cycling frequency. The present study highlights a new perspective of understanding cycling behavior and pleads for the inclusion of car-related factors in its future conceptualizations and interventions to encourage it.",1369-8478,Not found
Personality and demographic differences in the perceived risks of potentially timid driving behaviours,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.027,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Timid driving behaviours can be described as overly cautious and hesitant driving behaviours. Little research has examined behaviours that potentially resemble timid driving and how these behaviours are perceived by other drivers. This is despite the potential for these behaviours to be perceived in a way that leads to angry and aggressive retaliatory behaviours in some drivers (e.g., in anger-prone drivers). We conducted an online survey examining the perceived road safety risks of several behaviours that could potentially result from timid driving and their relationships with driver personality (trait anxiety, trait driving anger), behaviour (anxious driving, angry driving), and demographic (age, gender, annual mileage) background. Drivers (N = 439, Mage = 49.41 ± 5.59 years, aged 18–89) perceived excessively cautious and unpredictable braking behaviours as posing moderate levels of risk. Multiple linear regression analyses also indicated higher perceived risks of slow and excessively cautious behaviours in older, male, and anger prone drivers. No meaningful associations were found between driver characteristics and the risks of unpredictable braking behaviours. These results suggest that safety campaigns to reduce aggressive behaviour may benefit from targeting the perceptions of other drivers’ behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating the influence of approaching vehicles on pedestrian's visual patterns and crossing behaviors at an uncontrolled crosswalk,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.026,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The visual behaviors and movement characteristics of pedestrians are related to their surrounding potential safety hazards, such as approaching vehicles. This study primarily aimed to investigate the visual patterns and walking behaviors of pedestrians interacting with approaching vehicles. Field experiments were conducted at two uncontrolled crosswalks located at the Cuihua and Yanta roads in Xi’an, China. The visual performance of pedestrians was assessed using the eye tracking system from SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI). Moreover, motion trajectories of the pedestrians and approaching vehicles were obtained using an unmanned aerial vehicle. Subsequently, the visual attributes and movement trajectories of pedestrians and motion trajectories of approaching vehicles were statistically analyzed. The results showed that approaching vehicles distracted the fixation of crossing pedestrians significantly, and occupied 29.5% of the total duration of fixation; that is, pedestrians always directed more fixation points to the approaching vehicles compared to other stimuli. As a vehicle approached, pedestrians’ fixation shifted from other areas of interest to the vehicle. Moreover, an increase in the velocity of the vehicle and a closer distance between pedestrian and the vehicle resulted in an increase in the pedestrians’ duration of fixation on the approaching vehicle, and they implemented more saccades. Furthermore, approaching vehicle’s velocity and distance between pedestrian and approaching vehicle are not significantly associated with pedestrian’s movement attributes. These findings provide insights into the crossing behavior of pedestrians during pedestrian-vehicle interactions, which could assist future researchers and policy makers.",1369-8478,Not found
Insights into the effectiveness of messaging promoting intentions to use connected vehicle technology,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.018,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Connected vehicles offer considerable promise for reducing congestion, pollution, and crashes. Nonetheless, less than a third of road users are aware of the potential for connected vehicles to transform transport systems. This study examined the effectiveness of messaging aimed to increase the public’s knowledge of connected vehicle technologies using a short, animated video and its effects as assessed via a survey. Participants were assigned to either a control group, who were not exposed to the messaging, or an intervention group, who were exposed to the messaging, within a pre-post design. Participants (in the intervention group) answered questions about their knowledge of and experience with connected vehicle technologies prior to seeing the messaging and again following being exposed to such messaging together with their intentions to use these technologies in the future. As a theoretically informed investigation, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) constructs of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control were also measured. The results showed that the messaging increased knowledge about and intention to use connected vehicle technologies. Furthermore, changes in how the TPB constructs predicted intentions were found between the control and intervention groups which may help to explain how the messaging influenced participants’ intentions to use such technology in the future.",1369-8478,Not found
A method in modeling interactive pedestrian crossing and driver yielding decisions during their interactions at intersections,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.005,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Investigating pedestrian crossing and driver yielding decisions should be an important focus considering the high risks of pedestrians in exposed to motorized traffic. Limitations, however, exist in previous studies – variables considered previously have been limited; how their behavior affect each other (defined as interactive impacts) were not sufficiently considered. This paper aims to provide a methodological approach for pedestrian crossing and driver yielding decisions during their interactions, considering of different variable types including interactive impact variables, traffic condition variables, road design variables, and environment variables. A Distance-Velocity (DV) framework proposed in an earlier study is introduced for definitions and concepts in studying pedestrian-vehicle interactions. Logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks and random forests, are introduced as candidate models. A case study involving six crosswalk locations is conducted, focusing on interactions between pedestrians and right-turn vehicles. The proposed methodological approach is applied, with the performance of the four machine learning methods compared in terms of model generalization and confusion matrix. The model with the best performance is further compared to the typical gap-based model. Results show that random forest and logistic regression models performed the best in modeling pedestrian crossing and driver yielding decisions respective, in terms of model generalization. Besides, the DV-based modeling method (average accuracy of over 90% for pedestrians and 80% for drivers) outperformed the traditional gap-based method in all test seeds. As a key finding, interactive impacts from each other (the pedestrian and the driver) act as a key contributing variable on their decisions.",1369-8478,Not found
A scoping review of predictors of driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) in young drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.014,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Background Recreational and medical legalization of cannabis or marijuana use in countries and states continues to increase. Young adults aged 16–24 years have the highest prevalence rates of cannabis use. Young driver cannabis use is an incompletely understood traffic safety issue. Objectives The purposes of this scoping review were to characterize the predictors of driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) among healthy young drivers and to identify research gaps. Inclusion criteria A self-reported measure of DUIC and a correlation (r, odds ratio, risk ratio) to demographic or behavioral variables such as age, gender and frequency of use was required for inclusion Sources of evidence APA PsycInfo, SPORTDiscus, Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar, MEDLINE Complete, Scopus, Embase, ERIC, TRID and POPLINE databases were searched using an a priori protocol. Methods The PRISMA-ScR methods and checklist were used to conduct the scoping review. After the removal of duplicates, abstract screening (N = 999), and full-text review (N = 173), 19 primary studies met inclusion criteria. Predictors were coded and mapped into four primary thematic categories: social, individual, driving and substance use. Results Of the included studies, a total of 52,197 respondents were surveyed in-person or online and 51.8 percent were males. The predominant predictors of DUIC included being a male, high school senior, with lower grades, having a younger ‘age of first cannabis use’, a higher frequency of consumption, a reduced perception of danger, repeatedly binge drinking, a history of driving under the influence of alcohol and living with fewer parents. Research gaps Identified research gaps include methods used to study young drivers, cannabis edibles, chronic user tolerance, driver adaptation, passengers of drivers who consumed cannabis, combined use with other legal and illicit drugs, and combined smartphone and cannabis use. Conclusion The results of this scoping review can be used to develop and target general and specific predictors of DUIC in novice, teen and young drivers. Additional research designs will be required to gain a more complete evidence-based understanding of the effects of cannabis on young drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of widening longitudinal road markings on driving speed perception,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.021,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Road markings may influence driver behavior, and therefore road safety. An increase in the width of road markings might lead drivers to perceive lanes to be narrower than they really are, creating the illusion of traveling faster. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether wider longitudinal road markings can affect the perception of lane width and thus induce drivers to slow down. To this end, three curves with reduced visibility were selected for a field experiment. The road markings were painted wider than normal, and video recordings were made with narrow and wide markings by a camera installed in a vehicle. A total of 14 videos were shown to each of the 185 participants; then a survey was carried out to analyze in which video the participants perceived higher speed. The results showed that if the participants perceived differences in speed, the higher speed was perceived with the wide markings. This perception of higher speed increased if the participant was female, or if the participant had ever had an accident. In view of the obtained results, it can be said that the use of wider road markings could help reduce vehicle speed, thus contributing to improved road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
A factor analysis for identifying people with disabilities’ mobility issues in built environments,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.016,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Neighborhood built environments (BE) have been recognized as an important aspect that can, directly and indirectly, impact people with disabilities’ mobility. While many efforts have been made to improve the quality of BE, people with disabilities still perceive inequality in BE. The objective of this study is to identify the factors influencing people with disabilities’ attitudes toward BE that can facilitate or suppress their mobility, using exploratory factor analysis. This study specifically focuses on people with physical disabilities and people with visual impairments living in Austin, TX and Houston, TX metropolitan areas in USA. Data was gathered through an online survey. This study identified three factors from the sample: 1) barrier-free BE; 2) BE supporting safe travel; and 3) walkable BE. In addition, the factors were compared according to the respondents’ demographic information, such as income level, disability type, and private car use availability in households. Regarding income level, low-income individuals with disabilities perceived BE more negatively than their counterparts did. As for private car availability, people with disabilities who have no car in their households had a more negative perception of BE. However, no differences were found in the attitudes across disability types. This study contributes to understanding what BE factors are important for people with disabilities. The findings suggest the importance of establishing more targeted and prioritized strategies, considering people with disabilities’ neighborhoods and individual characteristics, for the improvement of their mobility.",1369-8478,Not found
Risky driving and lapses on the road: An exploration on self-regulatory dysfunction in Australian drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.006,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Self-regulatory ability has been linked to a) the tendency to engage in risky behaviours, and b) the ability to focus attention. This study investigated the relationships between metacognitions, emotion regulation difficulties, risky driving behaviours, and attentional lapses on the road, among an online sample of Australian drivers (N = 255). Firstly, group comparisons showed that although females reported greater self-regulatory dysfunction, males reported a higher frequency of risky driving behaviours. Alternatively, older drivers reported being better self-regulators, and less-frequent risky driving behaviours and attentional lapses on the road. Secondly, correlations demonstrated that metacognitions were associated with difficulties in regulating emotions, the engagement of risky driving behaviours, and the quantity of attentional lapses experienced on the road. Emotion regulation difficulties and risky driving behaviours were also shown to be positively related to the frequency of attentional lapses. Structural equation modelling confirmed a hierarchical model in predicting attentional lapses, with self-regulatory components representing higher-order factors over risky behavioural components. Finally, metacognitions demonstrated mediative effects toward the relationship between prior speeding experiences and future intentions to speed. This study has provided preliminary evidence for the application of metacognitions in the engagement of risky driving behaviours, and therefore the potential for informing future interventions.",1369-8478,Not found
Behavior model and guidance strategies of the crossing behavior at unsignalized intersections in the connected vehicle environment,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.008,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The connected vehicle environment is considered to be a disruptive technology that reconstructs the way people travel and road transport, and more importantly, ensures traffic safety. This study aims on investigating drivers’ interactive behavior at an unsignalized intersection in the connected vehicle environment. Specifically, a simplified iterative behavior model was established to predict the potential conflicting vehicles’ behavior. Furthermore, based on principles of safety, efficiency, and comfort, the guidance strategies were proposed to help the subject vehicles cross intersections. A multi-user driving simulator experiment was carried out and 48 participants were divided into 24 pairs to complete the test. The simplified iterative behavior model was constructed based on the dynamic interaction of each participant pair as they approached the intersection from straight-crossing directions. The comparison results showed the behavior model was an effective microscopic simulation tool for vehicles at unsignalized intersections with high accuracy and good applicability. Then, the guidance strategies under different compliance rates (baseline, 50 % compliance, 100% compliance) were evaluated based on three indexes i.e. standard deviation of speed (SDS), duration of crossing the intersection (DCI), and time exposed post-encroachment-time (TEP). The numerical simulation results showed that the guidance strategies could effectively improve the safety and efficiency of drivers crossing the intersection under both 50% and 100% compliance rates. Besides, with the increase of compliance rate, the comfort level also increased evidently. This study can provide theoretical and algorithmic references for microscopic simulation and guidance strategy at unsignalized intersections in the connected vehicle environment.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the effect of contextual factors on driving: An experimental study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.007,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Alongside human factors, contextual factors are believed to have an ongoing and complex impact on driving outcomes. However, how and to what extent the components of context influence driving outcomes (e.g. rule violations, crash, stress, fatigue) are far beyond full understanding. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of weather condition, lighting condition and traffic density on driving outcomes. Thirty-six volunteers were enrolled to participate into a driving simulator-based experiment. Each participant was required to complete twelve trials of simulated driving under different sets of scenarios. Driving outcome was measured by five dependent variables: frequency of speeding, frequency of lane deviations, number of correct sign recognition, completion time and workload. The results showed the frequency of speeding was significantly affected by weather condition, lighting condition and traffic density. Lighting condition had a significant effect on number of correct sign recognition. Weather condition, lighting condition and traffic density had significant effects on task completion time. Weather condition and lighting condition had significant effects on driver’s workload. The implications of the results could help traffic safety professionals better understand the risk factors that may lead to human errors during driving. Practically, countermeasures could be inspired and developed to mitigate the adverse impacts brought by driving context to minimum.",1369-8478,Not found

Adolescents' perceptions of school neighbourhood built environment for walking and cycling to school,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.011,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Walking is a more common transport mode to school than cycling among adolescents in many countries worldwide. Adolescents' and their parents' have different perceptions of walking versus cycling to school. This study compared adolescents' perceptions of school neighbourhood built environment characteristics for walking versus cycling to school. Adolescents familiar with their school neighbourhoods (n=411; age: 15.0 ± 1.2 years; male: 31.3%) from six secondary schools in Dunedin, New Zealand completed an online survey about their travel to school and perceptions of their school neighbourhood environments for walking and cycling to school. Overall, 32.8% of adolescents walked to school, and only 1.2% cycled. More adolescents reported sufficient footpaths than cycle paths (77.9% vs 42.3%) in their school neighbourhoods. Compared to walking, adolescents reported that their school neighbourhood environments provided less support for cycling to school, including fewer crossings/signals for cyclists versus pedestrians (52.8% vs 69.3%), fewer street lights (cycling vs walking; 57.9% vs 70.3%) and fewer destinations within easy cycling versus walking distance from their school (65.5% vs 50.4%) (all p<0.05). Active transport users perceived lower traffic volume, higher traffic speed, and fewer hilly streets along the walking and cycling routes to school than motorised and mixed transport users (all p<0.05).

The effect of age and sensation seeking on pedestrian crossing safety in a virtual reality street,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.010,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"A wide range of individual, interpersonal and environmental factors influence the safety of pedestrians crossing the street, including human development (children take more risks than adolescents and adults) and sensation seeking (individuals higher in sensation seeking have greater risk). The interaction between those two variables has not been carefully studied, however. Does the effect of sensation seeking on pedestrian safety vary across human development as cognitive and other skills improve? This study investigated the primary effects of age and sensation seeking, plus their joint effects, on pedestrian crossing in a virtual reality environment. 209 children (10–13 years old), adolescents (14–18 years old) and young adults (20–24 years old) screened to be high and low level in sensation seeking participated. A 3 (age group: child vs adolescent vs young adult) × 2 (sensation seeking: high vs low) × 2 (traffic condition: easy vs harder crossing) mixed factorial design was conducted. Three pedestrian safety outcomes – start delay, missed opportunities and dangerous crossings – were considered. Results showed that when the traffic condition was easier to cross within, the start delay to enter traffic gaps was significantly shorter for children than for adolescents and young adults. There were no significant differences across age groups when the traffic condition was harder to cross within. Pedestrians also missed more opportunities to cross the road when the traffic condition was harder to cross within. Pedestrians low in sensation seeking missed more opportunities to cross than those high in sensation seeking. All age groups had more dangerous crossings during the harder crossing scenario than in the easier one, and adolescents had more dangerous crossings than young adults or children. Finally, the results of hierarchical regression models predicting dangerous crossings showed that traffic condition had a significant predictive effect on children's dangerous crossing behavior, and both high sensation seeking and harder traffic conditions predicted adolescents’ dangerous crossing behavior. No included variables significantly predicted adults' dangerous crossing behavior. We conclude that both age and sensation-seeking contribute to pedestrian safety. The effect of sensation seeking does not vary widely by age group, but its effect on adolescents was somewhat stronger than in the other age groups studied.",1369-8478,Not found
Research on parking choice behavior of shared autonomous vehicle services by measuring users’ intention of usage,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.012,88,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are one of the important development directions of smart and green transportation. However, relevant researches are not sufficient at present. The factors influencing the intention to use SAVs and their parking choice behaviors need to be further analyzed. First, in order to better explain, predict, and improve travelers’ intention to use SAVs, the conceptual framework based on technology acceptance model was developed to establish the relationships between the travelers’ intention to use SAVs, social influence of SAVs, attitude toward behavior of SAVs, perceived risk of SAVs, perceived usefulness of SAVs and perceived ease of these use. Then structural equation model (SEM) was established to analyze the relationship between various variables. The results show that the perceived usefulness, behavior attitude, social influence, perceived ease of use, and perceived risk are the main factors that determine the intention to use SAVs. Through the test of direct effect, indirect effect, and total effect in the model, it is found that perceived usefulness has the largest total impact on intention to use SAVs, with a standardized coefficient of 0.765, followed by behavior attitude (0.732), social influence (0.597), perceived ease of use (0.462) and perceived risk of SAVs (−0.452). In addition, through the study of observed indicator variables ATB2 and BI3, it is found that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, perceived risk, attitude toward behavior, and behavior intention all have an impact on parking behavior. In order to study the specific influencing factors of parking choice behavior, a multinomial logit (MNL) model was established to analyze the relationships between travelers’ parking choice behaviors and the influential factors, which include travelers’ individual characteristics, travel attributes, and parking modes’ attributes by extracting from a questionnaire.

Considerable research has been conducted on the TOR, especially in terms of the effectiveness of multimodal methods. Therefore, in this study, the effectiveness of various multimodalities was compared and analyzed. Thirty-six volunteers were recruited to compare the effects of the multimodalities, and vehicle and physiological data were obtained using a driving simulator. Eight combinations of TOR warnings, including those implemented through LED lights on the A-pillar, earcon, speech message, or vibrations in the back support and seat pan, were analyzed to clarify the corresponding effects. When the LED lights were implemented on the A-pillar, the driver reaction was faster (p = 0.022) and steering deviation was larger (p = 0.024) than those in the case in which no LED lights were implemented. The speech message resulted in a larger steering deviation than that in the case of the earcon (p = 0.044). When vibrations were provided through the haptic seat, the reaction time (p < 0.001) was faster, and the steering deviation (p = 0.001) was larger in the presence of vibrations in the haptic seat than no vibration. An interaction effect was noted between the visual and auditory modalities; notably, the earcon resulted in a small steering deviation and skin conductance response amplitude (SCR amplitude) when implemented with LED lights on the A-pillar, whereas the speech message led to a small steering deviation and SCR amplitude without the LED lights. In the design of a multimodal warning to be used to issue a TOR, the effects of each individual modality and corresponding interaction effects must be considered. These effects must be evaluated through application to various takeover situations.",1369-8478,Not found
The relationship between simulator sickness and driving performance in a high-fidelity simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.015,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Driving simulators are highly valuable tools for various applications such as research, training, and rehabilitation. However, they are also known to cause simulator sickness, a special form of traditional motion sickness. Common side effects of simulator sickness include nausea, headache, dizziness, eye-strain, and/or disorientation, all symptoms which may negatively impact driving performance. The goal of the present study was to investigate the relationship between simulator sickness and driving performance obtained in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Twenty-one healthy participants were engaged in a simulated driving task containing rural, city, and highway sections for approx. 25 min. Participants were asked to drive naturally while obeying traffic rules and completing common driving maneuvers (including reactions to sudden events). Driving performance was evaluated based on various driving measures, such as lane positioning, speed measures, following distance, or the number of steering reversals. Simulator sickness was measured before, during, and after the simulated drive using a combination of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and the Fast Motion Sickness scale. Overall, correlations between the level of simulator sickness and driving performance measures were low to moderate (r’s from -0.37 to 0.40) and were not significant. Additionally, participants who reported higher levels of simulator sickness did not differ with regards to their driving performance from those who reported lower simulator sickness scores. Our results suggest that the presence of simulator sickness is not strongly related to performance in a driving simulator.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessment of data glasses for motorcycle riders in a simulated lane change test,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.016,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Relevant riding information such as speed or navigation instructions are typically displayed in head down dashboards on Powered Two-Wheelers. Data glasses provide information directly in the field of view and could, therefore, reduce glances away from the roadway ahead to focus on the dashboard. This study aimed to examine whether providing information in data glasses while riding as compared to classical head down displays makes a difference. Therefore, a total of N = 24 riders completed the ISO lane change test on a motorcycle riding simulator. Meanwhile, riders had to react to changing turn-by-turn indications which were either displayed in the dashboard, in the data glasses or redundantly in both display technologies. The performance in the lane change test and the reaction times achieved in the secondary task were examined along with riders’ workload by means of the Detection Response Task (DRT) and questionnaire data. Results revealed that riders’ lane change performances did not differ between the conditions ‘data glasses’ and ‘dashboard’. Information displayed in the data glasses was recognized faster and fewer turn-by-turn indications were missed. The performance in the DRT remained unchanged throughout the test conditions, while the subjective workload experience decreased with the use of data glasses. Overall, the results suggest that data glasses did not provoke an attentional capture effect and were, therefore, not inferior compared to dashboards regarding riding performance. However, data glasses did reduce the perceived workload and may in particular provide a safety benefit when time-critical information, such as warnings, need to be displayed.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating explanations in conditional and highly automated driving: The effects of situation awareness and modality,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.010,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"With the level of automation increases in vehicles, such as conditional and highly automated vehicles (AVs), drivers are becoming increasingly out of the control loop, especially in unexpected driving scenarios. Although it might be not necessary to require the drivers to intervene on most occasions, it is still important to improve drivers’ situation awareness (SA) in unexpected driving scenarios to improve their trust in and acceptance of AVs. In this study, we conceptualized SA at the levels of perception (SA L1), comprehension (SA L2), and projection (SA L3), and proposed an SA level-based explanation framework based on explainable AI. Then, we examined the effects of these explanations and their modalities on drivers’ situational trust, cognitive workload, as well as explanation satisfaction. A three (SA levels: SA L1, SA L2 and SA L3) by two (explanation modalities: visual, visual + audio) between-subjects experiment was conducted with 340 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results indicated that by designing the explanations using the proposed SA-based framework, participants could redirect their attention to the important objects in the traffic and understand their meaning for the AV system. This improved their SA and filled the gap of understanding the correspondence of AV’s behavior in the particular situations which also increased their situational trust in AV. The results showed that participants reported the highest trust with SA L2 explanations, although the mental workload was assessed higher in this level. The results also provided insights into the relationship between the amount of information in explanations and modalities, showing that participants were more satisfied with visual-only explanations in the SA L1 and SA L2 conditions and were more satisfied with visual and auditory explanations in the SA L3 condition. Finally, we found that the cognitive workload was also higher in SA L2, possibly because the participants were actively interpreting the results, consistent with a higher level of situational trust. These findings demonstrated that properly designed explanations, based on our proposed SA-based framework, had significant implications for explaining AV behavior in conditional and highly automated driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Research on the transition marking between the broken line and solid line of expressway,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.011,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Drivers often cross the solid line unintentionally during the lane-changing, when the sight distance is blocked by the vehicle ahead. There are significant potential risks to change lanes in solid line area, which would cause traffic flow disruption and traffic safety hazards. If the drivers with limited sight distance can be reminded in advance that the lane marking ahead is a solid line, many drivers will refrain from changing lanes in the restricted area, therefore, it is important to help the drivers with limited sight distance to obtain the information of lane marking ahead. There is limited research on this specific issue presently, nor any relevant regulations or manuals available in China. This paper puts forward a novel concept of transition marking, and a creative approach by adding the transition marking between the broken line and the solid line. The transition marking is considered an information carrier to predict the pass-through right of the road ahead. We have studied the form and length of the transition marking and evaluated its effectiveness through the driving simulation experiment. The form analysis shows that the white mutation broken line has better visibility and legibility. The transition marking length is shown to be closely related to the vehicle speed and distance. The simulation results indicate that the transition marking length is negatively correlated with vehicle distance and positively correlated with speed. Based on the simulation results and detailed statistical analysis, the reference value of transition marking length is proposed. The effectiveness evaluation demonstrates that the transition marking reduces the probability of solid-line crossing during lane-changing dramatically by 92%.",1369-8478,Not found
Teenage bicyclists' perceptions toward automated vehicles and their associated traffic infrastructure: A focus group discussion,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.006,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Automated vehicles (AVs) can improve traffic safety for vulnerable road-users like bicyclists. It is most likely that current young people will be the ones to use these vehicles and interact with them. However, very few studies have focused on bicyclist-AV interaction, with little to no inclusion of teenage bicyclists. This research used a virtual focus group study with 25 teenage bicyclists in six groups. Participants were presented with potential designs of infrastructures and communicating interfaces, they discussed pros and cons for each design, and answered multiple surveys. Overall, teenage bicyclists showed positive perceptions toward AVs. They preferred spacious lanes for bicyclists and physical barriers separating AVs and bicyclists. Teenagers chose visual interfaces with familiar icons; nevertheless, they recommended both visual and audible interfaces to ensure bicyclists’ attention and address the need of visually and audibly impaired populations. Future researchers and stakeholders will be benefited from the methodology and outcomes of this research.",1369-8478,Not found
Aging and sleep deprivation affect different neurocognitive stages of spatial information processing during a virtual driving task – An ERP study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.001,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"We have previously shown that aging deteriorates detection of spatial visual and auditory stimuli and prolongs reaction times measured during a virtual driving task. Sleep deprivation affected the young more than the old. Here we determined the effects of age and sleep deprivation on ERPs elicited by spatial visual and auditory stimuli during virtual driving. Participants were 22 young (18–35 years) and 19 old (65–79) healthy males. Experiments were run in normal daytime condition and after a night of sleep deprivation. Aging shortened the peak latencies of the early P1 and N1 but increased the P3 latency. Sleep deprivation slowed down and diminished the N1 peaks of the young. General right-side preference was seen in latencies. Thus, the effects of aging could be seen in decision making and working memory related processes (P3), whereas those of sleep deprivation could be found in alerting and orienting functions (N1) in the young.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating driver reactions to movements of autonomous vehicle in permitted right turn through driving simulator experiments,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.018,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Traffic safety has always been a hot topic for human-driven (HDV) and autonomous vehicles (AV) mixed flow. The conflict between permitted right-turn vehicles (PRT) and opposing through vehicles (TH) at signalized intersections (left-handed traffic) is extraordinarily critical. AVs with aggressive behaviors are able to accept short gap time without losing safety. However, such a turning maneuver may lead to dangerous feelings and cause unexpected reactions of approaching drivers. This study aims to investigate and model drivers’ reactions in TH movements to PRT AVs considering the trust degree of drivers to AVs. Questionnaire surveys and driving simulator experiments were conducted for 41 participants. Results reveal that the right turn timing of PRT AV will significantly influence drivers’ reactions. Basically, TH drivers will brake with a high probability under the situation of small expected post encroachment time (PET). It is also found that female drivers and drivers with low trust in AVs are more vigilant to PRT AVs than other drivers. Based on this finding a two-layer model for reproducing TH drivers’ reactions to PRT AVs is proposed. The first layer is to determine the braking decision and the second layer is to calculate the parameters of braking behaviors (brake lag, braking time, and speed drop). The significance and coefficients variables in these models proved that the trust in AV will influence drivers’ decisions and braking behaviors (brake lag and braking time). The more the drivers trust AVs, the smaller the expected PET to AVs they can accept for passing without braking, and the more gently they will brake (longer brake lag and shorter braking time) due to the cutting in of PRT AVs. This effect will become significant after drivers have experienced several interactions with AVs.",1369-8478,Not found
Measuring data sharing intention and its association with the acceptance of connected vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.014,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Transportation agencies and researchers are optimistic about the potential use of data collected from connected vehicles (CVs) for a variety of traffic and transportation applications. However, the literature lacks the evaluation of data sharing intention of the public for CV applications and its relationship with CV acceptance. This study investigated this gap by conducting a questionnaire survey of 2400 US adults. The results showed that the intention to share CV data depends upon the use of data but not the type of data. The possible uses of CV data were found to be grouped under four categories: driver information, congestion assessment and reduction, and pavement and infrastructure assessment and improvement (ICP); enforcement of traffic rules and fees based on usage (EF); roadside assistance and crash investigation (RC); and research purposes (RP). The data sharing intention for these four data uses vary, though with some commonality, which reflects the overall data sharing intention in CV technology (CVT). In addition, it was found that data privacy and security issues of CVT lower the data sharing intention and CV acceptance. Thus, a number of ways to improve CV acceptance by minimizing the data issues of CVT are discussed. Significant differences in perception of data privacy and security, data sharing intention, and CV acceptance were observed for individuals of different socio-economic and driving-related characteristics.",1369-8478,Not found

The research is based on online data collection (n = 646) and applies Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modelling.

On-road trust and perceived risk in Level 2 automation,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.008,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"To encourage appropriate use of driving automation, we need to understand and monitor driver’s trust and risk perception. We examined (1) how trust and perceived risk are affected by automation, driving conditions and experience and (2) how well perceived risk can be inferred from behaviour and physiology at three levels: over traffic conditions, aggregated risk events, and individual risk events. 30 users with and without automation experience drove a Toyota Corolla with driving support. Safety attitude, subjective ratings, behaviour and physiology were examined. Driving support encouraged a positive safety attitude and active driver involvement. It reduced latent hazards while maintaining saliently perceived risks. Drivers frequently overruled lane centring (3.1 times/minute) and kept their feet on or above the pedals using ACC (65.8% of time). They comfortably used support on curvy motorways and monotonic and congested highways but less in unstable traffic and on roundabouts. They trusted the automation 65.4%, perceived 36.0% risk, acknowledged the need to monitor and would not engage in more secondary tasks than during manual driving. Trust-in situation reduced 2.0% when using automation. It was 8.2% higher than trust-in-automation, presumably due to driver self-confidence. Driving conditions or conflicts between driver and automation did not affect trust-in-automation. At the traffic condition level, physiology showed weak and partially counter-intuitive effects. For aggregated risk events, skin conductance had the clearest response but was discernible from baseline in < 50%. Pupil dilation and heart rate only increased with strong braking and active lane departure assist. For individual risk events, a CNN classifier could not identify risk events from physiology. We conclude that GSR, heart rate and pupil dilation respond to perceived risk, but lack specificity to monitor it on individual events.",1369-8478,Not found
Cars overtaking cyclists on different urban road types – Expectations about passing safety are not aligned with observed passing distances,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.005,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Cars overtaking cyclists have been identified as a source of crashes and subjective risk. Several studies investigated the passing distance for different road types. There has been less research concerning cyclists’ expectations concerning the passing distance at different road types. Thus, we aim at contrasting cyclists’ expectations about the passing safety for different speed limits and cycling infrastructures with the passing distances observed at corresponding urban road types. For this purpose, we show participants images of a predefined set of survey zones in a web-based survey, and ask them about the expected passing safety of cars overtaking them when imagining riding their bikes at these locations. We measure the observed passing distances at the same survey zones with a bike-mounted sensor. We find that cars meet the German legal minimum passing distance of 1.5 m in towns in only 30% of all observed events. In 30 km/h speed zones, passing distances at roads featuring dedicated cycling infrastructure (e.g. bike lanes, cycling boulevards) are decreased as compared to those featuring no cycling infrastructure. In contrast, people estimate that the passing safety on roads with dedicated cycling infrastructure is safer than without cycling infrastructure. This effect is even more pronounced on living streets. Situations where oncoming cars (e.g. living streets, ‘opposite’ roads) must be passed in close distance are apparently not perceived as particularly dangerous. Cycling tracks in 50 km/h speed zones increase both the observed passing distance and the corresponding expectations about passing safety. Taken together, the qualitative comparison of the two datasets implies that cyclists’ expectations about cars passing them in a more adequate and safe distance in streets with reduced speed limits and dedicated cycling infrastructure are not justified in light of the actually observed passing distances. Possible explanations for the contradicting patterns could be that cyclists prefer situations where space is explicitly dedicated for bikes, that they account for the anticipated car traffic volume, and that they assume oncoming cars as less dangerous to pass.",1369-8478,Not found
Traffic safety in bus transport: An analysis of Norway's largest transit authority's contract requirements to bus companies,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.004,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The main objective of the study is to evaluate direct and indirect traffic safety consequences of the requirements that Norway’s largest transit authority (Ruter) sets in the contracts with bus companies. To assess the representativity of Ruter’s requirements and its consequences, the data focuses both on Ruter and transit authorities from other areas in Norway, serving a mix of urban and rural areas. The study is based on qualitative interviews (N = 18), a workshop, reviews of documents and a quantitative survey (N = 1012). The study indicates that transit authorities may have direct influence on traffic safety, especially if they set requirements that exceeds (inter) national legislation. Ruter does that when it comes to driver collision protection and blind zone warning systems. We also find indications of indirect impact on traffic safety through the contracts. This is firstly related to the requirements for punctuality and regularity, which we find to be related to drivers’ stress, driving style and accident involvement in our quantitative analysis. It is secondly related to environmental concerns, which motivate maintaining (and increasing) a high level of passengers. Interviewees said that this influences the types of buses specified in contracts (e.g. large high capacity buses), and their routes (e.g. in narrow streets, “where people live”). They also emphasized that roads and infrastructure, for example in Oslo, are poorly adapted to bus transport. In our quantitative analysis, we found that buses that are poorly adapted to the roads they are used on, and roads that are poorly adapted to bus transport were related to bus drivers’ reported stress and time pressure, which were related to risky driving style, which in turn was related to accidents. Based on the study, we developed several policy implications, that we believe also can be relevant for, and inspire other transit authorities. Ruter has applied several of these changes after our study (e.g. requiring ISO:39001 certification from the bus operators in the contracts, starting to develop a system to learn from accidents), and may thus stand out as a transit authority that other may learn from when it comes to management of traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Self-regulation and tailgating behaviours among young drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.007,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Young drivers aged 17 to 25 years are overrepresented in road crash fatalities globally. In Queensland, Australia, tailgating is an illegal behaviour that has been attributed to at least 8,000 rear-end crashes per year. Notably, it has been found that young drivers tailgate more frequently than older drivers. This study utilised self-determination theory to understand self-regulation behind tailgating among young drivers. This theory has yet to be applied to understand tailgating but has been successful in understanding other risky driving behaviours, suggesting self-determination theory may have predictive utility in explaining tailgating. Participants (n = 609) aged 17 to 25 years (M age = 20.61 years) completed an anonymous online survey measuring engagement in tailgating, external and internal regulation, trait self-regulation, and aggressive driving. Results indicated that young drivers less influenced by legal and non-legal sanctions are likely to engage in tailgating more frequently (lower external regulation). Young drivers influenced by safe driving values were less likely to engage in tailgating (greater internal regulation). Poorer trait self-regulation and higher measures of aggressive driving were predictors of more frequent tailgating in young drivers. The results support the development of informative campaigns centred on the self-determination theory with the aim of educating young drivers on the implications of tailgating and safe following distances.",1369-8478,Not found
"Effects of mode distinction, user visibility, and vehicle appearance on mode confusion when interacting with highly automated vehicles",10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.020,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Automated vehicles are expected to communicate with pedestrians at least during the introductory phase, for example, via LED strips, displays, or loudspeakers.

To evaluate potential solutions to this problem, we conducted an online video-based within-subjects experiment (N = 59). The solutions under evaluation were mode distinction, vehicle appearance, and the visibility of the passenger via a tintable windshield. Our results show that especially the mode distinction and the conspicuous sensor attached to the automated vehicle showed positive effects. A tintable windshield, however, was negatively assessed. Thus, our work helps to design eHMI concepts to introduce automated vehicles safely by informing about feasible methods to avoid mode confusion.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of personality on driving behaviors among professional truck drivers: The mediating effect of safety climate,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.003,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Introduction: The number of traffic accidents involving truck drivers remains high, and strategies to eliminate the probability of such accidents have been proposed, among which enhancing the safety climate has attracted much interest. The main purpose of the current study was to validate the Chinese version of the safety climate scale for truck drivers and apply it to investigate the mediating effect of safety climate between truck driver personality and driving behavior. Method: A total of 389 male truck drivers completed the Big Five Inventory, the Chinese version of the trucking safety climate scale, the driver behavior questionnaire and the positive driver behavior scale. Results: The reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the organization-level safety climate scale and the group-level safety climate scale were confirmed through factor analysis. More importantly, a path analysis revealed that the organization-level safety climate mediated the effects of agreeableness and neuroticism on aggressive violations, ordinary violations and lapses, while the group-level safety climate mediated the influences of agreeableness, neuroticism and openness on positive behavior and all four kinds of aberrant driving behaviors. Conclusions: This study introduced the trucking safety climate scale into China and stressed the significance of improving both the organizational and the group levels of safety climate to reduce accidents involving professional truck drivers. Practical Applications: First, the adapted safety climate scale for Chinese truck drivers contributes to further investigating the role that safety climate plays in the safety problem of truck drivers in China. Moreover, the critical impacts of both levels of the trucking safety climate serve as reminders for relevant companies to not only pay attention to establishing an organization-level safety climate but also invest more effort into promoting the group-level safety climate.",1369-8478,Not found
Estimating effectiveness of speed reduction measures for pedestrian crossing treatments using an empirically supported speed choice modeling framework,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.002,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Pedestrian crossing treatments, such as Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons (PHBs) and Rectangular Rapid-Flashing Beacons (RRFBs), are traffic control devices implemented to help pedestrians safely cross busy or higher-speed roadways at midblock crossings and uncontrolled intersections. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the PHB and RRFB by analyzing drivers’ speeding behavior under different roadway types with real-life traffic conditions. In order to understand the effect of pedestrian crossing treatments (i.e., PHB and RRFB) have on drivers’ speeding behavior, this paper analyzes four zones (i.e., one upstream zone and three consecutive downstream zones). For the four analysis zones, different indexes were computed which corresponds to the differences in drivers’ speed when encountered with the pedestrian crossing treatments. A grouped random effect hurdle beta regression model is estimated for the indexes, with a fixed effect hurdle beta model used for comparison and validating the importance of considering the grouped random heterogeneity across participants. The proposed analysis framework was validated by the means of an empirical driving simulator study, based on two urban roads in the Central Florida region, North Alafaya Trail (SR-434) and South Orange Blossom Trail (US-441). The results revealed that the proposed modeling framework reflects drivers’ difference in speed for the different pedestrian crossing treatments. The results suggest that with proper understanding of the PHB, the PHB can reduce drivers speed even beyond the location of the PHB. Meanwhile, the RRFB does have some effect in speed reduction beyond the location of the RRFB, however many drivers failed to acknowledge the RRFB. It is suggested that when drivers’ have proper education on the use of the PHB to reduce speed safely and for the installation of RRFB be on roads with two or less lanes and a speed limit less than 40 mph. While the main purpose of the pedestrian crossing treatments is to help pedestrians cross safely, speed reduction can be considered a byproduct as revealed in this study.",1369-8478,Not found
Associations between personality and driving behavior are mediated by mind-wandering tendency: A cross-national comparison of Australian and Italian drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.019,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Objective This study examined the associations between personality traits (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and aberrant driving behaviors in a sample of Australian and Italian drivers by investigating the mediation effect of mind-wandering (MW) tendency. Background Although unsafe driving behaviors are influenced by both a driver’s MW tendency and personality traits, the potential interaction between these variables and their association with aberrant driving behaviors has not been previously investigated. Method Nine-hundred and four active drivers (n = 452 Australians, n = 452 Italians) completed an online survey related to their self-reported personality traits, driving behaviors, and MW tendency. Results A multi-group path analysis showed that MW tendency significantly mediated the effects of neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness on aberrant driving behavior with invariances across nationality groups. Conclusion These results suggest that the association between personality traits and aberrant driving behaviors is partially explained by a driver’s MW tendency while driving. Further research is needed to understand these relationships using objective measures of MW while driving (e.g., the probe-caught method). The findings of this study suggest that the assessment of personality traits may have important implications for inattentive and distracted driving and fitness-to-drive evaluation purposes.",1369-8478,Not found

Together with user acceptance, potential advantages and disadvantages that CAVs may bring at a societal level were explored. Results show that benefits like increased safety and accessibility and improved travel experience for both driver and passengers could support CAVs’ deployment. Nevertheless, a variety of concerns were raised during the discussions, related to privacy, responsibility in case of an accident, and increase in maintenance and repair costs. These aspects could significantly hamper or delay CAVs acceptability and need to be carefully considered by stakeholders.

Risky and anxious-aggressive drivers: A key barrier to traffic safety legislation in Germany,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.005,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Traffic safety is high on the agenda of European governments. Yet, countries including Germany maintain policies that are commonly identified as increasing traffic risks, such as speed limits set too high or trends of greater car motorization and mass. To better understand some of the interrelationships of driver characteristics and car segments, this paper identifies different groups of drivers, based on a representative sample of German automobilists (n = 1211). Psychological instruments used to identify driver segments include the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI), and the HEXACO Personality Inventory. Based on k-means clustering, we identified four distinct groups: Risky drivers, Showy anxious-aggressive drivers, Anxious drivers and Calm drivers. Questions focused on socio-demographics, political orientation, and traffic laws are used to describe these psychographic segments. Findings suggest that Risky and Showy anxious-aggressive drivers represent a greater threat to traffic safety than other driver segments for different reasons: they drive more powerful and larger cars, deliberately violate traffic laws – creating unsafe traffic conditions for others –, and oppose legislation making traffic safer, while also voting for parties holding on to the status quo. As their political choices appear dominated by automobile interests, there are widespread implications for society.",1369-8478,Not found
Why would people want to travel more with automated cars?,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.014,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The use of automated vehicles (AVs) may enable drivers to focus on non-driving related activities while travelling and reduce the unwanted efforts of the driving task. This is expected to make using a car more attractive, or at least less unpleasant compared to manually driven vehicles. Consequently, the number and length of car trips may increase. The aim of this study was to identify the main contributors to travelling more by AV. We analysed the L3Pilot project’s pilot site questionnaire data from 359 respondents who had ridden in a conditionally automated car (SAE level 3) either as a driver or as a passenger. The questionnaire queried the respondents’ user experience with the automated driving function, current barriers of travelling by car, previous experience with advanced driving assistance systems, and general priorities in travelling. The answers to these questions were used to predict willingness to travel more or longer trips by AV, and to use AVs on currently undertaken trips. The most predictive subset of variables was identified using Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression with a shrinkage prior (regularised horseshoe). The current study found that conditionally automated cars have a substantial potential to increase travelling by car once they become available. Willingness to perform leisure activities during automated driving, experienced usefulness of the system, and unmet travel needs, which AVs could address by making travelling easier, were the main contributors to expecting to travel more by AV. For using AVs on current trips, leisure activities, trust in AVs, satisfaction with the system, and traffic jams as barriers to current car use were important contributors. In other words, perceived usefulness motivated travelling more by AV and using AVs on current trips, but also other factors were important for using them on current trips. This suggests that one way to limit the growth of traffic with private AVs could be to address currently unmet travel needs with alternative, more sustainable travel modes.",1369-8478,Not found
Self-reported anger among ordinary and delivery electric bike riders in China: A comparison based on the cycling anger scale,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.002,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"As vulnerable traffic participants, electric bike (EB) riders have suffered from high collision casualties in recent years. Road user anger has been shown to affect riding behavior and lead to traffic accidents. Besides, studies have highlighted that there may be differences in road user anger in driving different vehicles due to varying perceptions of the relative vulnerability of vehicle type characteristics (control performance and cognitive processes). However, current road user anger investigations for two-wheelers have focused mainly on conventional cyclists, and little attention has been paid to e-bike riders, especially with the emerging group of delivery e-bike (DEB) riders. This study aims to develop a Cycling Anger Scale (CAS) for EB riders based on the Cycling Anger Scale and explore the road user anger experienced by EB riders and the differences between ordinary and delivery EB riders. The survey was conducted in Nanjing, China, and collected from 281 Ordinary EB (OEB) riders and 268 DEB riders. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis are conducted to determine the revised four-factor structure of the 14-item CAS for EB. The results show that the scores of police interaction and cyclist interaction on the CAS subscales are significantly different between the OEB and DEB groups. The police interaction is the largest source of anger for both groups. Besides, the aggressive riding behaviors are significantly correlated with riding anger, which can be predicted by different aspects of riding anger for the two types of EB riders. This study provides a theoretical basis for designing intervention measures and safety education programs to enhance EB riders’ road safety.",1369-8478,Not found

How impressions of other drivers affect one's behavior when merging lanes,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.007,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In recent years, systems have been developed to realize automatic driving based on objective information such as the relative distance and relative speed between vehicles. However, humans still must drive in complex situations, for instance, when merging lanes. In such driving situations, it is possible that people make decisions based not only on objective information, but also on subjective information. This study examined how subjective information, specifically, a driver’s impression of the other vehicle, affects the decision to merge in front of or behind the other vehicle when merging lanes on a highway. Twenty participants (nmale = 10; nfemale = 10; Mage = 43.92 [SDage = 11.40]) joined two experiments, Days 1E and 2E, using a driving simulator. Two months after participating in Day 1E the participants joined Day 2E. In the Day 1E, they drove either on the merging lane or the main lane and merged lanes while considering the other vehicle driving along the adjacent lane. This experiment measured the probability that the participants drove in front of another vehicle upon merging, which is defined as “lead probability.” The Day 2E was similar to 1E, except for the manipulation of the participants’ impression of the other vehicle as being aggressive/cautious via acceleration/deceleration of the other vehicle, and through the contents of the instructions regarding the other vehicle’s driving characteristics. In the Day 2E, the participants were randomly assigned to two: Aggressive or Cautious conditions. As the result of comparing the lead probabilities, it was found that only when the participants were driving on the merging lane and had the impression that the other vehicle is aggressive, the impression lowered the lead probability. The result indicates that people make decisions based not only on objective information but also on subjective information for specific driving situations, such as merging lanes. These findings can help in the development of automated driving systems that allow safer merging.",1369-8478,Not found

Exploring behavioral validity of driving simulator under time pressure driving conditions of professional drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.004,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Driving simulators have become an important tool in human factors research, given that they are appropriately validated. Therefore, this study aims to explore the behavioral (absolute and relative) validity of a fixed-base driving simulator by analyzing different driving behavior measures such as speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and brake pedal force. Thirty professional drivers participated in the experiment and the data was collected in real and simulated worlds under No Time Pressure (NTP) and Time Pressure (TP) driving conditions. Initially, comparative analyses were conducted on different driving behavior measures using Wilcoxon-signed rank test to examine absolute validity of the driving simulator. Finally, Generalized Linear Mixed (GLM) models were developed for computing the effective distance between real and simulated worlds by quantifying the parameters and for establishing relative validity. In general, the continuous profiles of driving behavior measures followed similar trends in real and simulated worlds and comparative analyses indicated relative validity of the driving simulator. The GLM models showed significant interaction effect of driving environments (real-world and simulated world) and driving conditions (NTP and TP) where high driving speed, high brake pedal force, and low lateral acceleration were observed in simulated world under TP driving condition than real-world under TP driving condition. Overall, the statistical analyses showed qualitative correspondence (relative validity) of the driving behavior measures in between real and simulated worlds. The findings from the current study showed expediency of the driving simulator and its effectiveness in conducting research on human factors and driver safety.",1369-8478,Not found
"Drinking, drug use and road rage in Turkish drivers",10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.012,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Alcohol or drug use and road rage behaviors in drivers are threats to traffic safety. The purpose of this research is to examine the relationship between alcohol or drug use and aggression in Turkish drivers, and to evaluate the mediating role of driving anger in this relationship. 270 amateur and professional Turkish drivers (170 male, 100 female) have filled up Driving Anger Scale (DAS), Driver Aggression Indicators Scale (DAIS), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Questionnaire Form. 15.9% of the participants scored 8 and higher on the AUDIT scale (alcohol problem). The most prevalent substance is cannabis, used at least once in a lifetime (20%). The results of mediated regression analysis indicates that driving anger has an increasing mediating role in the relationship between alcohol use and driver aggression. Due to limitations in the data, we could not reveal the relationship between substance use and driver aggression. These findings have led us to think that drinking use may contribute to being a perpetrator and/or a victim of the road rage. Taking precautions against drinking driving and road rage and going over the current implementations is important in order to create a safer traffic environment. Scientific researches carried out in this field must aim to provide the desired efficiency on prevention and intervention programs that reduce the prevalance of such dangerous acts.",1369-8478,Not found
"Unsafety on two wheels, or social prejudice? Proxying behavioral reports on bicycle and e-scooter riding safety – A mixed-methods study",10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.015,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The use of non-motorized transportation and micro-mobility is increasing in many cities. Bicycle riding and e-scooter use are now more common and affordable than ever. However, users of these devices face certain key issues. These include their own risky behaviors as well as involvement in conflicts with other road users. Self-report data may not adequately capture these behaviors and interactions. Despite this, more objective data (i.e., how third parties perceive these users’ road behaviors) is scarce. Aims: This study aimed to understand whether e-scooter riders have comparable or different riding behaviors than cyclists. This was investigated using a mixed-method study. Methods: This paper is divided into two sub-studies. In Study 1, 950 Spanish non-cyclists and non-e-scooter riders (mean age 31.98 ± 13.27 years; 55.3% female) provided external ratings (proxies) regarding the perceived behaviors of bicycle and e-scooter riders. In Study 2, collective Rapid Assessment Processes (RAPs; n = 23) were used to develop qualitative configurations of some of the key risky behaviors highlighted in Study 1. Results: There were significant differences in the perceived errors and violations rated by proxies for both types of riders (with e-scooter riders perceived as having higher rates of risky behaviors). However, there were also structural differences in the effects of external raters’ risk perceptions, traffic rule knowledge, and traffic incidents with two-wheeled riders on how they rated the behaviors. Conclusion: The results of both studies suggest that external raters’ perceptions provide further understanding of the causes, dynamics, and conflicts related to road behaviors performed by certain groups of road users. This is particularly apparent when there is no clear legislation and information on safe riding in urban areas. In this sense, improving infrastructure could promote safer interactions. Finally, road safety education could focus on promoting safer practices and interactions in order to improve how others perceive riders’ behavior.",1369-8478,Not found
New parents and driver safety: What's sleep got to do with it? A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.009,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Fatigue-related motor vehicle crashes are common worldwide and have been addressed by a range of road safety campaigns. These campaigns are typically directed towards at-risk groups (e.g., heavy vehicle drivers), who may be likely to experience fatigue resulting from reduced or disrupted sleep opportunities. Another population likely to experience sleep loss and disruption is new parents. The sleep of new parents is likely to be significantly disrupted by childcare responsibilities. As such, new parents may also be likely to experience fatigue while driving. A systematic review of five databases (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) was performed to identify what research is currently available on sleep, fatigue, and driving in new parents. A total of twelve documents were included in this review. A synthesis of findings suggests new parents are at risk of fatigued driving – though the amount and quality of evidence available is limited. A research agenda is proposed to address the limitations of this field of research.",1369-8478,Not found
Social identity and cycling among women: The case of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.023,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Through the lens of the Social Identify Theory (Tajfel, 1974), this research aims to understand how social identity affects the perception of cycling as a mode of transport among women from different socio-income backgrounds. Using the case study of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa (Israel), we found that cycling is associated with distinct social categories rather than seen as a 'socially neutral' practice. In particular, we found cycling to be associated with 'being a Tel-Avivian' and with a healthy and active lifestyle. Such distinct identification of cycling is likely to enhance cycling uptake among more privileged groups, who are often able to identify with these social categories. In contrast, it may create a barrier for underprivileged groups, who do not identify with these social categories. In addition, we show how e-bikes – which are not identified with privileged groups – do not provide an identifiable alternative for women from all groups, as it is identified with “tough” and “violent” men. Furthermore, we show how cycling, in general, is perceived as “tough”, “dangerous” and as requiring a “constant struggle” over space with other road users, and hence fits a typical “masculine” behavior. Finally, we show how currently cycling is perceived by the underprivileged as a threat to their way of life or even as a symbol of them being pushed out of their neighborhood – a perception that limits cycling uptake among these social groups. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for social identity in cycling research and policymaking, especially in low-cycling contexts.",1369-8478,Not found
Comparing eye-tracking metrics of mental workload caused by NDRTs in semi-autonomous driving,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.004,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The objective of this study was to verify the effectiveness of eye-tacking metrics in indicating driver’s mental workload in semi-autonomous driving when the driver is engaged in different non-driving related tasks (NDRTs). A driving simulator was developed for three scenarios (high-, medium-, and low-mental workload presented by SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Levels 0, 1, and 2) and three uni-modality secondary tasks. Thirty-six individuals participated in the driving simulation experiment. NASA-TLX (Task Load Index), secondary task performance, and eye-tracking metrics were used as indicators of mental workload. The subjective rating using the NASA-TLX showed a main effect of autonomous level on mental workload in both visual and auditory tasks. Correlation-matrix calculation and principal-component extraction indicated that pupil diameter change, number of saccades, saccade duration, fixation duration, and 3D gaze entropy were effective indicators of a driver’s mental workload in the visual and auditory multi-tasking situations of semi-autonomous driving. The accuracy of predicting the mental-workload level using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier was 88.9% with bootstrapped data. These results can be used to develop an adaptive multi-modal interface that issues efficient and safe takeover requests.",1369-8478,Not found
Social exclusion affects aggressive driving behaviour: The mediating effect of prosocial tendencies and driving anger,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.010,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Social exclusion—being rejected or ignored by individuals or groups—is a common and adverse experience in social life. As a social activity, driving behaviour can be influenced by many factors. Whether social exclusion is one of these factors is an open question. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the impact of the social exclusion experience on individuals and their driving behaviours and the mediating effect of prosocial tendencies and driving anger. A total of 240 (104 males and 136 females) participants from China completed a questionnaire including the Ostracism Experiences Scale (OES), the prosocial tendencies measure (PTM), the Driving Anger Scale (DAS) and the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). The hierarchical multiple regression analysis and pathway analysis results showed that social exclusion experience and driving anger positively predicted aberrant driving behaviours (including aggressive violations, ordinary violations, lapses and errors), while prosocial tendencies had a negative impact on aberrant driving behaviour. Moreover, prosocial tendencies and driving anger mediated the relationship between social exclusion and driver behaviour, accounting for 11.18% and 46.71% of the total effect, respectively. The chain-mediated effect of prosocial tendencies and driving anger was also significant, accounting for 5.26% of the total effect of social exclusion on driver behaviour. This study examines the mechanisms underlying social exclusion experiences that positively predict individuals' unsafe driving behaviours, thereby filling a gap in social exclusion research and suggesting new avenues of exploration into the personal and social influences that affect driving behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found

However, smartphone use is a risky behavior when used while driving to and from work. As work experiences have been found to influence risky commuting behaviors, we hypothesized that job crafting, i.e., a set of proactive work behaviors through which employees change their job demands and resources, influences and is influenced by risky commuting behaviors. We argued that employees' smartphone use during driving commutes is related to how employees proactively choose to transform their demands and resources at work. A quantitative diary study was designed to investigate the process linking smartphone use during driving commutes to and from work and job crafting. A sample of 128 office employees completed two short daily questionnaires for five consecutive workdays (N = 627 observations). Results from multilevel analyses showed that daily talking on the phone while driving to work was positively associated with the proactive optimization of job demands, while daily proactive pursuing of challenging stimuli at work (i.e., seeking challenges) was positively related to looking at the phone when employees drove back from work. Furthermore, on days when employees reduced their hindering job demands, they reported less frequent talking on the phone while driving back from work. Results provide practical implications for the prevention of distracted driving and other risky driving behaviors.",1369-8478,Not found
Use of Level 1 and 2 driving automation on horizontal curves on interstates and freeways,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.008,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Little is known about how the actual use of Level 1 and 2 driving automation systems may be affected by geometric road characteristics in naturalistic driving environments. This study examined the use of these systems on horizontal curves on interstates and freeways. It used travel data collected in a field operational test conducted with two 2016 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and two 2017 Volvo S90 vehicles equipped with ACC and Pilot Assist (PA). Logistic regression models estimated changes in the likelihood of ACC use associated with horizontal curvature in the Evoque vehicles, and of PA and ACC use in the S90 vehicles, while accounting for traffic conditions. Drivers were less likely to drive with ACC or PA on as horizontal curves became sharper. In the Evoque vehicles, the likelihood of using ACC was 71.6% lower on the sharpest category of horizontal curves (those with a degree of curvature>2.5 degrees per 100 feet of arc or a radius smaller than 2,292 feet), compared with straight road segments or the flattest horizontal curve category (those with a degree of curvature <= 1.5 degrees per 100 feet of arc or a radius no <3,820 feet). In the S90 vehicles, the likelihood of using PA and ACC declined 74.6 and 66.3%, respectively, on the sharpest curves. Many driving automation systems face challenges on horizontal curves, even within their operational design domain.

Car following with an inertia-oriented driving technique: A driving simulator experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2022.06.003,89,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Background For many decades, car-following (CF) and congestion models have assumed a basic invariance: drivers’ default driving strategy is to keep the safety distance. The present study questions that Driving to keep Distance (DD) is a traffic invariance and, therefore, that the difference between the time required to accelerate versus decelerate must necessarily determine the observed patterns of traffic oscillations. Previous studies have shown that drivers can adopt alternative CF strategies like Driving to keep Inertia (DI) by following basic instructions. The present work aims to test the effectiveness of a DI course that integrates 4 tutorials and 4 practice sessions in a standard PC computer designed to learn more adaptive driving behaviors in dense traffic. Methods. Sixty-eight drivers were invited to follow a leading car that varied its speed on a driving simulator, then they took a DI course on a PC computer, and finally they followed a fluctuating leader again on the driving simulator. The study adopted a pretest-intervention-posttest design with a control group. The experimental group took the full DI course (tutorials and then simulator practice). The control group had access to the DI simulator but not to the tutorials. Results. All participating drivers adopted DD as the default CF mode on the pre-test, yielding very similar results. But after taking the full DI course, the experimental group showed significantly less accelerations, decelerations, and speed variability than the control group, and required greater CF distance, that was dynamically adjusted, spending less fuel in the post-test. A group of 8 virtual cars adopting DD required less space on the road to follow the drivers that took the DI course.",1369-8478,Not found

This study used eight kinds of social norm slogans to nudge drivers’ yielding behaviour and explored the influence of pedestrian characteristics and situational factors on drivers’ decision-making regarding giving way when turning right. By analysing 254 valid questionnaires, it was found that compared with static norms, injunctive norms and dynamic + static norms, positively worded dynamic norms have a better nudging effect on drivers' yielding behaviour. The results of the conjoint analysis showed that social norms have the greatest impact on drivers' decisions to yield (32.28%), followed by whether pedestrians comply with traffic rules (23.33%) and the age of pedestrians (18.40%).

Evasive action characteristics of motorcycle riders towards occluded-surprise and expected pedestrians: A pedestrian mock-up study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.006,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Evasive action performance of motorcycle riders plays a vital role in the prevention of road crashes. In possible conflicting scenarios, motorcycle riders need to respond quickly and perform evasive actions successfully to prevent collisions with other vulnerable road users such as crossing pedestrians. To study the motorcycle rider behavior in conflicts with occluded and visible pedestrians, we designed four mock-up pedestrian scenarios, which includes, two surprise scenarios, one stationary scenario, and one expected scenario. Riders’ responses to the conflicts were measured using instrumented vehicle’s trajectory. Most riders preferred deceleration over swerving at the beginning of the interaction, followed by swerving at manageable speeds. Further, the analysis of riders’ deceleration rates revealed that a linear relationship existed between the deceleration rates and time to collisions (TTC). The study also analyzed the riders’ responses using repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) to check for the effect of scenario type on deceleration rates. Results indicated that scenario type significantly affected the mean deceleration rates. Further, RM-ANOVA analysis carried out on the jerk behavior of motorcycle riders indicated that there was a significant effect of scenario type on the jerk behavior. Motorcycle riders’ jerks varied linearly with TTC and motorcyclists employ relatively higher decelerations and jerks when faced with pedestrians emerging suddenly from occluded locations such as from the blind spots formed due to parked vehicles. This study helps in understanding motorcycle rider behavior in critical situations and shows the need for assistive evasive systems for motorcycle riders to mitigate collisions with other vulnerable road users.",1369-8478,Not found
How do the recognizability and driving styles of automated vehicles affect human drivers’ gap acceptance at T- Intersections?,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.018,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Future traffic will be composed of both human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and automated vehicles (AVs). To accurately predict the performance of mixed traffic, an important aspect is describing HDV behavior when interacting with AVs. A few exploratory studies show that HDVs change their behavior when interacting with AVs, being influenced by factors such as recognizability and driving style of AVs. Unsignalized priority intersections can significantly affect traffic flow efficiency and safety of the road network. To understand HDV behavior in mixed traffic at unsignalized priority T-intersections, a driving simulator experiment was set up in which 95 drivers took part in it. The route in the driving simulator included three T-intersections where the drivers had to give priority to traffic on the major road. The participants drove different scenarios which varied in whether the AVs were recognizable or not, and in their driving style (Aggressive or Defensive). The results showed that in mixed traffic having recognizable aggressive AVs, drivers accepted significantly larger gaps (and had larger critical gaps) when merging in front of AVs as compared to mixed traffic having either recognizable defensive AVs or recognizable mixed AVs (composed of both aggressive and defensive). This was not the case when merging in front of an HDV in the same scenarios. Drivers had significantly smaller critical gaps when driving in traffic having non-recognizable aggressive AVs compared to non-recognizable defensive AVs. The findings suggest that human drivers change their gap acceptance behavior in mixed traffic depending on the combined effect of recognizability and driving style of AVs, including accepting shorter gaps in front of non-recognizable aggressive AVs and changing their original driving behavior. This could have implications for traffic efficiency and safety at such priority intersections. Decision makers must carefully consider such behavioral adaptations before implementing any policy changes related to AVs and the infrastructure.",1369-8478,Not found
Bears in our midst: Familiarity with Level 2 driving automation and attending to surprise on-road events,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.016,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This study presents an on-road paradigm to measure the effect of Level 2 (L2) system familiarity on attention strategies to salient, but non-hazardous, driving-related events when using the driving automation. A vehicle with an oversized pink teddy bear on the back overtook participants three times while they drove a 2019 Mercedes-Benz C300 equipped with a L2 system for 1 h. This L2 system requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel while activated. The L2 system was turned on or off, depending on the assigned condition, and participants varied in their familiarity with L2 systems. Cameras recorded participant eye glance behavior. After the drive, participants were asked to recall the bear and the number of times their mind had wandered from the driving task during the drive. Results show that the driving automation support gave only participants familiar with L2 systems an advantage for greater bear recall. Unfamiliar participants were at a relative disadvantage when assisted by the L2 system, with generally poorer bear recall than unfamiliar participants who drove with the system off. Better bear recall corresponded with wider on-road gaze dispersion and more instances of mind wandering. Our findings support the effectiveness of this paradigm to measure driver attention when using a L2 system under real-world conditions and highlight the need to consider the role of driving automation familiarity in future research.",1369-8478,Not found
Guiding drivers towards safer driving speed: Exploiting visual dominance in speed adaptation,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.011,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Inappropriate speed is a main cause of accidents. Drivers are often unaware of potential risks due to inadequate speed. To prevent dangerous situations, we need to understand perceptual factors influencing human speed perception. Due to the prominent role of vision in driving, we examined the effect of visuo-spatial stimuli on speed based on the optic flow. While developing an adaptive infrastructure measure to reduce speed, we conducted two consecutive studies, a driving simulator study and a field test to investigate findings further. In both studies, we placed lights on two sides of a highway exit and either illuminated them statically or activated them in a way that they appeared to be moving towards the driver. We expected drivers to slow down more when seeing static light stimuli compared to a baseline without lights. We also expected drivers to decrease speed more in conditions with oncoming lights compared to a baseline, and to static lights, due to distorted speed perception. The first study in a static driving simulator revealed no difference between conditions. In the field test, both static lights and lights moving towards the driver led to a speed reduction compared to a baseline but did not differ from one another. Lights in general led to lower driving speed, potentially due to their warning character, but we found no difference between the light conditions, suggesting that the effect might not be based on the optic flow. Future research should investigate the relationship between driven and perceived speed more closely.",1369-8478,Not found

Motivation and active travel in adolescent girls and boys in Germany – Findings from the ARRIVE study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.015,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Active travel (using an active mode of transport such as walking or cycling) contributes to the accumulation of daily physical activity and thus holds potential for promoting health. To promote active travel among adolescents an in-depth understanding of determinants from a sex/gender perspective is needed. Within Self-Determination Theory (SDT), it is proposed that the quality of an individuals’ motivation (i.e., the degree to which it is autonomous) determines the extent to which they engage in particular behaviors and perform them effectively. As part of the ARRIVE study, the aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between motivation and active travel in adolescent boys (N = 263, Mage = 12.92) and girls (N = 254, Mage = 13.21) from a nationwide German sample. Results showed significant group differences between male and female adolescents in the proportion of trips traveled actively, intrinsic motivation and amotivation. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated different relationships of the different types of motivation proposed within SDT on active travel behavior depending on sex/gender. In the total sample, integrated and identified regulation increased the odds of active travel (by 15.8 %, and 20.3 % respectively), whereas amotivation decreased the odds by 23.0 %. Intrinsic motivation and controlled forms of extrinsic motivation (i.e. introjected and external regulation) did not significantly change the odds of active travel. Separate sex/gender-specific analyses were conducted. For boys, only identified regulation significantly increased the odds of active travel (by 40.2 %) and amotivation significantly decreased the odds (by 18.8 %). In girls, integrated (by 25.3 %) and external (by 20.3 %) regulation significantly increased the odds of active travel, while amotivation (26.6 %) significantly decreased the odds. We conclude that disparities exist in the relationship among different regulation types with active travel behavior between adolescent boys and girls, and that findings contradictory to SDT might result from the specific context of traveling to a destination. Considering the regression analyses findings, future interventions to promote active travel among adolescents should incorporate sex/gender-sensitive development, because some behavioral regulations might not be equally effective among girls and boys.",1369-8478,Not found
Experiences of older adults interacting with a shared autonomous vehicle and recommendations for future implementation,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.014,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Introduction A recognised potential benefit of autonomous vehicles is increased mobility for older adults. However, this group is more apprehensive about adoption, which may hinder uptake. Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) represent a use case that may be especially relevant for older people due to emerging applications in retirement villages and similar precincts. However, little research has examined the SAV-related concerns of older adults and strategies to address them. This study used an exploratory approach involving SAV exposure to identify strategies that may increase older people’s receptiveness to SAVs. Method Older adults living in retirement villages (n = 63) were interviewed while interacting with an SAV to examine their needs, expectations, and concerns regarding SAVs. The interview data were coded and thematically analysed. Results Participants recommended the following approaches to ensuring SAVs are useful and acceptable to older adults: providing physical accessibility for those with mobility impairments, comfortable and practical internal layouts, and operating SAVs on convenient routes at useful speeds. Strategies such as exposing older adults to SAVs in operation to encourage uptake and initially ensuring a human assistant is present were suggested methods of increasing receptivity. Discussion The findings suggest older passengers are likely to share many of the same reactions to SAVs as the broader population, but with a stronger focus on issues relating to accessibility and the physical layout of the vehicles. The solutions to these issues suggested by the study participants may be useful for those designing SAVs for use in older people’s settings and beyond.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of fatalistic beliefs and risk perceptions on road safety attitudes in Latin America; A two-country study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.003,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Road safety is a major challenge in the Latin American region; however, there is a significant lack of research undertaken there. To contribute to addressing this gap, this paper reports on an exploration of the antecedents of traffic safety attitudes in two Latin American contexts: Brazil and Ecuador. Building on related work undertaken in other countries, the research explored the relationships between fatalistic beliefs, traffic risk perceptions, and road safety attitudes, while accounting for age, gender, and exposure to the road environment. Data from 2432 individuals, analysed using Structural Equation Modelling, revealed differences in the extent to which different fatalistic belief constructs (including divine control, luck, helplessness, internality, and general fatalism) were related to road safety attitudes. Moreover, fatalistic beliefs were found to influence road safety attitudes both directly and indirectly through their influence on risk perceptions. Those that reported more fatalistic beliefs also reported more dangerous attitudes to road safety and a lower perception of on-road risk. Mirroring findings from work undertaken in other countries, we found males compared to females and younger compared to older respondents to report more dangerous attitudes to road safety, with inconclusive results for risk perceptions. We also found very similar patterns of results in the data from the two countries included in the research. Results are discussed with regards to informing the design of road safety interventions aimed at influencing individual road user attitudes and, ultimately, human behaviour and system performance.",1369-8478,Not found
Optimizing guidance signage system to improve drivers’ lane-changing behavior at the expressway toll plaza,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.008,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Although ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) has been widely implemented in vehicles in China in recent years, the channel guidance signage system on expressways has not been updated accordingly. Late lane-changing occurs when drivers are confused about the correct channel to enter, leading to increased crash risks and traffic congestion in front of the toll. The paper aims to optimize the current guidance signage systems, given the high proportion of ETC vehicles on Chinese expressways, and evaluate its effects on the drivers’ lane-changing behavior when passing through the expressway toll channels. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to test four scenarios: Original sign plan, Partial Manual Toll Collection (MTC) sign plan, Complete MTC sign plan and Complete MTC sign with Voice warning plan. Forty participants with a valid driver's license completed the four scenarios, and their behavior performances (e.g., decision-making of lane-changing, response time, average speed and deceleration) in the main lane in front of the toll booth were analyzed. The results showed that compared to the Original sign plan and Partial MTC sign plans, the Complete MTC sign plans (with and without voice warning) played a significant role in improving the MTC vehicle drivers’ lane-changing behaviors. The improvement included earlier initiated lane-changing, shortened response time, lower deceleration rate and extended lane-changing duration distance. The findings of this study have important implications for expressway designers and relevant management departments to optimize the current guidance signage and enhance traffic safety and efficiency at the toll plaza.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the usage of supervised driving automation in naturalistic conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.013,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This study reports usage of supervised automation and driver attention from longitudinal naturalistic driving observations. Automation inexperienced drivers were provided with instrumented vehicles with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane keeping (LK) features (SAE level 2). Data was collected comparing one month of driving without support to two months where drivers were instructed to use automation as desired. On highways, level 2 automation was used respectively 63% and 57% of the time by Tesla and BMW users, with peak usage during slow stop-and-go traffic (0–30 km/h) and higher speeds (>80 km/h). On roads with speed limits below 70 km/h, automation was used less than 8%, and use on urban roads was incidental rather than habitual. Automation usage increased with time in trip, but no clear time of day effects were found. Head pose data could not classify driver attention, and we recommend gaze tracking in future studies. Head pose deviation was selected as alternative indicator for monitoring activity. Comparing among forms of automation usage on the highway, head heading deviation was smallest during ACC use, but did not differ between automation and baseline manual driving. Head heading deviation during manual driving was smaller in the baseline than the experimental phase, which suggests that motives for manual highway driving may be attention related. Automation usage did not change much over the first 12 weeks of the experimental condition, and there were no longitudinal changes in head pose deviation.",1369-8478,Not found
Increasing the conspicuity of cyclists at night by using bicycle lights and clothing to highlight their biological motion to oncoming drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.005,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Reduced conspicuity is an important contributing factor to increased motor vehicle-bicycle crashes and cyclist fatalities at night. This study explored ways of making night-time cyclists more conspicuous to oncoming vehicles through cyclist clothing options and bicycle light position. Fifteen young participants (M = 29.1 ± 4.5 years) drove a closed-road at night and indicated when they first recognized a cyclist pedalling in place at the roadside, facing the approaching vehicle. The bicycle had a static forward-facing white light located either on the handlebars or the helmet and wore one of five clothing configurations: fluorescent vest, retroreflective vest, retroreflective ankle strips, retroreflective vest plus retroreflective ankle strips, retroreflective vest plus biomotion retroreflective strips. There was a significant effect of light position (p < 0.001) and clothing (p < 0.001), where recognition distances were longer when the light was helmet-mounted and when retroreflective strips were worn on the lower legs to highlight the cyclist’s biological motion compared to either of the vest conditions. There was also a significant interaction between light position and clothing (p = 0.007) such that the benefit of retroreflective strips was greater when the bicycle light was helmet-mounted rather than on the handlebars. Importantly, the benefits of leg markings were apparent even when positioned at the ankles alone. These findings highlight that retroreflective material is most useful for improving cyclist conspicuity at night when positioned on cyclists’ lower legs, particularly the ankles (highlighting the cyclist's pedalling motion), rather than on the torso, and have important practical implications for maximising cyclists’ conspicuity and hence safety on night-time roads.",1369-8478,Not found
Consumer knowledge and acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.004,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This research aimed to examine how personal car users are informed about Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in Australia, and the extent to which information received at point of sale influenced the level of understanding and adaptation of ADAS. Further, this study applied the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to assess drivers’ intentions to use ADAS within the next month. Participants were required to have purchased a new or second-hand vehicle within the past five years and which had at least one of the following five ADAS: autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross traffic alert. Participants (N = 217, Mage = 47.87 years, 149 male) completed a 20-minute online questionnaire. The findings revealed that 122 (56%) participants reported not seeking out any information about ADAS prior to purchasing their vehicle. Further, the most reported approaches used by participants to learn about their vehicle’s ADAS were through the owner’s manual (n = 121, 55%) and via trial and error (n = 117, 54%). It was also found that total time spent with the salesperson in explaining ADAS features did not influence drivers’ level of understanding of ADAS or number of days to adapt to the ADAS in their vehicle. However, and consistent with the TAM, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were significant positive predictors of intentions to use ADAS within the next month. It was also found that participants who learnt about these technologies either via reading the owner’s manual, trial and error, or a verbal explanation at point of sale appeared to be more frequently classified as reporting higher acceptance of ADAS than those participants who did not use those learning methods. Given that technology in vehicles will continue to advance, it is vital that more work is conducted to educate drivers about the functionality of ADAS. Further, it is also important to communicate where buyers of personal cars can go and find accurate and reliable information about ADAS.",1369-8478,Not found
Physiological measures of bicyclists’ subjective experiences: A scoping review,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.007,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Feeling unsafe, stressed, and uncomfortable while bike riding are key barriers that prevent people from riding more. Examining these perceptions is important for increasing bicycling. The recent rise in wearable devices has coincided with research using bike riders’ physiological responses to measure their subjective experiences while riding. However, the types of physiological responses used to quantify bike riders’ experiences and how well these responses compare to individual perceptions of riding experience gathered through interviews or surveys remains unknown. This scoping review aimed to address these knowledge gaps and identified five key findings: i) The main physiological responses used to measure subjective rider experience were heart rate variability, heart rate, and skin conductance; ii) Where physiological and non-physiological measures of subjective experience have been compared, statistical comparisons showed weak associations and descriptive comparisons showed moderate to large degrees of variation in the number of identified moments of stress; and iii) Physiological responses were predominantly used as measurements of psychological stress. We conclude that further work is needed to determine whether physiological responses are a valid measure of subjective riding experience, and to examine a wider range of feelings that people might experience while bike riding.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of motorcycle lighting configurations on drivers’ perceptions of closing during nighttime driving,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.017,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Objective The aims were to better understand how drivers perceive an approaching set of motorcycle headlights during nighttime driving and to determine whether alternative motorcycle headlight configurations improve drivers’ perceptual judgments of closing for an oncoming motorcycle. Background Motorcyclists account for a disproportionate number of roadway fatalities, especially at night. One potential cause of this is drivers’ misjudgments of a motorcycle’s approach. Method The first experiment examined whether drivers were more sensitive to horizontal or vertical optical expansion and whether drivers could integrate these two dimensions to achieve a lower looming threshold. A second experiment built on these results to test whether alternative headlight configurations that maximized size were better than other motorcycle headlight configurations and a car’s headlights. In both experiments, participants were instructed to press a button to indicate when they first perceived an oncoming vehicle to be closing under nighttime driving conditions. Results Headlight orientation did not affect when drivers perceived closing, and drivers were not able to integrate optical expansion from multiple dimensions in a way that achieves a lower looming threshold. However, the alternative motorcycle headlight configurations that accentuated the full extent of a motorcycle’s size resulted in drivers perceiving closing sooner than other motorcycle headlight configurations but not sooner than a car. Conclusion Drivers perceive closing sooner for larger headlight configurations except when the headlight configurations are relatively small, in which case the effect of headlight size is attenuated. Application Drivers’ perceptual judgments of motorcycles may improve when motorcycles have headlights that span its full height.",1369-8478,Not found
Applying an extended theory of planned behaviour to understand influences on safe driving intentions and behaviours,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.009,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Most road safety research and interventions focus on risky or unsafe driving but understanding psychosocial motivators for safe driving behaviours may also be important in efforts to improve road safety. The current study applied an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) including attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control (PBC), together with the additional constructs of moral norm, descriptive norm, and anticipated regret in understanding drivers’ intentions to engage, and self-reported engagement, in safe driving. As additional extended TPB constructs, personality constructs from the Five Factor Model of Personality (FFM; extraversion, neuroticism [emotional stability], agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to experience [imagination]) were also investigated. Licensed drivers from Queensland, Australia, aged 17 years and older, completed an initial online survey investigating intentions for safe driving behaviours (N = 171) followed by a second online survey-one week later investigating actual behavioural engagement (N = 63). Participants answered items related to general safe driving and two safe driving scenarios: namely, leaving an adequate gap between vehicles on a multi-lane highway and reducing speed in storming conditions. Separate hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to identify the motivators of intentions to engage in safe driving in each scenario. PBC and subjective norm were significant predictors of intentions to engage in general safe driving and the two specific scenarios. Attitude was a significant predictor of intentions to engage in safe driving in the specific highway scenario, moral norm was a significant predictor of intentions in both the general safe driving and the specific highway scenario, and anticipated regret was a significant predictor in the specific storming conditions scenario. Imagination was the sole significant personality-related predictor of intention and that was only in the specific highway scenario. For the predictors of self-reported performance of safe driving behaviour, these were examined regarding only the general (N = 57), and the specific highway scenario (N = 49) given storms/rainy weather had not occurred in the interim period between surveys. Self-reported safe driving behaviour in the general and specific highway scenario was significantly predicted by intention. This research supports the importance of understanding factors influencing safe driving behaviours and not just risky driving behaviours. Research that identifies influences on safe driving may help to inform interventions that may promote more positive, safe on-road behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found
Is all high-risk behaviour premeditated? A qualitative exploratory approach to the self-regulation of habitual and risky driving behaviours,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.002,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The majority of research surrounding the intervention of risky driving behaviours has operated on the notion that offending behaviour is intentional, leading to a defined theoretical approach on deterrence. This study aimed to investigate the motivations, regulatory behaviours and resisting beliefs that contribute to the occurrence of risky driving behaviours, from the perspective that some behaviour may be unintentional and habitual by nature. An online sample of Australian drivers (N = 46) were recruited to complete a qualitative phone interview regarding their perceptions of risky driving behaviours. Thematic analysis revealed that firstly, speeding and the use of technology while driving (i.e., distraction) were the most commonly reported risky driving habits. Speeding in particular appeared to be both habitual and unintentional, whereas phone use while driving was attributable to addiction, impulses and attitudes. Factors such as drivers’ mentality, the automaticity of the behaviour, and social norms were perceived to make habitual behaviours more difficult to change, whilst personal experiences with legal and physical consequences were perceived to increase risk perceptions and promote behavioural change. Participants also reported using cognitive reframing strategies and behaviours to increase and maintain awareness of the behaviours. Overall, this study has highlighted the resistant and multi-dimensional nature of risky driving habits, as well as the situational factors that preclude them. Based on the findings, future research may benefit by focusing efforts to understanding how habituality fits in the broader deterrence literature, and how such behaviours can be best intervened.",1369-8478,Not found
The implications of situation and route familiarity for driver-pedestrian interaction at uncontrolled mid-block crosswalks,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.003,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Most routine daily trips take place along the same route, a fact that previous studies have not investigated together with the repeated situation of conflicting with other road users. Consequently, our study addresses driver behaviour by separating the driving experience into three categories: (i) drivers unfamiliar with the route, (ii) those route-familiar, and (iii) situation-familiar drivers. The specific case of driver-pedestrian interaction at uncontrolled mid-block crosswalks is investigated. A multi-level factorial experiment including (i) crosswalk design (linear sidewalk and curb extension), (ii) driver familiarity, and (iii) pedestrian time gap acceptance (4, 6, and 8 s) was conducted using a driving simulator. Fifty-two participants were divided into four groups and stratified by age, gender, and driving experience. The minimum instantaneous time to collision, post-encroachment time, maximum car deceleration, and maximum car speed were all used as surrogate safety measures (SSM). Route-familiarity led to higher speed, while situation-familiarity positively affected driving behaviour making drivers more inclined to decrease their speed at circa 100 m before a crosswalk. The curb extension layout enhanced pedestrian safety and mitigated any adverse effects due to familiarity, with a particularly relevant impact on SSM at low accepted time gaps for pedestrians. Situation- and route-familiarity treatment protocols lead to different behaviours among drivers, indicating a clear need to account for these two familiarity levels in experiments on safety-related countermeasures.",1369-8478,Not found
Can we adapt to highly automated vehicles as passengers?

Therefore, based on human factors engineering, it is necessary to study highly automated vehicles (HAVs) that meet different user needs. Thus, this study aims to investigate the relationships between state anxiety, situational awareness, trust, and role adaptation. The adaptation model is constructed to conduct a study on the adaptation of HAVs with different automated styles when user roles change from driver to passenger. Simulated riding was conducted in the HAV experiment (N = 117), collecting scale data after each participant had experienced each automated driving style. A structural equation modeling approach was applied to analyze the adaptation model based on scale data. The results showed that there was a significant correlation between state anxiety, situational awareness, trust, and role adaptation. State anxiety has a significant negative predictive effect on trust, situational awareness, and role adaptation. In addition to its direct impact on role adaptation, state anxiety also has an indirect effect on role adaptation through situational awareness and trust. Furthermore, the automated driving style has been confirmed to have a moderating role in the relationship between the direct and indirect effects of state anxiety and role adaptation. Our findings contribute to multiple streams of the literature and have important implications for designing personalized automated driving to improve user acceptance.",1369-8478,Not found
Hazard perception performance and visual scanning behaviours: The effect of sleepiness,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.020,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Driver sleepiness accounts for a substantial proportion of crashes in Australia and Worldwide. Young adults are overrepresented in sleep-related crashes and are more susceptible to sleepiness, resulting in impaired attention and driving performance. Visual scanning behaviour can affect the role between attention and information acquisition from the driver's environment. Thus, if attention is impaired, visual scanning behaviours are likely to show decrements as well. Overall, 32 young adults aged between 20 and 25 years completed a 60-minute hazard perception task to examine the effect of sleepiness and time-on-task on hazard perception performance, visual scanning behaviours, subjective sleepiness scores, and psychomotor vigilance test performance. The main outcomes include decrements in hazard perception performance and a restriction in horizontal and vertical eye scanning ranges across the 60-minute session, but with a more pronounced effect when sleep-restricted. These outcomes were consistent with increases in subjective sleepiness and behavioural metrics of sleepiness assessed via the PVT. Reductions in scanning range could limit opportunities to attend to hazards and other critical safety events. The current study outcomes provide an important contribution regarding the risks associated with sleepy driving performance.",1369-8478,Not found

To achieve this, user education is considered crucial. Since gamification has previously shown positive effects on learning motivation and performance, it could serve as a measure to enhance user education on automated vehicles. We developed a tablet-based instruction involving gamified elements and compared it to instruction without gamification and a control group receiving a user manual. After instruction, participants (N = 57) experienced a 30-minute automated drive on a motorway in a fixed-base driving simulator. Participants who received the gamified instruction reported a higher level of intrinsic motivation to learn the provided content. The results also indicate that gamification promotes mental model formation and trust during the automated drive. Taken together, including gamification in user education for automated driving is a promising approach to enhance safe driver-vehicle interaction.",1369-8478,Not found
What is the motor vehicle crash risk for drivers with a sleep disorder?,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.010,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"In many parts of the world, drivers with serious sleep disorders have restrictions on their licence – with the fitness-to-drive criteria varying across licensing jurisdictions. This study aimed to systematically review the literature that evaluated the available scientific evidence for the relationship between sleep disorders and two driving safety outcome measures: (i) motor vehicle crashes (MVC) and (ii) on-road driving test outcome. This review was registered with PROSPERO in July 2019 (see CRD42019144643). A systematic search of public health, psychology and transport databases was conducted on November 8th, 2019. The quality of evidence for each study was rated using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Quality Assessment tools. Thirty-nine studies published between 1976 and 2015 met the inclusion criteria (n = 9 case-control; n = 24 cohort/cross-sectional; n = 6 before-after). Overall, the quality of evidence for 22 studies was rated as ‘good’, nine as ‘fair’ and eight as ‘poor’. Included studies addressed: sleep apnoea and sleep-related breathing disorders (n = 35); central disorders of hypersomnolence and narcolepsy (n = 5), and insomnia (n = 2), with some studies covering multiple sleep disorders. Of the thirty-five studies specifically investigating MVC risk associated with sleep apnoea, eighteen studies reported an increased risk (n = 11 ‘good’, n = 4 ‘fair’, n = 3 ‘poor’ quality), seven reported no difference in risk (n = 3 ‘good’, n = 4 ‘fair’ quality), and two provided inconclusive findings (n = 1 ‘good’, n = 1 ‘fair’ quality). Most studies suggested that increased sleep apnoea severity was associated with an increased MVC risk. Furthermore, untreated sleep apnoea was predominantly associated with increased risk, whilst decreased risk was associated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) treatments. Five studies (n = 3 ‘good’, n = 2 ‘fair’ quality) investigated MVC risk associated with disorders of hypersomnolence and narcolepsy, and all reported increased risk. Only two studies investigated MVC risk associated with insomnia, with inconsistent findings: one reporting increased MVC risk (‘good’) and one reporting no difference (‘fair’). Regarding impacts on on-road driving test outcome, our comprehensive search found no studies investigating the association between sleep disorders and this driving safety outcome measure. Notwithstanding the limitations of the included studies, the weight of evidence suggests a moderately elevated MVC risk for drivers with sleep disorders (sleep apnoea; hypersomnia and narcolepsy), with the majority reporting around two and a half times higher risk, and lower risk with treatment. This evidence is consistent with current fitness-to-drive guidelines, most of which specify licence restrictions conditional upon severity, treatment compliance and effective response to treatment. The generalisability of the findings is limited as many identified studies had methodological limitations, were conducted across a wide time period, in numerous licensing jurisdictions with different requirements, and across a diverse range of participant populations. A large-scale, population-based controlled study, in multiple licensing jurisdictions with equivalent licensing and fitness-to-drive requirements, is warranted to rigorously investigate MVC risk and sleep disorders, including evaluating the possible benefit of therapies.",1369-8478,Not found
Mobile phone use while driving in Finland,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.018,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Mobile phones represent one of the most common distractions for drivers and phone use while driving is particularly problematic in Finland. The aim of this research was to explore the Finnish sample of responses from ESRA2 (E-Survey of Road users' Attitudes) with a specific focus on the distracting behaviours related to mobile phone usage while driving. ESRA2 data is derived from online surveys amongst a representative sample of the adult populations in each participating country. In total a sample of 994 responses were collected in Finland for ESRA2, which included 703 responses from participants who held a driver’s licence and reported driving a car in the 30 days prior to the survey. The results provide evidence of the problematic usage of mobile phones while driving in Finland. Mobile phone use was considered across three specific types of usage: (1) handheld phone calls while driving; (2) handsfree phone calls while driving; (3) texting, emailing or social media use while driving. Almost half (49.4 %) of the sample reported using a handheld mobile phone to make a call while driving at least once in the 30 days prior to the survey. A similar percentage (41.4 %) of the sample had used a phone hands-free and 35.6 % had texted, emailed, or used social media. The study highlights how mobile phone usage is a complex and multifaceted issue and that there are a broad range of underlying factors that influence mobile phone usage depending on the way in which people engage with their mobile phone while driving.

How do warnings influence cyclists' reaction to conflicts?

For an effective warning system, the implementation of warning signals is fundamental. However, more knowledge about the cyclist specific design of warnings and the influence of warnings on the cyclist is needed. To analyze the benefit of warnings in conflicts and the reaction pattern of cyclists we conducted a test-track experiment. We evaluated the data of 62 participants who were divided into three warning groups (between-subjects) and encountered different situations (within-subjects). The warning groups either received acoustic, vibro-tactile or no warnings. The situation variable consisted of three conflicts and two false warnings in the groups with warnings. We measured significantly shorter reaction times of persons who received acoustic and vibro-tactile warnings compared to the persons without warning. Furthermore, acoustic warnings led to shorter reaction times compared to vibro-tactile warnings. The reaction pattern was described by different bicycle dynamics variables. It was mostly influenced by the situation and rarely by the warning group. Based on the velocity curves and reaction times we identified learning effects describing how the warned participants adopted the warning system over the five situations. These findings indicate that a warning system offers great safety benefits to cyclists. Based on the current results, acoustic warnings are recommended when an urgent reaction is required.",1369-8478,Not found
Shared space: Different age groups’ perspectives,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.009,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Background Shared spaces, in the context of road transport, often refer to areas shared by unprotected and protected road users and intended to facilitate a living city space for every-one. A basic idea behind shared spaces is to create traffic safety by inducing some uncertainty. This study investigates how young, middle-aged, and elderly pedestrians experience shared space, as well as whether and, if so, how two shared space designs (without and with large flowerpots) affect this experience. Method Thirty-seven participants, divided into three age groups, participated in the study, conducted in Fisherman’s Square, Västervik, Sweden. An adjacent non-signal-regulated pedestrian crossing was used as a control. Two studies – visual scanning and Q studies – were combined. In the visual scanning study, eye-tracking examined how the two designs affected the participants’ visual scanning behaviour (i.e., what participants looked at) as pedestrians. In the Q-study, Q-methodology was used to examine how the two designs affected the participants’ experiences as pedestrians. Results The visual scanning study showed that different age groups were affected in different ways by designs without and with large flowerpots in the shared space. While the middle-aged participants always glanced more often at traffic-relevant objects, and young participants always glanced equally often at traffic-relevant and non-traffic-relevant objects, the elderly participants changed their visual scanning behaviour depending on the design. Without large flowerpots deployed, the elderly participants glanced more often at traffic-relevant than non-traffic-relevant objects. No such difference was obtained when large flowerpots were deployed. The Q-study showed that participants, regardless of age, experienced no great uncertainty in this shared space. The perceived uncertainty, which nevertheless existed, was reduced with large flowerpots deployed to recreate the traditional division with clear zones where pedestrians could stay in relatively car-free areas while motor vehicles had clear paths to travel along. Conclusion The results suggest that shared space, without large flowerpots, succeeded in inducing some uncertainty, especially among middle-aged and elderly pedestrians. However, deploying large flowerpots seemed to decrease this uncertainty, especially among elderly pedestrians. The major concern prompted by these results is how this decreased uncertainty affects traffic safety. Shared space also needs to be studied from the car driver’s perspective to understand the interaction between different road user groups.",1369-8478,Not found
"Moral disengagement mechanisms in interactions of human drivers with autonomous vehicles: Validation of a new scale and relevance with personality, driving style and attitudes",10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.015,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the road transportation systems raises questions with respect to their interactions with human drivers’, especially during the early stages. Issues such as unfamiliarity or false assumptions regarding the timid and safe behaviour of AVs could potentially result in undesirable human driver behaviours, for instance “testing” AVs or being aggressive towards them. Among other factors, morality has been determined as a source of aggressive driving behaviour. Following previous approaches on moral disengagement, the current paper argues that moral standards during interactions of human drivers with AVs could potentially blur, leading to the disengagement of self-regulation mechanisms of moral behaviour. The study investigates the impact of moral disengagement on the intention of human drivers to be aggressive towards AVs. To that end, an online survey was conducted including a newly developed survey of moral disengagement, adapted to the context of AVs. Moreover, measures of personality, driving style, attitudes towards sharing the road with AVs and perceived threats were collected. A confirmatory factor analysis provided support for the concept of moral disengagement in the context of AVs. Moreover, relationships between personality, driving style and attitudes towards sharing the road with AVs were found, via a structural equation modelling approach (SEM). The results could have implications in the future driver training and education programmes, as it might be necessary to not only focus on driving skills but also on the development of procedural skills that will improve the understanding of AVs’ capabilities and ensure safer interactions. Efforts on improving attitudes towards AVs may also be necessary for improving human driver behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Transition patterns of driving style from a traditional driving environment to a connected vehicle environment: A case of an extra-long tunnel road,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.012,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"To provide a better understanding of individual driver’s driving style classification in a traditional and a CV environment, spatiotemporal characteristics of vehicle trajectories on a road tunnel were extracted through a driving simulator-based experiment. Speed, acceleration, and rate of acceleration changes are selected as clustering indexes. The dynamic time warping and k-means clustering were adopted to classify participants into different risk level groups. To assess the driver behavior benefits in a CV environment, an indicator BI (behavior indicator, BI) was defined based on the standard deviation of speed, the standard deviation of acceleration, and the standard deviation of the rate of acceleration change. Then, the index BI of each driver was calculated. Furthermore, this paper explored driving style classification, not in terms of traditional driving environment, but rather the transition patterns from a traditional driving environment to a CV environment. The results revealed that inside a long tunnel, 80 % of drivers benefited from a CV environment. Moreover, drivers might need training before using a CV system, especially female drivers who have low driving mileage. In addition, the results showed that the driving style of 69 % of the drivers’ transferred from a high risk-level to a low risk-level when driving in a CV environment. The study results can be expected to improve driving training education programs and also to provide a valuable reference for developing individual in-vehicle human-machine interface projects and other proactive safety countermeasures.",1369-8478,Not found
Two-step communication for the interaction between automated vehicles and pedestrians,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.016,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"An important challenge of automated vehicles (AV) will be the cooperative interaction with surrounding road users such as pedestrians. One solution to compensate for the missing driver-pedestrian interaction might be explicit communication via external human machine interfaces (eHMIs). Additionally, implicit communication such as a vehicle pitch motion might support AVs when interacting with pedestrians. While previous work explored various explicit and implicit communication cues, these concepts communicated the intention of the AV at one single time point. Currently, empirical findings on two-step communication lack so far. In this study, we empirically test the effect of a two-step AV communication that uses an implicit cue at a long distance and subsequently provides an implicit or explicit cues at a short distance. We compared its efficiency to single-step communication concepts providing implicit or explicit cues at the shorter distance only. To explore whether the right communication cue is used at the right distance, we analyzed pedestrians’ fixations while approaching an AV using an eye tracking device. We conducted a virtual reality study (N = 30) with AV communication concept that provided an active pitch motion or an eHMI and compared them with a two-step AV communication concept that provided an additional active pitch motion at a long distance when approaching the pedestrian. Furthermore, we recorded pedestrians’ fixation behavior while the AV approached. Consistently to previous work, single-step AV communication showed a beneficial effect on crossing behavior. Pedestrians initiated their crossing earlier while approaching an AV with an active pitch motion or an eHMI compared to the baseline condition. While active pitch motion reduced subjective safety feeling, eHMI increased it. However, the two-step communication concept did not further improve pedestrians’ crossing initiation times and their safety feeling. The pattern of fixation behavior differed as a function of AV distance. When the approaching AV was far away, pedestrians exclusively looked at the environment. During the approach, pedestrians gradually fixated the bumper and the hood and only then the windshield of the AV. Hence, it seems to be useful to present an AV intent communication at a certain distance from the pedestrian. These findings posit the importance of considering pedestrians’ fixation behavior when developing communication concepts between AVs and pedestrians.",1369-8478,Not found
It's how you say it – The extended Theory of Planned Behaviour explains active transport use in cardiac patients depending on the type of self-report in a hypothesis-generating study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.005,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Physical activity (PA) plays an essential part in the secondary prevention of persons with coronary heart disease (CHD). A substantial amount of PA can be gained through increasing the use of active transport modes (walking or cycling for at least 10 min/day) in CHD patients’ daily routine, benefiting the mortality and morbidity rate as well as the environment. The current study aims to investigate the utility of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework extended with habit strength, in understanding the behavioural intention and the behaviour of using active transport modes during the daily travel routine of CHD patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 131 CHD patients. The behaviour was measured using three self-report methods; 1) scale measure, the walking or cycling frequency, 2) direct ATS (Active Travel Score, PA calculated by the directly reported aggregated time spent per day for walking or cycling for travel purposes), and 3) indirect ATS (PA calculated by combining the duration spent on trips by walking and cycling from the self-reported one-day travel diary). Additionally, the participants completed surveys on the direct measures of TPB constructs and habit strength. The results indicated that the TPB constructs explained a 38% variance in the intention to use active transport modes of CHD patients, by which the variance increased to 59% with the addition of habit strength. On the contrary, different behavioural measures were explained differently by TPB and habit strength. The scale measure of behaviour was best predicted (up to 21%) by TPB and habit strength. However, the direct and indirect measures of behaviour were poorly explained (up to 3% and 10% only, respectively). Habit strength moderated the relationship between behaviour (scale measure) and behavioural intention. Surprisingly, higher behavioural intention resulted in a lower behavioural frequency when the habit strength to be active is low. This suggests a limited control over the behaviour thus indicating the intention-behaviour gap. The current study findings highlight the inconsistent predictive utility of TPB across different types of behavioural self-report measures, targeted at the use of active transport modes in CHD patients. However, considering this study as hypothesis-generating, further research is necessary to replicate and extend these findings.",1369-8478,Not found
Towards a new approach to detect sleepiness: Validation of the objective sleepiness scale under simulated driving conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.007,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The Objective Sleepiness Scale (OSS) was developed to detect and quantify sleepiness on the basis of two direct and reliable sleepiness indicators: EEG and EOG. The present study aims to test whether the OSS can be used to detect sleepiness episodes that impair performance on driving and vigilance tasks accurately and with a good time synchronization. Forty-three healthy volunteers performed monotonous driving sessions on a simulator and the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) in a normal sleep condition and after partial sleep deprivation. OSS reliability and time synchronization for sleepiness detection were tested on driving (standard deviation of vehicle lateral position and off-road duration) and PVT (reaction time and lapses). Inter-rater reliability of the scale was evaluated by two blinded scorers. Results show that the OSS score indicates higher sleepiness in sleep deprivation conditions (p < 0.001) and with time-on-task. Differences of performance between OSS score calculated with multiple pairwise comparisons, indicate OSS score increase when driving performance (SDLP and off-road duration) decreases (p < 0.001 for comparisons between OSS stages 0 vs 2, 0 vs 3, 1 vs 2 and p < 0.05 for 1 vs 3). Reaction time during PVT is also related to the OSS score (p < 0.05 for OSS values from 0 to 2, 0 to 3, 1 to 2 and 1 to 3). There is no proportional relation between OSS score and performance impairment, but a threshold effect between levels 1 and 2 of the scale is observed. Positive outcomes are also obtained for time synchronization of the OSS assessed on driving performance (p < 0.001 for both SDLP and off-road duration). Finally, inter-rater agreement is found to be considerable. The results allow us to consider using the Objective Sleepiness Scale as a tool for research on sleepiness.",1369-8478,Not found
Modeling the effects of perceived intuitiveness and urgency of various auditory warnings on driver takeover performance in automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.008,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Existing driver models mainly account for drivers’ responses to visual cues in manually controlled vehicles. The present study is one of the few attempts to model drivers’ responses to auditory cues in automated vehicles. It developed a mathematical model to quantify the effects of characteristics of auditory cues on drivers’ response to takeover requests in automated vehicles. The current study enhanced queuing network-model human processor (QN-MHP) by modeling the effects of different auditory warnings, including speech, spearcon, and earcon. Different levels of intuitiveness and urgency of each sound were used to estimate the psychological parameters, such as perceived trust and urgency. The model predictions of takeover time were validated via an experimental study using driving simulation with resultant R squares of 0.925 and root-mean-square-error of 73 ms. The developed mathematical model can contribute to modeling the effects of auditory cues and providing design guidelines for standard takeover request warnings for automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Do sport modes cause behavioral adaptation?,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.017,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"A key question in transportation research is whether drivers show behavioral adaptation, that is, slower or faster driving, when new technology is introduced into the vehicle. This study investigates behavioral adaptation in response to the sport mode, a technology that alters the vehicle’s auditory, throttle-mapping, power-steering, and chassis settings. Based on the literature, it can be hypothesized that the sport mode increases perceived sportiness and encourages faster driving. Oppositely, the sport mode may increase drivers’ perceived danger, homeostatically causing them to drive more slowly. These hypotheses were tested using an instrumented vehicle on a test track. Thirty-one drivers were asked to drive as they normally would with different sport mode settings: Baseline, Modified Throttle Mapping (MTM), Artificial Engine Sound enhancement (AESe), MTM and AESe combined (MTM-AESe), and MTM, AESe combined with four-wheel steering, increased damping, and decreased power steering (MTM-AESe-4WS). Post-trial questionnaires showed increased perceived sportiness but no differences in perceived danger for the three MTM conditions compared to Baseline. Furthermore, compared to Baseline, MTM led to higher vehicle accelerations and, with a smaller effect size, a higher time-percentage of driving above the 110 km/h speed limit, but not higher cornering speeds. The AESe condition did not significantly affect perceived sportiness, perceived danger, and driving speed compared to Baseline. These findings suggest that behavioral adaptation is a functional and opportunistic phenomenon rather than mediated by perceived sportiness or perceived danger.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of daytime running (LED) lights on motorcycles speed estimation: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.002,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Motorcycles are the most common type of vehicle involved in traffic deaths, especially in underdeveloped and developing countries. In order to prevent traffic accidents involving motorcyclists, one of the measures is to respect the “see and be seen” rule. If a motorcycle is perceived in time or another motorcyclist is spotted in time, there is enough time to react, in order to avoid a traffic accident or reduce the consequences. In many countries, it is for this reason that the use of daytime running lights on motor vehicles and/or motorcycles is legally prescribed. In the Republic of Serbia, a country that belongs among the least developed countries, about a third of those killed in traffic accidents are motorcycle drivers. For these reasons, an experimental study was conducted on a driving simulator to examine the importance of (non) use of daytime running lights on the estimation of motorcycle speed. Three different situations were examined: without daytime running lights, with daytime running lights, and with LED daytime running lights; for test speeds of 30 km/h, 50 km/h, 70 km/h, and 90 km/h. In the experiment, 128 young drivers participated. The results showed that the speed of a motorcycle with LED daytime running lights on is perceived most accurately.",1369-8478,Not found
What constitutes traffic event severity in terms of human danger perception?,10.1016/j.trf.2022.08.001,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This study focuses on the severity gradation of non-collision events. Earlier theoretical work has suggested that a proper severity measure for an event should reflect the risk of personal injury, which is often split into two components, including the risk of a collision and the potential consequences had the collision taken place. While a great number of severity measures have been suggested, most of them fail to address both components, thus resulting in counter-intuitive event gradations and inconclusive outcomes in validation studies. Conversely, it has been shown that human observers often show very good agreement when given a task to rank traffic situations by their severity or level of danger. The aim of this study is to investigate in depth how human judgements of the severity of traffic situations can be expressed by means of objective safety indicators. In this study, a set of video-recorded traffic situations, in which a cyclist passes straight through an intersection while a left or right-turning motor vehicle crosses the cyclist’s path, were analysed. Binary logistic regression was used to develop models assessing the most important traffic severity indicators associated with human feelings of danger. The results showed that the initial conditions of a traffic event, defined as a start of an evasive action, contain the most important information for explaining its severity. Moreover, variables related to both proximity and collision consequences are important and should be integrated into severity measures.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of environmental factors and individual differences on subjective evaluation of human-like and conventional automated vehicle controllers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.018,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Achieving optimal performance in human-machine systems, such as highly automated vehicles, relies, in part, on individuals’ acceptance and use of the system, which is in turn affected by their enjoyment of engaging with, or experiencing, the system. This driving simulator study investigated individuals’ real-time subjective evaluation of four different Automated Vehicle (AV) driving styles, in different environmental contexts. Twenty-four participants were recruited to manually drive a contextually rich simulator environment, and to experience human-like and non-human-like AV driving styles, as well as the automated replay of their own manual drive. Their subjective real-time feedback towards these driving styles was analyzed. Our results showed that participants gave higher positive feedback towards the replay of their own drive, compared to the other three controllers. This difference was statistically significant, when compared to the high-speed controller (named as Fast), particularly for sharp curves. With respect to the replay of their own drive, participants gave higher negative feedback when navigating an Urban environment, compared to Rural settings. Moreover, changes in roadside furniture affected individuals’ feedback, and this effect was more prominent when the vehicle was driving closer to the edge of the road. Based on our results, we conclude that individuals’ perception of different AV driving styles changes based on different environmental conditions, including, but not limited to, road geometry and roadside furniture. These findings suggest that humans prefer a slower human-like driving style for AV controllers that adapts its speed and lateral offset to roadside objects and furniture. Investigating individual differences in AV driving style preference showed that low Sensation Seeking individuals preferred the slower human-like controller more than the faster human-like controller. Consideration of this human-centered feedback is important for the design of future AV controllers, to enhance individuals’ ride experience, and potentially improve acceptance and use of these vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Refreshing Older Adults’ Driving Skills (ROADSkills): A randomized controlled trial examining the effect of video feedback,10.1016/j.trf.2022.07.019,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Objectives This study evaluated the effectiveness of a personalized video-based driver training program on the behind-the-wheel skills of community-dwelling older adults. Method In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), 80 older drivers [mean age (SD) = 71.0 (3.9)] were randomly assigned to view one of two educational videos: 1) personalized video feedback on their driving (n = 40) or 2) a generic video on aging-in-place (n = 40). The primary outcome, the total number of errors accrued in a 30-minute standardized on-road evaluation, was analyzed at baseline and 4 weeks after watching the assigned video. On-road evaluations were video-recorded and scored by a blinded rater. Self-report measures of driving abilities, behaviors, and comfort were also compared. Results At the 4-week follow-up, the mean difference in the number of on-road performance errors [mean (95% CI) = -12.0 (-16.6, −7.4), p < 0.001] favored the intervention group compared to controls, with significant improvements across multiple domains: vehicle control [mean (95% CI) = -4.8 (-8.1, −1.5), p < 0.01], observing the roadway [mean (95% CI) = -5.5 (-8.4, −2.6), p < 0.001], and compliance with traffic rules [mean (95% CI) = -1.3 (-2.3, −0.2), p < 0.05]. Within-group change on behind-the-wheel errors was significant for the intervention group [mean (95% CI) = -10.3 (-13.5, −7.1), p < 0.001], but not for the control group [mean (95% CI) = 1.7 (-1.6, 4.9), p > 0.05]. No significant differences were found on the self-report measures. Discussion A novel, video-based approach that provided personalized feedback to older drivers significantly reduced behind-the-wheel errors 4-weeks post-intervention. Changes in self-reported driving behaviors and abilities were not significant.

Predicting pedestrians’ intention to cross the road in front of automated vehicles in risky situations,10.1016/j.trf.2022.05.022,90,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Due to the absence of a human driver, the introduction of fully automated vehicles (FAVs) may bring new safety challenges to the traffic system, especially when FAVs interact with vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. To ensure safer interactions between pedestrians and FAVs, this questionnaire-based study aims to understand Australian pedestrians’ intention to engage in risky road-crossing behaviors when they interact with FAVs vs. human-driven vehicles (HDVs). A 2 × 2 between-subject design was utilized, in which two risky road-crossing scenarios were designed and took into account the vehicle type (FAV vs. HDV) and vehicle speed (30 km/h vs. 50 km/h). A total of 493 participants (aged 18–77) were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions and completed an online questionnaire based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This questionnaire measured pedestrians’ intentions to cross the road in the assigned scenarios as well as the motivational factors behind these intentions in terms of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, perceived risk and trust in the vehicle. The results show that pedestrians had significantly higher intentions to cross the road in front of approaching FAVs than HDVs. Participants also reported a lower risk perception of crossing in front of FAVs and greater trust in this type of vehicle. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were significant predictors of intentions to engage in risky road-crossing behavior. Findings of this study provide important implications for the development and implementation of FAVs in the future road transport system.",1369-8478,Not found

The participants were 922 students, males (48%) and females, aged 10–14 and who attended the seventh (51%) and ninth grades in a medium-sized city in southern Italy. They completed an anonymous self-report questionnaire at school, specifically designed for the research. Measures included mode of transport, level of independent mobility, frequency of risky behaviours as a pedestrian and risk perception of these behaviours. Moreover, students were asked to evaluate the risk, their likely behaviour, and likely motives for risky behaviour in a specific traffic scenario concerning a risky road crossing shown on a video. Gender and age differences were taken into consideration, and relationships between risky behaviour as a pedestrian, level of independent mobility and different measures of risk perception (concerning both risk behaviour as a pedestrian and in the video scenario) were investigated. Results showed that risky behaviours while travelling as a pedestrian were more widespread among ninth grade students and those who were more independent. Moreover, a strong relationship between a greater involvement in risky pedestrian behaviours and lower risk perception and a greater tendency to justify risky behaviours were found in the students. Results suggested the implementation of a prevention programme in early adolescence to improve both risk perception in specific traffic situations and the awareness of motives of risky road behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found

Improved driver behaviour at bus stops on local roads: Comparison of different treatments,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.016,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Every day, millions of students use school bus as a mean of transportation to and from schools. Nevertheless, most of the school bus related crashes occur at or near bus stops. The overtaking of stopped school buses during boarding and alighting of students imposes safety risks on students and drivers. This study aims to investigate the impact of three different treatments on driving behavior at bus stops. In total, this study compared four different conditions. Three of them were treatment conditions namely (Red Pavement, Road Narrowing, and smart LED), which were compared with a control condition (i.e., the default bus stop layout without any additional treatments as implemented in the State of Qatar). Each condition was tested for three situations. Situation 1 and Situation 2 were designed with the presence of a stopped school bus on the same and on the opposite travel directions, respectively, while, Situation 3 was designed without any school bus at the bus stop location. A total of 72 subjects participated in the experiment. Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was employed to study the impact of several factors on the overtaking/crossing probability of the stopped school bus. In Situation 1, Road_narrowing condition outperformed the other conditions by making 94.3 % of drivers to stop for the bus, while in Situation 2, LED condition performed best by making 48.6 % of drivers stop for the bus that is stopped at the opposite travel direction. Moreover, the LED and Road_narrowing treatments were effective in moderating drivers’ speed behavior, lowering their traveling speed by 5.16 km/h and 5.11 km/h, respectively even in the absence of any bus at the bus stop. Physical road narrowing condition outperformed the other tested conditions, and therefore, can be recommended as a low-cost treatment to improve safety at bus stops. In locations where the implementation of physical road narrowing is not feasible, LED treatment can be used to moderate driver traveling speed and stopping behavior.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving around bends with or without shoulders: The influence of bend direction,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.019,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Paved shoulders have long been used to create “forgiving” roads where drivers can maintain control of their vehicles even when as they drift out of the lane. While the safety benefits of shoulders have been well documented, their effects on driver behavior around curves have scarcely been examined. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by assessing whether the addition of shoulders affects driver behavior differently as a function of bend direction. Driver behavior in a driving simulator was analyzed on left and right curves of two-lane rural roads in the presence and absence of 0.75-m and 1.25-m shoulders. The results demonstrated significant changes in drivers’ lateral control when shoulders were provided. In the absence of oncoming traffic, the shoulders caused participants to deviate more toward the inner lane edge at curve entry, at the apex and at the innermost position on right bends but not left ones. In the presence of oncoming traffic, this also occurred at the apex and the innermost position, leading participants to spend more time off the lane on right curves. Participants did not slow down in either traffic condition to compensate for steering farther inside, thereby increasing the risk of lane departure on right curves equipped with shoulders. These findings highlight the direction-specific influence of shoulders on a driver’s steering control when driving around bends. They provide arguments supporting the idea that drivers view paved shoulders as a new field of safe travel on right curves. Recommendations are made to encourage drivers to keep their vehicle within the lane on right bends and to prevent potential interference with cyclists when a shoulder is present.",1369-8478,Not found

Mental models of driver monitoring systems: Perceptions of monitoring capabilities in an online U.S-based sample,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.012,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Driver monitoring, whether accompanying vehicle automation or not, appears poised for wide deployment in the near future. Driver monitoring is itself a form of automation (often needed in response to having automated other aspects of driving), and previous automation research has indicated that accurate mental models are critical to successful human-automation interactions. In this study, a descriptive survey of car owners examined perceived capabilities of generic driver monitoring systems (DMS) to detect 30 different potentially distracting behaviors or adverse mental states. Additional open-ended questions queried drivers about beliefs regarding how DMS work and how they might be defeated. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that perceived capabilities factored into four categories, including beliefs that driver monitoring systems can detect: (1) console and control interactions; (2) smartphone interactions; (3) gaze position and in-cabin movement; and (4) adverse mental states. Although research and industry analysis have suggested that camera-based gaze monitoring will be the path forward, a considerable minority of drivers appear to believe that console interactions will be monitored. Further, car owners in this study generally were skeptical about the ability DMS to detect adverse mental states, which may be in misalignment with the capabilities of systems that will be available in the near future. For future research, questions remain about the potential implications of false alarms (real and perceived) in driver monitoring, as well as the role of experience and initial training/instruction for deployed systems.",1369-8478,Not found

This study intends to compare risk perception and decision-making in high-risk traffic situations between individuals with AD and controls by exploring gaze tracking and hazard detection patterns. The study included 16 individuals with early-stage AD and 26 controls. During the experiment, participants underwent several vision and cognitive tests and watched twelve videos of high-risk traffic situations while their eye movement patterns were being recorded by the eye tracking device, in order to understand how cognitive abilities affect eye movement patterns during high-risk traffic situations. The results revealed poorer cognitive abilities and diminished risk perception in individuals with AD compared with the controls and thus an inability to predict potential accidents. In terms of high-risk traffic situations involving pedestrians, traffic violations by others and view-blocking events, a significant difference in gaze patterns was found between individuals with AD and healthy seniors. The contribution of this study is in elaborating the effect of different traffic event type and specific cognitive abilities on traffic risk-detection in individuals with AD.

Bi-directional vehicle speed data were collected continuously during the week prior to VMS installation (Week1), throughout the week that the anti-speeding messages were displayed (Week2), and a post-display week (Week3). Results Of six separately measured locations, Week2 southbound mean speeds (facing signage) and percent of drivers/riders exceeding the signed speed limit were consistently below those recorded during Week1 for all time periods. Aggregated Week3 (post-VMS) southbound data for all time periods, showed consistent patterns for mean speed and percent of drivers exceeding the signed speed limit, being higher than in Week2 (VMS displayed) but lower than during Week1 (pre-VMS).

In this regard, the Cycling Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ) represents one of the tools available to assess the core dimensions of cycling behaviour and their relationship with road safety outcomes from a behavioural perspective. Nevertheless, it has never been psychometrically approached through a cross-cultural perspective. Therefore, this study aimed to perform the cross-cultural validation of the CBQ, examining its psychometric properties, reliability indexes, validity insights and descriptive scores in 19 countries distributed across five regions: Europe, America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. For this purpose, it was used the data retrieved from a full sample of 7,001 urban cyclists responding to a large-scale electronic survey. Participants had a mean age of M = 36.15 (SD = 14.71), ranging between 16 and 83 years. The results of this large-scale study empirically support the assumption that the 29-item version of the CBQ has a fair dimensional structure and item composition, good internal consistency, reliability indexes, and an interesting set of validity insights. Among these results, there can be highlighted that: (i) Structurally speaking, the questionnaire works better under a three-factor dimensionality, keeping all its 29 items, whose factor loadings are >0.400 in all cases; (ii) The CBQ shows greater reliability indexes than in previous applications using smaller samples, with good Cronbach’s alphas [0.768 - 0.915], McDonald’s omegas [0.770 - 0.913] and Composite Reliability Indexes [981 - 0.994]; and (iii) Robust tests comparing riding behaviours of riders with different levels of risk perception and crash involvement support the concurrent validity of the Cycling Behaviour Questionnaire. These outcomes endorse the usefulness of the CBQ to assess both risky and positive riding behaviours of cyclists in different countries, contributing to assess and improve cycling safety from the human factors approach.",1369-8478,Not found
How distraction affects pedestrian response: Evidence from behavior patterns and cortex oxyhemoglobin changes,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.026,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Objectives Distracted walking is a major cause of pedestrian road traffic injuries, but little is known about how distraction affects pedestrian safety. The study was designed to explore how visual and auditory distraction might influence pedestrian safety. Methods Three experiments were conducted to explore causal mechanisms from two theoretical perspectives, increased cognitive load from the distraction task and resource competition in the same sensory modality. Pedestrians’ behavior patterns and cortex oxyhemoglobin changes were recorded while they performed a series of dual tasks. Results Four primary results emerged: (a) participants responded more slowly to both visual and auditory stimuli in traffic, as well as walked more slowly, while talking on the phone or text messaging compared to when undistracted or listening to music; (b) when participants completed pedestrian response tasks while distracted with a high cognitive load, their response was significantly slower and poorer than when they carried out a lower cognitive load distraction task, (c) participants had higher levels of oxy-Hb change in cortices related to visual processing and executive function while distracted with a higher cognitive load; and (d) participants' responses to traffic lights were slower and resulted in a higher activation in prefrontal cortex and occipital areas when distracted by a visual distraction task compared to when distracted with an auditory task; similarly, brain activation increased significantly in temporal areas when participants responded to an auditory car horn task compared to when they responded to visual traffic lights. Conclusions Both distracting cognitive load demands and the type of distraction task significantly affect young adult pedestrian performance and threaten pedestrian safety. Pedestrian injury prevention efforts should consider the effects of the type of distracting task and its cognitive demands on pedestrian safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving distraction at night: The impact of cell phone use on driving behaviors among young drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.015,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Currently, young drivers are more likely than other drivers to use cell phones while driving at night, which has become a major cause of road crashes. However, limited attention has been given to distracted nighttime driving. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the interaction effect of cell phone use and time of day (daytime and nighttime) on young drivers’ car-following performance. Forty-three young drivers engaged in a driving simulator experiment with a within-subject design that included three distractions (no distraction, talking and texting on a cell phone) and two times of day. This paper applied non-parametrictests to analyze the data and obtained the following results: (1) the standard deviation of lane position (SDLP) did not significantly differ at either time of day under no distraction, but it was significantly higher at night on straight roads and large-radius curves after introducing distractions. In addition, participants drove faster and gave less headway on small-radius curves under both distractions at night; (2) texting significantly increased the SDLP, while there was less lateral variation during the talking tasks than under no distraction on simple road sections; and (3) compared with the experienced drivers, the novice drivers drove faster during the talking tasks on small-radius curves, but there was no significant difference between groups during the texting tasks. These findings provide both theoretical and practical implications for related policy makers to enhance traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found
The detection of vulnerable road users by younger and older drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.018,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"The detection of vulnerable road users (VRUs), especially under time constraints, may be impaired in elderly drivers, due to their visual and cognitive decline. This represents a major concern for road safety. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of aging on the detection of VRUs. A further aim was to investigate the impact of external factors on VRU detection. Twenty-two young adults, 20 younger-old adults, and 32 older-old adults were included in the study. A series of photographs were displayed for 500 ms. Participants were asked to detect the VRU, which could be a motorcyclist, a cyclist, or a pedestrian. The VRU was located at one of two distances (near/far), one of two locations (off-centered/centered), and in two car-DRL (daytime running lights) environments (on/off). The ability to correctly detect a VRU was measured. An eye-tracker was used to record eye movements. The main findings showed that VRU-detection performance decreased with aging, even in the younger-old group (ages 55–68). The ability to correctly detect a VRU by older-old adults was poorer particularly when the VRU was a motorcyclist or a cyclist. As a whole, the older-old adults made more fixations to correctly detect the VRU than the other two age groups did. Moreover, the visual angle between the gaze of the participant’s last fixation and the target in the older-old group was lower than in the other two groups, particularly when the VRU was off-centered. This finding suggests that older-old adults compensated for their visual-field decline by doing more visual exploration than the other two groups did to correctly detect the VRU. The results are discussed with regards to age-related cognitive and visual deficits. Word count: 279.",1369-8478,Not found
"Multimodal travel behaviour, attitudes, and cognitive dissonance",10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.007,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Multimodal travel behaviour, also termed multimodality, refers to as the phenomenon of an individual using more than one mode of transport in a given period. Studies indicate that encouraging multimodality may provide a solution to induce modal shifts towards sustainable transport. In this research, we investigate the distribution of mode-specific attitudes and attitude-mode use incompatibilities across clusters and levels of multimodality using the Netherlands Mobility Panel. We find that the most positive attitude does not necessarily correspond to the mode with the highest level of use. Attitudes towards car use are most positive, independent of the cluster membership and levels of multimodality. We also find that multimodal public transport users (compared with car-dominant users) and those with a higher level of multimodality are more likely to be attitudinally incompatible with frequently-used modes and the composition of their existing mode sets of travelling. This suggests that multimodal individuals may tend to experience cognitive dissonance with their mode use. Our findings also help uncover the psychological mechanism underlying a recent important finding that multimodal individuals are inclined to change their mode use patterns over time.",1369-8478,Not found
Basic psychological need frustration scale: Adaptation and validation to active commuting to school in Spanish children and adolescents,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.010,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Based on self-determination theory (SDT), the aims of this study were to adapt the Psychological Need Thwarting Scale to active commuting to and from school, as well as to gather information about validity and reliability of the Basic Psychological Need Frustration Scale in Active Commuting to and from School (BPNFS-ACS). A total of 285 children and adolescents, aged 10–17 years, participated (49.47 % girls; Mage = 12.88, SDage = 2.16). Need satisfaction and frustration, as well as motivation for ACS were measured. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis supported the 12-item three-factor correlated model, which was invariant across gender and age. Convergent validity was met with suitable values for average variance extracted. Discriminant validity was obtained by acceptable values for the heterotrait–monotrait ratio of correlations and the correlations among the three latent factors. Reliability was also supported by adequate scores on Cronbach’s alpha, Raykov’s coefficient, and intra-class correlation coefficient. Criterion validity was evidenced by a negative prediction from need frustration to active commuting to school, and a positive association of need satisfaction with active commuting to school. Results support the use of the BPNFS-ACS for the purpose of gaining deeper insight into the “dark side” of motivation for active school transport among Spanish children and adolescents.",1369-8478,Not found
Longer-term exposure vs training: Their effect on drivers' mental models of ADAS technology,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.017,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Drivers often learn about the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) on their vehicles over time and through trial and error. While this experience can aid drivers’ understanding about the systems, it may not necessarily lead to sufficient and accurate mental models, especially concerning less frequent “edge case” situations. This study recruited 39 new owners of vehicles equipped with ADAS technology to which the owners were naïve. The initial mental model of these owners was evaluated using a mental model assessment. To understand changes in mental models over time the assessment was repeated six times over the course of approximately 6 months. Weekly mileage, technology usage, and information regarding their exposure to edge case scenarios was also collected. At the end of the 6 months, participants completed a simulator drive using adaptive cruise control (ACC) that included several edge cases. Over the course of the first 6 months of vehicle ownership, drivers’ scores on the mental model assessment improved. These improvements were largely due to increased understanding of the technology’s limitations as opposed to improvements in knowledge about system function. With respect to driving performance in the simulator session, the mental model scores were not predictive of responses to the edge cases. However, a comparison of those mental model scores against weak and strong mental model benchmark scores gathered in a previous study revealed that mental models improve over 6 months (for some drivers), but not to the level of understanding of a group that received a short but extensive introduction to ACC. This suggests that there is room for improvement in how drivers gain understanding about driver support features and further underscores the need of training and education for proper use and interactions.",1369-8478,Not found
Devil in the details: Systematic review of TOR signals in automated driving with a generic classification framework,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.009,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Background Meta studies on factors contributing to take-over performance did not include the design of take-over request (TOR) signals, other than the modality at which TORs are presented. A detailed understanding of the influence of TOR design on take-over performance is therefore lacking. Objective To gain an overview of the level of detail with which TOR designs are reported in academic literature, by using and evaluating a novel classification framework. In this framework TORs are classified in terms of modalities, classes, and underlying attributes. Furthermore, the framework involves classification of potentially competing background signals, as well as the setting in which a study is performed. Method A systematic review was performed on articles written in English that were published between 2014 and 2021 using Web of Science, as well as articles retrieved from two previous TOR classification studies and three meta studies on take-over performance. Studies were considered for subsequent analysis if they involved a downward transition of the level of automation following a TOR, resulting in a sample of 391 TORs found in 189 studies. Results No predominant TOR design was found, and a considerable part of the available design space has not yet been explored. Studies reported less information on TOR designs when examining TOR designs at an increased level of detail. On average, attribute information was reported for half of the TORs per class. Conclusions More attention towards a detailed description of TOR implementations is needed and how this can impact experimental findings. The classification framework and the corresponding coding sheet could support systematic reporting and subsequent meta-analysis in future work. This way, a better understanding about the impact of TOR design on take-over performance can be gained, which in turn can support implementation of safe and effective TORs in (automated) vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Measured increases in steering entropy may predict when performance will degrade: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.006,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"We investigated the effect of time-on-task on driver’s mental workload and driving performance during a simulated driving task. The extent of mental workload was estimated from steering entropy, while driver performance was measured from the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) and the Standard Deviation (SD) Sterring Angle. Seventeen participants underwent a simulated highway driving task for 60 min. The results show that mental workload increased significantly after 15 min, whereas driving performance did not degrade until 30 min. These results suggest that when drivers first affected by time-on-task, they can cope with the situation by increasing mental effort investment and can manage to perform normally for a while (15 min). Since changes in steering entropy precede changes in driving performance, this measure of mental workload may have utility as a predictor of increased accident risk.",1369-8478,Not found
Audiovisual time-to-collision estimation for accelerating vehicles: The acoustic signature of electric vehicles impairs pedestrians' judgments,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.023,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"To avoid collisions, pedestrians intending to cross a road need to accurately estimate the time-to-collision (TTC) of an approaching vehicle. For TTC estimation, auditory information can be considered particularly relevant when the approaching vehicle accelerates. The sound of vehicles with internal combustion engine (ICEVs) provides characteristic auditory information about the acceleration state (increasing rotational speed and engine load). However, for electric vehicles (EVs), the acoustic signature during acceleration is less salient. Although the auditory detection of EVs has been studied extensively, there is no research on potential effects of the altered acoustic signature of EVs on TTC estimation. To close this gap, we compared TTC estimates for ICEVs and for EVs with and without activated acoustic vehicle alerting system (AVAS). We implemented a novel interactive audiovisual virtual-reality system for studying the human perception of approaching vehicles. Using acoustic recordings of real vehicles as source signals, the dynamic spatial sound field corresponding to a vehicle approaching in an urban setting is generated based on physical modeling of the sound propagation between vehicle and pedestrian (listener) and is presented via sound field synthesis (higher-order Ambisonics). In addition to the auditory simulations, the scene was visually presented on a head-mounted display with head tracking. Participants estimated the TTC of vehicles that either approached at a constant speed or accelerated positively. In conditions with constant speed, TTC estimates for EVs with and without AVAS were similar to those for ICEVs. In contrast, for accelerating vehicles, there was a substantial effect of the vehicle type on the TTC estimates. For the EVs, the mean TTC estimates showed a significant overestimation. Thus, subjects on average perceived the time of arrival of the EV at their position as longer than it actually was. The extent of overestimation increased with acceleration and presented TTC. This pattern is similar to a first-order TTC estimation representing a failure to consider the acceleration, which is consistently reported in the literature for visual-only presentations of accelerating objects. In comparison, the overestimation of TTC was largely reduced for the accelerating ICEVs. The AVAS somewhat improved the TTC estimates for the accelerating EVs, but without reaching the same level of accuracy as for the ICEVs. In real traffic scenarios, overestimations of the TTC of approaching vehicles might lead to risky road-crossing decisions. Therefore, our finding that pedestrians are significantly less able to use the acoustic information emitted by accelerating EVs for their TTC judgments, compared to accelerating ICEVs, has important implications for road safety and for the design of AVAS technologies.",1369-8478,Not found
Illusion of safety? Safety-related perceptions of pedestrians and car drivers around 3D crosswalks,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.003,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Facilitating safe pedestrian road crossings is a major prerequisite for safe urban environments. In multiple cities around the world, 3D crosswalks have been painted, which provoke an optical illusion, of e.g., a crosswalk floating above the road, in car drivers who approach the crosswalk. However, to date, no detailed study of road users’ safety related perceptions on 3D crosswalks has been conducted. Hence, we investigated car drivers’ and pedestrians’ perceptions of a 3D crosswalk, and how they rate its safety in comparison to traditional (non-3D illusion) crosswalks. In an on-site questionnaire survey, we interviewed 201 pedestrians and 102 car drivers in the direct vicinity of a newly painted 3D crosswalk located in Yangon, Myanmar. Our results show that only 53.9% of the car drivers report to have consciously perceived the 3D effect of the crosswalk. Nonetheless, both, pedestrians and car drivers rate the 3D crosswalk as safer for road crossing than a traditional crosswalk. A high share of pedestrians (43.3%) report taking a detour to use the 3D crosswalk for road crossing. Approximately one third (31.3%) of pedestrians and 48.0% of car drivers interviewed have talked to their friends about the 3D crosswalk, indicating a high potential for using 3D crosswalks as a marketing tool for road safety actors to generate attention for pedestrian safety. Unrelated to our main research question, we found that pedestrians prefer to cross in groups, as it increases the perceived likelihood of cars yielding to them. Overall, the data points to significant increases in the perceived safety of drivers as well pedestrians around the 3D crosswalk. Future studies need to investigate how these perceptions translate to actual safety related behavior.",1369-8478,Not found
A systematic review of observational studies investigating the influence of mobile phone distraction on road crossing behaviour of pedestrians,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.008,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"The growing prevalence of technological distractions amongst pedestrians makes it an important road safety concern. Observational studies are considered a reliable method to investigate the influence of mobile phone distraction on pedestrian road crossing behaviour and crash risks. The present study conducts a systematic review of international literature on pedestrian distraction observations by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 792 studies were identified from the literature search on six research databases: Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane library, and Transportation Research International Documentation (TRID). Finally, 39 research articles were assessed using the systematic classification scheme based on the following five research aspects: prevalence of mobile phone distraction, study locations, performance measures, analysis techniques, and additional factors associated with mobile phone use among pedestrians. Over 35% of the studies were conducted in the United States of America (USA) and 69% of the investigations were done in the last five years. Overall, the findings across the studies indicate that mobile phone distraction plays a major role in pedestrian risky road crossing behaviour and violation tendencies. Visual distractions (such as texting) exhibited higher behavioural impairment compared to cognitive distractions (e.g., listening to music, and conversations). Pedestrian characteristics such as gender and age were the key factors examined in 77% and 67% of the observational studies.

Effect of design factors on drivers’ understanding of variable message signs locating traffic events,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.005,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Background This article addresses how to combine three elements (a pictogram, an arrow, a city) in a variable message sign (VMS) to locate temporary events (e.g., “congestion before Milan”). We adopted the G1c stack model as a design template, an Advanced Directional Sign (ADS) recommended by the 1968 Convention to locate cities, which can be easily adapted to modern VMS. However, as most of the VMS in operation are not full-matrix, we have also adapted this design to more restrictive display conditions. This adaptation critically concerned the arrow function on the message that either points up broadly (generically, as in G1c) or connects with the city more specifically (explicit). Although G1c reads top-down like a verbal text, previous studies indicated drivers’ preference for bottom-up landmark order in VMS, so both ordering criteria were compared in the present study. Methods The experiment involved 99 people (70 drivers and 29 drivers in training). Participants were informed that they would see various VMS reporting certain events (e.g., congestion) related to one of four cities along the road. Their task was to identify the event location (before, after the city) after seeing blocks of two consecutive messages (first a complementary message, then the target message), limiting their response to the content of the second message. Three design-focused factors were tested: typographical alignment (left or centre), landmark order (bottom-up or top-down), and arrow function (explicit or generic). The rate of correct location answers was the dependent variable. Results Results revealed that comprehension varied greatly depending on the arrow’s function and the placing of elements. In the explicit-arrow messages, comprehension was good both in the Top-down and Bottom-up conditions, but in the generic-arrow messages, only in the Bottom-up condition was comprehension good. Likewise, understanding was better in the Before condition than in the After condition in all combinations of Landmark order and Arrow function conditions. In general, left alignment of the central column elements of the VMS improved comprehension respective to centred alignment. Finally, the complementary message factor had an effect under certain circumstances. Practical implications The messages displaying a generic arrow (following the G1c model) were better understood when the landmarks were ordered bottom-up, not top-down. In addition, explicit-arrow messages were better understood per se (in the absence of a complementary message) than generic-arrow messages. Overall, this work suggests that improving our understanding of how thought processes and design features relate to each other can contribute to safer driving nationally and internationally.",1369-8478,Not found
An analysis of factors affecting wrong-way driving at a highway entrance using a driving simulator among older drivers with cognitive decline,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.014,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"About 200 highway wrong-way driving cases occur annually in Japan, of which about 70% are caused by older drivers. The number of these cases has remained consistent despite adoption of full-fledged measures against wrong-way driving, thus demonstrating the need for further measures. Reports indicate that older drivers include those with cognitive decline. Moreover, it has been revealed that drivers over 75 years of age who caused wrong-way driving had lower test scores in the usual cognitive function tests performed at the time of licence renewal. However, there is no clear evidence on the relationship between cognitive decline and driving behaviour that stimulates wrong-way driving. In this paper, we reproduced a wrong-way driving approaching a right turn to an expressway exit in a virtual environment using a driving simulator for older drivers, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition to the measurement of driving behaviour and eye-tracking during simulator driving, we conducted a cognitive function test to investigate the relationship between driving behaviour and visual behaviour factors that initiate reverse running and cognitive decline. The results revealed that the reason for the start of a highway wrong-way driving may be a human error at the recognition stage of overlooking a visual wrong-way driving countermeasure, or a human error at the judgement stage of failing to suppress action despite noticing the visual countermeasure. Additionally, attentional and executive functions were related to the wrong-way initiative, although MCI did not affect it. This suggests that those who could not control their wrong-way driving behaviour despite observing the signs had specific executive function deficits.",1369-8478,Not found

In this study, 21 elements associated with the acceptance of autonomous driving are defined. The Kano model is used to classify the acceptance elements into five attributes and to propose guidelines for improving acceptance. Driver characteristics are classified based on four human factors, which are used to investigate differences in acceptance between groups. A Google survey and fieldwork were completed by 187 participants. Contrary to previous studies, no significant gender differences are observed in the current study. In terms of age, many obstacles are encountered in securing autonomous driving acceptance from the elderly driver group.

Effect of multiple monitoring requests on vigilance and readiness by measuring eye movement and takeover performance,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.001,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Drivers do not need to supervise the L3 automated driving system but have to resume dynamic driving tasks when necessary, where the takeover request system plays a crucial role in alerting drivers to take over control. Previous studies have investigated the feasibility of the two-stage takeover system, which divides the takeover request system into monitoring requests and takeover requests. However, whether it will affect drivers’ situation awareness and takeover performance if the monitoring request is issued multiple times without the takeover request has not been fully considered. This research conducted a driving simulation study to investigate the effect of multiple monitoring requests on participants’ vigilance to monitoring requests and readiness for takeover requests by measuring their eye movement and takeover performance. Forty-two participants experienced three kinds of takeover conditions: no monitoring request, once monitoring request, and four monitoring requests. Simultaneously, the eye movement and takeover performance of participants were recorded and analyzed. Results showed that participants gained sufficient situation awareness in the monitoring request phase and showed better takeover performance in the two-stage takeover system than the single-stage takeover system. However, participants’ vigilance to the monitoring request and readiness for the takeover request decreased after experiencing multiple monitoring requests. Specifically, 62% and 59% of participants put their hands on the steering wheel during the monitoring request phase when experiencing the first monitoring request, which decreased to 35% after experiencing four monitoring requests. Moreover, after experiencing multiple monitoring requests, more participants shifted their attention to non-driving-related tasks after first observing the road and with a reduced percentage of time in the road center. These findings suggest that the monitoring request should be more reasonable to avoid reducing the vigilance and readiness of drivers to take advantage of the two-stage takeover system effectively.",1369-8478,Not found

VR experiments can provide an objective and accurate measurement of pedestrian behaviors, thus improving the understanding of complicated pedestrian behaviors. Based on experimental data from 200 university students, we identified pedestrians’ crossing behavior that is cautionary or risky concerning various physical safety designs of streets. This study found that there are trade-off relationships between various behaviors which should be systematically studied to produce safer street design guidelines. Furthermore, as the contexts and sequences matter in behaviors for intersection crossing, the interpretation of behaviors should carefully consider the context of built environments and sequential decisions made by pedestrians.

A main cause of crashes is the misinformation of drivers as they fail to sense relevant visual information. We aimed to analyze the gaze behavior of car drivers in a variety of intersection scenarios, bringing together the partial findings of previous research, and examine the interdependencies of the contributing factors to provide a database for driver modeling. In a driving simulator study with 59 participants, we varied intersection scenarios regarding drivers’ right of way (yield sign, green traffic light), intersection type (T junction, X intersection), surrounding traffic (none, irrelevant, relevant), and intended driving maneuver (left turn, right turn, going straight). A total of 25 intersection scenarios were presented in a within-subjects design to a control group and a group with a cognitive load task (counting back in numbers of two). Fixations were coded regarding defined areas of interest in the field of view and separated according to three segments of the intersection approach: 75–50 m, 50–25 m, and 25–0 m before entering the intersection. The results show that the effect of surrounding traffic, secondary task engagement, and the intended driving maneuver changed dramatically depending on the right of way of the driver. Surrounding traffic primarily affected gaze behavior in scenarios of ceding the right of way close to the intersection entry. The cognitive load task increased fixations on the road center especially in situations where the driver had the right of way, but less in situations of ceding the right of way. Interactions with the type of intersection were only apparent for different driving maneuvers. This study provides a detailed and comprehensive picture of drivers’ attentional processes when approaching intersections which is relevant for understanding and modeling of driver behavior in urban traffic.",1369-8478,Not found
"Identifying the determinants and understanding their effect on the perception of safety, security, and comfort by pedestrians and cyclists: A systematic review",10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.004,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"The continuous growth of the world population and its agglomeration in urban cities, demand an increasing need for mobility, which in turn contributes to the worsening of traffic congestion and pollution in cities. Therefore, it is necessary to promote active travel, such as walking and cycling. However, this is not an easy task, as pedestrians and cyclists are the most vulnerable link in the system, and low levels of safety, security and comfort can contribute to choosing private cars over active travel. Hence, it is essential to understand the determinants that affect the perceptions of pedestrians and cyclists, in order to support the definition of policies that promote the use of active modes of transport. Thus, this article fills an important gap in the literature by identifying and discussing the objective and subjective determinants that affect the perceptions of safety, security and comfort of pedestrians and cyclists, through a systematic review of the literature published in the last ten years. It followed the PRISMA statement guidelines and checklist, resulting in 68 relevant articles that were carefully analyzed. The results show that the perception of safety is negatively affected by fear of traffic-related injuries, fear of falling related to infrastructure and infrastructure maintenance, and negative behavior of drivers. Regarding security, crime was the major concern of pedestrians and cyclists, either with emphasis on the person or on personal property. With regard to comfort, high levels of air and noise pollution, lack of vegetation, bad weather conditions, slopes and long commuting distances negatively affected the users' perception. The results also suggest that poor lighting affects all domains, providing a negative perception of safety, security and comfort. Similarly, the presence of people is seen as negatively influencing the perception of safety and comfort, while the absence of people negatively impacts the perception of security. Therefore, the findings achieved by this study are key to assist in the definition of transport policies and infrastructure creation in large smart cities. Additionally, new transport policies are proposed and discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Eco driving as a road safety measure: Before and after study of three companies,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.012,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This study reports the results of a natural before and after study of economic driving and use of fleet management system recording driving style as a road safety measure. The study includes three companies studied on three occasions, in: 1) 2013, 2) 2018 and 3) 2020. Surveys in all the companies were conducted in 2013 and 2018, and interviews were conducted at all three time points. Two of the companies (Company B and C) started working actively with fleet management system as a measure for economic driving between measurement time points 1 and 2. The third company had such a measure in place before time point 1 (Company A). Company A is therefore used as a “control company”. The study indicates that measures for economic driving in general and fleet management systems in particular have a good effect on road safety and economy. This applies to fleet management systems focusing on aspects of economic and safe driving. The accident risk in Company B and C decreased significantly in the post-measurement in 2018, and the safety culture improved. The interview data supports the conclusion of lower accident risk. The discussion indicates that these results cannot be explained by referring to other safety measures during the period, changes in framework conditions, demographic changes in the samples, or a decrease in the risk of property damage accidents with heavy goods vehicles during the study period. However, it is concluded that implementing safety management systems have better effect on road safety than fleet management systems, because Company A, which has the former, has a higher level of road safety than the other two companies.",1369-8478,Not found
Road safety behaviors: Role of control beliefs and risk perception,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.021,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Nowadays, drivers (both professional and private) are exposed to many risks, including accidents, for which prevention is becoming a major concern. Studies showed that understanding drivers' beliefs and perceptions of road risk is an important avenue to explore for the purpose of an effective prevention (Brewer et al., 2007; Kouabenan, 1998, 2002). This article looks at the relationship between control beliefs, risk perception, and road safety behaviors. One thousand and seventeen Moroccan professional and private drivers were asked to answer a questionnaire including scales measuring control beliefs, road risk perception and reported road safety behaviors. The results showed that drivers who possess a high sense of control over road risks tend to have a low perception of these risks and to adopt fewer safety behaviors. In addition, it is observed that drivers tend to adopt safer behaviors when they perceive road risk as high. The practical implications of this study for prevention are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Group cycling safety behaviours: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.013,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Background The popularity of cycling in a group is longstanding and increasing. Compared to riding as an individual, many cyclists feel safer when riding in a group as they have better personal security, potential support in case of mishaps, safer wayfinding and are more visible to other road users. However, further to the safety challenges shared with individual cyclists, group cyclist safety is impacted by rider proximity, the larger space taken up on roadways, potentially higher speeds, and social norms that could increase risky behaviours. Despite these unique safety considerations, the practice of cycling in groups has received little academic attention and group cyclist safety behaviours have not been analysed by road safety researchers. Objective To identify, describe, categorise and conceptualise within a teamwork framework, safety related behaviours of groups of cyclists as mentioned in academic literature. Methods Three academic databases (Google Scholar, Proquest, and Scopus) were searched for peer reviewed literature that mentioned safe or risky behaviours of groups of cyclists. A total of 32 papers met the inclusion criteria. Relevant group cyclist behaviours were described and categorised using a conceptual teamwork framework. Results Group cyclists’ safety behaviours are governed by a comprehensive but informal and adaptable set of rules. These rules are safety critical and are often strictly controlled within groups. Many groups of cyclists may ride in a safer manner than individual cyclists due to teamwork factors, particularly shared mental models, team orientation, and adaptability. Conclusion Group cyclists take safety seriously. Teamwork factors may make behavioural interventions to decrease risky behaviours easier to implement with group cyclists compared to individual cyclists. Investigation of group cycling safety behaviours may inform safe system interventions to increase road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
"The need for speed: Scores on a new video-based measure of speeding propensity, suitable for use in online research, correlate with drivers’ on-road speeding behaviour",10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.022,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"A video-based measure of drivers’ speeding propensity (the UQ Video Speed Test) was developed for use in both laboratory-based and online research studies. In the test, the respondent is presented with a series of 16 video clips of traffic footage, which were shot from the driver’s perspective using a camera mounted behind the windscreen of a moving car. For each clip, the respondent’s task is to indicate to what extent they would travel faster or slower than the speed of the camera car. Responses to all clips are averaged to determine the respondent’s overall score. In the present study, we investigated associations between drivers’ video speed test scores and five measures of real everyday speeding behaviour obtained over a 5-week period using GPS trackers. There was a significant positive correlation for each of the five on-road speeding measures. In addition, age-related differences in test scores were consistent with observed real-world group differences in speeding behaviour. Test scores also correlated with an established self-report questionnaire measure of speeding (i.e., the Speed Scale from the Driving Style Questionnaire). Overall, the data supported the use of the UQ Video Speed Test as a proxy measure of drivers’ real-world speeding behaviour in laboratory-based and online studies (though it would be inadvisable to use such tests in the assessment of drivers for licensing purposes, due to the potential to “fake good”). The test can be deployed using standard online survey platforms (e.g., Qualtrics), and is available at no cost for use in driving research.",1369-8478,Not found
Does it deliver what it promises? Evaluation of cognitive distraction caused by speech-based interfaces with detection response and box task,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.020,91,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Speech is considered a promising modality for human-machine interaction while driving, especially in reducing visual and manual distraction. However, speech-based user interfaces themselves have shown to increase cognitive distraction. There remains a lack of standardized and unambiguous methods for measuring the impact of speech-based assistants on cognitive distraction while driving. This work aims to investigate whether the combination of the box task and the detection response task (DRT) is a suitable method for assessing the cognitive distraction caused by speech-based assistants. For this purpose, participants (N = 39) engaged in artificial (n-back tasks) and natural speech-based secondary tasks (interaction with Android’s Google Assistant and Apple's Siri) differing in predefined levels of cognitive workload while performing the box task and the DRT. The results showed that DRT performance differed between the 0-back and 1-back task but not between the different cognitive workload levels of the speech-based assistants. No clear effects emerged for the box task parameters. Thus, the combination of the box task and DRT is well-suited for measuring cognitive distraction caused by artificial secondary tasks but not by natural interactions with speech-based assistants.",1369-8478,Not found
"Driver behavioural adaptations to simulated automated vehicles, potential implications for traffic microsimulation",10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.012,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The ongoing technological development of automated vehicles is bringing their implementation ever closer. Until all vehicles are completely automated there will be a mix of human driven and automated vehicles. To assess impacts of such automated vehicles on traffic safety and flow, techniques involving traffic microsimulations are often used. Here mixed traffic scenario’s are simulated by assigning different behavioural models to automated and to human driven vehicles. The human driver models generally remain unchanged when simulating different penetration rates of automated vehicles. In the real world, however, phenomena like social contagion could result in changes in human driving behaviour when automated vehicle penetration rates increase. To investigate such adaptive behaviour a simulator study was conducted where participants were asked to drive the same route three times, each time with a different penetration rate of automated vehicles. The simulated automated vehicles were assigned driving behaviour that resulted in a shorter time-headway, stricter speed control and a reduced reaction time compared to the simulated human drivers. The results show that when the penetration rate of automated vehicles increased the participants adopted shorter time-headways, smaller following distances, less variable velocity more closely resembling the maximum allowed speed, and reduced reaction times with faster acceleration at traffic lights. These findings suggest that driving behaviour changes when the composition of surrounding traffic changes. In order to more accurately use traffic microsimulation to estimate effects of mixed traffic it is therefore important to ensure that human driver models are updated to incorporate social contagion effects.",1369-8478,Not found
Motivations for watching videos on mobile phones while driving in parking lots and while waiting at intersections in the United States,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.002,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This is a two-part mixed methods study that investigated motivations for watching videos on mobile phones while driving. We make three theoretical contributions in this paper. First, we specifically examine watching videos on mobile phones while driving, whereas previous studies examine calling, texting, monitoring messages, and using apps. Second, we specifically focus on waiting at intersections and driving in parking lots; parking lots have not been studied in previous studies. Third, we incorporate perception about the law into the Theory of Planned Behavior model as a predictor of intention. The quantitative survey yielded responses measuring each variable in our extended Theory of Planned Behavior model. We found that although people don’t watch videos on their phones while driving as much as they text or converse, the rates of watching are disturbingly high (41% watch at intersections). The intention to watch while driving is a significant predictor of behavior, and attitude is a significant predictor of intention in both scenarios. Moral norms are significant predictors of intention in the parking lot scenario. Nearly half (48%) of drivers don’t know their state laws regarding mobile phone use while driving. Neither knowledge about state law with respect to watching videos on mobile phones while driving nor the actual state law about using handheld devices while driving is a significant predictor of the intention to watch videos while driving. The qualitative survey yielded open-ended responses on drivers’ salient beliefs about watching videos on mobile phones while driving. We propose using a multitude of laws to reduce mobile phone use while driving, and requiring drivers to take a short course on distracted driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Modelling the effect of aggressive driver behavior on longitudinal performance measures during car-following,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.006,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Driving aggression is a major concern during car-following situations as it is closely associated with collision risk and crash severity. Despite the tendency of reckless driving actions and increased crash risk with the vehicle ahead, aggressive driver behavior remains unexplored. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of aggressive driver behavior (three driver categories: aggressive, moderately aggressive, and non-aggressive drivers) and drivers’ tendency to aggressive stimuli (due to lead vehicle (vehicle moving ahead) reckless driving) on car-following behavior. A sample of fifty-eight Indian drivers participated in this study. All the experiments were conducted using a driving simulator. The simulator design includes a lead vehicle dynamic maneuver with rapid accelerations and decelerations (at 1 m/s2, 1.5 m/s2, and 2 m/s2). Three longitudinal performance measures including speed variability (SPV) from LV, speed recovery time (SRCT), and time spent tailgating, were analyzed during LV acceleration stage using generalized linear models (GLM). Further, to assess collision avoidance behavior and crash risk, deceleration adjusting time (DAT) was analyzed during the LV sudden deceleration stage using Weibull Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) analysis. The findings indicate that due to their tendency to risk-raking behavior, aggressive drivers decreased their SPV and SRCT by 25 % and 18 %, respectively. The time spent tailgating increased by 107 % for aggressive drivers. The survival probabilities were decreased by 23.77 % for aggressive drivers at 3 sec DAT. The findings of the study can be used in car-following models to enhance the model performance, improve the reliability of simulation tools, and design interventions to improve safety (in automated driving).",1369-8478,Not found
Strong predictors of offender drivers: Drug and alcohol addiction and the inability to dissociate binge alcohol or drug consumption from driving. Revoking their driver's licence may not be enough,10.1016/j.trf.2022.12.002,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The causes underlying traffic offender behaviour might be the tip of the iceberg that represents a persistent burden on global health and serves to detect other serious social, family, work problems. Better understanding and prevention of recidivism following a First-time driving under the influence conviction and analysis of High Risk offender driver behaviors are needed. This study seeks to identify the factors that predict an offender driver profile, analysing not only drivers’ general use of alcohol and/or drugs, but also their ability to dissociate the use of alcohol and other substances from driving. A total of 315 drivers — 97 offenders (95.9 % men) and 218 non-offenders (47.2 % men) responded to a battery of self-report evaluation questionnaires on: alcohol use habits (measured with the AUDIT); drug use (measured with the DAST-20); the ability of dissociating alcohol and substance use from driving; educational level; self-reported traffic violations, errors and lapses (measured with the DBQ, Driver Behaviour Questionnaire); and sociodemographic questions. The model showed good fit indicators (R2 = 0.74). It also displayed good predictive power: (1). It correctly classified 91 % of participants as offender or non-offender drivers. (2). More specifically, its sensitivity was 88 %, having correctly classified offenders as offenders. And its specificity was 92 %, having correctly classified non-offenders as non-offenders. The findings underscores that not only is alcohol use a key predictor of offending behaviour, but so is drug use. These addictions are a health problem, and their consequences are more serious when the afflicted individual drives a vehicle. This article makes evident that repeat offenders have a lower ability of dissociating alcohol and substance use from driving than do non-offender drivers. Non-offenders are shown to be more capable than offenders of dissociating consumption from driving: offender drivers are unable to dissociate the consumption of more than 5 spirit drinks, or the consumption of cannabis, from driving. More than half of non-offender drivers admitted to driving after having had 1 or 2 beers. Along these same lines, we found that offenders believe they have fewer lapses than non-offenders. This could be due to the optimism bias of bold offender drivers, who overestimate their abilities and underestimate their lapses. We also found that offender drivers have a lower educational level. Revoking the High Risk offender’s driver’s licence may not be enough. Instead, High Risk Offenders should be given the support they need to give up the consumption of alcohol and drugs, at least while driving. This could be achieved if they receive motivational interventions and are referred for detoxification treatment.",1369-8478,Not found
A speed limit advisory system provided by in-vehicle HMI considering auditory perception characteristics for connected environment,10.1016/j.trf.2022.12.004,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"In-vehicle HMI (Human Machine Interface) systems are well studied due to their great application prospect, but the recent development of connected technologies raises more possibilities that this technology provides more accurate speed limit warnings to ensure driver safety according to specific vehicle and road parameters. To capitalize on the potential of in-vehicle HMI systems to provide auditory and visual warnings to drivers and to improve adoption and utilization of this warning information. To this end, we designed a speed limit advisory system (SLAS) that recommended reduced speeds for hazardous sections of road, communicated to drivers by their in-vehicle HMI systems. Frontal distance models of single and gradient auditory warning were implanted into the systems to determine the warning timing. We then tested these SLASs in a high-fidelity simulator in order to evaluate their utility. 70 participants (mean age = 28.7 years; 36 male) drove through a simulated 15 km stretch of one-way two-lane rural road. We evaluated five different warning modes: single visual (SV), single audio visual (SAV), gradient visual (GV), gradient audio visual (GAV) or control (roadside sign). Participants using the SLAS slowed down significantly compared to the control group before entering the curve, with drivers receiving GAV warnings driving lowest speeds. Less experienced drivers exhibited higher compliance with GAMs (GV or GAV). The SLAS was generally considered useful though not by drivers with>10 years of driving experience. Drivers tended to prefer singular warnings to gradated warnings, which were rated as equally preferable to roadside signage. Eye tracking data indicated that none of the SLAS modes were overly distracting to the drivers. Overall, we find that the SLAS improves driver safety while producing no obvious distraction. The main difficulty lies in persuading experienced drivers to use the system. In a word, the results of this study provide validation for the concept of HMI warning system using connected technology in hazardous road areas and help determine the appropriate timing of in-vehicle warnings.",1369-8478,Not found
Psycho-physiological measures on a bicycle simulator in immersive virtual environments: how protected/curbside bike lanes may improve perceived safety,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.015,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"As a healthier and more sustainable way of mobility, cycling has been advocated by literature and policy. However, current trends in bicyclist crash fatalities suggest deficiencies in current roadway design in protecting these vulnerable road users. The lack of cycling data is a common challenge for studying bicyclists’ safety, behavior, and comfort levels under different design contexts. To understand bicyclists’ behavioral and physiological responses in an efficient and safe way, this study uses a bicycle simulator within an immersive virtual environment (IVE). Off-the-shelf sensors are utilized to evaluate bicyclists’ cycling performance (speed and lane position) and physiological responses (eye tracking and heart rate). Participants bike in a simulated virtual environment modeled to scale from a real-world street with a shared bike lane (sharrows) to evaluate how the introduction of a curbside bike lane and a protected bike lane with flexible delineators may impact perceptions of safety, as well as behavioral and psycho-physiological responses. Results from 50 participants (representing both genders and across a wide age range) show that the protected bike lane design received the highest perceived safety rating and exhibited the lowest average cycling speed. Furthermore, both the curbside bike lane and the protected bike lane scenarios show a less dispersed gaze distribution than the as-built sharrows scenario, reflecting a higher gaze focus among bicyclists on the biking task in the curbside bike lane and protected bike lane scenarios, compared to when bicyclists share right of way with vehicles. Additionally, heart rate change point results from the study suggest that creating dedicated zones for bicyclists (curbside bike lanes or protected bike lanes) has the potential to reduce bicyclists’ stress levels. Female participants show a higher preference on the protected bike lane design and a lower perceived safety rating on the sharrows. These findings are from participants riding a bicycle simulator in an immersive virtual environment and inform, but do not fully reflect, bicycling in the real world.",1369-8478,Not found
Using random forest to test if two-wheeler experience affects driver behaviour when interacting with two-wheelers,10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.001,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Car drivers are primarily responsible for crashes between cars and bicycle and motorcycle riders (two-wheelers; TWs). A lack of exposure and riding experience with TWs among car drivers may contribute to the occurrence of these crashes. The current research investigates if car drivers with different TW riding experience levels act differently during risky interactions with both types of TWs. A total of 69 drivers completed a 10-minute driving session using the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator, which included five interactions with TWs based on common crash types. These interactions involve driving manoeuvres in which TWs were initially positioned in front of or at a right angle to the driver. The drivers were divided into two categories based on whether they possessed TW riding experience or not. For analysis, several response features were calculated using the speed and time to collision (TTC) during the time window covering the interaction. Then, a random forest algorithm used the extracted features from the predefined window to classify the drivers. Classification accuracy was calculated using leave one out cross-validation. To test the association between the speed, TTC features and experience as a TW rider, the drivers’ labels were randomly permuted. The random forest models were trained using these permuted labels, and the average classification accuracy was calculated.

Predicting young drivers’ safe behaviour of stopping in the dilemma zone,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.017,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Young drivers are overrepresented in road crashes, half of which occur at intersections in urban areas. One area of focus for crashes at intersections is the dilemma zone, when a driver approaches a signalised intersection at the onset of the yellow light and is unsure whether to continue through or to stop. A challenge in this area of research has been the lack of focus on safe, rather than risky, driving behaviours of young drivers at intersections and a paucity of research on psychosocial factors that motivate driving decisions at intersections. This study aimed to explain young drivers’ intentions and predict their self-reported behaviour of stopping in the dilemma zone (the safe behaviour), using psychosocial factors which influence behaviour in young drivers. Participants were N = 180 young drivers from Queensland. An initial online survey presented three unique scenarios to participants: a general dilemma zone situation, the dilemma zone whilst running late and the dilemma zone where the vehicle in front drives through the yellow light. Participants responded to items measuring Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) constructs extended with prototype perceptions and willingness constructs from the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM). A follow-up online survey measured participants’ self-reported driving behaviours in the previous three weeks, in each scenario. Hierarchical multiple regressions found that the TPB and PWM constructs significantly explained between 59.1 % and 72.7 % of the variance in intentions to stop. This suggested the utility of extending the TPB with a social-reaction decision making model such as the PWM. The follow-up survey (N = 74), found that intentions, but not PBC or willingness, significantly predicted 29 % of the variance in young drivers’ self-reported stopping behaviour for the general scenario and the running late scenario and 10.8 % for the vehicle in front scenario. The findings of this study suggest the value of researching young drivers’ safe behaviours and provide information on psychosocial factors, such as prototype perceptions, that road safety interventions can target in order to reduce road crashes. Additionally, these findings provide evidence for the use of the PWM to extend the TPB, and in investigating young drivers’ decisions in the dilemma zone.",1369-8478,Not found
Gamification and sensory stimuli in eco-driving research: A field experiment to reduce energy consumption in electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.014,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Gamification can create meaningful engagement for users and foster desired behaviors. In gamification research, however, the importance of sensory stimuli often has been overlooked. We examine and discuss how the variation of visual and auditory stimuli in gamified driving influences users’ eco-driving behavior. We conducted a field experiment where eco-driving is the field of application and energy consumption the dependent variable. Participants performed test drives with a battery electric car whilst using a mobile application that supports participants to drive more eco-friendly. We varied the extent to which the application employs visual and auditory stimuli. Our results of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) show that, depending on the stimuli configuration, participants expose different levels of energy consumption and experience different levels of enjoyment as well as different intentions to actually use this mobile application. More specifically, through the ANCOVA, we find significant differences of the energy consumption between the control group, who drove without the gamified application, and the visual-auditory group, as well as between the visual-only and the visual-auditory group, both at a p-value of 0.02. Further, the MANOVA reveals significant differences between the visual-only and visual-auditory group at a p-value of 0.01 for both perceived enjoyment and intention to use. Due to the significant impact of the varied sensory stimuli on the outcomes, we conclude that the choice and design of sensory stimuli play an increasingly important role in real-time gamification in safety critical situations.",1369-8478,Not found
Development and evaluation of a human machine interface to support mode awareness in different automated driving modes,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.023,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"With increasing implementation of automated driving technology it is expected that different automation modes will be present within the same vehicle and within a single trip. At all times during automated driving the driver needs to have ‘mode awareness’, which is an understanding of the automation mode and the corresponding responsibilities. Yet, research on HMI design to support mode awareness for multiple automation modes within a single vehicle and within a single trip is currently limited. The current work describes the development and evaluation of a Human Machine Interface (HMI) to support mode awareness while driving in different automation modes. The work exists of three phases: Phase 1 defines functional requirements for HMI design based on literature review and 5 experimental studies including 146 participants. Phase 2 implements the functional requirements in HMI design through expert and focus group sessions. Phase 3 evaluates and improves upon the HMI design employing virtual reality and the RITE (Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation) method with 18 participants. The result is a continuous and holistic HMI design creating mode awareness through ambience. Findings from Phase 3 and previous research indicate that this HMI is comprehended well, with a relatively low task load, and with a good experienced system usability. It is important to additionally evaluate the HMI design resulting from the current study in driving simulators and in on-road tests. Such tests will provide an opportunity to verify and expand on the current study’s findings and to contribute to guidelines for HMI design.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of simulated time delay on teleoperators’ performance in inter-urban conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.007,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Time delay in communication networks is a major challenge in controlling vehicles from remote centers (also known as teleoperation). In the current study, we investigated the effects of time delay in controlled and partly controlled driving environments at higher driving speeds and in relatively short time delays (50 ms, 150 ms, and 250 ms) which characterise the 5G era. Participants (N = 72) faced several challenges while operating a vehicle in a simulated scenario. The challenges started with following a lead vehicle on a curve, continued with responding to a sudden brake of the lead vehicle, and concluded with highway driving among other simulated road users. The speed, the distance to other vehicles, the brake and swerving of the vehicle and the crash rate were measured during each scenario. At the end of the scenario, participants completed the NASA-TLX. We found that at a time delay of 250 ms (but not 150 ms), following a lead vehicle on a curved road was characterized by a higher standard deviation of speed and distance to the lead vehicle and stronger swerving than at the shorter time delay of 50 ms. Swerving was also stronger at the 250 ms than at the 50 ms delay on the highway. Finally, crashes, which occurred mainly on the highway and in response to the sudden brake of the lead vehicle (before the highway), were 20 % (not statistically significant) higher at the 250 ms than at the 50 ms delay. The gap in collision frequency between the 150 ms and 50 ms delay was lower (8 %) and not statistically significant. This relatively small gap corresponded with the insignificant changes between 150 ms and 50 ms delay on the other indices of driving safety that we analyzed (e.g., braking and swerving). Regarding the NASA-TLX, participants rated the 250 ms delay higher than the other delays on almost all dimensions except for effort on which they did not distinguish between the 250 ms and the 150 ms delay. Our findings expand current knowledge on the effects of time delay on teleoperation. In the Discussion section, we translate this knowledge into practical recommendations regarding possible delays in teleoperation and possible countermeasures for the time delay.",1369-8478,Not found
Measuring workload effects of augmented reality head-up displays using detection response task,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.010,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Augmented reality (AR) technology could establish direct relationships between displayed information and objects in the real driving environment, e.g. by highlighting relevant objects in the traffic environment. However, it is unclear how these potential benefits of augmentation affect drivers’ distraction from the driving task and their level of workload. Since gaze detection cannot separate glances at AR-elements from glances at the driving scene, new evaluation criteria are needed for measuring the distraction potential of AR-elements. The paper evaluates a methodology based on the Detection Response Task (DRT) for measuring the distraction and workload effects of three different display technologies: Head-Down Display (HDD), Head-Up Display (HUD), and Augmented-Reality HUD (AR-HUD). The DRT measures cognitive and visual workload based on a recognition-response task using the two parameters, reaction time and misses. Two experimental studies using driving simulation (N = 24) and production vehicles in real traffic (N = 24) are reported. As use cases, the subjects had to navigate through an urban traffic environment and pass different intersections. During that they were assisted by navigation systems based on the above mentioned display technologies. The resulting workload is compared to a baseline drive without the need to navigate and a reference drive in which the subjects had to work on a secondary task while driving. The results of the DRT are compared with subjective measures, gaze behaviour, and driving performance. In addition, drivers’ preference and user experience regarding the three display technologies and their feedback concerning the DRT method were assessed. The results of both experimental studies show that drivers prefer the AR-HUD display technology. Reasons are mainly the hedonic aspects of the AR-HUD such as the novelty of the technology. Nevertheless, drivers report that AR-elements could obstruct important areas of the road and distract more from the driving task than HUDs. The subjective and visual-cognitive workload measured by the DRT do not differ between the HMI conditions. An analysis for each type of intersection yields most misses for the AR-HUD condition and fewest misses in the HDD condition. However, visual workload (i.e. eyes-off-road time) is higher for HDD compared to (AR-)HUD. Feedback by participants reveals that the DRT as a method for workload assessment is well accepted. All in all, the two DRT measures, misses and reaction time, allow a valid and objective workload measurement and could serve as a supplement or substitute for gaze analysis. The discussion gives indications for the measurement of workload effects caused by AR-HUD using DRT.",1369-8478,Not found

Methods This study used a mixed methods design, consisting of both qualitative (Phase 1- focus groups) and quantitative (Phase 2- Survey) methods with licensed Queensland (state of Australia where the study was conducted) drivers. In Phase 2, a convenience sample of 125 participants responded to an online survey. The survey assessed intentions to always wear a seatbelt both as a driver and as a passenger. Results The results of Phase 1 revealed the salient normative, behavioural, and control beliefs underpinning this behaviour. These beliefs were incorporated into the survey for Phase 2. The results of Phase 2 identified that the standard TPB constructs accounted for 70.5% of the variance in intention to always wear a seatbelt as a driver and 51% of the variance in intention as a passenger. However, perceived behavioural control (PBC) and subjective norm were the only significant predictors of intention to always wear a seatbelt as a driver, while subjective norm was the only significant predictor of intention as a passenger. The extended TPB explained a significant amount of additional variance over and above the standard TPB for both the driver (2.1%) and the passenger (15.2%) contexts. Mediation analyses also confirmed the importance of considering not only the direct but also indirect effects of the study’s key constructs. Results confirmed the perspective that past behaviour’s effect is at least partially, and in the case of the relationship between past behaviour and attitude, fully mediated by habit. Conclusion The results confirmed that while most participants reported always wearing their seatbelt irrespective of whether they were said to be a driver or passenger in a vehicle, there are some instances where they may be less likely to wear their seatbelt. The study highlights the complexities associated with understanding the motivations of seatbelt wearing intentions and the need for further research to ensure the motivations underpinning seatbelt use are well-understood. Such motivations need to be clear to help inform the development of future, targeted interventions to enhance seatbelt wearing intentions and ultimately behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ gap acceptance during parking maneuvers as a basis for initiating driving actions in automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.008,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"As a social system, traffic requires the coordination between different involved road users, particularly in shared spaces (e.g., parking areas) with fewer statutory regulations and hence more ambiguous encounters. By anticipating the development of driving scenes and adapting own driving actions, drivers maintain individually varying safety margins, such as accepted time gaps, to surrounding traffic participants. However, drivers’ gap acceptance (GA) was shown to be influenced by situational factors and driver characteristics. In order to apply expectable interactions in mixed traffic, involving manual and automated vehicles (AVs), intuitive gaps in traffic flow need to be selected by AVs when initiating parking actions. Derived time gaps of manual drivers could provide a basic orientation for intuitive driving functions in AVs. Thus, the current experimental study assessed manual drivers’ GA in a parking area scenario. Real-world video material was used to investigate the effects of interaction partners, their encountering speeds and drivers’ age and sensation seeking on GA. In the study, 42 participants (including two age groups: 18–30 years vs ≥ 45 years) indicated their GA when initiating a left-turn parking maneuver in front of approaching vehicles. The study examined three interaction partners (motorcycle, passenger car, truck), each approaching at six different speed levels (10–35 km/h). The results revealed that selected time gaps increased as vehicle size increased, with the largest GA for the truck and the smallest gaps for the motorcycle. Moreover, time gaps decreased at higher approaching speeds of the interaction partners. In addition, older participants selected more conservative gaps and participants with higher sensation seeking scores accepted lower time gaps to initiate a parking maneuver. The results of the current study revealed that there is no one single time gap that is always considered as appropriate to initiate parking actions. For intuitive interaction capabilities in AVs and to support smooth encounters in mixed traffic, the speed of the approaching interaction partners should be considered as an essential situational factor when initiating parking maneuvers. To consider individual driving style preferences (e.g., due to driver age) and support user acceptance, selectable driving style profiles should be available in AVs as a form of customization.",1369-8478,Not found
"New and used vehicle buyers’ awareness, understanding, and trust in advanced driver assistance systems",10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.009,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Introduction There is concern that the effectiveness of crash avoidance systems will decrease or the potential benefits of adaptive cruise control (ACC) will fail to emerge as motor vehicles with the systems age. This is partly based on assumptions that these vehicles will eventually be bought on the used vehicle market, and the experience of buyers who purchase them used will differ from that of the first owners. But there is a lack of research on the topic. The purpose of this study was to compare driver trust, understanding, and awareness of crash avoidance systems and ACC between owners who purchased new versus used vehicles. Method Consumers who purchased model year 2016–2019 vehicles with standard advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) completed surveys that measured experience with the systems. In our analyses, we controlled for owner age group and gender, the importance that the vehicle they planned to buy had the technologies equipped, and how well they believed the seller explained the technologies. Results As expected, respondents who purchased new vehicles had consistently more trust, awareness, and understanding of the systems relative to respondents who bought used. Results suggest that the perceived importance of ADAS early in the buying experience and a good explanation of the technology from the seller to the buyer may help reduce these differences. However, knowledge and awareness of ADAS was imperfect among new vehicle buyers, and concerns about the effectiveness and feasibility of training underscores the importance of improving understanding and use through system design. Conclusion The significant association between increased trust in the systems and understanding and awareness of the technology, regardless of type of purchase, suggests that efforts to confer knowledge of ADAS early in the ownership experience will be beneficial to both groups of buyers.",1369-8478,Not found
"Humans vs, machines; motorcyclists and car drivers differ in their opinion and trust of self-drive vehicles",10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.014,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Self-drive vehicles have the potential to revolutionise transport systems, however their adoption by mainstream users is highly dependent on a range of factors including trust. Moreover, perceptions of self-drive cars are likely to be highly dependent on the lived-experience of different road user types. Motorcyclists have high impressions of road-vulnerability and distrust for other road users. This distrust stems from the evidence that the vast number of motorcycle crashes occur as a consequence of other-driver error. We therefore hypothesised that compared with car drivers, vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists would report high levels of other-driver distrust, but high levels of trust in self-drive cars. We conducted semi-structured interviews with motorcyclists and car drivers and found that motorcyclists are indeed distrustful of other drivers but have higher levels of trust for self-drive cars compared with car drivers, while car drivers have low levels of trust for self-drive cars, but high levels of trust for other drivers. Motorcyclists were also more likely to report a perspective of trust that centred around their own personal safety on the road. This study provides valuable insights into different road user’s perceptions of AVs.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessing speeding propensity via self-report: An on-road validation study of the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire and three speeding-specific measures,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.003,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Speeding is well-established as a key contributor to crash risk and severity, yet it remains a common behaviour. Hence, speeding propensity is an important focus of study in road safety research. For pragmatic reasons, researchers investigating the causes and consequences of speeding behaviour, or evaluating interventions, will often need to measure speeding propensity indirectly, via self-report (e.g., in large-scale online studies). In the present study, we evaluated a number of self-report measures of driving behaviour. Specifically, we investigated several Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) scales (All Violations, Ordinary Violations, Aggressive Violations, and Errors), as well as three speeding-specific measures, namely: (1) the DBQ Speed Items; (2) the Speed Scale from the Driving Style Questionnaire (DSQ); and (3) a novel measure of Relative Speed Choice. In the present study, we assessed the extent to which scores on these measures reflect actual risky speeding behaviour during real driving (as a construct closely related to speeding propensity). To achieve this, we used data from g-force triggered dashcams to estimate the frequency of young drivers’ speed-related heavy-braking events (i.e., incidents in which the participant was exceeding the speed limit and then applied the brakes abruptly) over an average of 6.43 weeks. Among the standard DBQ scales, only Ordinary Violations scores were significantly associated with the frequency of speed-related heavy-braking events. However, compared with DBQ Ordinary Violations, scores on all three speeding-specific measures were better predictors of these events. Further, both the DSQ Speed Scale and the Relative Speed Choice measure provided better prediction than the DBQ Speed Items. We also found that prediction could be further improved (to a small degree) by using both the DSQ Speed Scale and the Relative Speed Choice measure in combination. These results suggest that the DBQ Ordinary Violations scale, the DBQ Speed Items, the DSQ Speed Scale, and the novel Relative Speed Choice measure can all potentially be used to assess speeding propensity in studies where drivers’ risky speeding behaviour is of interest, but the latter two (alone or in combination) are the best options from a measurement perspective.",1369-8478,Not found
"Attachment, altruistic personality traits and the theory of planned behaviour as predictors of altruistic driving behaviours in young adults",10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.011,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Young adults are overrepresented in crash statistics compared to mature drivers. Research has addressed this concern by investigating factors related to risky driving; however, studies investigating altruistic driving are scarce. Altruistic driving, conceived as driving in a way that benefits others without expectation of benefit for oneself, may lead to less risky driving and reduction in crashes. The current study investigated psychological attachment, altruistic personality traits and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) constructs as predictors of altruistic driving behaviours. The sample consisted of 17–25-year-old licensed drivers, living in Queensland, Australia, who had completed at least three quarters of mandated supervised driving practice with their mother or father as supervisor. Participants completed two linked online surveys. Survey 1 (N = 93) assessed sociodemographic factors, TPB variables, previous behavioural performance, attachment, altruism and intentions for altruistic driving. Survey 2, occurring two weeks later (n = 23), measured opportunity for and engagement in altruistic driving. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses supported the predictive value of the TPB constructs in explaining behavioural intention in general altruistic driving and two specific altruistic driving scenarios. However, altruism and attachment were not significant predictors of intention in any scenario. Bivariate correlations found that neither intentions or PBC (from Survey 1) were significantly associated with altruistic driving behaviours (from Survey 2) in any scenario. This research increases knowledge about motivators of altruistic driving by young drivers. This insight may be used to inform road safety interventions to motivate more altruistic driving, decrease aggression on the roads, and reduce young driver involvement in crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
"Cognitive load, working memory capacity and driving performance: A preliminary fNIRS and eye tracking study",10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.013,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"A common cause of road traffic incidents is driver distraction, which can occur when the driver’s attention is engaged in a concurrent secondary task. However, the relationship between cognitive demands, individual differences in working memory capacity and driving performance has received little research attention. Using a fixed-base driving simulator, the aim of this study was to use a combination of self-report, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and mobile eye tracking data to investigate the impact of cognitive load on drivers’ gaze behaviour and driving performance, as well as explore the relationship between working memory capacity and driving performance under increased cognitive load. Twenty-one participants with a range of driving experiences (e.g., 0–14 h per week) completed a simulated driving task in a simple environment (i.e., country highway) under single-task (driving only) and dual-task (driving + modified 2-back task) conditions. Cognitive load was assessed via fNIRS data that manifested as changes in regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) in prefrontal cortex as well as self-report data of perceived mental effort. Participants’ working memory capacity was assessed using the Operation Span Task. Findings showed that prefrontal rSO2 and perceived mental effort was significantly greater under dual-task conditions compared to the single-task condition. In the dual-task condition, participants’ gaze dwelled for longer on the road and they made fewer fixations, of longer durations. Participants were able to maintain driving performance in this condition, although this was at the expense of secondary task performance. Interestingly, driving infractions under dual-task conditions were negatively correlated with participants’ working memory capacity. The findings suggest that engaging with distracting secondary tasks while driving may increase drivers’ cognitive load and change their gaze behaviour. Driving performance can seemingly be maintained under such conditions, but this may be partly determined by the driver’s working memory capacity.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ reactions to connected vehicle forward collision warnings: Leveraging real-world data from the THEA CV pilot,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.011,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The Tampa Hillsborough Expressway Authority Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment (THEA CV Pilot) implemented several vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) applications on more than 1,000 private vehicles. This paper focuses on the Forward Collision Warning (FCW) application to study factors that are associated with drivers’ reactions to FCWs and to investigate if the observed driving styles derived from the data support the participants’ stated driving styles obtained from their survey responses. A panel of participants, driving in real-world traffic conditions for over two years with retrofitted CV technology and integrated FCW application, is used. The panel consists of a treatment (Human Machine Interface (HMI) enabled) and a control (HMI disabled) group. Random parameters logit and correlated grouped random parameter logit models are estimated to reveal possible associations between stated and observed driving behavior, HMI exposure, socio-demographic factors, and the response variable (drivers’ reaction to FCW). The study found an association between one measure of driving volatility, so that with increased driving volatility (proxy for driving aggressiveness), the probability of reaction to FCW declines. The study also found that the probability of reaction for drivers who received a warning (audiovisual) via HMI increased by 9.93 % compared to those who did not receive a warning.",1369-8478,Not found
The role of yielding cameras in pedestrian-vehicle interactions at un-signalized crosswalks: An application of game theoretical model,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.004,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Objective Pedestrian–vehicle interaction has gained substantial interest in the field of travel behavior and safety. Although traffic rules stipulate the right of way at unsignalized crosswalks, the actual behavior of road users is usually based on game-theoretical solutions. Moreover, non-cooperative games between pedestrians and drivers can be more complicated in the presence of law enforcement equipment. This study aimed to investigate the impact of yielding cameras on road users’ joint behavior at unsignalized crosswalks using a game-theoretical model. Methods and analysis A field survey was conducted using aerial and roadside cameras. In the game-theoretical model, road users were assumed to behave in accordance with the quantal response equilibrium. Additionally, the presence of a yielding camera was introduced into the payoff functions. Influencing factors, including demographics, road users’ behavioral characteristics, and environment, were incorporated into road users’ utilities. The beliefs of road users regarding other road users’ actions were also considered in the model. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate road users’ knowledge and awareness of yielding cameras and their right of way. Results The results indicate that the yielding camera significantly affected driver behavior but had minimal effect on pedestrians crossing decisions because fewer pedestrians were aware of the yielding camera while crossing. Moreover, the camera increased the probability of confusion in the game between pedestrians and drivers (drivers chose to yield, whereas pedestrians chose to stay), thus adversely affecting traffic efficiency. Novelty and improvement A novel game-theoretical model was established to evaluate road users’ joint behaviors at unsignalized crosswalks. Several practical suggestions have been provided to improve the effectiveness of yielding cameras and traffic efficiency.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of contrast on pedestrians’ perception of vehicle speed in different road environments,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.017,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"It is well known in the psychophysical literature that low visual contrasts can lead observers to misestimate the speed of moving objects. This effect can have important consequences for traffic safety when navigating under low visibility due to adverse weather conditions (e.g., fog) or visual impairments. So far, road traffic research has primarily focused on the perception of self-motion during driving showing that drivers can both under- and overestimate their own driving speed depending on the spatial distribution of contrast. In two experiments, we used a two-interval forced choice discrimination task to investigate whether pedestrians would be subject to similar biases when estimating the speed of approaching vehicles in a simulated traffic scene. We found that the perceived vehicle speed decreased when the contrast of the view was reduced uniformly but increased when contrast was reduced in a distance-dependent manner, simulating more realistically visibility in fog. The increase of the perceived vehicle speed in simulated fog occurred in bare and visually more complex road environments including either roadside trees or road markings. The origins of such misperceptions, specifically in fog, remain unclear. The temporal integration of motion signals in combination with a lack in speed constancy, and the illusion of acceleration due to the dynamic contrast-change of the vehicle constitute potential explanations that need further investigation.",1369-8478,Not found
The use of monitoring and feedback devices in driving: An assessment of acceptability and its key determinants,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.021,92,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Recent technological advancements allow monitoring of drivers’ behaviour and offer the opportunity for providing feedback. While this approach has been shown to have a positive effect on driver behaviour, whether it is accepted by drivers has not yet been extensively investigated. This questionnaire study examined the opinions of a sample of 628 Dutch drivers on the potential use of a monitoring and feedback system. The focus was on (1) whether drivers would be interested in being assessed, (2) whether data collection (i.e., monitoring) could be used for this purpose, and (3) which features the potential system must have in order to get accepted. The results showed that participants were moderately enthusiastic about the prospect of receiving monitoring feedback: on average, their opinion was between neutral and positive. Professional drivers expressed slightly more positive opinions, but no demographic variable was strongly associated with acceptability. Many drivers rated themselves as good drivers already and had low sensitivity to data collection, i.e., participants indicated being used to data collection online. If they were to use a monitoring and feedback device, participants indicated a preference for data on speed and forward-facing video footage and a preference for personalisation. The use of a monitoring and feedback system can be considered as a trade-off between sharing personal data and receiving support to improve driving skills. Based on the participants’ reported online behaviour, it appears that the perceived costs associated with sharing data are small. The potential benefits of driver monitoring and feedback, however, are not salient to the participants, which may limit the use of such a system on the roads.",1369-8478,Not found
Will I cross when I see you crossing? Towards illegal pedestrian road crossing simulations,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.022,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"The temporal dimension (how long the pedestrian has been in a situation) and the social influence from the neighbor's behaviors are important factors in street crossing decisions. In this paper, we propose a preliminary agent-based model of the street crossing decisions at a pedestrian light without traffic based on three priors. First, a pedestrian agent is willing to wait a certain amount of time before crossing a street (we call it Accepted Waiting Time, AWT) and beyond that, it crosses even at a red light. The next two priors are based on Rosenbloom's work, who suggests that a pedestrian waiting at a red light may be influenced by those who are crossing or waiting. Combining these two priors mimics some aspect of social influence, and we assume this social influence modulates the AWT of the pedestrian agent. Thus, in our simulations, agents supposed to cross at the red light may wait for the green light, influenced by waiting neighbors. Conversely, the window of opportunity of the neighbors crossing at the red light influences the waiting agents to cross as well. These results mean that the crossing decision would be different if the agents were alone. Moreover, agents with similar characteristics (in terms of AWT) and perceiving the same situation (color of the pedestrian traffic light and number of neighbors) but arriving at the crossing location at different times, will take different decisions (cross/wait). Furthermore, the behaviors produced by our model are quite consistent with those reported in the literature, in terms of violation rate and waiting time. Further research is needed in order to include additional influence factors to this proof-of-concept model, and to take traffic into account, which is needed before using the proposed model in virtual reality applications dedicated to children learning to cross roads.",1369-8478,Not found
External and internal influences on mobile phone use while driving: Combining the theories of deterrence and self-determination,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.019,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Objectives Various legal countermeasures have been introduced in numerous jurisdictions worldwide to reduce the risky behaviour of phone use while driving. However, external factors do not influence behaviour alone; internal factors may also play a large role in influencing behaviour. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of both external and internal influences on hand-held phone use while driving. Methods and analysis The influence of external factors was examined after a higher penalty and a trial for mobile phone detection cameras was introduced in Queensland, Australia, utilising deterrence-theory related constructs. Meanwhile, internal factors were examined through the lens of self-determination theory to determine the relevance of self-regulation to phone use while driving, over and above the effect of deterrence factors. Findings A total of 866 participants (M age = 37.51 years, SD = 17.23) completed a survey examining these variables. Despite the changes to the penalty and enforcement, the legal factors did not significantly deter drivers from phone use while driving. Instead, participants reported avoiding punishment, which influenced further engagement in the behaviour. Meanwhile, indicators of self-regulation including effort/importance, perceived pressure, and relatedness were found to have a more salient impact on the behaviour, whereby drivers who reported high levels of internalised regulatory processes were less likely to use a hand-held phone while driving. Novelty and improvement These results provide a novel contribution to understanding road rule compliance and have important implications for both theory and practice. For example, it can be suggested that legal countermeasures need to be improved, while non-legal countermeasures that target internalisation is a promising avenue for future research.",1369-8478,Not found

In an online YouGov survey (N = 1175) with text-and-image vignettes of a one- or three-lane road section, AV convoys that shared lanes with a normal vehicle were perceived less positively and led to greater blame toward their owning institutions than lone AVs. AVs affiliated with a private commercial company were perceived less positively than those affiliated with a public transit agency. AVs used to regulate traffic of the vehicles behind them were blamed more than AVs used to navigate through traffic to reach a destination.

“You're a Cop and You Gotta Help Me!”: How the type of automated vehicles and collision algorithms influence individuals’ attitudes toward the vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.012,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"In spite of a growing number of studies regarding collision algorithms of autonomous vehicles (AVs), little attention has been paid to how AV types influence the effects of collision algorithms on individuals’ attitudes toward AVs. The current study investigated whether police AVs with selfish or utilitarian collision algorithms, compared with personal AVs with the identical type of collision algorithms, induce different attitudes toward AVs. An online experiment was conducted to explore how the AV types (personal vs police) and collision algorithms (selfish vs utilitarian) can jointly influence individuals’ attitudes, such as trust, perceived benefit, ethical evaluation of AVs, and public acceptance of AVs. According to our findings, there was a moderating effect of AV types on how individuals respond to AVs with selfish or utilitarian collision algorithms. Police AVs with selfish algorithms had a negative impact on individuals’ overall attitudes toward AVs. In contrast, personal AVs with selfish collision algorithms did not lead to such negative attitudes. Furthermore, selfish algorithms embedded in personal AVs were not found to increase individuals’ perceived benefit or approval for the mass adoption of AVs.

Exploration of driver stress when resuming control from highly automated driving in an emergency situation,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.016,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Introduction In a highly automated vehicle, the resumption of manual control often takes place in emergency situations automation cannot handle. Time pressure may increase driver stress and lead to risky behaviors. For safety purposes, this study examines the impacts of emergency takeovers on driver stress. Method The impacts of emergency takeovers on driver stress were explored through heart rate, pupil diameter and perceived stress, gathered from 36 drivers in a driving simulator. Three degrees of emergency were used: non–, moderate, and extreme emergency. Results The results indicate a pupil dilation, high levels of perceived stress and a long-lasting increase in heart rate when drivers had to resume control in moderate and extreme emergency situations. The results also show a lower perceived stress level and a bi-phasic cardiac pattern—composed of a short-lasting decrease in heart rate prior to long-lasting increase in heart rate—when drivers were warned to regain control (moderate emergency) compared to when they were not warned (extreme emergency). Conclusion The results (1) suggest that time urgency is a key factor in the induction of driver stress during takeovers, (2) support the existence of a warning-induced preparatory response—characterized by a short-lasting decrease in heart rate—and previously observed in research on defensive behaviors, and (3) support the hypothesis that the preparatory response is a means of reducing driver stress. Overall, the results provide valuable information about cognitive preparation for emergency takeovers, and more generally about driver stress in emergency situations.",1369-8478,Not found
Predicting perceived risk of traffic scenes using computer vision,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.014,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Perceived risk, or subjective risk, is an important concept in the field of traffic psychology and automated driving. In this paper, we investigate whether perceived risk in images of traffic scenes can be predicted from computer vision features that may also be used by automated vehicles (AVs). We conducted an international crowdsourcing study with 1378 participants, who rated the perceived risk of 100 randomly selected dashcam images on German roads. The population-level perceived risk was found to be statistically reliable, with a split-half reliability of 0.98. We used linear regression analysis to predict (r = 0.62) perceived risk from two features obtained with the YOLOv4 computer vision algorithm: the number of people in the scene and the mean size of the bounding boxes surrounding other road users. When the ego-vehicle’s speed was added as a predictor variable, the prediction strength increased to r = 0.75. Interestingly, the sign of the speed prediction was negative, indicating that a higher vehicle speed was associated with a lower perceived risk. This finding aligns with the principle of self-explaining roads. Our results suggest that computer-vision features and vehicle speed contribute to an accurate prediction of population subjective risk, outperforming the ratings provided by individual participants (mean r = 0.41). These findings may have implications for AV development and the modeling of psychological constructs in traffic psychology.",1369-8478,Not found

Surprisingly, crashes involving vehicles with L2 driving automation contributed to the public’s discussion of L3-L5 AVs. Understanding the variations in public perception of AVs is imperative, which could significantly affect the future evolution of AVs. Respondents have few opportunities to express their views freely in survey-based studies relying on structured questionnaires (e.g., Likert scale). We collected 42,111 comments from Chinese mainstream social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Tik Tok) in August 2021 and applied advanced text mining technology (Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, text network analysis, and sentiment analysis) to understand variations in public perception of AVs before and after the crashes. The results show that the public expresses more blame for vehicles with L2 driving automation than human drivers and has misunderstandings about the current development of L3-L5 AVs, which is closely connected with publicity from automobile companies and media. Women were more negative than men both before and after the crash, and the sentiment difference was most significant in the first three days of the crash.

For this, vehicle owners that are registered in a participants panel of a German vehicle manufacturer (N = 402) were recruited via e-mail invitation. They filled out two online surveys over the course of one month (NT1 = 281; NT2 = 228). As part of the first survey, participants were randomly assigned to a framing condition in which either CO2 (environmental framing), pollutant (altruistic framing), or monetary savings (monetary framing) of eco-driving were highlighted, or the control group. We examined whether the framed tips increased short-term eco-driving motivation and intention as well as medium-term eco-driving behavior change. As expected, participants rated the savings of environmental and altruistic framing (i.e., CO2/ pollutant savings) as worthier than the monetary savings. However, individuals who were exposed to framed eco-driving information independent of framing content reported an increase of eco-driving behavior, compared to the control group.

This intrinsic neural activity in brain regions is expressed through extrinsic driving performance. It was found that auditory distracted driving, with the lowest activation in the right frontal lobe, had the least effect on lateral control of the vehicle, and cognitive distracted driving, with the highest activation in the right frontal lobe, had the greatest effect on lateral control of the vehicle.

Adaptation and validity of the reckless driving habits scale in young Chinese drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.011,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"The aims of the present study were to adapt the Reckless Driving Habits Scale (RDHS, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004) to a sample of young Chinese drivers and to examine its relationships with personality traits and traffic accidents. Four hundred fifty young drivers aged 18–25 years agreed to participate in this study and completed questionnaires assessing their reckless driving behaviours, personality traits (trait anger, sensation seeking, altruism and normlessness) and social desirability. The results of an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed a 10-item scale with satisfactory reliability (0.889). The validity of the scale was supported by the significant correlations between reckless driving behaviours and personality traits. The drivers who scored higher on reckless driving behaviours were male and younger. This study also found that reckless driving behaviours can significantly predict young drivers’ violation involvement in the previous 12 months and in the overall driving period since they obtained their driving licences after controlling for social desirability and demographic variables. These findings show that the Chinese version of the RDHS is a reliable, valid and highly useful instrument.",1369-8478,Not found

Predictors of risky driving among teen drivers with ADHD during U.S. COVID-19 shelter in place orders,10.1016/j.trf.2022.10.013,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Factors associated with continued driving during shelter in place orders have been examined in a community sample of typically developing teen drivers, but not in teens diagnosed with Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Our objective was to examine psychosocial factors that predicted risky drivingduring shelter in place orders in teens with ADHD, which is important since teens with ADHD are at particular risk for poor driving outcomes. The present study is also novel in that it uses naturalistic data of risky driving rather than self-report of continued driving. Naturalistic in-car data from 56 ADHD participants (M age = 16.875 years, SD = 0.955; 55.400 % were male) enrolled in an on-going study were used in the present study. Teens had an average of 26.915 months (SD = 14.343) of driving experience. Risky driving was defined as experiencing an event exceeding 0.600 g-force during the first month of COVID-19 pandemic shelter in place ordinances in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, USA. A hierarchical logistic regression with a post-COVID driving event as the dependent variable was conducted. Baseline ratings of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (ODD/CD) severity were entered in the first step of the model, while anxiety severity and parent behaviors regarding teen driving safety (monitoring and limit setting) were entered in the second step of the model. The first step of the model reached statistical significance (χ2(2, 54) = 7.577, p =.023), with only greater symptoms of ODD/CD significantly predicting a post-COVID driving event (B = 0.144, p =.020). With each point increase in ODD/CD symptoms, there was a 15.5 % increase in the probability of experiencing a high g-force event during COVID-19 restrictions. The model was no longer significant at step 2 when anxiety severity and parent behaviors were added to the model (χ2(3, 55) = 10.97p =.052).We conclude that ODD/CD symptom severity was the strongest predictor of risky driving during COVID-19 restrictions within a sample of teen drivers with ADHD. Study implications may be beneficial for clinicians who work with families of teenswith ADHD; suggestions for strategies mitigating this risk are discussed. These findings also have implications for which teens with ADHD may be less positively impacted by other government mitigation strategies such as Graduated Drivers Licensing (GDL) regulations.",1369-8478,Not found
How psychological factors affect speeding behavior: Analysis based on an extended theory of planned behavior in a Chinese sample,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.003,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Speeding, the most frequent traffic offense, is a key contributor to road crashes. This study explores the psychological factors affecting drivers’ speeding behavior (exceeding the posted speed limit by more than 10%) based on the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB). The scale incorporating TPB constructs and additional variables (Type A personality, risk perception, and driving habit) was developed to collect empirical data, and 945 valid samples were obtained. The reliability and validity of the developed scales were verified, and a structural equation model of drivers’ speeding behavior was established to explore the causal relationship between speeding behavior and psychological characteristics and the interrelationships between TPB variables (speeding intention, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control), explicit cognition predictors (risk perception and Type A personality) and implicit habitual factors (driving habit). The results showed that speeding intention and driving habit positively correlated with self-reported speeding behavior. In addition, attitude and risk perception positively correlated with speeding intention. Although Type A personality trait had no significant effects on speeding behaviors, it had significant effects on attitude and risk perception. In addition, the results of the mediation analysis demonstrated that speeding intention, driving habit, and attitude toward speeding are the most influential factors. Attitude and risk perception have a significant indirect effect on speeding behavior mediated by speeding intention. Drivers’ attitudes, driving habits, and risk perception played a mediating role in the relationships between Type A personality traits and speeding behavior. The findings yield insights into useful information and directions for designing road safety interventions, developing driver education and training programs, and strengthening social messaging aimed at the general public.",1369-8478,Not found
Using direct and belief-based measures of the theory of planned behaviour to predict intention to cycle when mildly intoxicated,10.1016/j.trf.2022.12.001,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Alcohol intoxication seems to be an important contributing factor to cyclist injury and death in traffic. The first aim of this study was to examine how much of the variance in intention to cycle when mildly alcohol intoxicated during the coming year could be explained by only three direct measures of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control, and by indices constructed from the belief-based measures, respectively. The second aim was to identify the belief composites that contributed to the prediction direct measures of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and intention, regarding cycling when mildly alcohol intoxicated during the coming year. A sample of cyclists (n = 196) completed a postal questionnaire including both direct and belief-based measures of the latent variables in the theory of planned behaviour. The results indicated that the three direct measures of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control contributed more to the prediction of drivers’ intention to cycle when alcohol intoxicated than did the 33 indices constructed from belief-based measures. This suggests that three items is sufficient to predict peoples intention. Standard multiple regressions then showed which of the belief composites contributed to the prediction of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control, as well as intention. These identified beliefs could be used to, for example, develop effective road safety campaigns, but it is important to remember that these beliefs might not be directly transferable to other groups of people and that all campaigns must be based on the beliefs of their specific target audience.",1369-8478,Not found
Comparing the sensitivity of the box task combined with the detection response task to the lane change test,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.004,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"The Box Task combined with a Detection Response Task (BT + DRT) is a relatively new and easy-to-use method to assess in-vehicle system demand, consisting of a visual-manual task (BT) and a cognitive task (tactile DRT). Currently, little is known regarding the sensitivity of the BT + DRT for different types and difficulty levels of secondary tasks. Therefore, the present study evaluated the BT + DRT’s sensitivity compared to the Lane Change Test (LCT), which is an ISO-standardized test method. Fifty-two participants engaged in a visual-manual (Surrogate Reference Task) and a cognitive secondary task (counting task) across two levels of difficulty while performing a PC version of the BT + DRT and LCT. The BT parameters, especially the standard deviation of box position and size, were sensitive to visual-manual secondary task demand. Moreover, the results showed that the DRT is a sensitive method to assess cognitive demand, supporting previous findings. In contrast, the mean deviation of the adaptive reference lane used as the standard LCT parameter was not as effective in discriminating between visual-manual and cognitive tasks. Hence, to distinguish between different types and levels of secondary task demand, the BT + DRT is more accurate than the standard LCT version. Future studies should investigate how an increased BT difficulty can further improve the sensitivity to visual-manual and cognitive secondary task demand.",1369-8478,Not found
The factors impacting the use of navigation systems: A study based on the technology acceptance model,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.005,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Navigation systems are important in daily driving situations. The user experience of using navigation systems can influence drivers’ attitudes towards them and their intentions to use them. The objective of this paper was to identify the mechanisms underlying the use of navigation systems and analyse the psychological factors that influence drivers’ use of navigation systems. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was used to explore the factors impacting navigation system usage, and related factors such as trust and professional driver status were also considered. Using data collected from 372 drivers in China, the study demonstrated that two dimensions of the TAM, perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), as well as trust, were positively related to the intention to use navigation systems. Meanwhile, these positive associations were mediated by drivers’ attitudes towards navigation systems. Furthermore, professional drivers showed different trends from nonprofessional drivers in terms of the path from PEOU and trust to positive attitudes.",1369-8478,Not found
"The antecedents, regulation and maintenance of anger on the road: A qualitative investigation on the factors influencing driver anger and aggression",10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.002,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Aggressive driving behaviour (ADB) is an ongoing road safety issue that has proven difficult to deter. The purpose of this study was to: qualitatively investigate the antecedents of ADBs, document the self-regulatory processes and metacognitive beliefs associated with ADBs, and explore how metacognitive facets might influence the progression and expression of anger. An online sample of Queensland (Australia) motorists who had recently engaged in ADBs (N = 34) were interviewed and inductive thematic analysis was applied to the response data. The results showed that firstly, ADBs were primarily triggered by discrepancies in drivers’ mentality. Several perceptual, situational, internal and experiential factors were found to influence the likelihood and severity of the response to the triggering behaviour. Trait aggressive drivers tended to have lower perceptions of risk, and resistance to deterring events (e.g., fines; near misses). The self-regulation of ADBs appeared to be contingent on participants’ metacognitive awareness to recognise when their behaviour was being influenced by anger, and the ability to utilise appropriate cognitive-behavioural regulatory strategies when required. Following ADBs, participants reported different forms of evaluation, including anger, depressive, fearful, and reflective rumination styles, and these processes were perceived to influence future driving behaviours in different ways. However, trait aggressive drivers in particular tended to demonstrate a lack of evaluation following ADBs. The findings of this study may provide a framework for future research applying the concept of self-regulation to the topic of ADB and may also help inform road authorities of alternative and effective approaches for reducing driver aggression.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of emotion on galvanic skin response and vehicle control data during simulated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2022.12.010,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the effect of driver emotion on the physiological and vehicle control data and the possibility of predicting the driver emotion to enhance the driving experience. Method The driver emotions in the driving context were classified into eight categories depending on high and low levels of arousal and valence: happiness, surprise, fear, anger, depression, boredom, relief, and neutrality. Fourteen male and female volunteers with ages between 22 and 34 y participated in the test, and approximately 540 min of image, physiological, and vehicle data were collected. After inducing the participants’ target emotion through the viewing of a film and writing of passages, we asked the participants to drive on a highway through a driving simulator and self-evaluate their emotion. After the test, the participants were allowed to go home after emotion neutralization. Result The participants’ self-evaluated emotions correlated highly with the intended induced emotions. High arousal and negative valence emotions such as anger and low arousal and positive valence emotions such as relief exhibited a statistically significant elevation for the following indicators: galvanic skin response amplitude, longitudinal vehicle control data such as throttling and braking, and lateral vehicle control data. Conclusions The test results confirmed that a driver’s emotional state could be reflected in the differences between the biometric data or vehicle control data. In particular, the emotion associated with a high arousal and negative valence could be clearly distinguished from that associated with a low arousal and positive valence. Therefore, the driver's emotional state affects the traffic condition, and the detection of potentially risky emotions such as those associated with road rage and development of a suitable driving mode can help enhance the driving safety. Applications Drivers’ emotions can be identified based on physiological data and vehicle control data and integrated into the system to formulate appropriate responses. For instance, anger anticipated from a driver can be alleviated by a preemptive measure, thereby enhancing the traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Is there a relationship between time pressure and pedestrian non-compliance? A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.001,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Pedestrians are usually referred to as the most vulnerable road users because they lack sound protection against crashes. The danger of collisions for pedestrians increases at intersection crosswalks due to the non-compliance behaviour of pedestrians at such multi-directional traffic locations. To acquire a greater comprehension, it is indeed imperative to understand pedestrian behaviour at such sites. Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the risk associated with non-compliance behaviour and the primary causes of non-compliance behaviour at intersections. The study also explored the relationship between time pressure and non-compliance road crossing behaviour. The authors searched the Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Semantic to identify the required studies. After excluding books, review papers, non-English research, proceedings, duplicates, and irrelevant studies, 73 pieces of literature were identified for the review process. The current study enlisted all the elements that influence the non-compliance behaviour of pedestrians. Many factors, such as time of day, weather conditions, land use, etc., have a substantial effect on non-compliance but have not been sufficiently studied to establish broad conclusions. Consequently, in exploring the fundamental reasons for non-compliance behaviour, it was found that time--saving or being in a hurry is one of the strong influencers for non-compliance behaviour. Hence, these findings indicate a positive correlation between time pressure and the non-compliance behaviour of pedestrians. However, even though time pressure is a primary source of non-compliance, studies illustrating the impact of time pressure on pedestrian decision-making behaviour are extremely limited. Furthermore, because all time pressure studies have been limited to midblock crossings, it is worthwhile to assess the role of time pressure in pedestrian safety in complex intersection scenarios.",1369-8478,Not found
Psychological and experiential contributors to experienced cyclists’ on-road cycling behaviour: A path analysis study,10.1016/j.trf.2022.11.016,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Cyclists’ behaviour may be characterised as both positive and negative, although research has typically focused on the latter – notably, behaviours such as crashes, collisions, and errors. Cyclist distraction is often implicated in these negative behaviours. However, there is a dearth of research on the psychological correlates of errant cycling behaviours and distraction. We distributed an online survey that included a combination of established and novel measures to 191 experienced cyclists (155 M, 36 F; aged 18–80 yrs, M age = 57.03 yrs) to ascertain their self-reported cycling behaviour and experience, their attentional style, their cycling self-efficacy and their negative experiences whilst cycling. We conducted path analysis to explore relationships between these variables – specifically, to determine whether self-reported cycling behaviour and negative experiences would be predicted by attentional style, cycling self-efficacy, and cycling experience. Of the statistically significant relationships, Internal Distraction Control negatively predicted cyclists’ self-reported errors (b = -0.235) and violations (b = -0.195). The cyclists’ years of urban cycling positively predicted their errors (b = 0.068), violations (b = 0.046) and negative experiences (b = 0.05) when cycling. Cycling self-efficacy positively predicted violations (b = 0.003) and negatively predicted positive behaviours (b = -0.002). These results suggest that a combination of psychological and experiential factors explain some of the variance in self-reported cycling behaviours – particularly negative ones. Road user entropy in UK towns and cities is set to increase as micromobility usage increases. Formal assessment of cyclists’ capabilities, particularly their ability to deal with distractions, may be crucial to mitigate the consequences.",1369-8478,Not found

Too close for comfort: A mixed methods study to understand self-reported tailgating using the theory of planned behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2022.12.005,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Background Tailgating (following a lead vehicle too closely) is a key contributor to crashes and injury. While vehicle technology has the potential to reduce the trauma resulting from tailgating, full market penetration of these technologies is some time away. In the meantime, efforts to improve road safety can focus on supporting safer driver behaviour by targeting motivations for this behaviour. Method A mixed methods design was used to understand reasons why drivers tailgate and potential countermeasures to reduce this behaviour. Qualitative data from 247 drivers (males = 29 %; mean age = 39.86; SD = 14.39) were sought to understand circumstances when drivers are tailgated and when they report tailgating. In a second study, 736 drivers (males = 41 %; mean age = 37.69; SD = 14.27) responded to questions developed from the qualitative findings to quantify the frequency of tailgating and reasons behind it. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was applied to understand whether self-reported intention to tailgate could be predicted by attitudes, perceived social acceptance of the behaviour, perceived behavioural control, and past tailgating behaviour. Results Tailgating was a common behaviour. All drivers in the first study had experienced being tailgated by other drivers, while 77% had tailgated other vehicles; albeit 55% reported this was rare. Tailgating was unintentional (due to dense traffic; or lack of knowledge of safe following distance recommendations) or intentional (due to pressure from other drivers, anger or to change others’ behaviour). Structural equation modelling showed that TPB constructs of attitude, social norms, perceived behavioural control and past tailgating behaviour predicted intention to tailgate, accounting for 66% of the variance. Conclusion TPB is a useful framework for explaining tailgating behaviour, or at least the intention to tailgate, and to develop interventions. These could focus on education of the risks of tailgating, the recommended safe following distances as well as strategies to support drivers maintaining safe following distances across different speed zones.",1369-8478,Not found
Pedestrians’ perceived vulnerability and observed behaviours relating to crossing and passing interactions with autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2022.12.007,93,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Researchers have predicted that “vulnerable road users” (VRUs) such as pedestrians will feel less vulnerable and thus take more risks around autonomous vehicles (AVs) than around human-operated vehicles (HOVs). However, data on the behaviours pedestrians are likely to display during passing as well as crossing interactions with AVs – particularly from naturalistic studies – are currently lacking. Such data could help inform AV system designers and authorities, as well as researchers. So, a novel study was conducted in London, UK. Perceived vulnerability was gauged via a survey on hypothetical pedestrian-vehicle interactions (N = 267). Behaviours were observed during real crossing and passing interactions with AV shuttle pods in a shared space (N = 330). While pedestrians were the main focus, joggers and cyclists were also frequenting the observation site and were included in the analysis of passing interactions. The survey results showed that pedestrians were not perceived to be less vulnerable around AVs. Diminishing initial boldness in the crossing interactions, and high yielding in the passing interactions, supported this, demonstrating that VRUs were not taking undue risks; rather, they appeared to be experiencing some uncertainty and discomfort. Further results showed other VRU behaviours (gap acceptance, inattention, hesitation, changes in speed, explicit communication, a side preference) may be relevant in AV interactions, but not necessarily to the same degree as when around HOVs or not in line with UK road rules. Positive conclusions were drawn for AV programming, and for safety, at least in the short term, but concerns regarding mobility need addressing.",1369-8478,Not found

The main purpose of this study is to explore effective feedback content and the mediating effect of drivers’ responsibility based on the triangle model of responsibility. We designed a mixed study with 3 driving scenarios (getting too close to lead vehicle, speeding, and running a yellow light) and 4 feedbacks (no feedback, feedback with only a prescription, feedback with only an event, feedback with both prescription and event) as within-subject factors and 2 driver identities (feedback without driver identity, feedback with driver identity) as a between-subjects factor. A total of 110 Chinese drivers completed this study. The results showed that providing feedback enhanced drivers’ willingness to drive safely, while the effects of feedback with different contents varied with scenario. In addition, the mediating effect of drivers’ responsibility between feedback and speeding was confirmed. This study revealed that the effectiveness of feedback would be significantly influenced by a subtle change in feedback content in different driving scenarios, suggesting the importance of tailoring feedback content according to specific situations. Additionally, we provided a possible explanation of the mechanism of feedback by verifying the mediating effect of responsibility.

Relationship between braking intensity and driver heart rate as a function of the size of the measurement window and its position,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.013,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Heart Rate (HR) is often used to capture the driver's mental workload and stress. Usually, during a predefined time window (e.g., 10 s, 30 s, or longer). In addition, the center of that time window is commonly placed at the peak of events of interest (e.g., safety events such as hard braking). However, the choices of window size and window position relative to driving events are often not explained in the literature, and conceivably, other choices could have been made for estimating changes in HR. This research tested the effect of window size and position on HR estimates. Participants executed 12 braking events on a closed driving course and were monitored for HR and skin conductivity. We fitted a regression model on HR as a function of driver braking intensity, multiple times (N = 210), each time, we calculated the HR with different window sizes (1–70 s) and three window positions (onset of braking, peak deceleration, and end of braking). We found that the coefficients in the model on HR by braking intensity changed as a function of the window size and its position. Our sample's optimal time window size was different from conventional settings: it was 4-second long and centered at the end of the braking events. Our findings showcase the analysis procedure that we employed and can contribute to research on physiological markers (HR and others) and to the design of driver assistance systems.",1369-8478,Not found

Despite their long-standing use, many problems associated with their design adversely impact comprehension and legibility. Method: To assess their current effectiveness, the design and worldwide application of thousands of these symbols were examined according to established criteria for sound symbol design. Analysis: Design issues explored ranged from addition of color and text to placement of prohibition bars to arrangement of multiple symbols on a sign to merits of mandatory vs prohibitory messages to alternative depictions of specific images, such as for ferries, cycle streets and disabled pedestrians. Results: The problems identified include unsuitable symbol size, line width, contrast, perspective, types of detail and image content. Numerous examples of symbol use and misuse are illustrated for warning, regulatory and facilities/services signs and for supplementary plaques. Guidelines, including a sequential-component approach, are offered for designing symbols that possess clear messages and high legibility.

Driver drowsiness is affected by the thermal environment, but drowsiness predictions in previous research are based on a limited thermal environment and do not consider realistic thermal conditions, including warm environments and individual differences. This study uses the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index, a personal thermal environment indicator, in drowsiness prediction to treat individual differences. Furthermore, it provides a model of thermal-drowsiness progression characteristics that comprehensively covers both cold and warm environments. The drowsiness data were collected from 29 subjects driving on a highway under six levels of thermal comfort conditions. Based on the collected data, a model of the amount of change in drowsiness after 15 min was built. The results show that the drivers were most drowsy in the slightly warmer condition (PMV + 0.2) and hardly drowsy in both the cooler and warmer conditions after 15 min of driving. This inverted U-shaped characteristic was numerically modeled as the effect of the thermal environment on driver drowsiness. In addition, in models predicting drowsiness after 15 min, PMV had a greater effect on improving accuracy than conventional driving time. These results suggest that for short periods of driving, the personal thermal environment may have a greater influence on drowsiness progression than driving time. Whilst limited by the small sample size, this study provides insight into the relationship between thermal comfort and drivers’ drowsiness under real-world highway driving conditions.",1369-8478,Not found

By collecting data from 1035 participants, exploratory factor analysis identified significant constructs of DAX including “Adaptive, “Verbal anger expression”, “Use of the vehicle to express anger”, and “Personal physical anger expression” and T-LOC including “Self”, “Other drivers”, “Vehicle/environment”, and “Fate/luck”. A two-phase approach of K-means clustering and a logistic regression model was then used to evaluate the effects of driving anger expression on T-LOC and crash involvement. The results revealed that while males and younger drivers reported more aggressive orientation in driving anger situations, females, older drivers, and those with higher driving experience significantly showed a higher level of adaptive orientation in driving anger situations. The logistic regression models showed that external T-LOC (believing that other people and factors are responsible for an accident, not themselves) was significantly higher in middle-aged drivers and those with 11–20 years of driving experience. Also, drivers with adaptive anger expression were less likely to report a high level of external T-LOC. On the other hand, the use of the vehicle to express anger increased the probability of external T-LOC.

To inform future educational efforts, we investigated the beliefs and attitudes of Australian learner drivers about driving and avoiding driving through floodwaters. Methods: The study adopted a cross-sectional correlational design with measures drawn from the theory of planned behaviour and administered within an online survey. Phase 1 (N = 44 learner drivers) aimed to identify the core beliefs associated with driving through floodwater. Phase 2 (N = 250 learner drivers) tested these beliefs predicting willingness to drive through floodwater as well as the social psychological factors that predict learner drivers’ willingness to drive and avoid driving through floodwater using a pre-tested scenario. Analyses comprised descriptive statistics, linear regression, and structural equation models. Results: Ten key beliefs were identified as predicting willingness to drive through floodwater. These included perceived advantages and disadvantages, perceived social approval from important others, and perceived facilitators and barriers regarding driving through floodwater in the presented scenario. Structural equation models of social cognition constructs of the theory of planned behaviour revealed attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control predicted both willingness to drive and avoid driving through floodwater. Past experience as a passenger also predicted these social cognition constructs, although this differed across models. Discussion: Results highlight the importance of modelling safe driving behaviour for young passengers. The strong association between subjective norm and willingness to drive through floodwater further highlights the importance of those supervising learner drivers to establish expectations around avoiding driving through the floodwater if it is encountered on a driving route. Conclusion: Social cognition factors from the theory of planned behaviour predict willingness to drive and avoid driving though floodwater. Theory-based targets should be considered for the development of intervention programs for novice drivers, such as those holding learner licenses.",1369-8478,Not found
What a girl wants: A mixed-methods study of gender differences in the barriers to and enablers of riding a bike in Australia,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.010,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Background There is substantial potential to improve low rates of bike riding participation in Australian women. Understanding of the barriers to and enablers of riding a bike is essential for planning of urban environments and development of interventions to promote accessible active transport. It is well established that there are differences in the needs and experiences of people of different genders in urban environments, however our understanding of the needs of women who are not yet riding a bike are limited. We aimed to quantify perceived barriers and enablers to riding a bike for transport between women and men, and to explore reasoning behind these. Methods Using a mixed methods sequential explanatory design, we purposively sampled people by age, gender and area of residence in Greater Melbourne, Australia. The sample participated in an online survey of barriers to and enablers of riding a bike. Participants who completed the online survey indicated if they were interested in participating in further qualitative research which aimed to gain a deeper understanding of their attitudes toward, barriers to and enablers of riding a bike. A total of 40 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 women and 20 men who were categorised as Interested but Concerned in bike riding. Results Of the 912 surveys collected, 717 were completed and included in analyses. Significant differences were identified in the barriers and enablers reported between women and men, where more women reported concerns regarding riding on the road. In interviews, more women reported issues relating to a lack of confidence and concern about their safety riding a bike around motor vehicle traffic compared to men. Conclusions Women have specific concerns about riding on the road alongside motor vehicle traffic and the associated risks, and a lack of confidence in their ability and knowledge of bike riding and bikes themselves. It is imperative that women’s perspectives and needs are considered in the planning and promotion of bike riding globally to prevent and tackle gendered inequities.",1369-8478,Not found
Fifty shades of frustration: Intra- and interindividual variances in expressing frustration,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.004,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Negative emotions like frustration can lead to risky driving behavior in manual driving and may hinder the acceptance of innovative automated vehicles. The option to automatically recognize such negative emotions of vehicle users with so called affect-aware systems has gained increasing attention within the last few years. This offers the possibility to adapt vehicle functions, such as the human–machine interface, in real-time. Emotional expressions in face and body form potential indicators for user frustration. Previous studies have investigated expressions of frustration in the context of driving and mobility, but have neglected situational and interindividual differences. In this paper, we examined the possibility to improve the recognition of frustration by considering individual differences. For this, a driving simulator study with 50 participants and a real-world driving study with 23 participants were conducted. An analysis of participants’ facial expressions during frustrating driving situations confirms previously reported expressions of frustration (Brow Lowerer, Dimpler, Brow Raiser, Smile and Lip Press). In addition, the results also hint towards high variance between and low variance within participants for all other expressions, suggesting the existence of individual-typical expressions of frustration. Hence, future frustration-aware systems could benefit from considering these individual differences by using a universally trained algorithm that is then customized towards each individual.",1369-8478,Not found
Behavioural modelling of automated to manual control transition in conditionally automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.008,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Human-vehicle interaction in the presence of automated driving features (ADFs) poses significant challenges in behavioural adaptation. At the current level of automation, the mixed right-of-control of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) with partial human involvement is of interest. This study investigates the factors affecting the successful take over of the control by a human driver in the conditionally automated vehicle upon operational design domain (ODD) exit under different sociodemographic, mental workload, traffic flow, weather, and lighting conditions. Data collected in Virtual and Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE) are used to study the successful taking of control back from automated driving. Apart from estimating the binary and mixed logit models, a latent structure was developed to incorporate the attitudinal indicators in the integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model. Results indicate that almost 80 percent of participants were successful in safely regaining control. However, participants with more sensitive attitudes about CAV safety, were more likely to fail. Heavy congestion positively impacts situational awareness in taking back control safely from a CAV. Moreover, multi-tasking based on non-driving related secondary task (NDRT) engagement in a rainy night scenario, mental workload, and reaction time were significantly positive indicators of unsafe control transition. The statistics suggest that the driver's familiarity with the concept of CAVs is not enough for the safe transition of control.",1369-8478,Not found
Further down the road: The enduring effect of an online training course on novice drivers’ hazard perception skill,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.011,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Hazard perception training has been proposed as a potential strategy for reducing crash risk in drivers. Although previous work has shown that hazard perception is a trainable skill, it also indicates that the effect of hazard perception training often decays over time, sometimes to the point of being negated. In the present study, we evaluate a hazard perception training course specifically designed to minimize the rate of forgetting through the use of evidence-based strategies such as incorporating distributed practice and taking advantage of the contextual interference effect. We report data on a sample of novice drivers, in which we evaluated the effect of the course on a validated measure of hazard perception skill (a verbal-response “hazard prediction test”) in both the short term (M = 9.24 days, or 1.32 weeks) and medium term (M = 9.87 weeks, or 2.27 months), using a randomized control design. At both retention points, trained participants scored significantly and substantially higher than an untrained control group, adjusting for baseline performance. Further, the hazard prediction scores of trained drivers did not significantly decrease between the short- and medium-term assessment points, indicating that there was no evidence of skill decay over this time frame. There was also no evidence that completing the course increased driver confidence at any time point, which is important given that increased confidence could potentially lead to unintended negative effects on crash risk. The results suggest that the training course improves a skill that has been associated with crash risk over a time period that is of practical value, especially as refresher training sessions could be used to further extend the effect into the longer term (i.e., beyond the duration examined in this study) if necessary.",1369-8478,Not found
Postintervention reoffense in DUI repeat offenders receiving alcohol treatment as a diversion intervention: A 2-year follow-up study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.006,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Purpose Alcohol use problems are prevalent among recidivists of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). This 2-year postintervention follow-up study explored the preventive effects of 12- or 6-month alcohol treatment in relation to reoffense among repeat DUI offenders who participated in a community-based joint legal–medical intervention program. Methods A total of 259 repeat DUI offenders with alcohol use problems were referred from a Prosecutors’ Office to a psychiatric hospital to receive alcohol treatment. We divided these participants into two groups on the basis of treatment duration (6- and 12-month groups) and collected their official DUI offense records for 2 years after the intervention. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the hazard ratio of each treatment duration in relation to reoffense. The reoffense rates were compared with a group of DUI offenders (n = 4097) who did not participate in the intervention program (i.e., a nonintervention group). Results The baseline characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The 2-year reoffense rates for the 12-month treatment, 6-month treatment, and nonintervention groups were 12%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. The hazard ratio for reoffense was lower for the 12-month group than for the 6-month group (hazard ratio: 0.45; 95% confidence interval: 0.21–0.96). Survival analysis revealed that compared with the non-intervention group, reoffense was significantly reduced in the 12-month group but not in the 6-month group. Conclusion The 12-month joint legal–medical intervention program for alcohol treatment yielded superior outcomes to the corresponding 6-month program in terms of preventing DUI reoffense for 2 years postintervention. This research is, however, subject to the limitation that we lacked the information of factors that might affect the reoffense risk, such as motivation level, readiness to change, personality traits, and familial support.",1369-8478,Not found
A cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) evaluation of a pre-driver education intervention using the Theory of Planned Behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.001,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Road traffic injuries are the leading of cause of death of 5–29-year-olds worldwide (World Health Organisation, 2018) making young driver safety a global public health concern. Pre-driver road safety education programmes are popular and commonly delivered with the aim of improving safety amongst this at risk group but have rarely been found to be effective (Kinnear, Lloyd, Helman, Husband, Scoons, Jones et al., 2013). A pre-driver education intervention (DriveFit) was designed and evaluated with a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991). The responses of 16–18-year-old students (n = 437) from 22 schools/colleges in Devon, UK were analysed and showed that the DriveFit intervention led to some small improvements in risk intentions, attitudes, and other measures, which differed by sub-group. Speed intentions improved immediately post- intervention (T2), whereas a composite measure of all intentions and mobile phone use intentions improved at 8–10 weeks post-intervention (T3). Apart from speed intentions, a trend towards intentions becoming safer at T3 was noted. Mobile phone use and speeding attitudes, a composite measure of attitudes, as well as attitudes to driving violations and perceptions of risk, improved at T2 and T3, with the size of the effect slightly reduced at T3. Participants expressed safe views at baseline (T1), which overall left minimal room for improvement. Whilst previous research has found that education interventions deliver small self-reported effects, that diminish over time (i.e., Poulter and McKenna, 2010), this study finds small, but lasting attitude effects (which diminish in magnitude over time) and a trend towards improving intentions, over and above the control group. The findings provide some guidance on future research to design and evaluate educational interventions for pre- and novice drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Modeling driver steering behavior in restricted-preview boundary-avoidance tasks,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.017,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"In the design of human-like steering support systems, driver models are essential for matching the supporting automation's behavior to that of the human driver. However, current driver models are very limited in capturing the driver's adaptation to key task variables such as road width and visibility (i.e., ‘preview’ of the road ahead). This paper uses a recently proposed, novel control-theoretical model for centerline tracking to investigate driver steering in lane-keeping tasks with restricted and unrestricted preview, in an attempt to substantially extend this model's validity. Using data from a tailored driving simulator experiment, three driver control loops (feedforward, heading and position feedback) are separately quantified using system identification techniques. The results show that when preview is restricted, drivers use all of the remaining preview to anticipate the curves of the road ahead, and are no longer able to ‘smooth’ tight curves in the road trajectory (i.e., corner cutting). When sufficient preview and lane width are available, the time to line crossing increases, and steering behavior is less aggressive and more intermittent, or more ‘satisficing’. The novel driver steering model captures these adaptations very well (over 95% of the steering actions) and can thereby be instrumental in realizing human-like steering automation and support systems.",1369-8478,Not found

Acceptance of using autonomous cars in a test drive and ordinary, real traffic scenarios, as well as the intention to buy one were measured via self-administered items. We used conditional process modeling to get a more detailed insight into the connections among these factors. The findings revealed that all four factors of attitudes towards autonomous vehicles (benefits in usefulness, benefits in situations, commonalities concerns, system concerns) but only the optimism factor of technology adaption propensity affected the acceptance. Dependency seemed to affect benefits in usefulness and the two concern variables. Gender differences are almost entirely explained away by the effects of attitudes.

Exploring the factors influencing acquisition and learning experiences of cars fitted with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS),10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.006,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have shown substantial potential to increase road safety. To guarantee a growing presence and correct use of ADAS, road safety initiatives such as driver education and programs to promote safer vehicles need to be oriented towards the specific needs of individual drivers. The aim of this study was to explore a sample of Australian drivers’ rationale for driving a vehicle with ADAS and the strategies that they use when learning to operate the functions of ADAS. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 Australian drivers aged between 19 and 78 years (M = 41.54, SD = 16.32; 25 females). The results were organised into four themes: (i) reasons for driving/purchasing a car with ADAS, (ii) systems influencing driver purchasing systems, (iii) strategies used by drivers when learning about ADAS, and (iv) perceptions regarding the importance of learning and training to use ADAS. Acquisition of vehicles with ADAS frequently occurred because of the perceived safety benefits of specific systems (e.g., rear parking sensor or in-vehicle information system). Additionally, some participants did not highlight the safety benefits as the main reason for driving/purchasing a car with ADAS. Indeed, some participants mentioned that ADAS acquisition was not a reasoned process but rather an opportunistic decision when upgrading their vehicles, mainly because these systems were already included in a vehicle. Regarding education, it was found that participants were using trial-and-error as their main approach to learning about the capabilities of ADAS and official sources of knowledge about the system were rarely consulted. On a positive note, participants recognised the importance of learning to use ADAS systems correctly, showing that there is demand for effective and engaging driver education.",1369-8478,Not found
Making night-time pedestrians safer using innovative clothing designs,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.002,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Night-time pedestrians, including recreational walkers and runners, remain at significant risk of being killed or seriously injured, because drivers often fail to see them in time to avoid a collision. Clothing incorporating retro-reflective markers on the moveable joints creates a visual perception of biological motion or “biomotion” which has been shown to improve night-time pedestrian conspicuity. This study investigated whether clothing with markings in the biomotion configuration retains its conspicuity if adapted to include thinner or patterned retro-reflective strips making it more acceptable to wear for recreational pedestrians. In a night-time closed road study, the relative conspicuity of pedestrians to 14 young drivers with normal vision (mean age 24.3 ± 3.1 years) was assessed for pedestrians wearing different thicknesses and patterns of biomotion strips and compared with typical clothing worn by night-time pedestrians, including commercially available sports clothing with retro-reflective elements, a fluorescent yellow top, and black clothing. Results showed that all the biomotion configurations resulted in significantly longer recognition distances: around 2 times longer than the sports clothing, 2.5 times longer than the fluorescent top and 4 times longer than the black clothing. Similar trends were found for the distance at which drivers correctly identified pedestrian orientation (towards or sideways to the vehicle), with significantly longer distances for all the biomotion configurations, when compared to the sports, fluorescent top and black clothing. These findings highlight the effectiveness of biomotion clothing, even when using retro-reflective strips as thin as 0.75 cm and have implications for clothing designs for recreational walkers and runners to enhance their night-time safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Response times in drivers' gap acceptance decisions during overtaking,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.003,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Overtaking on two-lane roads can lead to increased collision risks due to drivers' errors in evaluating whether or not to accept the gap to the vehicle in the opposite lane. Understanding these gap acceptance decisions can help mitigate the risks associated with overtaking. Previous research on overtaking has focused on the factors influencing gap acceptance decisions. However, the cognitive processes underlying gap acceptance decisions remain poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that response time (i.e. the time it takes the driver to evaluate the gap and make a decision) can provide valuable insights into the cognitive processes during gap acceptance decisions, in particular in pedestrian crossing and left turn decisions. However, the more complex nature of the overtaking maneuver renders it difficult to measure response times in overtaking. As a result, response times in overtaking have not been investigated, thereby limiting our understanding of overtaking behavior. To address this gap, in this paper we propose a method to measure response time in drivers' overtaking decisions and demonstrate this method in a driving simulator experiment ( N = 25 ). Specifically, we analyzed the effect of distance to the oncoming vehicle and speed of the ego vehicle on response time in accepted and rejected gaps. We found that response times for rejected gaps were on average longer than for accepted gaps. The response times increased with the distance gap and decreased with the initial velocity of the ego vehicle. We conclude that using the proposed method for measuring response time can give insight in the way drivers make gap acceptance decisions during overtaking. These results provide basis for cognitive process models that can help further understand overtaking decisions.",1369-8478,Not found
Perceptions related to engaging in non-driving activities in an automated vehicle while commuting: A text mining approach,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.015,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Automated vehicles (AVs) offer human operators the opportunity to participate in non-driving activities while on the move. In this study, we examined and compared drivers' perception of non-driving activities in two driving modes: highly AVs in the future and current vehicle systems, where the human operator is still responsible for controlling the vehicle such as braking and steering. The study used a survey distributed through an online paid marketplace platform called Lucid, which included open-ended questions soliciting participants' perceptions of non-driving activities given a work commute scenario for each driving mode. Text mining and clustering analysis were used to analyze the responses of 752 participants to four open-ended survey questions. Results showed that drivers had a more positive sentiment towards future automated vehicles compared to current systems. The most reported non-driving activities overall were “work”, “listen”, and “relax”; were “listen” for current vehicle systems and “work” for AVs. The study also captured the changes in drivers' perception from current systems to AV systems. The findings indicated that most drivers (83.4%) would continue their current non-driving activities, with 76.0% continuing to perform work or work-related activities. Approximately 8.7% of respondents would switch from their current tasks to work-related tasks in an AV, while 3.7% would do the opposite—abandon work-related tasks to do other activities. The study suggests that working while commuting will be an advantage of AVs, highlighting the need to understand how people can work productively as we move forward with automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Using pupillometry and gaze-based metrics for understanding drivers’ mental workload during automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.015,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This Horizon2020-funded driving simulator-based study on automated driving investigated the effect of different car-following scenarios, and takeover situations, on drivers’ mental workload, as measured by eye tracking-based metrics of pupil diameter and self-reported workload ratings. This study incorporated a mixed design format, with 16 drivers recruited for the SAE Level 2 (L2; SAE International, 2021) automation group, who were asked to monitor the driving and road environment during automation, and 16 drivers in the Level 3 (L3) automation group, who engaged in a non-driving related task (NDRT; Arrows task) during automation. Drivers in each group undertook two experimental drives, lasting about 18 min each. To manipulate perceived workload, difficulty of the driving task was controlled by incorporating a lead vehicle which maintained either a Short (0.5 s) or Long (1.5 s) Time Headway (THW) condition during automated car-following (ACF). Each ACF session was followed by a subsequent request to takeover, which happened either in the presence or absence of a lead vehicle. Results from standard deviation of pupil diameter values indicated that drivers’ mental workload levels fluctuated significantly more when monitoring the drive during L2 ACF, compared to manual car-following (MCF). Additionally, we found that drivers’ mental workload, as indicated by their mean pupil diameter, increased steeply around takeovers, and was further exacerbated by the presence of a lead vehicle during the takeovers, especially in the Short THW condition, for both groups. Pupil diameter was found to be sensitive to subtle variations in mental workload, and closely resembled the trend seen in self-reported workload ratings. Further research is warranted to assess the feasibility of using eye-tracking-based metrics along with other physiological sensors, especially in real-world settings, to understand whether they can be used as real-time indicators of drivers’ mental workload, in future driver state monitoring systems.",1369-8478,Not found
"Does in with the new, mean out with the old? An extended theory of planned behaviour exploring the impact of vehicle technologies on intentions to not wear seatbelts",10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.013,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Approximately one in five Australians killed in motor vehicle crashes will not be wearing a seatbelt. A circulating lay theory suggests that drivers may be questioning the continued necessity of seatbelts given advances in other advanced vehicle technologies. This belief is deeply concerning given the implementation of advanced driver assistance systems in new cars is rapidly increasing. The objective of this research was to apply an extended Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), including the additional constructs of trust in vehicle technology and perceived risk of death or injury in the event of a crash, to assess the influence of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control (PBC), trust, and perceived risk on drivers’ intentions to engage in seatbelt non-use. The study also aimed to examine if the predictive utility of the extended TPB differed according to the presence of passive (e.g., airbags) active (e.g., lane keeping assist) technologies in vehicles, Further, the influence of underlying behavioural belief, control beliefs, and normative beliefs on driver’s intentions to engage in seatbelt non-use were also explored. Participants (N = 182, 83 males, M age = 44.23 years) completed a 25-minute online questionnaire. The study was a cross-sectional, between groups design in which all participants were exposed to a baseline control scenario, then randomly allocated to one of four experimental scenarios which manipulated the type of vehicle technologies present in a hypothetical vehicle. Consistent with theoretical expectations of the standard TPB, a hierarchal regression revealed that the constructs of attitude, subjective norms, and PBC (self-efficacy only) significantly and positively predicted seatbelt non-use intentions. Of the extended constructs, trust, but not perceived risk, exhibited a significant effect, and positively predicted seatbelt non-use intentions in the control condition and the active technology condition. Additionally, a critical beliefs analysis found that discomfort was a significant positive predictor of seatbelt non-use intentions. Overall, the findings offer support for the use of the TPB to explain seatbelt non-use intentions and suggest that trust in vehicle technology may influence drivers’ decisions to not wear a seatbelt. This research offers a novel determinant of seatbelt non-use that may be more responsive behavioural change interventions.",1369-8478,Not found

In this study, driver compliance with V2V information in simulated car-following tasks was measured and analyzed under different information display settings, such as baseline without information, visual information only, and multimodal information. Car-following data were collected from 30 participants in a driving simulation environment. The results revealed that V2V information could significantly reduce the driver's response time to the lead car’s speed change, resulting in an increase in the minimum time-to-collision when the lead car slowed down. Driver compliance was significantly higher under multimodal information settings than when using visual information alone. Moreover, driver compliance was higher when facing a decelerating lead car than when facing an accelerating lead car. No significant differences in driver compliance between the deceleration levels was observed; however, differences existed among different car-following preference groups. The findings of this study can be applied to V2V car-following models to improve the simulation accuracy for connected-vehicle traffic. Additionally, multimodal information presentation can provide a reference for V2V communication design.",1369-8478,Not found
Bicycling comfort at roundabouts: Effects of design and situational factors,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.008,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"As roundabouts replace traditional intersections, there are concerns regarding the safety of roundabouts for bicycling. Given the limitations of crash data, this study informs an understanding of bicycle safety at roundabouts in the US through an analysis of cyclists’ perceptions of comfort regarding different roundabout design and operational attributes and different bicycling situations (e.g., entering, exiting, circulating) at roundabouts. In an online questionnaire, we presented 568 US adult bicyclists with renderings of a hypothetical roundabout and asked a series of questions about perceived comfort. We then used an integrated set of ordered probit regression models to analyze comfort outcomes (overall and in five situations) against roundabout attributes, while controlling for personal socio-demographics and cycling characteristics (including type of cyclist). Although most current cyclists (71%) reported some degree of comfort bicycling at roundabouts, around a third (29%) felt somewhat or very uncomfortable. Roundabouts perceived to be more comfortable for bicycling had: one (rather than two) lanes, lower traffic volumes, more bicycle facilities-especially separated bicycle lanes (a “protected roundabout”)-and a larger central island. The most comfortable situations were entering and exiting the roundabout, while the least comfortable situations were riding on the sidewalk or in the crosswalk. Circulating within the roundabout was the situation rated most similar to ratings of overall comfort. “Strong and fearless” cyclists were generally more comfortable at roundabouts than “interested but concerned” cyclists, except for sidewalk riding. These results offer implications for how to make roundabouts more comfortable for people bicycling of all abilities and levels of confidence.",1369-8478,Not found
Formation of crowdshipping habits in public transport: Leveraging anticipated positive emotions through feedback framing,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.012,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"To meet global goals for emission reductions, widespread behaviour change is needed. This includes adoption of novel travel habits. Public transport–based crowdshipping represents an opportunity for linking novel travel habit formation with the challenges posed by the environmentally burdensome state of last-mile parcel deliveries. This paper investigates potential links between anticipated as well as experienced positive emotions and behaviour formation in the highly habitualised context of public transport use. The empirical basis is a two-month real-world field experiment, in which public transport passengers could carry test parcels to and from Automated Parcel Lockers placed at public transport stations and stops. A pre- and post-survey was distributed in relation to the experiment. The results show that participants who to a higher degree anticipated having positive emotions evoked by participation reported a higher degree of habit formation. Second, recipients of an environmentally framed feedback showed more conducive attitudinal and behavioural results, including habit formation and post measures for anticipated positive emotions. Third, the environmentally framed feedback further supported the habit formation effect of anticipated positive emotions. Finally, a higher degree of habit formation was found amongst participants using a smartcard compared to monthly cardholders who do not need to perform any related physical tasks when travelling by public transport. Results indicate the possibilities of supporting motivated cueing, where the reward value of performing a behaviour is conditioned onto situational cues that, with repeated participation, become associated with the (emotional) reward.",1369-8478,Not found
Does active transport lead to improved mood and performance? A panel study of travel changes during the Covid-19 lockdown in Norway,10.1016/j.trf.2022.12.009,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Everyday commuting is seen as a burden and an unwanted necessity for people. Recent studies have challenged this notion and have found that certain aspects of commuting can be positive. In particular, research has shown that active commuting can be an important source of everyday physical activity and a pause between arenas for daily routine. The current study uses the Covid-19 lockdown situation in Norway, and the associated travel restrictions, as a backdrop to study the relationship between active travel and self-reported mood and work performance. In a situation where people are strongly encouraged to take up active mobility forms in place of more passive forms, the often-encountered challenge of self-selection is reduced. A convenience sample was recruited via social media (N = 1319) in May 2020 and completed a total of six follow-up surveys over a period of four months, thus allowing for a panel design as well as a within-subjects comparison. The survey covered topics related to commute mode, experience of travel, current mood, and work performance. Background variables related to personality, general wellbeing as well as sociodemographic measures were also captured. Multivariate models show that those who during this period commute with active modes (walking and cycling) report a higher degree of travel satisfaction than users of passive modes (driving and public transport). Further, active modes are associated with being in a better mood, and with reporting higher work performance. Finally, looking at individuals who over time change travel mode (N = 151), we find that they report improved mood and work performance when travelling with active vs passive modes. The results have implications for policy makers and for employers looking for justification to spend company money on measures to increase active travel.",1369-8478,Not found
"Which visual cues do drivers use to anticipate and slow down in freeway curve approach? An eye-tracking, think-aloud on-road study",10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.021,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Although much research is done on speed and gaze behaviour inside curves, there is little understanding of which cues drivers use to anticipate and slow down while approaching curves. Therefore, an on road experiment was conducted in which 31 participants drove through six freeway curves in their own car. During the experiment, look-ahead fixations and speed were recorded using an eye-tracker and a GPS tracker, respectively. In addition to these measurements, the participants verbalised their reasons for changing speed. The distribution of fixations over various areas of interest was investigated around the start of deceleration before each curve and around the start of each curve. Verbalisation data were analysed to infer the number and types of reasons for changing speed and when these were mentioned together with mentions of deceleration before a curve. The results showed that before starting to decelerate, the participants fixated mostly on the Focus of Expansion and edges parallel to the curve trajectory, whereas most fixations on warning or speed signs were recorded mostly after participants started to decelerate. These findings suggest that drivers use information from the Focus of Expansion, be it a change in optical flow or the presence of a kink in the alignment, as the main cue to start decelerating. Parallel edges are also important cues, whereas warning and speed signs are primarily used to confirm that a speed change is needed.",1369-8478,Not found
Augmented reality interfaces for pedestrian-vehicle interactions: An online study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.005,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Augmented Reality (AR) technology could be utilised to assist pedestrians in navigating safely through traffic. However, whether potential users would understand and use such AR solutions is currently unknown. Nine novel AR interfaces for pedestrian-vehicle communication, previously developed using an experience-based design method, were evaluated through an online questionnaire study completed by 992 respondents in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The AR indicated whether it was safe to cross the road in front of an approaching automated vehicle. Each interface was rated for its intuitiveness and convincingness, aesthetics, and usefulness. Moreover, comments were collected for qualitative analysis. The results indicated that interfaces that employed traditional design elements from existing traffic, and head-up displays, received the highest ratings overall. Statistical results also showed that there were no significant effects of country, age, and gender on interface acceptance. Thematic analysis of the textual comments offered detail on each interface design’s stronger and weaker points, and revealed unintended effects of certain designs. In particular, some of the interfaces were commented on as being dangerous or scary, or were criticised that they could be misinterpreted in that they signal that something is wrong with the vehicle, or that they could occlude the view of the vehicle. The current findings highlight the limitations of experience-based design, and the importance of applying legacy design principles and involving target users in design and evaluation. Future research should be conducted in scenarios in which pedestrians actually interact with approaching vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
"Driver's mental workload classification using physiological, traffic flow and environmental factors",10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.004,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"During the dynamic driving process, classification of mental workload for drivers is a complex task due to multiple factors, including human, vehicle, road, and the environment. Many current studies focus on the impacts of a single factor, such as physiological signal, lane changing, and so on, but these results are usually unsatisfactory due to the incapacity to account for other factors. In response, this work proposes a multi-factor quantification and analysis method to classify the driver's mental workload by incorporating physiological signal, traffic flow, and environment. For physiological signals, we use sensors to gather the driver's Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA). In order to quantify the traffic flow and environment, such as traffic volume, space headway, and weather. We use detection algorithms in images from the car's front and rear driving recorders in the real-world driving experiment on the expressway. Furthermore, we can estimate the distance between surrounding vehicles and the experimental vehicle using the detected car coordinates and camera parameters. This work then applies deep learning algorithms to classify the front driving recorder images into several weather classifications. Finally, the quantified multi-factor data can be utilized to classify the driver's mental workload. Drivers, on the other hand, annotate the data using the NASA Task Load Index Scale's results (NASA-TLX). In our experiments, we compare the classification results of single-factor and multi-factor data with three machine learning algorithms: neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF). The results demonstrate that for traffic volume and space headway from drive recorders, the detection performance of traffic volume in a monocular camera can reach up to 87.3%. Within sight distance, the accuracy of space headway can reach up to 87.1%. The RF algorithm achieves an outstanding classification result with strong stability by incorporating ECG, EDA, traffic flow, and environmental factors, and its classification accuracy achieves 97.8%. These findings further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multi-factor quantification and analysis method.",1369-8478,Not found
"How human-automation interaction experiences, trust propensity and dynamic trust affect drivers’ physiological responses in conditionally automated driving: Moderated moderated-mediation analyses",10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.024,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Although the human-automation interaction experiences (i.e., the takeover request [TOR] lead time and system usage time) have been shown to play an important role in the physiological responses of humans driving automated vehicles (AVs), little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying these relations under different trust propensity levels. To fill this gap, we conducted an experimental study in a simulator with 34 licensed drivers involving a series of takeover events. The self-reported trust ratings, drivers’ galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and monitoring ratio were collected and analyzed. The results show that, after drivers experience TORs, dynamic trust mediates the effects of the human-automation interaction experiences on the GSR and monitoring ratio during the following non-takeover periods. Additionally, high trust propensity weakens the impact of the TOR lead time on dynamic trust, while long system usage time strengthens the relations between dynamic trust and the GSR, HR. Moreover, the TOR lead time moderates the relation between dynamic trust and the monitoring ratio. Specifically, this significant relation only exists during non-driving-related tasks after experiencing the 8 s and +∞ s TOR lead time but not after experiencing the 4 s TOR lead time. These findings could provide additional support for the design of the adaptive vehicle-driver interface and onboard soothing technology in conditionally AVs to calibrate trust and improve driving experiences.",1369-8478,Not found
Evolutions in undirected travel (satisfaction) during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.025,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that undirected travel (UT), or trips taken for their own sake, can partly compensate for a reduction in destination-based trips due to governmental regulations. Consequently, UT (in general, but particularly during the pandemic) may be especially satisfying and therefore important to subjective well-being. However, through the course of the pandemic, changes in UT were anticipated as individuals adapted to a ‘new normal’. This research – conducted in Flanders, Belgium – first investigates whether the characteristics of and satisfaction with UT persisted after one year into the pandemic (April 2020 to May 2021) using longitudinal panel data from two waves (n = 332). Results of paired sample t-tests indicate that UT satisfaction increased though duration of trips decreased, and results of the Sign test indicate that the frequency of UT generally decreased. Second, this research investigates characteristics of individuals with different UT behavior. Six profiles of UT behavior were identified based on starting or stopping UT, increasing or decreasing UT, maintaining UT frequency, or not participating in UT. Chi2 tests identified differences among profiles based on wave 1 UT frequency, most recent trip mode, socio-demographic, and household characteristics. Results indicate that participation in UT might motivate future UT, one to three UT trips per week is a maintainable frequency, UT might be important to those with smaller living spaces and those living with children or other adults, and suggest that attention should be paid to mobility equity, including how and for whom systems are planned. These findings are important to understanding the effects of long-term governmental regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on travel behavior, and how investigating UT might help to challenge and reimagine traditional mobility systems post-pandemic.",1369-8478,Not found
"Walk or run? An observational study to explore pedestrian crossing decision-making at intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh applying rules mining technique",10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.003,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"To ensure the safety of pedestrians, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of their road crossing behaviors, including the factors that influence the decisions they make regarding crossing. One of the crucial crossing behaviors of pedestrians is the crossing pattern, which refers to whether a pedestrian crosses the road by walking or running. Safety of the pedestrians often depends on it as running crossing pattern is one of the riskiest crossing behaviors. However, there is a lack of inclusive studies that explore pedestrians’ decision regarding their crossing pattern. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the significant factors influencing pedestrians' decision regarding their crossing patterns (walk or run) at intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using the chi-square test, and to examine the association between the identified contributory factors and crossing pattern using the association rules mining technique. Pedestrian road crossing behaviors, their characteristics, and traffic characteristics related data were collected from six busy intersections in Dhaka using the videography survey method. Findings of the study showed that walking crossing pattern was strongly associated with the factors such as controlled intersection, narrow road, wide median, female pedestrian, older pedestrian, using two-stage strategy, group crossing, accepting larger gap, using crosswalk, and crossing in front of slower vehicles. Besides, running crossing pattern was strongly associated with uncontrolled intersection, wide road, narrow median, male pedestrian, younger pedestrian, using rolling gap strategy, crossing alone, accepting shorter gap, crossing through conflict zone, and crossing in front of light and faster vehicles. The findings of this study would aid policymakers to develop effective solutions to improve pedestrian safety as well as to design future technologies like automated driving systems.",1369-8478,Not found
The development and application of the drivers’ attitudes of right-of-way questionnaire (DARQ),10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.020,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This study explored differences in the right-of-way attitudes of different drivers and the utility of right-of-way attitudes for predicting drivers’ driving behaviors through the development of the Drivers’ Attitudes of Right-of-way Questionnaire (DARQ). DARQ is a tool to judge the negative attitudes of drivers of the right-of-way and hence assist in the selection of excellent professional drivers. Moreover, the study defined drivers’ attitudes of the right-of-way and determines the psychological components of such attitudes. A total of 614 drivers participated in the study. After two tests, the DARQ was established, consisting of assessments of three dimensions: cognition, behavioral tendency, and emotion. We assessed Cronbach’s alpha, split-half reliability, and structural and criterion validity of the questionnaire; the DARQ had a sound theoretical construction and good reliability and validity. Results revealed that professional drivers and professional drivers without accidents had higher correctness of right-of-way attitudes. This shows that the questionnaire had good criterion validity and could be used to effectively screen professional drivers, especially those without accidents. The results also revealed differences in the correctness of drivers’ right-of-way attitudes according to gender, age, and driving experience (cognition and behavioral tendency). Male drivers, older drivers, and experienced drivers had more correct cognitions and behavioral tendencies than did female drivers, young drivers, and novice drivers. Finally, we conducted a third test with 214 drivers. The results revealed that the correctness of drivers’ right-of-way attitudes predicted prosocial and aggressive driving behavior. The higher the correctness of drivers’ right-of-way attitudes (cognition and behavioral tendency), the higher the level of prosocial driving behavior, and the lower the level of aggressive driving behavior. The more positive drivers’ emotions regarding right-of-way attitudes, the higher the level of prosocial driving behavior and the lower level of aggressive driving behavior. The study helps advance the measurement of right-of-way attitudes and automatic driving research. For example, this provides reference data and a model of human traffic participants’ right-of-way attitudes that could help inform research on automatic driving. Moreover, the results of this study could provide guidance for the screening and training of professional drivers, especially professional drivers without accidents, to reduce the rate of traffic accidents.",1369-8478,Not found
Adding visual contextual information to continuous sonification feedback about low-reliability situations in conditionally automated driving: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.017,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"In conditionally automated driving, control transitions where drivers are asked to take over manual control quickly are a known challenge as drivers are likely “out-of-the-loop” due to automated driving. We previously demonstrated a useful sonification feedback design to support drivers for takeover events by manipulating background music to convey real-time changes in the automation reliability level. The present research examines two types of auxiliary information—explanations about the potential sources for reduced reliability and recommended actions to prepare for a potential takeover event—to communicate event-specific context about the low-reliability situations indicated by the sonification feedback. In a driving simulator with SAE level 3 automation, forty participants were assigned to one of four interface conditions: (i) sonification feedback only, (ii) sonification feedback and visual auxiliary information providing explanations, (iii) sonification feedback and visual auxiliary information providing action recommendations, or (iv) sonification feedback and both explanatory and action-recommending auxiliary information. Participants experienced six low-reliability events that belonged to three types of situations that may eventually lead to a takeover event: operational problems, system limitations, and unexpected events. Two events became system-requested takeover events. Our results showed that auxiliary information impacted visual information processing but not the takeover decisions or response times to takeover requests. The situation type—characterized by the availability of cues and presence of hazards in the environment—also played a significant role in both participants’ takeover decisions and visual information processing behaviors. These findings have implications for designing effective feedback for not only Level 3 automation, which we studied, but also for Level 4 dual-mode vehicles that could allow transitions to manual driving when exiting their operational design domains and for Level 2 automation, where drivers may need more support to monitor the road effectively and make more timely takeover decisions.",1369-8478,Not found
The notorious B.I.T: The effects of a ransomware and a screen failure on distraction in automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.002,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Connected and automated vehicles are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which may jeopardise their safe and efficient operation and, as a result, negatively affect drivers’ behaviour. A major concern for such cyber-attacks is visual distraction inside the vehicle, which is one of the main causes of road accidents. In this empirical research using a driving simulator, 38 participants drove in a conditionally automated vehicle and experienced two types of failure: explicit (i.e., ransomware attack appearing on the in-vehicle screen) and silent (i.e., turn signals failed to activate on the in-vehicle screen and instrument cluster), while engaged in a non-driving related task. Drivers’ gaze behaviour, in terms of number and duration of fixation, were collected and analysed. Results showed that the HMI where the ransomware was displayed was the area of interest drivers looked at the most. The majority of drivers failed to notice that the turn signal was faulty. Nearly half of drivers looked at the ransomware for more than 12 s while driving. No effect on the timing of failure on gaze behaviour was observed. This research evidenced that ransomware attacks are distractive and pose significant risks to road safety – with one participant crashing the vehicle after resuming manual control. Data also evidenced that such connected vehicles are unlikely to meet NHTSA’s distraction guidelines for safe use of in-vehicle devices.",1369-8478,Not found
Pilot study: Effect of roles and responsibility training on driver's use of adaptive cruise control between younger and older adults,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.023,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"With the development of driver support systems (SAE Levels 1 – 2), drivers must take on new monitoring and supervision tasks in additional to manual driving. Training is necessary to clarify drivers' new roles and promote safe usage and trust in these systems. Providing training for lower-levels of automation may also benefit drivers’ acceptance of future Fully Automated Vehicles (FAVs, SAE Level 5). However, younger and older drivers differ in training preferences (e.g., owner's manual vs on-road trial and error) and hold different attitudes towards automation. This study investigates the effects of additional training on drivers' roles and responsibilities when using Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC, SAE Level 1) for younger and older drivers. Thirty-nine adults (20 younger + 19 older) were trained on one of two ACC training protocols: basic (system functionality, operational procedures, and limitations) and comprehensive (basic training + ACC background and roles of responsibilities). Participants’ situational trust and ACC usage was evaluated before, during, and after experiencing an emergency event while using ACC in a driving simulator study. Results showed that the comprehensive training promoted drivers' situational trust in ACC, ACC usage, and the acceptance of FAvs Compared to younger drivers, older drivers used ACC less, reported less dynamic situational trust, higher levels of workload, and lower acceptance. Overall, comprehensive training resulted in older drivers behaving similarly to younger drivers. The comprehensive training also promoted the acceptance of FAVs for both younger and older drivers. In conclusion, training of drivers’ roles and responsibilities has an impact on drivers’ usage of ACC and may be particularly useful for older drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Technology readiness and intentions to use conditionally automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.001,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are an emerging technology predicted to become available to the public over the next several decades. CAVs offer a range of potential benefits to the driver and broader society including reducing road trauma, decreasing traffic congestion, and offering new mobility choices. However, there is uncertainty regarding uptake of this new technology. If users do not see the value in the technology, it is unlikely to be fully adopted and the potential benefits of CAVs will not be realised. One commonly used instrument to investigate user acceptance of new technology is the Technology Readiness Index (TRI). The TRI has been used to investigate intentions to use CAVs in various countries, however no such study has been undertaken in Finland. As such the aim of this research was to investigate technology readiness and intentions to use conditionally automated vehicles amongst Finnish residents. A total of 384 participants (M = 46.9yrs; SD = 14.9yrs, 24.5 % female) completed a survey consisting of the TRI 2.0, demographics, car ownership, driving information and intentions to use conditionally automated vehicles. A multilinear regression was conducted to examine the factors that influence self-reported intentions to use a conditionally automated vehicle. When controlling for the other variables, Optimism and Insecurity were significantly associated with intentions to use a conditionally automated vehicle. Optimism had a positive correlation, with stronger intentions to use a conditionally automated vehicle among those who were more optimistic towards technology. Participants with lower levels of insecurity, that is, those who felt more secure with technology, also had stronger intentions to use a conditionally automated vehicle. The other significant variable in the model was previous experience with a CAV which had a significant positive relationship. The study adds to the existing literature regarding CAV adoption and provides added insight within a Finnish context of how exposure to technology and the factors of the TRI can influence intentions to use conditionally automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Social identity based motivation to engage in collective action supporting the redistribution of street space,10.1016/j.trf.2023.01.009,94,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Reallocation of street space to active travel modes remains contested, despite the need for a sustainable mobility transition. Citizen engagement plays a crucial role in pushing city councils to take action and provide safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. In this study, we assess what drives active support for policies redistributing street space, focusing on transport user groups and their social identities that may influence active engagement in favor (or in opposition) to these transport policies. We draw on the Social Identity Model of Collective Action to investigate processes influencing active policy support as a form of collective action. Based on a representative sample of German citizens (N = 615), we observe a medium–low willingness to get actively engaged. Findings suggest that people identifying with minority groups (e.g. cyclists) profiting from changes to the status quo are most willing to support policies redistributing street space. A sense of collective efficacy and perceived social pressure within the group through social norms seem particularly important. As social identity processes appear to influence people’s policy support more so than their mode choice itself, there are widespread implications for the mobility transition. We discuss the benefits of considering social identities from the perspective of policy makers as well as citizen initiatives.",1369-8478,Not found
How does talking with passengers threatens pedestrian life? An analysis of drivers' performance based on real-world driving data,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.010,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Talking with passengers while driving may impair driver performance. However, little is known about the extent to which this factor affects driver behavior. Since distracted driving accounts for most pedestrian accidents, the present study seeks to demonstrate the danger posed to pedestrian crossing safety by talking with passengers. Based on a real-world driving approach, the current study examines how talking with a passenger affects a driver’s behavior when encountering pedestrians. A study of 41 participants’ driving behavior at different locations was conducted, and 2,922 conflicts with pedestrians were coded according to four conditions (without or with passengers, and at marked crossings or at other locations). Using binary regression, it was found that this factor near pedestrian crossing areas causes significant dysfunction in driving yielding behavior. Distraction negatively affects driver-yielding behavior when drivers engage in speeding, resulting in a fivefold decrease in evasive maneuvers. In addition, a multinomial regression model indicated that drivers would reduce their evasive maneuvers by more than 60%, with lane changes accounting for most of these maneuvers. Also, the present study concluded that pedestrian crossing gaps should be at least two times larger when drivers converse with passengers than when they do not do so. This study may contribute to the development of legislation, policy, countermeasures, and future research aimed at reducing distracted driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Zebra crossings at T-intersections: Likelihood of unintended negative consequences for safety and walkability,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.005,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Local governments in Melbourne are installing zebra crossings at prioritised T-intersections within activity centres and neighbourhoods. These treatments are well-intentioned and meant to increase certainty for road users, to create a more equitable and safer mobility environment for pedestrians, and to work as one small part of an integrated approach to encourage walking for transport. However, there is complexity in, and poor knowledge of the road rules with which the treatment interacts: Drivers turning into such an intersection are already required to give way to pedestrians, while, somewhat counterintuitively for many road users, drivers turning out are not. As a result, there is a risk that the treatment may have systems level unintended negative consequences for walkability. This study used a community survey and a series of expert interviews to test this hypothesis. The results show that while zebra crossings at the terminating road of a T-intersection can eliminate the uncertainties implicated by the current version of the road rules at the sites in which they are installed, there is also a very real risk that their use at some but not all T-intersections could undermine walkability in the neighbourhoods in which they are used. A recommendation, supported by a recent UK precedent, to change the Victorian road rules to require car drivers to give way to pedestrians who are crossing the terminating road of T-intersections, is made. The change would standardise the rules for T-intersections to create a generalised and unambiguous duty for drivers to give way on turning. It would play a small part in facilitating walking for transport and in doing so would contribute to enhancing opportunities for incidental exercise and social interaction, both of which benefit health and are important aspects of liveability.",1369-8478,Not found

Efforts to increase cycling uptake are hindered by negative attitudes towards cyclists. Recent research from Australia has found that many people consider cyclists to be less than fully human. There is currently a lack of empirical evidence that explains these dehumanising perceptions. Most people who ride bicycles in Australia wear safety helmets as required by mandatory helmet laws. We hypothesised that people wearing bicycle helmets are perceived as less human compared to people without helmets due to reduced visibility of eyes and hair. We tested this hypothesis through a survey (n = 563) comprised of two-paired alternate forced choice questions to identify which image of a cyclist respondents consider to be less human. We then analysed the results using a Bradley-Terry probability model. We found images of cyclists wearing helmets or safety vests to have a higher probability of being selected as less human compared to images of cyclists wearing no safety equipment.

Short term memory and peripheral vision at junctions,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.004,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Motorcyclists are at extremely high risk of death in crashes where another vehicle pulls out into their path at a junction. Such crashes have often been described as the result of “look but fail to see” errors. However, recent research has shown that such errors occur even after a driver has looked directly at an oncoming motorcyclist. An alternative explanation for some of these crashes is the “saw but forgot” error. The idea that drivers might forget vehicles they have looked at only moments earlier is surprising, but it matches recent cognitive research that highlights limitations in visual short term memory. We present a cognitive model that highlights the limitations of drivers’ vision and memory at junctions. In two laboratory experiments we explore 68 young drivers’ abilities to make safe decisions at junctions and their memory for oncoming vehicles. In each experiment the driver is required to make head movements to view static images to the right, the left, and straight ahead. Views are projected over 180 degrees and the driver’s basic task it to respond when they feel the junction is safe for them to cross. On occasional trials drivers are given a surprise memory test. Drivers find this task remarkably hard, frequently missing safe crossing opportunities and choosing to cross when it is not safe. Notably, drivers are much more likely to choose to a cross in front of an oncoming vehicle once they have looked away from it, suggesting that in this task failing to remember an oncoming vehicle is a more frequent cause of errors than failing to perceive it. This conclusion is supported by the memory tests which revealed that in even moderately busy traffic conditions the junction crossing task can exceed the capacity of visual short term memory. In the first experiment we separately explore the influence of peripheral vision, finding that drivers’ decision making and memory in this task is poor with or without peripheral information being present. In the second experiment we explore an initial intervention designed to enhance phonological memory but do not find that it improves memory for oncoming motorcyclists. In the second experiment we additionally separate out the influence of load (number of vehicles present) and delay (how long ago the vehicles were seen). This separation shows clear effects of load, but not delay on memory. We interpret these as evidence for both proactive and retroactive interference in visual short term memory. The current research shows that even a simple junction crossing task can exceed the capacity of visual short term memory. We suggest that this may be an important cause of junction crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessment of the cooperation between driver and vehicle automation: A framework,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.002,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"As long as the human driver is responsible for part(s) of the driving task during automated driving, the driver and automated driving system are sharing the driving task. Such a shared task is characterized by shared control, in which cooperation between the driver and vehicle automation is essential. However, means to holistically assess the quality of this cooperation are currently lacking. This work addresses how cooperation between driver and vehicle automation can be operationalized and assessed to gain insight into the quality of the shared driving task. Quality indicators and measurement methods are identified across seven dimensions reflective of the quality of cooperation between driver and automation. Based on previous empirical and theoretical studies a total of 34 quality indicators are identified. The methods to measure these quality indicators fall into four categories: 1) Subjective (such as questionnaires); 2) behavioral (such as reaction times, steering response); 3) neurophysiological (such as heart rate and pupil size); and 4) heuristic evaluation. The result is a first step in the development of a framework for the quantitative assessment of cooperation in the shared driving task. Yet, important knowledge gaps remain. For instance, the exact contribution of each quality indicator and their exact interrelationship are currently unclear. Moreover, all quality indicators reflect a requirement that should be met. Further research is needed to define exactly when each requirement is met. Additionally, it should be established to what degree each measurement method can validly and reliably provide insight into their quality indicator. Therefore, to ultimately ensure valid and reliable application of the framework in practice, the framework should continue to be developed and improved upon in future work.",1369-8478,Not found

A total of 286 participants (188 women) were recruited from a community sample of Australian drivers who completed an online questionnaire and watched a video vignette showing a provocative driving event. As expected, narcissism and driver comparison predicted higher levels of driver aggression, and aggression was higher in conditions where a driver’s ego was threatened. However, there was no interactive effect of ego threat and narcissism or driver comparison on driver aggression. Our findings have implications for the development of a consistent, theoretically grounded definition of driver aggression that focuses on intention to harm, and for the development of measures that operationalise the construct in this manner.",1369-8478,Not found
Yield or not to yield? An inquiry into drivers’ behaviour when a fully automated vehicle indicates a lane-changing intention,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.012,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Automated vehicles have started to be integrated into the road transportation system and operate in a mixed traffic environment. To ensure a smooth and successful integration, it is vital to have a good understanding of the human factor challenges involved in the process, especially the issues related to other road users who will share roads with automated vehicles. The study focuses on conventional vehicle drivers’ acceptance of and interaction with fully automated vehicles (FAV). An online survey with experimental scenarios showing an FAV’s lane-changing intention was designed to test the interaction responses of participants. The survey also collected the participants’ demographic information (e.g., age, gender, driving experience), self-reported general driving behaviours (e.g., errors, lapses and violations), past benchmark behaviour in the same situation and their acceptance of FAVs. The study recruited 838 participants in total, comprising 465 participants from Australia (216 males vs. 249 females) and 373 participants from China (172 males vs. 201 females). Ordered probit models were developed to predict three types of behavioural responses of drivers in the lane-changing scenario, i.e., positive, disregardful and aggressive responses. The results showed that older drivers, females, and drivers who had less driving experience were more likely to adopt positive interactions with FAVs than their counterparts. Drivers who reported frequent risky driving behaviours (e.g., aggressions, lapses and errors) were less likely to report positive interaction but more likely to report disregardful and aggressive interactions. Drivers reporting more positive/favourable attitudes and a higher trust toward FAVs demonstrated a higher possibility of positive interaction, and those with higher perceived behaviour control were more likely to restrain disregardful interaction. The study helps to form a greater understanding of conventional vehicle drivers’ perception of FAVs and the underlying factors that may influence their interaction behavioural tendency.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ behaviour when overtaking cyclists on rural roads: Driving simulator validation using naturalistic data,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.011,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Driving simulator is a useful tool for obtaining data on driver behaviour efficiently and quickly. However, to ensure the reliability of the data gathered by the simulator, it is necessary to check the differences between drivers’ behaviour in the simulator and in reality. In this study, an existing two-lane rural road was replicated on the driving simulator under the same traffic conditions of groups of cyclists and oncoming motorised vehicles. For this purpose, a naturalistic field data collection was developed on the real road using instrumented bicycles and static video recordings. A total of 30 volunteers participated in the driving simulator tests. The objective validation of the driving simulator was based on three operational variables: average travel speed, overtaking vehicle speed, and lateral clearance. As a result, higher average travel speeds and lower lateral clearances were obtained in the real world compared to those observed in the simulator. It was also found that overtaking vehicle speed depends on the group of cyclists. Overall, the data obtained in the field and in the driving simulator did not present statistically significant differences. The analysis of drivers’ perception in the simulator tests concluded that the simulator reflected reality in an accurate way, achieving the subjective validation of the driving simulator. Thus, this study validates the driving simulator for bicycle safety research on rural roads.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating driver uncertainty about lane change decisions,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.001,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Driver uncertainty in lane change maneuvers can induce long reaction times and lead to dangerous crashes. However, drivers’ uncertainty about their lane change decisions has not yet been targeted by researchers or vehicle manufacturers. This paper aims to investigate driver uncertainty by evaluating the variables distance gap, time-to-collision (TTC), and closing velocity between the vehicle changing lines and an oncoming vehicle. A driving simulator study was conducted with 29 participants who had to decide if, in a given traffic situation triggered by an acoustic signal, a lane change to the left would be safe. Participants’ reaction times, subjective certainty scores, and lane change decisions were recorded as indicators of driver uncertainty. The results show that the factors distance gap, TTC, and closing velocity significantly affect driver uncertainty. The analyses polynomial regression, polynomial ordinal regression, and repeated measure logistic regression were used to separately predict driver uncertainty in terms of reaction time, subjective certainty scores, and lane change decisions. The results show that all three factors are necessary for predicting driver uncertainty. The distance gap results in the strongest influence on driver uncertainty, followed by the TTC, and lastly the closing velocity. In addition, reaction times and subjective certainty scores were found to be significantly negatively correlated with each other.",1369-8478,Not found
A psychological profile of drivers convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.007,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Driving under the influence of alcohol (driving while intoxicated [DWI]) is a rather large social problem. It can be influenced by the driver’s personality, risk perception, difficulties related to hyperactivity, or attention deficit and alcohol dependencies; all of which share complex relations with each other, increasing the probability of criminal behaviour while driving and of road accidents. The purpose of this study is to explore the way in which personality, personality disorders, risk perception and behaviour while driving, hyperactivity or attention deficit, and the problematic consumption of alcohol are expressed in a sample of Spanish drivers who had been found guilty of committing DWI offences. These results are compared with those recorded for a sample of drivers with no history of such violations. For this study, a total of 115 subjects sentenced to perform road safety-related community service work (CSW) as a result of DWI convictions, as well as 97 drivers with no violations, were evaluated using Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) tests, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE), the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Version 1.1, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Our results reveal that DWI traffic offenders exhibit risky consumption and signs of dependence (on alcohol and/or other drugs), and low levels of risk perception that are significantly lower than those observed for drivers without infractions. The logistic regression model provides data that supports the implication of a low perception of risk while driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, the violation of rules, extroverted personality traits, openness and cordiality, the indications of possible paranoid and antisocial PDs, and a below-university level of education as predictors of road crime due to DWI. This statistical solution offers a classificatory model with adequate internal and external validity. This scientific evidence could be useful for the design and improvement of prevention and reinsertion plans.",1369-8478,Not found
Motivational and deterrent effects of route attributes in cyclists’ route choice,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.003,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Cyclists’ route choice is influenced by various route attributes as well as by individual characteristics or the purpose of cycling. Previous studies examined the extent to which those route attributes either motivate or deter to choose a certain route. However, one attribute, e.g. traffic volume, can both motivate and deter depending on the specific level, e.g. high vs. low traffic volume, and the effect of the levels may not be equal. Previous studies usually focused on either the motivational or the deterrent level. This study aims to compare both levels of several attributes, considering also individual factors and different cycling purposes. In an online questionnaire, (N = 169) participants were firstly separated into two trip purpose conditions by instruction (work vs. shopping). They were then presented with two routes representing the motivational and deterrent aspect of one attribute, and were asked for the maximum acceptable travel time for one route given the travel time of the alternative route and vice versa. Results indicate that commuter cyclists are more sensitive to deterrent aspects than to motivational aspects. In general, the gradient and the surface of a route have the highest impact, whereas advisory cycle lanes and traffic lights have the smallest. However, the impact of route attributes was influenced by individual aspects. This study is one of few that examined the impact of various route attributes by considering both the motivational and deterrent level of each attribute. It, thus, exceeds the existing literature by results of these effects and help to obtain a deeper understanding of cyclists’ decision to choose or avoid certain routes.",1369-8478,Not found
Is text-based user manual enough? A driving simulator study of three training paradigms for conditionally automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.006,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Training drivers about the automated driving system is one way for establishing safe and efficient driver interactions with a conditionally automated vehicle. This study investigated the effectiveness of three training paradigms—written, video (contains use cases), and interactive guides (support practices of use cases)—in a driving simulator study. Thirty participants with little or no prior experiences in driving automation were recruited and randomly assigned to participate in one of the training paradigms followed by a written test and two driving trips in a simulator. Explicit knowledge acquisition following training, driving performance during the simulated trips, and changes in acceptance of automation after training were analyzed. Results showed that: (1) there were no significant differences among the training groups in the declarative knowledge section of the test; however, the video guide group outperformed the written guide group in the procedural knowledge and strategic knowledge sections, and the interactive guide group outperformed the written guide group in the strategic knowledge; (2) Training type produced a significant effect on manual response times, but not visual response times, to non-scheduled takeover requests: the interactive guide group produced the shortest manual response times; (3) the interactive guide group performed better in takeover control during non-scheduled takeover scenario and (4) spent more time viewing the road during periods of low-reliability automated driving; (5) the written guide group reported decreased perceived safety after training. These findings suggest that the inclusion of use cases (in video and interactive guides) and providing hands-on practices (in interactive guide) have unique potentials in developing drivers’ knowledge in conditionally automated driving. This work has important implications for the effective design of conditionally automated driving training, as well as for the design of human-machine interface in automated vehicles to support users in developing and maintaining situation awareness.",1369-8478,Not found
Traffic safety effects of economic driving in trucking companies,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.011,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The present study examines the relationship between economic driving and road safety in trucking companies that have received support to work with economic driving, and a Reference sample of drivers from assumed average companies. The study is based on survey data (N = 366), and qualitative interviews (N = 26) with managers and employees. We first test the relationship between economic driving and traffic safety at the driver level (aim 1) and find a clear relationship: drivers with high scores in the fleet management systems, which record key aspects of economic and safe driving style, have a lower accident risk than drivers with lower scores. We then test the relationship between economic driving and traffic safety at the organizational level (aim 2), using the Eco Ladder for energy management approach to describe companies with different levels of measures to facilitate economic driving. Results indicate a lower accident risk for companies at the top level in the Eco Ladder for long-distance and regional transport (but not in distribution transport). This is due to the fact that the companies at the top of the Eco ladder have the most measures to facilitate economic driving, and thus the largest proportion of drivers with high scores in the fleet management system. We find relationships between focus on economy and safety at both driver, technology and company level. We also discuss potential conflicts between economic driving and traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Improving drivers’ merging performance in work zone using an in-vehicle audio warning,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.004,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Work zone poses a great impact on traffic safety, and one of the important reasons is the increased merging behavior caused by lane closure. This study focuses on drivers’ lane-merging process in work zones, considering both individual driving behaviors and interaction risks with surrounding vehicles. An intelligent in-vehicle audio warning was proposed to improve the merging behaviors, and its efficacy was tested in a driving simulator experiment. Forty-two participants comprising 22 males (12 professional drivers vs. 10 non-professional drivers) and 20 females (10 professional drivers vs. 10 non-professional drivers) took part in the study. Five traffic density levels and five different locations to release the audio warning were set to collect the behavioral and trajectory data. The results showed the audio warning could reduce the merging risks evidently. However, its effectiveness was affected when the warning information was released too late. A high traffic density was associated with poor driver behavior and high merging risks. Male drivers were more likely to have interaction risks with the lead vehicles than female drivers. Professional drivers had more stable vehicle operating and lower merging risks during lane-merging than non-professional drivers. The research shed some lights on work-zone planning and management strategies.",1369-8478,Not found
Study on the influence factors of takeover behavior in automated driving based on survival analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.012,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The driver’s takeover behavior is critical to safety during automated driving in fog zones. This paper aims to explore the influence mechanism of takeover behavior, this paper analyzes the influence of various factors on takeover behavior from the perspective of event duration, and the influence mechanism of takeover behavior can be promoted. A takeover behavior test platform of L3 automated driving technology was developed based on a driving simulator, and a high-fidelity driving simulation experiment was carried out with the fog zone selected as the takeover scenario. The takeover request time (TOR) was set as 5 s and 10 s, and the no-driving-related task (NDRT) was set as work tasks and entertainment tasks. 42 drivers were invited to participate in the experiment where takeover behavior data were obtained. Takeover response time and takeover correct time are representative indicators of takeover behavior, which are extracted from takeover response and takeover performance. The survival analysis (the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards method) was used to explore the effects of factors (gender, age, driving age, TOR, NDRT) on survival time (takeover response time, takeover correct time). The KM model results show that driver attribute factors (gender, age, and driving age) had significant difference on takeover response time. Females were more cautious about the takeover, and their response time is shorter than that of males. The takeover response time increased with age and driving age, with statistical difference. Only TOR had a statistical difference in the takeover correct time, while other factors had no statistical significance. The takeover correct time of TOR-10 s (median = 8.50 s) is higher than the TOR-5 s (median = 3.65 s). However, the mean value of takeover correct time corresponding to 5 s is higher than 10 s. The Cox model results are consistent with the KM model, and the model results show that external variables (TOR, NDRT) have significant influence on the takeover correct time. The work task requires more immersion, and the longer time it takes for drivers to recover the situational awareness of driving, which leads to an increase in the takeover correct time. Based on the survival analysis method, this research studies the influence of factors on takeover behavior from the perspective of the duration of takeover events, which can lay a foundation for in-depth study on the influence mechanism about takeover behavior. The study can also provide references for the improvement of drivers’ takeover behavior, and the optimization design of the takeover warning system.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving and forgetting: Why what we remember isn't what occured,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.016,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"It is a commonly held belief that our memories are good, that we can recall all the things that we saw and that happened to us. On our drive to or from work we can describe with confidence the route we took and what the traffic was like. But driving is very proceduralised, and our memory for what happened most recently is often based on what we usually see, a pastiche of events that may have happened, or not. This experiment set out to extend our understanding of memory reliability by testing people’s recollections about a recent drive. Over two drives participants traversed familiar roads in the University of Waikato driving simulator. Participants took three memory tests about what they saw during the drives. The first one was after a control drive, the second one after a drive in which the participant called out interesting, unusual, and hazardous objects (a detection task), and a third memory test was 48 h after completing the second drive. The results of the memory test showed a typicality effect, with drivers’ memories being almost twice as accurate for very atypical events they encountered. There was also a delayed recognition effect, with recall 48 h after experiencing lower rates of recognition than either immediate condition. The rates of false alarms were over 50% for the delayed recognition of very typical and medium items. Immediate memories of very typical items by the control group were also high (nearly 40%). The act of looking for something while driving (the detection task) had the effect of reducing the false alarm rate for all items. The rate of false alarms was very low for very atypical items under all tasks. The results are interpreted as being of importance for those interested in memory and attention, as a means of determining what drivers attend to, and what they do not.",1369-8478,Not found
Risk of OSA affects reaction time and driving performance more than insomnia in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.014,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Sleep disorders have been implicated as a cause of motor vehicle crashes in select populations through reduced cognitive function. We investigated the impact of insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on reaction times and driving performance in the population-based cohort of older adults in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Risk of OSA was classified by the positive responses to the STOP-BA(N)G questionnaire. Time-dependent cognitive function was formally evaluated in all participants with choice reaction times (CRT). Of 30,097 participants, 2657 (8.8 %) met criteria for insomnia and 2092 (7.0 %) were classified as high risk of OSA. Insomnia was equally distributed in all risk categories for OSA. Both self-reported lane position errors and driving safety were more often described as worse in moderate and higher risk groups for OSA although there was also a marginal association with improved driving safety. This is in spite of the fact that daily driving frequency was reported more often with higher risk categories of OSA. Choice reaction times were on average longer in both moderate (845.7 ± 245 msec) and higher (860.2 ± 263 msec) risk groups for OSA compared to participants with low risk of OSA (860.2 ± 266 msec). Insomnia was not associated with driving performance, lane position errors and CRT. Subgroups with categories based upon OSA risk groups with and without insomnia showed no distinct relationship beyond the association with OSA risk categories alone. Too few responses were recorded to assess near miss and motor vehicle crashes. We conclude that objective slower reaction times and poorer self-reported driving performance were associated with the risk of OSA but not insomnia.",1369-8478,Not found
Do people drive as they live together? Associations between aggressive behaviour on the road and intimate relationships,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.015,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Aggressive behaviour is a common response in different contexts all around the world. General aggression theories, such as the frustration-aggression theory, try to explain this behaviour in any context. However, situational specificity could play a relevant role in this issue, so proneness to behave aggressively may depend more on the context than on a general root or personality trait. With the aim of shedding light in this field, the current research aimed to analyse the relationship between aggressive behaviour on the road and intimate relationships. A sample composed of 275 participants who had a driving license and lived with an intimate partner completed a set of self-reports regarding aggressive behaviour in both contexts. The results suggested a convergence in the way of expressing anger, except in the case of adaptive aggression. A SEM-based approach indicated that the measured aggressive variables fitted better in two highly correlated factors rather than a single one, suggesting the relevance of the situational specificity in the prediction of aggressive behaviour in both contexts.

Improving young drivers’ speed compliance through a single dose of feedback,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.006,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Feedback is an important component in learning, including the development of safe driving for novice drivers. Research shows that feedback can reduce the number of speeding occurrences, and the likelihood of speeding-related incidents and accidents, but it is not clear how often feedback should be provided. The present study builds on a series of laboratory and field studies that showed providing feedback to novice drivers about their speeding performance, financial and safety implications on one occasion after a baseline drive, improved their speed compliance on a subsequent test drive. The benefit was evident six months post intervention. The aim of the current study was to investigate on-road whether this effect could be enhanced by more frequent feedback of the same type. Seventy young drivers (54% male) were randomly allocated to one of five groups in which frequency of feedback was varied: Feedback provided on one, two, three or four occasions each spaced one week apart or no feedback. The effect of frequency of feedback was tested at weekly intervals for 4 weeks (i.e., immediately, then at subsequent sessions that occurred one, two, and three weeks after the first), then six months post-intervention. The results revealed that feedback provided on only one or two occasions was the most effective in reducing young drivers’ average speed and percentage of time speeding for lower (50 km/h) and higher (80 km/h) speed zones. The benefits were not enhanced by multiple feedback occasions. The Control (no feedback) group showed the worst speed compliance, with mean speed and percentage of time speeding increasing from the baseline.

To help prevent this particular type of crash, new driver monitoring technologies track ocular and head movement and alert drivers when periods of prolonged distraction are detected, thus preventing hazardous situations on the road. In this mixed-factorial multi-level experiment, the behaviour of drivers was measured as they performed a secondary task while being monitored via an auditory Driver Distraction Warning (A-DDW) device which reminded them to look at the road ahead and cease the activity which was the source of distraction. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of this type of DDW device by measuring longitudinal and lateral behaviour in situations where the driver is intentionally distracted for a significant period of time, and when the device repeatedly reminds the driver of his/her primary task. Forty-two participants were randomly stratified into three groups and subjected to the following distraction levels: (i) not distracted (baseline), (ii) distracted, and (iii) distracted but interacting with the A-DDW device. All participants drove in (i) free-flowing and (ii) stable traffic conditions along straight motorway segments. Speed and speed deviation values for distracted drivers were lower than for undistracted ones but they also experienced a significant deterioration in vehicle lateral control. Conversely, drivers assisted by the A-DDW device experienced a considerable improvement in their lateral control even though their speed and speed deviation values were higher. The reaction times of distracted drivers interacting with the A-DDW device deteriorated as revealed in cognitive tests conducted before and after the driving task.",1369-8478,Not found
Which factors are most relevant to drivers’ overtaking choices at two-lane highways: A comparative analysis between questionnaire surveys and driving simulation,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.019,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Overtaking at two-lane highways is a common but risky driving behavior, and various factors may influence drivers' overtaking choices. In this study, we adopted both the questionnaire survey approach and the driving simulation experiment approach to analyze the relative importance of four relevant factors, i.e., the speed of impeding vehicle (IMV), thetypeofimpedingvehicle (IMT), thespeedofopposite vehicle (OPV) and thedistancetooppositevehicle (OPD), and to compare the results of people's subjective judgments and actual operations as well. Based on the data from 313 valid questionnaires (191 males and 122 females) rating these four factors, the importance level of each factor was first ranked by their mean scores. In the simulated driving experiment, a total number of 47 young drivers (28 males and 19 females) completed 356 overtaking scenarios, and the random forest algorithm was used to assess the degree of influence of each factor on drivers' overtaking choices. Afterwards, a post-experiment questionnaire survey regarding the subjective opinion of these four factors was conducted by these 47 drivers, and the Apriori algorithm was used to derive the overall importance ranking of these factors. The results from both the questionnaire surveys and the simulated driving experiments concluded that OPD is relatively the most important influencing factor in drivers’ overtaking choices among the set of four factors considered in this study, which provides road safety analysts with valuable guidance on how to reduce overtaking risk at two-lane highways. However, the main difference appears with respect to IMT, which ranks at the bottom in both questionnaire surveys, but is the second most important factor from the driving simulation, which implies that people's subjective judgments may not completely match their actual operations.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of Dual-Task modality on midfrontal theta power and driving performance across the adult lifespan,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.007,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Driving is a complex activity, entailing concurrent preparation and execution of motor behavior, and processing of cognitive information. Dual-tasking often leads to performance decrements, especially when the subtasks require similar neural resources, e.g., controlling the steering wheel, handling the pedals and shifting gears. With higher age, the ability to simultaneously perform different tasks deteriorates, as more mental resources are required for accurate coordination of movements. Therefore, using electroencephalography, we measured the neural correlates of dual-task driving in 81 healthy younger (n = 27), middle-aged (n = 25) and older adults (n = 29). A visuocognitive and a visuomotor dual-task were combined with a simulated lane-keeping task, with the latter dual-task requiring more similar resources. As expected, steering precision decreased to a higher extent when combined with a visuomotor dual-task in all participants, compared to no deterioration in the visuocognitive dual-task. Yet, this visuomotor dual-task performance decrease was more prominent with increasing age. Remarkably, although midfrontal theta power increased in all groups when a visuomotor dual-task was added, indicating the recruitment of additional mental resources, this increase was less prominent for middle-aged and older adults. This could signify a plateau effect of theta power in which a saturation of mental resources is reached, leading to an increased dual-task cost. Therefore, reducing driver task demands by limiting the need for motor control processing, e.g., by switching to automatic gear shifting, could be beneficial for driving safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of driving distractions on driver mental workload in work zone's warning area,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.018,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Traffic accidents are common in advanced warning areas of a maintenance work zone. One of the reasons for the accident is that the complex driving environment of the warning area makes drivers need to change lanes and speed frequently. Another reason is that driving distractions shift the driver's mental workload and make the drivers unable to complete the driving task well. The paper aimed to examine the impact of visual and cognitive distractions on the driver’s mental workload, eye movements, and driving behaviour when driving in advanced warning areas of the maintenance work zones. Thirty-two participants (mean age = 23.97 years) participated in the experiment and completed 3 advanced warning area simulation scenes. The road initial speed limit of simulation scenes was different: 60 km/h, 80 km/h and 100 km/h. The drivers needed to pass three scenes under three types of distraction tasks (no task, visual task and cognitive task). Six indices were used to evaluate the effect of the advanced warning area and the distracting secondary tasks on the driver's mental workload: two related to eye movements, two related to driver behavior, and two related to the electroencephalogram. The TOPSIS analysis was used to solve the problem of multi-evaluation indices comparison, sorting and selection. The results show that the driver has higher vehicle control ability under the distraction-free task condition than in other scenes. Furthermore, the impact of visual distraction on drivers is more significant than that of cognitive distraction, suggesting more visual attention is required for drivers when passing the complex working zone.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of alcohol and automation on drivers’ visual behavior during test track driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.008,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Background Driving under the influence of alcohol severely increases crash risk. Impairment detection during driving is therefore key to improve traffic safety. However, future detection systems need to capture impairment for more reasons than alcohol intoxication and must also function in all driving modes (manual, assisted, autonomous). Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) are promising candidates for such broader impairment detection. Method A test track study investigated the effects of alcohol intoxication on drivers’ visual behavior both when just driving and when engaged in a non-driving related task. Twenty-six participants performed two drives: 1) sober baseline, 2) with a target blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%. The participants drove in either manual, assisted, or autonomous drive (AD) mode. Results Intoxication influenced glance behavior in all driving modes. It was most evident during visually demanding non-driving related tasks where it resulted in longer single and total off-path glance durations. Additionally, when just driving in manual mode, almost one third of the drivers displayed gaze concentration to the forward roadway when intoxicated. For sober driving, the difference in visual behavior between manual and assisted mode were moderate. In contrast, there was a huge shift towards longer off-path glances, lower percent road center, and lower off-path glance frequency in AD mode. Conclusions Intoxication clearly affects drivers’ on/off road glance behavior. However, it is necessary to account for both driving mode and engagement in non-driving related tasks to reliably distinguish sober from drunk driving. Glance metrics has the potential to serve as a sub-set of indicators for a broader DMS-based detection of impaired driving, which can inform the decisions on when to activate in-vehicle countermeasures.",1369-8478,Not found
"Evaluation of drive-off procedures in dynamic driving simulators: Multisensory cues, interaction and sense of presence",10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.001,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The importance of a realistic driving feeling for the validity of driving simulator studies has been investigated by many researchers. These investigations focus on rather abstract test objectives like driving experience or safety aspects and indicate that a high sense of presence is important to achieve realistic behaviour of the driver. However, it is not clear if this must similarly be true for driving dynamic studies with precise test objectives like acceleration or jerk. In this paper, we investigate the influence of multisensory cues and interaction with the virtual vehicle on the experienced sense of presence and the evaluation of drive-off procedures. In a three-part experimental study with different variations of the virtual reality and the driver’s interaction with the virtual vehicle, the sense of presence is measured and compared in a between-groups design. Furthermore, the evaluations of nine drive-off acceleration profiles are compared. The results show that diverse multisensory cues do not significantly impact the experienced sense of presence regarding the general presence, spatial presence or realism. As expected, interacting with the virtual vehicle leads to higher involvement ratings. The results of the acceleration profiles evaluations indicate that multisensory cueing has a negligible effect on the evaluation of the drive-off behaviour under the tested conditions. The interaction of the driver with the virtual vehicle offers the test subject a better experience in virtual reality.",1369-8478,Not found

The study protocol consisted of two scenarios (a baseline and a decorated interior wall scenario) in which participants performed the baseline scenario to initiate the first testing. The driving behavior data (drivers' attention and mental workload, longitudinal speed regulation, and lateral control stability) and drivers' neural activation data were recorded and analyzed for the whole experimental session. This study used repeated measures generalized linear models (GLM) and Statistical Parameter Mapping (SPM12) platforms for statistical analysis. The results indicate that: 1) a decorated interior wall does affect drivers' attention and mental workload significantly, and drivers' boredom, psychological burden, and crash risk are reduced under the information stimulus. The color and element complexity of decorated interior tunnel walls constitute crucial factors in this information regulation mechanism, strongly related to driver distraction; 2) Under the influence of tunnel interior walls decorated with longitudinal strips, the driver's spatial perception and imagination are significantly improved, reducing anxiety and fear associated with hitting the interior walls. The lateral stability of vehicle operation is improved; however, compared with vertical stripes decoration, the effect of the tunnel interior wall decorated with horizontal stripes on drivers' speed regulation is not great.",1369-8478,Not found

Data was coded inductively, and the analysis revealed reflections on past commuting, rewards from present-day commuting and long-term justifications of commuting decisions. The study shows how issues related to eudaimonic well-being establish the long-term base of commuting behaviour and how past hedonic commute well-being impacts commuting behaviour. Acknowledging the temporal dimension is important, because inducing long-lasting behavioural changes requires an understanding of the past and present hedonic commute well-being experiences that impact commuting behaviour in the future. Eudaimonic well-being affects commuters over a longer timescale and enables them to live contently with their choices in the long term.",1369-8478,Not found
"“Another (hard) day moving in the city”: Development and validation of the MCSS, a multimodal commuting stress scale",10.1016/j.trf.2023.04.005,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Although most of the literature on stress-related factors uniformly points out several negative health, performance, and safety issues as potential outcomes attributable to a prolonged exposition to stressful situations, the applications of these assumptions to the field of urban mobility (and more specifically to commuting) remain considerably scarce. Indeed, while commuters worldwide usually face daily situations such as traffic jams, dearth of transport choices, crowded public transport services, long trips, and road conflicts, there are only a few studies that have methodologically addressed the issue of commuting stress (CS). Aim This paper aims to present in detail the development and validation of the Multimodal Commuting Stress Scale (MCSS), a self-report tool for assessing commuting stress-related factors among urban commuters of different modalities. Methods This cross-sectional study retrieved data from a nationwide sample of 1,429 commuters (aged between 18 and 78; average 34.42 years) from all 17 Spanish regions. Data were analyzed through Structural Equation Model-based competitive Confirmatory Factor Analyses, thus testing the psychometric performance of the scale under different structural assumptions, as well as its reliability, consistency, and validity insights. Results The outcomes of this study suggest that the developed MCSS has a clear four-dimensional structure, an optimal set of factor loadings, fair goodness-of-fit indexes, and satisfactory internal consistency and reliability. Additionally, validity analyses show that commuting stress factors measured through the MCSS have coherent associations with both physical/mental health indexes and trip-related factors, while it also discriminates commuting stress scores by sex, age, and commuting modality. Conclusion All in sum, the findings of this study endorse the suitability of the Multimodal Commuting Stress Scale for measuring stress-related factors affecting urban commuters, as well as to make comparisons among different groups of them.",1369-8478,Not found
Look right! The influence of bicycle crossing design on drivers’ approaching behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.017,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"One of the most frequent crashes between cyclists and motor vehicles is the so-called “turning into” accident, where a motor vehicle turns into the main road and collides with a cyclist riding on the main road and crossing the vehicle’s course. Previous studies mainly examined this type of crash and its causes with accident analyses or observational approaches. This study uses a driving simulator to examine the effect of possible countermeasures like the drivers’ expectancy towards crossing cyclists, the view into the junction, and various bicycle crossing designs. N = 66 participants passed T-junctions that differ in the mentioned measures. Gaze and driving data were collected to assess the criticality of each approach. Results indicate that drivers approach marked bicycle crossings at a lower speed than unmarked crossings. Furthermore, crossings with pronounced designs showed more uncritical approaches. However, an alarming percentage of all approaches were critical because drivers showed no appropriate gaze behavior. This was even increased when the view into the junction was limited. The findings suggest that especially the view at junctions must not be obstructed to provide sufficient fields of view. Pronounced bicycle crossing, however, can enhance drivers’ approaching behavior and might help to reduce the frequency of “turning into” accidents.",1369-8478,Not found
Pedestrians’ perceptions of automated vehicle movements and light-based eHMIs in real world conditions: A test track study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.010,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The development of increasingly automated vehicles (AVs) is likely to lead to new challenges around how they will interact with other road users. In the future, it is envisaged that AVs, manually driven vehicles, and vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians will need to share the road environment and interact with one another. This paper presents a test track study, funded by the H2020 interACT project, investigating pedestrians’ reactions towards an AV’s movement patterns and external Human Machine Interfaces (eHMIs). Twenty participants, standing on the side of a test-track road and facing an approaching AV, were asked to raise their arm to indicate: (1) when they could perceive the AV’s eHMI, which consisted of either a Full Light Band (FLB) or a Partial Light Band (PLB); (2) when they perceived the deceleration of the AV (with eHMI vs. no eHMI); and (3) when they felt safe to cross the road in front of the approaching AV (with eHMI vs. no eHMI). Statistical analyses revealed no effects of the presence of an eHMI on the pedestrians’ crossing decision or deceleration perception, but significant differences were found regarding the visibility of the FLB and PLB designs. The PLB design could be perceived at further distances than the FLB design. Both eHMI solutions were generally well-received, and participants provided high ratings of perceived safety, and confidence around the AV.",1369-8478,Not found

This paper is the result of that suggestion. What follows is not an empirical article that readers are accustomed to finding in TRF. It is a narrative that introduces readers to a few key individuals and moments in time that were critical in the creation of these three components of the traffic psychology discipline. The history in this paper could not be comprehensive, for as I explored the public record and spoke with or received email communications and documents from 12 individuals who were among the founders or knew critical details about their actions, I discovered there is so much more material worthy of exploration than could be addressed in this one manuscript. Alas, I am limited to introducing our historical organization only as a launching point for readers and me to have a foundation to research more. Readers will learn (and for some be reminded) of the discipline’s international organizational roots. We as a community have benefited in significant ways from these founding members.

Translation and adaptation of the family climate for road safety scale to a Spanish speaking population using confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equational modeling,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.011,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The Family Climate for Road Safety Scale (FCRSS) was originally developed and validated in Israel to assess young drivers’ perception of their family values, practices, and priorities regarding safe driving. The scale consists of seven factors representing various aspects of the parent-offspring relationship relating to safe driving: Modeling, Feedback, Communication, Monitoring, Messages, Limits, and Noncommitment to Safety. The present research aimed to adapt and validate a Spanish-language version of the FCRSS in Argentina via two separate studies. Study 1 (n = 1071) examined the FCRSS factor structure and internal consistency and the associations between FCRSS factors and sex, age, and self-reported traffic crashes. Study 2 (n = 487) provide further evidence of the factor structure and internal consistency in a second sample and examined the associations between FCRSS dimensions on the one hand, and measures of attitude towards traffic safety and reckless driving style on the other. The results indicate that a seven-factor model consistent with the original FCRSS provides the best representation of the scale dimensionality in both samples. All factors yielded good internal consistency reliability coefficients, and as predicted significant differences in FCRSS scores were found between women and men. Greater parental monitoring was negatively associated with traffic crash involvement. Finally, theoretically expected associations were found between FCRSS scores and attitude towards risky driving and the risky driving style. On the whole, the two studies present convincing evidence in support of the validity and reliability of the FCRSS in Argentina.",1369-8478,Not found
Validating the satisfaction with travel scale and measuring long-distance recreational travel satisfaction,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.015,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The study of long-distance recreational travel is limited, despite its importance in both travel behavior and tourism literature. To aid the literature, this study validates the existing satisfaction with travel scale (STS)—which has been mostly used and validated for commute and daily travel—and investigates the factors affecting travel satisfaction. The data was collected from a questionnaire survey of visitors to US national parks conducted in the Summer of 2022, and a structural equation modeling framework was used for analyses. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a three-factor structure with two affect-related factors—positive deactivation and positive activation—and a third factor (cognitive evaluation) related to valence and cognitive assessment of travel experience. The proposed measurement scale for long-distance recreational travel satisfaction could be used by tourism studies to investigate the interrelationships between travel satisfaction and tourism satisfaction, which could offer ways to increase the sustainability of tourism destinations. Structural equation model results show that socio-demographics, general travel attributes, trip-specific characteristics, travel-based activities, travel time perception, and attitudes are directly related to travel satisfaction. In addition to these direct effects, socio-demographic and general travel attributes are related to travel satisfaction indirectly through attitudinal characteristics (driving enjoyment and polychronicity). This investigation revealed a few differences in commute and long-distance travel behaviors: mostly the impacts of age, income, and travel duration on travel satisfaction. Based on the study results, it is also speculated that future autonomous vehicles would be a favorable choice for long-distance recreational travelers only if the option of manual driving is possible in those vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Combining survey-based and neuroscience measurements in customer acceptance of self-driving technology,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.016,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"In recent years, the issue of consumer acceptance of self-driving cars has come to the forefront of interest among policymakers, researchers and automotive industry experts. Anchored in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), these studies are typically based on survey data from respondents who have not used self-driving vehicles. The survey, being a perception-based measure has several limitations, such as social desirability bias, inaccuracy due to time pressure, just to name a few. In addition, the change in intention to use self-driving vehicles as a result of actual test use deserves more academic attention. To address this limitation, volunteers were invited to participate in a test drive as passengers in a self-driving vehicle, testing their acceptance of technology using an adapted version of UTAUT2 questionnaire before and after the ride. Neuroscience measurements were also performed: real-time electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking were recorded during the ride. The explanatory power of our regression model was high (97%) using this combined research method. Our preliminary results suggest, that in a real-life test technology acceptance was related more to emotional experience during the ride and less to other elements of the UTAUT2 model – which challenges the results of previous methods based solely on surveys.",1369-8478,Not found
What can bring transit ridership back: An econometric study on the potential of usage incentives and operational policies in the Greater Toronto Area,10.1016/j.trf.2023.03.014,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The COVID-19 virus has unimaginably disrupted the transit system and its overall functions. Users’ vigilant safety concerns posed by the pandemic and the consequent transit avoidance behaviour for a prolonged period could have lasting impacts on their transit preferences, leaving transit agencies to search for effective post-pandemic transit resilience policies. This study examines potential post-pandemic interventions and pandemic-induced psychological attributes impacting the future transit choice behaviour of non-transit users of the pandemic. It utilised data from a transit demand and choice adaptation survey in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. A two-stage model was formulated to jointly capture the pre-pandemic transit usage choices of those who did not make transit trips during the pandemic and the respective post-pandemic transit choices for these user groups. The models depicted that the post-pandemic transit choices were inversely affected by one’s pandemic concerns. In contrast, the choices were positively influenced by respondents’ views on post-pandemic transit usage and keeping the adopted safety policies in place. Regarding the conventional level of service attributes, paid park and ride facilities enhanced the probability of post-pandemic transit choice almost by 15% for occasional users. In comparison, the changes due to reliable service ranged from 10 to 11% for pre-pandemic users. Analogous propensity was seen for fare schemes offering free transfers between cross borders and 25% or more off-peak discounts on base fares. Moreover, more direct transit routes and increased parking costs by vehicular modes post the pandemic encourage travellers to retake transit.",1369-8478,Not found
Risk perceptions of driving under the influence of cannabis: Comparing medical and non-medical cannabis users,10.1016/j.trf.2023.02.007,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Background Reduced perception of potential harm resulting from cannabis use is associated with greater risk of driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC). Understanding risk perceptions of DUIC among subgroups of users will positively inform targeting and content of anti-DUIC driver education and public awareness campaigns. The current study compared DUIC-related risk perceptions among individuals who use cannabis exclusively for non-medical purposes versus those who use cannabis for exclusively medical or for both medical and non-medical purposes (i.e., dual-purpose users). Method Data were drawn from a regionally stratified cross-sectional general population telephone survey of adults (18 + years) in Ontario, Canada conducted in 2017. Respondents who reported past-year use of cannabis and answered questions regarding DUIC risk perceptions were selected (weighted N = 343). Modified Poisson regression models with robust standard error estimation were conducted for three attitudes: disagree that DUIC increases motor vehicle collision risk, agree that DUIC is safer than driving under the influence of alcohol (DUIA), agree that chances of being caught by police for DUIA higher than DUIC. In addition to type of cannabis user (non-medical only versus medical or dual-purpose), covariates included demographic characteristics and past-year alcohol and cannabis use frequency. Results Adjusting for other covariates, regression analyses indicated that medical or dual-purpose cannabis users were 45 % more likely than non-medical users to agree that DUIC is safer than DUIA (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio = 1.45, 95 %CI = 1.10, 1.91, p = 0.007). No other differences in risk perception between medical or dual-purpose and non-medical cannabis users were found. Discussion Although no difference between medical or dual-purpose and non-medical cannabis users was found in perceptions of collision risk associated with DUIC or risk of police enforcement, the perception that DUIC is safer than DUIA was stronger among medical or dual-purpose than non-medical users. Recognizing that the shift in public perception of DUIA as a high-risk behaviour contributed to reductions in incidence of DUIA, results of the current study support education and awareness campaigns that target medical or dual-purpose users and emphasize that, like DUIA, DUIC is also a high-risk behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
"Relating emotions, psychophysiological indicators and context in public transport trips: Case study and a joint framework for data collection and analysis",10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.002,95,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This study proposes an experimental framework for collecting on-board data on users' emotions, psychophysiological indicators, and context, to characterize their experience in a granular, scalable, non-intrusive, and ecological way. To gather emotions data, clustering techniques are used to adapt Russell's circumplex model to a transport framework, allowing data to be collected on-board using a smartphone application. For psychophysiological indicators, a specially designed portable PCB (Biomonitor 2.0) is used to record heart rate, heart rate variation, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity with high frequency and fidelity. Context information is collected using ambient sensors and a smartphone application. A proof-of-concept case study is conducted on 44 engineering students traveling for 2.5 hours on various public transport modes in Santiago, Chile, including an autonomous vehicle. The results show that the framework is feasible, and that emotions data can be effectively related to granular records of psychophysiological indicators and context using a discrete choice model. This study sets a precedent for future research to incorporate new granular public transport user satisfaction indicators based on emotions inferred from psychophysiological data and detect causal factors related to users' physical, emotional, and cognitive state.",1369-8478,Not found
Overtake or not – A computer-based driving simulation experiment on drivers’ decisions during transitions in automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.003,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The increase in automated driving changes the role of the human driver. Under SAE level 3 conditions, the driver has to be able to take back the driving task at any time. However, drivers are allowed to engage in non-driving related tasks during the automated drive, which can result in drivers being out-of-the-loop when they have to take back manual control. This raises the question of whether drivers are able to make safe decisions in such situations. In a computer-based driving simulation experiment, N = 37 participants drove in automated mode on a two-lane rural road and were distracted by a non-driving related task. Because of blocked sensors due to a slower preceding vehicle, the automated system asked the driver if an automated overtaking maneuver should be carried out or not. The selected maneuver was executed by the automated vehicle in automated mode. In a within-subject design with repeated measures, the time budget (with time pressure vs. without time pressure) and the criticality of the situation (TTC low vs. TTC middle vs. TTC high) were manipulated, and the overtaking decision, the reaction time, the certainty about the decision and the perceived criticality were measured. As a result, drivers decided more frequently and faster for the automated overtaking maneuver with time pressure. In addition, in more critical situations, drivers decided less frequently for the automated overtaking maneuver and took more time for the decision. The results provide insights into the decision-making of drivers in automated driving and can be used in the design of take-overs as well as in the development of automated driving systems to enhance traffic safety.",1369-8478,Not found
On the move: The impact of breaking up sitting during the day on driving performance when sleep restricted,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.013,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Objective Sleep restriction and prolonged sitting are both associated with reduced cognitive performance which is detrimental to safe driving. Regular bouts of walking to break up prolonged sitting have been shown to improve cognitive performance. It is unknown if breaking up sitting with walking may improve cognitive performance related to driving, particularly when drivers are sleep restricted. Methods Healthy participants (n = 81, age 23.6 ± 4.5 years, 49% female) participated in a 7-day laboratory study (1 Adaptation day, 5 Experimental days, 1 Recovery day). Participants were randomly allocated to a condition: sitting 9 h sleep (Sit9), breaking up sitting 9 h sleep (Break9), sitting 5 h sleep (Sit5) and breaking up sitting 5 h sleep (Break5). Participants allocated to the Break9 and Break5 conditions completed 3-min of light-intensity walking on a treadmill every 30 min between 09:00–17:00 h, while participants in Sit9 and Sit5 groups remained seated during these times. Each participant completed a 20-min monotonous simulated driving commute at 08:10 h and 17:30 h on each of the 5 Experimental days. Results There was a significant main effect of condition with decreased speed variability for Break9 compared to Sit9, Sit5 and Break5 (p < 0.0001) for both commutes. Break5 had significantly higher lane variability compared to Sit9 and Break9, and Sit5 (p = <0.05) for both commutes. Break5 reported greater subjective sleepiness before each commute compared to Sit9, Break9 and Sit5 (p < 0.001). Cox Proportional Hazards model showed a significant increase in time to first crash for Sit5 and Break5 compared to Sit9 (p= <0.005). There were no significant two- or three-way interaction effects by condition, day or commute time for any of the outcome measures. Conclusion The findings from this study highlight that breaking up sitting with light-intensity walking may improve driving performance in areas such as speed maintenance, but may not extend to lane keeping performance. The findings also show that the benefits of breaking up sitting with light-intensity walking may not be sufficient to overcome detrimental impacts of sleep restriction for all areas of driving performance. Future research should focus on increased intensity of activity as a possible means to extend the benefits more comprehensively across additional areas of driving performance.",1369-8478,Not found
"The impact of crime and crime-related experiences, worries, and perceptions on travel behavior",10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.014,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Although the risk of becoming a victim of crime in a transport setting is higher than in many other settings, research on how crime-related aspects impact travel has mostly focused on certain socioeconomic groups or certain modes, or by linking objective crime rates with mode choice. This limits our understanding of how crime-related aspects may impact decisions on whether, when, and how to travel. This paper aims to explore experiences with crime-related aspects in transport settings and how past experiences, together with perceptions and worry, are associated with self-reported alterations as a result of fear in travel behavior. In the absence of existing datasets, we collected primary data on experiences with crime, fear of crime, perceptions of crime, and travel behavior alterations as a result of fear of crime from 1,000 inhabitants in Great Britain. Our sample was representative in terms of gender, age, and socioeconomic groups, and revealed that experiences with crime in transport settings were common. Furthermore, we found that at least 25% of our respondents had experienced crime in any of the transport modes they used. We used ordinal regression models to test the impact of worry, crime experiences and perceptions on self-reported levels of travel behavior alteration due to fear. A previous experience of crime has impacts on travel behavior to a certain extent. For example, individuals who experienced crime while walking report an increased likelihood of not making a trip at all or altering their travel times. Having higher levels of worry is also significantly associated with an alteration in travel behavior. Women were on average more worried. They were also twice as likely as men to alter their travel behavior. However, stratified analyses by gender did not demonstrate that women were very differently impacted by experiences or worry. These findings provide insights into the extent to which travel behavior is impacted by experiences, perception, and fear of crime, as well as the existence of inequalities in this relationship. Based on our findings, we recommend including questions on social safety in travel surveys to enable additional modeling of these impacts, which may consequently help reduce inequalities.",1369-8478,Not found
Influence of non-driving related tasks on driving performance after takeover transition in conditionally automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.009,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In conditionally automated driving, drivers are required to respond to takeover requests (TORs) and resume manual driving of the vehicle in situations where the conditionally automated driving systems are ineffective. Prior to TORs, the driver may be engaged in Non-Driving Related Tasks (NDRTs), and their manual driving performance after the takeover transition (post-automation) may require time to return to normal. This study investigated the influences of NDRTs on manual driving performance during the post-automation period. Seventeen volunteers participated in this driving simulator study. There were three NDRTs: writing business emails (working condition), watching videos (entertaining condition), and taking a break with eyes closed (resting condition). The duration of engagement in each NDRT before resuming manual driving was either 5 min (short interval) or 30 min (long interval). When TORs were made, drivers were given 10 s (TOR lead time) to switch from an NDRT to manual driving and then continue driving on a straight highway for 5 min. The results demonstrated that driving performance was impaired during the post-automation period. A significant detrimental effect on driving performance was observed for all three NDRT conditions and both task engagement durations. This effect was particularly evident for lane control, where drivers on average spent 4–8 s per minute outside of their lane for each of the five minutes following the TOR. These results indicate that driver engagement in other tasks, even for brief periods, can increase accident risk during the minutes following a TOR. Analysis of individual driving performance revealed a subset of 5 drivers who were strongly impaired, spending 10–25 s per minute outside of their lane throughout the post-automation period. These unsafe drivers could be accurately identified from their driving behaviour during the pre-automation (control) period. Surprisingly, participants were unaware that their degraded driving performance following the takeover. These findings extend the understanding of the disruptive effect of cognitive set-switching while driving and have important implications for the design and safety of autonomous vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Trust in automated parking systems: A mixed methods evaluation,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.018,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In two studies, we evaluated the trust and usefulness of automated compared to manual parking using an experimental paradigm and also by surveying owners of vehicles with automated parking features. In Study 1, we compared participants' ability to manually park a Tesla Model X to their use of the Autopark feature to complete perpendicular and parallel parking maneuvers. We investigated differences in parking success and duration, intervention behavior, self-reported levels of trust in and workload associated with the automation, as well as eye and head movements related to monitoring the automation. We found higher levels of trust in the automated parallel parking maneuvers compared to perpendicular parking. The Tesla’s automated perpendicular parking was found to be less efficient than manually executing this maneuver. Study 2 investigated the frequency with which owners of vehicles with automated parking features used those features and probed why they chose not to use them. Vehicle owners reported low use of any automated parking feature. Owners further reported using their vehicle's autonomous parking features in ways consistent with the empirical findings from Study 1: higher usage rates of autonomous parallel parking. The results from both studies revealed that 1) automated parking is error-prone, 2) drivers nonetheless have calibrated trust in the automated parking system, and 3) the benefits of automated parallel parking surpass those of automated perpendicular parking with the current state of the technology.",1369-8478,Not found

Understanding how humans make trolley decisions provides insights into establishing autonomous driving ethical algorithms. Given that parental care motivation heavily influences moral judgments and decisions, this study aimed to explore the effect of parental care motivation on trolley problem decision-making and its underlying mechanisms. In study 1, parental care motivation was implicitly primed by using pictures of children in a text-based method. The participants had to decide which of the two targets (a child and an adult) to hit. The results showed that the probability of hitting the child target decreased significantly when parental care motivation was activated. In a virtual reality (VR) environment of Study 2, parental care motivation was activated using a 3D child avatar and scripted audio. Participants needed to decide which of the two targets to hit under different time constraints. The results showed that in the fast decision condition, parental care motivation had a stronger effect on the child hit rate, indicating that the effect of parental care motivation relied more on the intuitive emotional system. Therefore, the current study’s findings were discussed within the domain of the dual-process model and fundamental-motives framework.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating predictors of driving immediately after consuming cannabis: A study of medical and recreational cannabis users in Australia,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.015,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This study aimed to explore the length of time cannabis users typically wait between drug consumption and driving a vehicle, and what factors influence such decisions. A total of 839 Australian cannabis users participated in an online survey (26.3% had a prescription for cannabis). Participants ranged in age between 18 years and 75 years (M = 43.3) and 38.2% were female. Driving immediately after consuming cannabis was reported by 41.6% of the sample and waiting 1 h was the next most common response (17%). About one-quarter of participants reported that they waited at least 4 h, thus driving at a time they may no longer be impaired (26.8%). Factors that predicted waiting less time included: a greater frequency of drug consumption (times per day and per month), earlier age of cannabis use onset, using cannabis without a prescription, reporting past-year driving within four hours of consuming cannabis with an illegal drug, and lower perceptions of risk related to driving after consuming cannabis. Participants were asked to report how many days in the next year they would drive within four hours of cannabis consumption, with the most common response being 365 days (37.9% of sample). Given cannabis use is likely to increase through impending decriminalisation and expansion of prescription access, identifying ways to educate cannabis users and extend the length of time they wait between consumption and driving is critical for road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
It matters who is crossing: Users' trust when the automated vehicle stops for children and blind pedestrians,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.012,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In urban environments, automated driving offers the opportunity to improve traffic flow, heighten user comfort and also increase traffic safety for vulnerable road users. To realize these benefits, users need to trust and use automated driving functions when they interact with vulnerable road users such as crossing pedestrians. So far, previous studies have mainly focused on adult pedestrians and their interaction with automated vehicles. However, other pedestrians are even more vulnerable in crossing scenarios such as children or visually impaired people. In addition, some crossing events may be more critical than others depending on the crossing infrastructure or the visibility of the pedestrians. To examine the influence of these situational characteristics on users' perceived criticality of the situation and trust in the automated driving system, we conducted an online experiment. In short videos, the participants (N = 69) experienced automated rides from the users' perspective, where the vehicle stopped to let pedestrians cross. In a within-subjects design, we manipulated whether the crossing pedestrian was an adult, a child or a blind person and how critical the crossing event was (critical vs. non-critical). In the non-critical event, the participants perceived the crossing of a blind pedestrian as more critical than that of a child or an adult. In the critical event, the child was perceived as more critical than the adult. Participants also trusted the automated driving system less under a crossing event with a blind pedestrian compared to with an adult. More research is needed to determine if there are also implications for the use of automated driving systems in such situations and what additional information users might need from the automated driving system. In summary, this study shows the importance of including vulnerable pedestrians such as children and the visually impaired in the research and development of automated driving in cities.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating effects of multimodal explanations using multiple In-vehicle displays for takeover request in conditionally automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.014,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In conditionally automated driving, a human takeover transition is necessary in response to vehicle malfunction or other limitation. To mitigate the negative experience of this technological limitation, researchers have suggested providing an explanation along with the takeover request to increase drivers’ understanding and trust in an automated driving system (ADS). However, previous studies on the explanation have been limited to investigations of unimodal explanations that use either text or speech, while neglecting other various in-vehicle display options. The present study aims to investigate the effects of multimodal explanation using three in-vehicle displays—ambient light, cluster, and sound. The explanation given by each in-vehicle display was systemically manipulated into two levels (ambient light: constant color vs. variable color, cluster: no-text and no-background vs. text with colored background, sound: alert-only sound vs. speech with alert sound). To examine the effects of the explanation using these displays, we conducted mixed method research including a scenario-based experiment, questionnaires, and a follow-up interview for thematic analysis. In the experiment, eighty-two participants drove in a driving simulator and performed takeover tasks in several types of urgent situations for measuring their takeover time and error. The participants then responded to questionnaires on takeover workload and overall trust in automated vehicle. Next, fifty-six of them participated in the follow-up interview for discovering significant themes related to their experiences with the multimodal explanation. As results, we found that multimodal explanations that use two types of displays were more effective than unimodal explanations or multimodal explanations using three types of displays. Regarding the effects of each type of display, the speech-based explanation showed the best takeover performance in general. The explanation using the cluster was next most useful in performance. The ambient light explanation showed less significant to no effect in the takeover situation. We expect that these findings can contribute to theoretical understanding of driver response to multimodal explanations and to practical design of trustworthy explanations in various takeover situations.",1369-8478,Not found
Do drivers need spiritual fitness? The mediating effect of spiritual fitness on the relationship between personality traits and risky driving behaviours,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.016,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Drivers’ risky behaviours continue to be a major cause of traffic fatalities. Cultural changes, including fast-paced lifestyles, considerably contribute to speeding, fatigue, and texting while driving. Investigating the causes of these behaviours and resilience factors that can prevent or reduce negative outcomes is vital. The construct of spiritual fitness— defined as ‘the ability to adhere to beliefs, principles, or values needed to persevere and prevail in accomplishing a mission’—is an interesting proposition developed by the U.S. Army. Intervention programmes related to spiritual fitness are effective for vehicle operators' performance optimisation. Thus, this study introduces this phenomenon into research on civilian drivers. Specifically, the relationships between spiritual fitness, personality traits, and risky driving behaviours were examined. The study group comprised civilian drivers (N = 1037; Mage = 39.48 ± 13.32 years) who completed online self-reported questionnaire. Results showed that spiritual fitness was related to personality traits and risky driving behaviours. Additionally, spiritual fitness was a predictor of risky driving behaviours. Finally, spiritual fitness mediated the relationship between personality traits (impulsiveness, empathy, and conscientiousness) and risky behaviours. These findings confirm that spiritual fitness is a relevant resilience factor that merits further investigation on how it affects the on-road performance of civilian drivers. Study limitations and other possible research avenues are outlined.",1369-8478,Not found
The complexity of changes in modal choice: A quasi-experimental study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.015,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Background Changes in modal choice is argued to be one way to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Increasing modal choices in favour of more environmentally friendly travel modes requires a better understanding of how these choices are actually made. The first aim of this study is therefore to examine how modal choice is related to subjective experiences as perceived accessibility, perceived satisfaction, and habit, both before and after an intervention promoting public transport. The second aim is to examine how modal choice is affected by the intervention. Finally, the third aim is to examine how subjective experiences as perceived accessibility, perceived satisfaction, and habit are affected by the intervention. Method The design used is a before- and after-study with free public travel passes as the intervention (30- or 14-days free travel pass). Altogether, 52 travelers – distributed on two intervention groups and one control group – participated in the study. The 30-days free travel pass group constitutes 18 participants, the 14-days free travel pass group constitutes 19 participants while the control group constitutes 15 participants. During the before-period the participants were asked to register their modal choice using a digitalized application downloaded on their smart phones (the TravelVu app), to complete a short app-based questionnaire, and a web-based questionnaire. During the after-period, they were once again asked to register their modal choice and to complete a web-based questionnaire. All data collected were analyzed by variance or correlation analyses using the change between before- and after period as the dependent variable. Results The results show that walking was more common than the use of public transport and car, which in turn were more common than the use of bicycle. Perceived accessibility, perceived satisfaction, general health, life quality as well as habit were all rated fairly high. Over time, the use of public transport increased while the use of car decreased overall. With increased use of public transport, the perceived accessibility decreased, but on the other hand, the life quality increased. There was no difference in perceived accessibility, perceived satisfaction, or habit between the three groups, but the participants became overall more satisfied with the standard of their experiences of their everyday travel (cognitive evaluation). At the same time, they became less reflective of their choice of travel mode and less interested in trying out new alternative travel modes during the after- compared to the before period. Conclusion The intervention did not affect the modal choice or the subjective experiences. Over time, the participants did however increase their use of public transport and their cognitive evaluation of their everyday travel overall, while they decreased their use of car and became less reflective and less interested in trying out new alternative travel modes. These changes might be attributed to their participation in the present study.",1369-8478,Not found
A transactional model of stress and coping applied to cyclist subjective experiences,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.013,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Research indicates that subjective experiences such as happiness, joy, anxiety, and fear influence peoples’ decisions to bike ride. Negative user experiences in particular are a key barrier to increased bike riding participation. However, existing research has not considered the theoretical mechanisms that give rise to subjective experiences while bike riding. To achieve a more nuanced understanding necessary to enable subjective experiences to contribute to policy and planning, there is a need to both establish theoretically-informed definitions of what subjective experiences consist of, and common approaches to describing how they arise and can be measured. This conceptual paper addresses a translation gap between theory and existing research by applying the transactional model of stress and coping and the circumplex model of affect to demonstrate potential causal mechanisms and measurement approaches of bicycling-related subjective experiences. The transactional model of stress and coping proposes that individuals continuously appraise the demands of their environment relative to their coping abilities, stating that stress and negative emotions occur when an environment exceeds perceived coping abilities. The circumplex model of affect proposes that emotions exist on dimensions of valence and arousal, measuring the unpleasant-pleasantness and degree of activation of an emotion from low to high, respectively. By proposing theoretically-informed definitions and theoretical approaches, this paper establishes a framework that unifies existing research and enables a more nuanced understanding of individual differences in subjective experiences that can contribute to bicycling uptake.",1369-8478,Not found
The effects of depressed mood and 0.05 % blood alcohol concentration on risky driving in males,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.006,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Males are more likely than females to use alcohol as a maladaptive coping mechanism to alleviate symptoms of depressed mood. The effects of a combination of subclinical depressed mood and doses of alcohol below the per se legal threshold of 0.08 % blood alcohol concentration (BAC) on risky driving are unclear, however. This manuscript presents a quasi-experimental, between-subjects study testing the influence of combined subclinical depressed mood and 0.05 % BAC on risky driving in a simulator and the mediation of decision-making. Following assessment of depressed mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II), a double-blinded protocol was used to randomise participants and administer either an alcohol (0.05 % BAC) or a placebo (0.00 % BAC) beverage. The Iowa Gambling Task tested decision-making and participants indicated whether they would decide to drive in the simulator. Driving simulation measured risky driving in real-time. Participants were healthy male drivers (n = 57; age M = 38.2, SD = 7.5). Using ANOVA, there were non-significant group differences in risky driving. Logistic regression revealed non-significant effects between groups in predicting the decision to drive. Mediation regression was used to explore the underlying mechanisms of decision-making on the prediction of risky driving under depressed mood. However, decision-making under risk was only identified as a significant predictor of mean merge acceleration on the highway. In addition to the limited sample size, outcomes were likely impacted by the mediation of emotion regulation. As this research area remains promising, recommendations are highlighted. One of them includes the use of a measure of depressed mood that is more sensitive to externalising behavioural symptoms in males.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating changes in travel behavior over time in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.001,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected travel behavior, including the frequency and mode of travel, with the magnitude and nature of these effects varying over time. This study investigates the nature of these relationships by examining changes in various measures of travel behavior, including weekly driving hours, as well as the frequency of telecommuting, use of ride-sharing services, travel for medical purposes, and use of food delivery services. Self-reported travel data from a representative statewide survey of Michigan residents were used to assess changes in these metrics during the early stages of the pandemic, as well as one year thereafter. Random effects linear regression and ordered logit regression models were estimated and the findings show that various changes in behavior had long-lasting effects, while other behaviors generally reverted back toward pre-pandemic levels. In addition, these changes were found to vary across individuals. For example, significant differences were observed based on socio-demographic characteristics, between urban and rural areas, and amongst individuals with differing views on COVID-19 and related government interventions. In general, the pandemic tended to have less pronounced and sustained effects among younger adults as compared to older age groups. Further, those individuals who were opposed to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines were less likely to change their travel behavior, during both the early and latter stages of the pandemic. Changes were observed consistently across most of the travel metrics of interest. Among these, overall driving hours, travel for medical purposes, and ride-sharing were still lower during the latter stages of the pandemic, while telecommuting and the use of food delivery services reverted nearer to pre-pandemic levels.",1369-8478,Not found
Classification of motorized two-wheeler riders’ acceleration and deceleration behavior through short-term naturalistic riding study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.008,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Riding behavior is characterized by speed choices and evasive actions performed by riders while riding under normal conditions through naturalistic riding studies (NRS). Riders accelerate to attain free speeds and respond to traffic conflicts through various evasive actions. As safety of a motorized two-wheeler (MTW) rider predominantly depends upon his/her acceleration and deceleration behavior, we aim to classify acceleration and deceleration events obtained through a short-term NRS, and identify participants’ riding behaviors. The NRS included 58 riders and captured their kinematic profiles and surrounding traffic conditions through an instrumented MTW. Riders consisted of students and working-professionals with varying ages. Riders drove a 32 km round trip, and acceleration and deceleration events were extracted from riding profiles. The k-means clustering technique revealed three acceleration and three deceleration clusters. Acceleration clusters A1, A2, A3 were high-speed moderate-acceleration, moderate-speed low-acceleration and low speed high-acceleration clusters, respectively. Deceleration clusters D1, D2, D3 were low-speed high-deceleration, high-speed moderate-deceleration and moderate-speed low-deceleration clusters, respectively. This study revealed the most frequent riding behaviors (acceleration cluster A2 and deceleration cluster D3) which form MTW riders’ base-line riding behaviors. Principal component analysis revealed unique riding behavior of each acceleration and deceleration cluster. Study results also revealed significant differences between cluster contributions of student-riders and working-professionals, indicating that age and experience of riders also affect the number of acceleration/deceleration events.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of cybersecurity knowledge and situation awareness during cyberattacks on autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.010,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Autonomous vehicles offer many potential benefits; however, this expansion of cyber-physical systems also introduces a new potential vulnerability through cybersecurity threats. It is therefore important to understand the role vehicle occupants can play in preventing and responding to cyberattacks. The objective of this study is to (1) evaluate drivers’ responses to unexpected cyberattacks, and (2) evaluate how cybersecurity knowledge affects situation awareness (SA) during cyberattacks on automated driving. A driving simulator study with 20 participants was conducted to measure drivers’ performance during unexpected cyberattacks on a SAE Level 2 partially-autonomous vehicle and the infrastructure in the driving environment. Each participant experienced four driving scenarios, each scenario with a different cyberattack. Two cyberattacks were directly on the vehicle and two were on the infrastructure. Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was used to measure participants’ situation awareness during the drives and at the time of the cyberattacks. Participant takeover responses to the cyberattacks were collected through the driving simulator. Participants also completed a cybersecurity knowledge survey at the end of the experiment to assess their previous overall cyber awareness and experience with autonomous vehicles. Most of the participants recognized the cyberattacks, however only about half of the participants chose to takeover control of the vehicle during the attacks, and in one attack no one overtook the automation. Results from ANOVAs showed significantly higher SA for participants with greater familiarity with cybersecurity terms and vehicle-to-everything technology. In addition, SA scores were significantly higher for participants who believed security systems (i.e., firewall, encryption) are important and for those who felt protected against cybercrimes. The present results suggest that increased cybersecurity knowledge can cause a high level of situation awareness during automated driving, which can help drivers to control unexpected driving situations due to cybersecurity attacks.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the effects of left-turn distracted drivers on signalized intersections’ traffic operations,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.009,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Distracted driving represents a serious obstacle to maintaining an efficient transportation system. The safety impacts of distracted driving had been thoroughly explored. However, the traffic operations impact has received less attention. Few studies addressed distracted driving behaviors in through lanes, but less focus has been provided on the left turners. The goal of this study is to fill this gap in the research and address the impact of distracted driving for left turners on traffic operations at signalized intersections. Field data were collected from six (6) intersections, with thousands of observations analyzed in Orange County, Florida, studying different land use, lane configurations, and peak periods. The results demonstrated that 87% of all drivers were distracted. 28% were distracted by cell phone usage and showed significant effect only during the AM peak. During the PM peak, talking to passengers and dashboard categories were significant. In all peak periods, the category of “not identified” distractions was dominant (48%), indicating drivers not paying attention and staring through the windshield. Drivers in the first row in the queue experienced more distractions in the PM peak than in the AM peak. Motorists in residential & school land use had lower headway than those in mixed land use. This can be attributed to motorists' cautious driving behavior due to the existence of school zones and pedestrian crossings. In contrast, motorists in mixed land use tend to be more distracted by the commercial and tourist areas. The statistical models demonstrated that the overall effect of distracted drivers in the left lanes on the discharge headway at signalized intersections is significant. The TOD analysis showed that the distractions increased the headway by 40%, 37%, and 43% during the AM, MD and PM peak hours, respectively. Conversely, the overall distractions model results showed that the base headway increased by 40% resulting in reducing the intersection’s capacity by 30%.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of LED road stud color on driver behavior and perception along horizontal curves at nighttime,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.007,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Scotopic lighting conditions (reduced level of natural light or presence of artificial lighting) may impair driving performance and, therefore, impact on road safety. Thanks to technological developments, low-cost light emitting diode (LED) studs are now being considered as an alternative and affordable pavement marking solution to assist drivers in these conditions. By helping them to maintain their vehicle within the marked lane, the studs should prevent any deterioration in driver performance when negotiating curves at nighttime. However, the few studies that investigated the impact of LED studs on driving performance produced inconsistent results, and the question of whether they actively improve driver performance remains open. Furthermore, while international road regulations allow the use of LED studs, they do not provide consistent prescriptions for their lighting color. Here, we assessed the influence of different LED lighting colors (red, white, and unlit) on longitudinal and transversal driver behavior when negotiating road curves with different radii and sense of direction. In the study, thirty-six drivers drove a dynamic virtual scenario featuring twenty-four curves. After the driving simulation, participants completed a static perception test in which they assessed each curve in terms of the perceived levels of risk, pleasantness, and arousal they experienced while driving on it. In comparison with the unlit and red lit curves, those marked with white lighting LED studs were perceived as less risky, less arousing, and more pleasant independently of the radii and curve direction. Furthermore, when entering these curves, participants tended to shift their driving trajectories towards the center of the road. This effect was most evident on the central part of the curve. Further studies are expected to corroborate these results by focusing on different road geometries and LED stud layouts, as well as testing driving behavior in controlled road field studies.",1369-8478,Not found
Are new mums driving tired?,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.005,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"During the first year of their child’s life, mothers typically experience disrupted sleep and high levels of daytime fatigue. Other populations who experience sleep disruption and/or fatigue are considered to be at risk for fatigued driving. However, the degree of fatigue-related risk experienced by new mothers in Australia is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigued driving, fatigue-related near misses, and vehicle crashes in this population. A cross-sectional survey including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a range of fatigue and driving questions was completed by 187 Australian new mothers. Over 50% of participants who regularly drove did so while fatigued at least a few times per month. Furthermore, most participants who reported near misses indicated that either some or more than some of these incidents were attributable to fatigue (>70%). Similarly, >55% of participants who reported experiencing a motor vehicle crash since the birth of their child indicated that this crash was caused by fatigue. These findings suggest that new mothers may be considered an at-risk group for fatigued driving. To address this issue, it may be appropriate to provide education around driver safety, and to establish strategies to help minimise fatigue-related driving risk in this population. Furthermore, future research should include objectively measured sleep to establish the link more accurately between prior sleep and driver safety in new mothers in Australia.",1369-8478,Not found
Cortical dynamics of automated driving across the spectrum of cognitive aging: A proof-of-concept study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.004,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Background Automated vehicle (AV) technology may potentially improve road safety, independence, and mobility in older drivers with cognitive impairment (CI). Physiological sensors will be useful to provide feedback of the driver state to the AV controller system. The aim of this study was to compare changes in cortical activity recorded using electro-encephalography (EEG) during conditional automation between older adults with normal cognition (NC) and CI. Methods Fourteen older adults (age 72.43 (6.00); 10 (71%) women; nine with NC and five with CI) completed two driving simulator scenarios. Scenario 1 included conditional automated driving with an emergency take-over request (TOR) at the end of the drive. Scenario 2 was identical but with an additional non-driving related task (NDRT). EEG was recorded in three driver tasks: resting; automation; and TOR. The interaction effect of driver task (resting state – automated driving – TOR) and cognitive status (CI – NC) on frontal theta power was calculated using linear mixed models. Results A significant interaction effect of driver task*cognitive status on frontal theta power was found in the scenario without NDRT (F = 5.85; p = 0.001). Post-hoc effects showed that older adults with CI showed greater changes in frontal theta power from resting state to the TOR event (β = 16.44 ± 6.35; p = 0.01) and from automated driving to the TOR event (β = 17.91 ± 6.11; p = 0.006) compared to controls. No interaction effects were found on frontal theta power in the scenario with NDRT. Conclusions Our study provides proof-of-concept that older adults with CI show increased cortical activity while engaging with AV technology compared to neurotypical older adults.",1369-8478,Not found
The short-term effectiveness of online group hazard perception training in experienced drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2023.05.017,96,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This study aimed to test short-term effectiveness of hazard perception training in a group of experienced drivers and to evaluate the role of traffic safety attitudes, risky driving intentions, and driving self-efficacy on training effectiveness. Seventy experienced drivers volunteered to participate in the study: 38 attended online hazard perception testing and training sessions and 32 participated only in hazard perception testing sessions. A newly developed online group intervention of two sessions (based on the framework of hazard avoidance and delivered by a driving instructor) for hazard perception training was delivered to the experimental group. The control group received no training. Lithuanian hazard prediction test (LHP12) was used to measure the level of hazard perception at pre-test and post-test assessments. Additionally, self-reported questionnaires on traffic safety attitudes, risky driving intentions, driving self-efficacy, and socio-demographics were used in pre-test assessment. Training helped to increase hazard perception skills of experienced drivers. Experienced drivers who participated in training scored higher in post-testing compared to those who received no training. Higher driving self-efficacy was related to greater improvement of hazard perception skills after training. Traffic safety attitudes and risky driving intentions were not related to the outcomes of hazard perception training. The newly developed online program for hazard perception skills training was found to be effective in experienced drivers. Future studies should be based on the analysis of hazard perception training effectiveness in a larger sample of experienced drivers, as well as on the investigation of long-term hazard perception training effects.",1369-8478,Not found

Crosswalk design will be tested with regards to two factors: light and shadow (light-facing vs. shaded) and color (monochrome vs. two-color), for the purpose of creating 3D crosswalk samples. Through a driving environment that simulates the outdoor color temperature, a visual psychological experiment was conducted on 30 subjects to test their visual attention and inclination to brake. The results of multivariate analysis of variance show that within the same color temperature, subjects with driving experience had a significant reaction to the 3D crosswalk, with this response being stronger among females when analyzed in terms of gender. Among the test samples used in the study, the best result was obtained from the combination of yellow light-facing and red-shaded sides for the 3D crosswalk as in addition to increasing drivers’ attention, it can reduce the incorrect identification of the lane deviation system caused by the color white.",1369-8478,Not found
The influence of workday experience on smartphones uses in commuting from work to home,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.016,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Employees spend on average one third of their day at work, with the majority of them commuting to work on a daily basis. However, empirical evidence on how work-related attitudes (e.g., work engagement), as well as after work state (e.g., recovery from work) result in risky behaviors while commuting (e.g., smartphone use) and how they connect with road transport safety is still scarce. In this study, we hypothesized that daily work experience, i.e., recovery, work engagement, and exhaustion, can affect the use of smartphones while commuting from work. Hundred forty-six employees completed a diary twice a day for up to five consecutive workdays (n = 572 situational observations). Multilevel analyses revealed that work engagement mediated the relationships between specific recovery dimensions (e.g., psychological detachment and relaxation) and smartphone use for different purposes, i.e., texting, talking on the phone, and use of social media. High levels of recovery and work engagement lead to more frequent use of smartphones while commuting from work. On days employees felt more exhausted they reported engaging less frequently in risky driving/commuting behaviors. Results provide a starting point for research on the effect of workday experience on road transport safety.

Motorcyclists’ risky riding scripts: Schematic representations of error and violation behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.015,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Cognitive aspects play a crucial role in inciting motorcyclists to perform risky riding behaviors. Unfortunately, research on the contribution of scripts as a cognitive factor that facilitates decision making related to riding behavior is lacking. Through two studies, the current research attempted to investigate the roles of different expected events within a rider’s script that lead to risky riding behaviors, particularly lane-splitting, dangerous overtaking, and wrong-way riding. In Study 1, an interview was conducted with motorcyclists to identify the elements in a rider’s script that relate to lane-splitting behavior, dangerous overtaking, and wrong-way riding, within the contexts of both pro-risk and anti-risk riding situations. Subsequently, in Study 2, a survey was administered to motorcyclists to determine the elements of a script with the strongest bearing on a rider’s decision to perform lane-splitting, dangerous overtaking, and wrong-way riding. Findings from Studies 1 and 2 suggest that in certain riding situations, estimates of distance and width of gap between vehicles are the primary script elements with the greatest weight of importance in lane-splitting and dangerous overtaking. With regard to wrong-way riding, road situation and condition, as well as police presence, were the script elements found to have the greatest weight of importance in the performance of the behavior. Based on these results, the intervention for reducing risky riding behavior should use a different approach based on the nature and conception of each risky riding script.",1369-8478,Not found

The Box Task (BT) quantifies these secondary task demands concerning visual and manual aspects of the driving task. Combined with the tactile Detection Response Task (tDRT), it also measures cognitive demands. The standard method for assessing secondary task demand is the occlusion method. The present study compares the combined BT+tDRT method concerning various secondary task demands with the standardized occlusion method. In a laboratory study, participants completed artificial and realistic IVIS tasks with BT+tDRT or occlusion. Results revealed that BT+tDRT was able to distinguish different demands of visual, manual, and cognitive tasks, while the occlusion method was only able to distinguish different visual-manual IVIS tasks. Based on the results, we conclude that the combination of BT+tDRT captures the effects of IVIS on driving safety more precisely and comprehensively than does the occlusion method.

In the experiment, we tested drivers' hazard perception with four driving styles (dangerous, angry, anxious, and cautious) in different hazard conditions and improved hazard perception through visual alert training. Participants' driving behavior and hazard perception were recorded simultaneously. The results showed that (1) Dangerous drivers have the weakest perception of danger, cautious drivers are the strongest, and anxious and angry drivers are similar.

The influence of driving scenario on driver takeover performance and whether this influence varies the effect of the ToR time and NDR task remained unanswered. This study designed a 2(ToR time) × 2(NDR task) × 4 (driving scenario) factorial measure to investigate the effect of these factors on automated vehicle takeover performance. Forty-two participants drove in a simulated SAE Level 3 vehicle and performed a series of takeover tasks. The results showed that the ToR time, NDR task, driving scenario and ToR time × driving scenario had a significant effect on takeover behavior. In particular, the secondary work state task was correlated with the increased takeover and control time. The complexity of the driving scenario indicated a marginally significant influence on the quality of the takeover. A shorter takeover time and a smaller lateral offset were associated with a lower urgency of the driving scenario.

The three aggressive factors (physical aggressive expression, use of a vehicle and verbal aggressive expression) were positively related, while the adaptive/constructive subscale was negatively related to measures of trait anger and aggressive driving. In addition, younger drivers reported engaging in the aggressive forms of expression more frequently, while older drivers reported more frequently engaging in the adaptive/constructive form of expression. Finally, those who had crashed in the past three years reported more frequently engaging in the three aggressive forms of expression, while those that had not crashed reported more frequently engaging in the adaptive/constructive form of expression.

NASA Task Load Index, driver characteristics (driving style questionnaire and work-load sensitive questionnaire), and eye-tracking metrics were collected. Through the structural equation model, we found that driving style affects driver’s mental work-load and reaction sequence in a visual TOR alert situation, while in auditory TOR alert situation, a driver characteristics have no significance on mental workload and reaction sequence. Strong correlation between mental workload and reaction sequence was only found in the auditory TOR alert situation. These results can be used to develop an adaptive multi-modal interface that take driver characteristics into account.",1369-8478,Not found
The role of group membership in active road user attention across different age groups,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.020,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This study aimed to explore how travelling in different group constellations (alone, with known or with unknown people) affects children's and adults’ visual behaviour in traffic when cycling or walking. Additionally, mobile phone/earphone usage was considered, too. A follow-along study (n = 43) and an observation study (n = 898) were conducted to observe travellers in a natural setting. In the follow-along study, eye-tracking was used to investigate children’s glances behaviour on their way to school and how well they manage to fulfil attentional requirements. The observational study focused on children's and adults' visual behaviour at several intersections. The main result of the study was that group membership appears to have a large influence on individuals' visual sampling strategy. In formal groups reliance on each other was found to be stronger than in informal groups. People with a natural responsibility in the group, such as parents or other adults, take a more active role in visual monitoring. Reliance on others is found to a greater extent among pedestrians than cyclists. Regarding communication devices, the use of earphones did not significantly affect glance behaviour towards relevant areas. In naturalistic situations, group constellation, age and phone/earphone usage are interlinked, which needs to be considered when studying these factors.",1369-8478,Not found
"Evaluating the effectiveness of accessibility features for roadway users with visual impairment: A case study for Nanjing, China",10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.021,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Introduction Roadway users with visual impairment face significant challenges for commuting and other travel. This study aims to quantify the factors that affect the overall effectiveness of accessibility features from the perspective of roadway users with visual impairment. Sample and Methods Participants for this study were mainly either employees of ‘blind massage shops’ or students at the Nanjing School for the Blind. Data for 388 samples (not including 30 respondents selected for the pilot study) were collected through one-to-one interviews conducted in April 2018, among which 336 samples were validated for this study. An ordered logistic model was applied for the analysis. Results The accessibility features targeted for this study, i.e., tactile paving, curb ramps, pedestrian overpasses and underpasses, accessible pedestrian signals, and intelligent voice reminders at bus stops, are positively correlated with the overall effectiveness of travel-related accessibility features for visually impaired individuals. Tactile paving that is occupied by parked vehicles, discontinuous tactile paving, and the absence of alignment cues at intersections are negatively correlated with the overall effectiveness of these accessibility features. Discussion Conclusions from this study can be adopted as guidance for the planning, construction, and maintenance of accessibility features for roadway users with visual impairment. The quality and effectiveness of each accessibility feature individually is positively correlated with their combined overall effectiveness, based on the perceptions from this study’s participants. The top two challenges associated with tactile paving are vehicles parked on tactile paving and discontinuity of the tactile pavement, both of which should be addressed to achieve better accessibility for visually impaired individuals. Alignment cues should be installed at medians and islands to better serve the visually impaired community. Implications for Practitioners Regulations should be strengthened and enforced to prohibit vehicles from parking on tactile paving. Tactile paving also should be checked for breaks in continuity and any discontinuous tactile paving should be repaired promptly. Alignment cues should be installed in urban areas to improve the safety of street crossings for visually impaired pedestrians.",1369-8478,Not found
Technological and social distractions at unsignalized and signalized campus crosswalks: A multi-stage naturalistic observation study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.003,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The use of personal listening devices (PLDs) is most prevalent among the college attending population. PLDs can be quite distracting, especially when its users are performing focused tasks such as street crossings. Such scenarios are commonplace on campuses of rural higher education institutes, where students must cross multiple unsignalized crosswalks to get to their destination. To evaluate the dangers of PLD use and pedestrian behavior while navigating crosswalks, 1274 pedestrians were systematically observed over nine hours at four crosswalks; naturalistic observations were followed by a survey of 135 pedestrians, and two focus groups with a total of eight participants following a unique three-stage protocol. Results show that societal distractions such as crossing in group settings or talking with other members of a group while crossing led to more risky pedestrian behavior, than did technological distractors such as PLDs or cellphone use. There was also a consensus on hand gesture meanings for pedestrian-driver communication despite the presence of relatively diverse population. Findings from this study can serve as guidelines to develop external human machine interfaces (eHMIs) for automated vehicles, and appropriate countermeasures to reduce pedestrian distractions at crosswalks of higher education institutes.",1369-8478,Not found
Safe mobility: Analysis of drivers' behavior at the stop bar of signalized intersections using mixed-effects modeling,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.010,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Transportation safety continues to be a daily challenge as it results in enormous losses to human life and to the economy. This research targets safe mobility at intersections in an urban setting by analyzing drivers' behavior at the stop bar during red-light phases with an unprecedented focus on drivers' psychological and demographic attributes. To do so, three main scenarios are utilized to test drivers' responses using a state-of-the-art driving simulator, which include pedestrians crossing the crosswalk, police enforcement personnel and adjacent driver encroaching on the stop bar promoting the imitation behavior. A survey assessing demographics, including standardized questionnaires for individual psychological traits and driving rituals is used to complement the simulator experience for a total of 178 participants. Real life observations and monitoring at intersections are conducted to confirm drivers' behaviors with respect to stopping at the stop bar in the presence of various triggers. Our results show that younger males with a history of at least one severe accident are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior such as speeding and committing violations. Participants scoring high on the Attitudes Towards Traffic Safety and Driving Behavior Survey scales are safer drivers who show more concern about traffic laws. High scores on mindfulness and agreeableness (Big Five Personality Inventory) are associated with less violations whereas extraversion and neuroticism linked with impulsivity and frustration are associated with higher acceleration rates and overall speed. Taken together, driving scenarios and psychological variables better profile differential safe driving behaviors. Thus, it could be highly effective to include trainings for mindfulness and emotional management in addition to driving risk-awareness to enhance safe driving behavior and focus on improving the existing driving education system by focusing on young drivers' attitudes towards safety as it has shown to impact their actual driving behavior.",1369-8478,Not found

During COVID-19 restrictions, many people opted to travel by private cars for their mandatory trips instead of using public transportation, while many non-essential trips were cancelled. The changes in travel restrictions have influenced road safety outcomes. Utilizing decision tree modelling, the current research seeks to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the severity of road traffic crashes, considering two severity levels: fatal and non-fatal crashes in Iran's Khorasan Razavi province. The analysis considers the time period from May 2019 to October 2021 and includes three main intervals: the pre-COVID-19, strict lockdown period, and post-strict lockdown period. A spatial–temporal analysis of crash data was performed utilizing a data fusion approach with results presented using a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model. The data fusion approach uses a variety of data sources in order to obtain a thorough overview of the phenomenon being studied. In this study, independent descriptive factors, such as geometric design, weather, temporal variables, driver behavior, crash type, and traffic attributes, were included in the analysis. A similar pattern for crash severity was observed during the pre-COVID-19 and post-strict lockdown phases, with the majority of crashes being non-fatal. However, fatal crashes were more prevalent during the strict lockdown period. Among the independent variables associated with fatalities were traffic volume. In this study we identified that higher traffic volumes resulted in a higher crash frequency, however they were also associated with lower speeds, resulting in a decline in the severity of crashes. Other variables included lack of awareness as a driver behavior and cloudiness as a weather condition.",1369-8478,Not found
Star rating of driver's behavior as a tool to prevent risky behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.011,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Driver behavior is a key determinant of road safety. Risky behaviors can be measured and quantified using traditional and modern methods, which enables the assessment of the driver’s behavior. Following lessons from safety science, it is important to analyse and manage risks factors to optimize interventions in the transport context at the territory. The main objective of the paper is to explore the star rating of the driver’s behavior to provide credible road safety monitoring and identification of the factors that most contribute to risky driving behaviors. The Data Envelopment Analysis method for selection of most significant factors is used for star rating of driver’s behavior. The subject of the analysis encompasses 18 factors for 27 police administration units (PAUs) in the Republic of Serbia. The results are analysed regarding the following aspects: 1) star rating of driver’s behavior and 2) defining the stages of the periodic factors monitoring for each PAU analysed. Using a mobile phone while driving, not using child restraints system, alcohol drunk driving during the night and seat belt use at rear seats of passenger vehicles were identified as the most significant factors associated with risky driving behaviors. Monitoring a broader set of factors helps to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a territory’s road safety system. Star rating of driver’s behavior as a tool intended for decision-makers ensures monitoring, management, the exchange of evidence-based and customized best practices and defining earlier goal-oriented actions to manage driver’s behavior and to prevent risky driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Interference causes forgetting relevant information while driving much more strongly than decay,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.013,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Road crashes remain a major public health issue around the world with an unacceptably high number of people getting killed and injured every day. As previous research has indicated, failures in taking other road users into account may be a major cause for a large proportion of these crashes. Recently it was suggested that in some of these cases drivers had looked at the road users at some point of time but had apperently forgotten about them (‘saw but forgot’ error). As research on memory indicates, there are two possible reasons for this forgetting: Information may decay in the working memory when too much time has passed. Additionally, information may be replaced by other information added to memory (interference). To examine the role of these mechanisms in forgetting (recall accuracy), an online 8x8 experimental design was used varying the elapsed time since presenting the information (0 to 14 s in 8 steps; decay hypothesis) and the amount of subsequent information since a situation was perceived (0–7 pieces of information; interference hypothesis). A scenario was used similar to driving on the highway with 89 participants. The results of the 8x8 repeated measures ANOVA show that the participants’ recall accuracy decreased with an increasing amount of subsequent information but was not significantly affected by elapsed time. Accordingly, one would assume that ‘saw but forgot’ errors should occur more frequently with more information present, but not with more time passed. From a perspective of traffic safety, critical situations with a large number of information should be especially targeted for prevention measures.",1369-8478,Not found
How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect driver speed selection and crash risk on rural freeways?,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.008,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted various aspects of day-to-day life in unprecedented ways. This included significant reductions in travel that corresponded with travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the virus. This study evaluated changes in driver speed selection and crash/injury risk over the course of the pandemic on rural freeways in Michigan. Daily speed data and monthly crash data were analyzed from 2015 to 2020 to investigate changes that corresponded to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that during the initial periods of lockdown, mean speeds increased by 2.2–2.4 mph across all sites, while the total crash frequency was lower by 28%–45% compared to pre-pandemic years. Crashes also tended to be significantly more severe during the early stages of the pandemic. Interestingly, these changes were less pronounced on sites with 70-mph speed limits as compared to sites where speed limits were increased to 75 mph in 2017. However, as travel restrictions were lifted, speeds regressed towards long-term averages on the 75-mph sites while the higher speeds were maintained at sites with 70-mph limits. The increase in injury severity appears to be attributable to higher speeds, as well as increases in other high-risk behaviors during the pandemic, such as non-use of seat belts and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Some of these effects are also due to differences in terms of the population of drivers that were on the road during the pandemic. The results provide important insights as to the increases in severe crashes that coincided with the onset of the pandemic.",1369-8478,Not found
Do action video games make safer drivers? The effects of video game experience on simulated driving performance,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.006,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Research suggests, action video games (AVGs) can benefit cognitive performance across multiple domains including attention, visual-spatial awareness, psychomotor control, and executive functioning. Many of these domains overlap with the skills needed to safely drive a vehicle. We therefore predicted that experience playing AVGs may be associated with improved driving performance and greater spare capacity. One-hundred-and-thirty-eight participants who varied in action video game experience, completed a driving simulation under distracted and non-distracted conditions. Driving performance was measured through participants’ ability to maintain a consistent speed and lane position, and their spare cognitive capacity (via detection response task; DRT). Results showed participants with experience playing AVGs performed significantly better than non-gamers, demonstrating lower speed variability, improved lane maintenance, and better performance on the DRT. The effects of distraction were predictably observed, though distraction negated the improvements to DRT response times for AVG players. These findings indicate action video game players had better driving performance and increased spare cognitive capacity compared to individuals who did not play AVGs and highlight a potential avenue for improving driver safety through video game use.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of cognitive load on Detection-Response Task (DRT) performance during day- and night-time driving: A driving simulator study with young and older drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.002,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Over the past 25 years, distracted driving and driver inattention have been one of the main risk factors for road traffic safety. Previous research has shown that increased cognitive load from non-visual activities take our mind off the driving task, by engaging our working memory resources. Studies have shown that engagement in these tasks results in a more concentrated gaze towards the road centre, reducing lateral deviation (e.g., reduced standard deviation of lane position (SDLP) and less high frequency steering reversals). The Detection-Response Task (DRT) is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard used to study the impact of cognitive load, due to secondary task, on performance. This driving simulator study examined the effect of varying levels of cognitive load (using the n-back task) on driving and DRT performance. The effect of age and lighting conditions was examined by comparing the performance of a younger group of drivers (Age Mdn = 22) with that of an older cohort (Age Mdn = 66) during day- and night-time driving conditions. Results showed that young drivers’ DRT performance was better at night-time compared to day-time, when compared to that of older drivers. Young drivers also performed better at the n-back task. Overall, an increase in cognitive load increased response time to the DRT task. In line with previous studies, an increase in cognitive load also reduced SDLP, but only in the absence of the DRT. These results provide new knowledge on drivers’ detection of peripheral stimuli during different lighting conditions, and how these are affected by a cognitively loading, non-visual, working memory task. The implications of these findings on real-world road safety are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Car sickness in real driving conditions: Effect of lateral acceleration and predictability reflected by physiological changes,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.018,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"With the development of autonomous vehicles, car sickness may affect increasing numbers of car occupants. Car manufacturers have a real need to understand the causes of these symptoms, which occur mainly when car occupants are not engaged in a driving task. This study is the first to evaluate, in real driving conditions, the impact of lateral acceleration level and vehicle path predictability on car sickness incidence and severity, and the potential relationship with physiological changes. 24 healthy volunteers participated as front seat passengers in a slalom session inducing lateral movements at very low frequency (0.2 Hz). They were continuously monitored via physiological recordings and provided subjective car sickness ratings (CSR) after each slalom, using a 5-point likert scale. CSR reveal that (i) the greater the lateral acceleration and (ii) the less predictable the vehicle path, the more severe the car sickness symptoms in real driving conditions. An increase in several physiological parameters is also found simultaneously with higher CSR, demonstrating activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Moreover, the linear regression applied to our data suggests that these physiological parameters can be used to indicate car sickness severity. Moreover, the linear regression applied to our data suggests that the evolution of these physiological parameters may reflect the CSR level indicated by participants.",1369-8478,Not found
Should an external human-machine interface flash or just show text? A study with a gaze-contingent setup,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.005,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Automated vehicles need to prioritize pedestrian safety. One way to achieve this is through external human–machine interfaces (eHMIs) that send visual signals to pedestrians. eHMIs can be either text-based or light-based. However, there has been limited research on the effects of these types of eHMI on human information processing and attention allocation. This study aimed to fill this gap by using a gaze-contingent approach, which blurs the view outside a circular aperture, to test the hypothesis that text-based eHMIs, which require focused or foveal attention, result in longer response times compared to light-based eHMIs, which can be understood using peripheral vision. In this study, 23 participants watched animated video clips of traffic situations involving automated vehicles with either no eHMI, a flashing-light eHMI, or a text-based eHMI. Their eye movements were tracked, and they were asked to press the spacebar when they felt it was safe to cross the road. The results showed faster response times when an eHMI was present, with no significant difference between the two types of eHMIs. Further analysis suggested that the flashing-light eHMI captured attention briefly, while the text-based eHMI held attention for a longer period. When no eHMI was present, participants focused on the approaching vehicle for the longest time. The gaze-contingent window resulted in fewer eye movements and slower response times. In conclusion, the study showed that the gaze-contingent window negatively affected response times and eye movements, emphasizing the importance of considering peripheral vision when designing eHMIs for pedestrian safety.",1369-8478,Not found
A validation study comparing performance in a low-fidelity train-driving simulator with actual train driving performance,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.007,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Background Although common in other industries, such as the automotive sector, no train-driving validation study has been found in the existing literature. The present paper intends to fill that gap by comparing the results of train-driving performance in a physically low-fidelity but highly functional simulator with real train-driving performance. Method Thirty-four train driver students in the final part of their basic education were assessed in a 45-minute simulator test using the number of driving errors as the performance indicator. The results were compared with the performance at 11 weeks of internship as measured by supervisors grading according to a standard procedure. One of the classes (17 to-be drivers) was affected by restrictions related to COVID-19, which led to a shortened internship and distance learning during parts of the internship. The study also intended to measure the effect of the restrictions and the types of errors the drivers made by comparing the two classes. Results A significant correlation was found between the number of driving errors and internship grades, r = −0.45, p <.05. The results also revealed that COVID-19 restrictions negatively affected performance, as the students from Class B made significantly more driving errors and obtained a lower internship grade than those from Class A. Conclusions This paper shows that this type of low-fidelity simulator is well suited for measuring real train-driving performance. A measurement method that can predict long-term driving should have implications for both research and practical usability. Researchers can use this for studying the effects of, for example, different training methods, while train operation companies can use the method to test their drivers' skills and intervene before an actual accident occurs.",1369-8478,Not found
In their own words: A qualitative study of users’ acceptance of connected vehicle technology after nine months of experience with the technology,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.004,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The Ipswich Connected Vehicle Pilot (ICVP) was the largest on-road trial of connected vehicle technology in Australia. In the ICVP, 355 privately-owned vehicles were outfitted with connected vehicle technology and driven for 9 months with 326 participant vehicles remaining in the study until completion. User acceptance is as a key determinant of the future effectiveness of connected and co-operative Intelligent Transport systems (C-ITS) given it impacts likely uptake of these vehicles and the optimal functioning of such systems is contingent on widespread uptake by the public. This paper presents the findings of two qualitative studies conducted as part of the ICVP, comprising 53 individual interviews and 14 focus groups/interviews with 47 participants. The purpose of the qualitative studies was to understand users’ perceptions of the system as well as their acceptance of C-ITS in general. Overall, participants were generally positive towards the system, could appreciate the safety benefits it offers, and expressed interest in adopting the technology presuming future systems would be refined. Some participants reported that they missed the warnings provided by the system once the technology had been removed. Participants wanted the system to be seamlessly integrated in their vehicle and have features that enabled personalisation. Participants identified that some of the warnings, most notably the advanced red light warning, were presented too late or at inaccurate times indicating that these issues must be remedied to ensure successful future implementation of C-ITS. Participants appreciated that data sharing would optimise the system but wanted controls to be put in place to guard against misuse; participants did not want their data to be used for sales or marketing purposes. Users’ experience and perceptions are key to ensuring wider-spread adoption of C-ITS. The findings thus have important implications for future C-ITS implementation to ensure that the benefits of C-ITS are optimised to facilitate wide-spread penetration of the technology.",1369-8478,Not found
Atypical intersection of a bicycle path and a carriageway with marked car priority: Which car drivers give way anyway?,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.009,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The issue of the safety of vulnerable road users is particularly important at points of collision with other roads and road users. The most common solution at the intersection of a carriageway and a cycle path is a cycle crossing, with specific rules of priority for cyclists and drivers. However, the constantly increasing number of accidents involving cyclists prompts the creation of new and innovative solutions in infrastructure and traffic organisation. One novel solution in this respect takes the form of intersections of cycle paths with carriageways with traffic organisation that always gives priority to drivers, introduced in the city of Rybnik in Poland. The aim of the study is to analyse the behaviour of drivers at the intersection of the cycle path and the carriageway with signage indicating car priority in a situation when simultaneously a driver was coming along the carriageway and a cyclist was preparing to cross and crossed the intersection. The study took the form of a trial in which two cyclists—a man and a woman—negotiated the designated intersection in two directions. Drivers’ decisions to give or not to give priority were analysed in the context of the cyclist’s gender and direction of travel, as well as observable driver characteristics such as gender and residence based on the vehicle registration number. The study confirms that a significant number of drivers give priority to cyclists despite the rules at the intersection under study. However, no significant differences were found between the behaviour of female and male drivers. The study found that only one variable—place of vehicle registration—had a statistically significant relationship with giving priority to cyclists, contrary to the variables defining the gender of drivers and cyclists.",1369-8478,Not found
"Using eHMI, acoustic signal, and pitch motion to communicate the intention of automated vehicles to pedestrians: A Wizard of Oz study",10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.017,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Communication between automated vehicles (AVs) and pedestrians is crucial to coordinate traffic maneuvers and hence maintain road safety. Automated driving changes the driver’s role to that of a mere passenger, who can perform non-driving related tasks and therefore may not interact with other road users. In this novel traffic environment, both explicit and implicit cues might contribute to an effective communication between AVs and pedestrians by providing relevant information. So far, physical prototypes of AV communication have rarely been evaluated under real world conditions. The few studies managed to do so used a Wizard of Oz technique, where a human operator simulates the behavior of an AV. To measure the communication effectiveness, these studies instructed participants to explicitly state their crossing decision, but not to cross. While safety is assured, the generalizability of the results to pedestrians’ actual crossing behavior is unclear. We established a more realistic experimental setup for a Wizard of Oz study that allows pedestrians to actually start crossing while a of simulated AV is approaching. In a Wizard of Oz study, participants (N = 35) interacted with a simulated AV and had to infer its intention. In a fully factorial design, the effects of three different communication cues were explored: an external human-machine interface (eHMI, absent vs. present), an acoustic signal (absent vs. present), and pitch motion (active, normal, or none). The eHMI and acoustic signal were considered as explicit and the pitch motion as implicit cues. Participants were asked to exhibit natural crossing behavior which was captured by two optical tracking systems. Consistently to previous work, explicit AV communication showed a positive effect on pedestrians’ crossing behavior and safety feeling. Pedestrians initiated their crossings earlier and reported to feel safer when approaching an AV with an eHMI or an acoustic signal, compared to only having only a pitch motion. There was no main effect of pitch motion on crossing behavior and safety feeling. Nevertheless, there was an interaction between eHMI and active pitch motion. The effect of eHMI on crossing initiation time (CIT) was smaller in combination with an active pitch motion compared to normal pitch conditions. These results underline the importance of implementing appropriate AV communication.",1369-8478,Not found
A brief gamified immersive intervention to improve 11–14-year-olds’ cycling-related looking behaviour and situation awareness: A school-based pilot study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.019,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Despite the health benefits of active travel, very few people in the UK choose to cycle short journeys; a frequently cited barrier is personal safety concerns. Recent research using immersive video-based training has shown promise, in terms of improving young children’s situation awareness and looking behaviour when cycling, although such evidence is sparse. We designed and delivered a brief gamified immersive intervention to address this. Forty-four schoolchildren took part in a 10-minute intervention comprising 360-degree real-world point-of-view footage of a cycle journey through a busy urban environment, experienced via a head-mounted display (HMD) with built-in eye tracking. The participants were split into two groups: an explicit learning group who received instructions regarding adaptive looking behaviour, and an implicit learning group who received no instructions. In a gamified protocol, participants scored points for fixating on target areas that represented adaptive looking behaviour; reward sounds notified them when they were successful. The explicit learning group accrued points more rapidly in the early stages of the intervention, but the implicit learning group matched the explicit group’s performance level by the end of the brief intervention. All participants’ cycling confidence increased after the brief intervention, and these increases were correlated with their performance in the game, but participants’ performance on video-based situation awareness tests did not improve. Brief gamified immersive interventions could be used to develop young cyclists’ competence, and therefore confidence, regarding cycling on roads, which could, in turn, encourage them to cycle short journeys.",1369-8478,Not found

Education during the first automated drive is a time-efficient approach with the potential to foster engagement in learning content on the automated vehicle. To evaluate this approach, we developed a tutorial concept based on the four-component instructional design model that supports drivers during their first drive with a combined Level 2/Level 3 automated vehicle. In a driving simulator study with 32 participants, we compared the tutorial concept to the presentation of the identical information before the drive. The study consisted of two drives: A learning drive, in which half of the participants were supported by the tutorial concept, whereas the other half served as a comparison group which was instructed prior to the drive. After three weeks, participants completed a test drive without any support. Results indicate that both instructional approaches provided participants with adequate mental models and fostered trust in the automated vehicle. In addition, the tutorial concept enhanced acceptance of the automated vehicle and supported the performance of participants when they encountered a silent system failure. Taken together, instructing drivers during the automated drive is a promising approach for user education in automated driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Detection of driver distraction in the Australian naturalistic driving study videos using pre-trained models and transfer learning,10.1016/j.trf.2023.06.016,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Naturalistic driving data (NDS), collected from fitted vehicles with multiple sensors, including cameras, is a rich source to understand how drivers become distracted. However, detecting the distraction events traditionally required watching NDS videos which is expensive and time-consuming. Adopting state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to automate distraction detection using videos will save effort and money. Reducing/annotating a random sample of the videos and using it to train a machine learning model to carry out the data reduction for the rest of the dataset is possible. This paper investigates the feasibility of using pre-trained deep neural networks and random forest to detect driver distraction in the Australian Naturalistic Driving Study (ANDS) video data. The pre-trained model was fine-tuned using transfer learning; therefore, it can be used to classify (i.e. distracted/non-distracted) successive frames independently. To capture the time dependency between the consecutive images/frame during the training phase, we converted the 1-D output probability of the fine-tuned model into a higher dimension space. The distraction probability of each frame at a time is transformed into a vector by concatenating the distraction output probabilities of all frames within a time window centred at time. Moreover, the vector centred at the time was assigned the actual label of the frame at this time. Then we used Random Forest (RF) classifier to model the non-linear relationship between the probabilities in this new space and the distracted/non-distracted labels. This proposed framework was trained using some ANDS trips and tested using another set of trips. When applied to the dashboard camera, the proposed framework achieved 0.609, 0.218 and 0.325 for the true positive rate (TPR), the false positive rate (FPR), and the precision, respectively. Moreover, the face camera achieved 0.748, 0.344 and 0.651 for TPR, the FPR and the precision, respectively. These promising results suggest the proposed framework can be used routinely in many other data reduction tasks.",1369-8478,Not found
A comparative analysis of voluntary in-vehicle distractions of drivers' visual attention,10.1016/j.trf.2023.07.001,97,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Distractions to the driving process, whether inside or outside of the vehicle, are becoming an increasing problem, especially distractions that are voluntary in nature which are avoidable but seem to be prevalent on our streets. A research gap was identified in the lack of comparability of in-vehicle distraction influences on drivers' visual attention. The paper presents research on the effects of in-vehicle distractions on drivers' visual attention, which was performed with 23 participants in a real environment (test track) during normal traffic conditions. The drivers were subjected to 15 in-vehicle distractions, including mobile phone use (handheld and hands-free), finding items inside the vehicle, and controlling and managing various in-vehicle systems. All distractions caused a significant reduction in visual attention to driving-related areas, including tasks such as setting the climate control or radio frequency, which are generally not perceived as disruptions. In fact, setting the climate control, navigational system, and radio frequency diverted visual attention for more than 40 % of the whole task duration. All tasks caused a reduction in the variability of gaze direction onto the windshield, indicating an occurrence of vision tunnelling, which was again very prominent even with tasks that are usually not perceived as very distracting, such as adjusting the side mirrors. The results, therefore, show that in-vehicle tasks that are voluntary in nature may significantly affect drivers' visual attention, and this is not limited to mobile phone and entertainment system use.",1369-8478,Not found
"Investigating the relationship between self-reported (near) crashes, fined traffic offences, and risky riding behaviours among Flemish motorcyclists using the motorcycle rider behaviour questionnaire",10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.002,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Little research on motorcycling safety and rider behaviour has been performed in Belgium. This study used the Motorcycle Rider Behaviour Questionnaire (MRBQ) as part of a larger questionnaire on motorcyclist safety. Data was collected in Flanders (i.e., the Dutch speaking part of Belgium) through 560 motorcycle riders by means of a questionnaire that consisted out of the MRBQ, demographics, personal background, riding experience and exposure, vehicle information, and self-reported (near) crashes and fined offences. Results showed a factor structure consistent with previous studies, comprising the factors ‘traffic errors’, ‘speed violations’, ‘stunts’, ‘protective gear’, and ‘control errors’. Due to the limited number of crashes, only an effect on near-crashes and violations was observed for some of the MRBQ factors, as well as for the age and exposure of riders. This research indicated that the MRBQ has its merits in terms of both construct and predictive validity. Nonetheless, the MRBQ was found to be subject to limitations. The need for more research was raised to examine the potential presence and impact of a social desirability bias and common method variance. Additionally, Implications for practitioners and policy makers have been discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Regular looks out the window do not maintain situation awareness in highly automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.015,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The loss of situation awareness (SA) caused by the out-of-the-loop phenomenon is a major problem for successful take-overs after highly automated driving. Despite recent advances in driving automation, a human backup for the automated system is currently indispensable. For uneventful situations, the automation works and drivers can perform engaging non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). However, they need to be ready to respond at all times in case of a take-over request (TOR). For smooth and safe transition from automated to manual control, SA has to be re-established within seconds. We investigated whether regular out-the-window looks can facilitate this process. This driving simulation study is the first to investigate whether such situation awareness maintenance can improve take-over performance after a TOR. In a repeated-measures design, 89 participants experienced 5-minutes of highly automated driving with a NDRT followed by a critical take-over situation. Every 30 s, participants were asked either to monitor the traffic scene for 3 s (monitoring condition) or to merely interrupt the NDRT for 3 s (control condition). We ensured that incidental traffic monitoring was impossible during the NDRT. In the control condition, participants saw a blank screen during the 3-seconds intervals. Contrary to common intuition, the results show neither improvements in objective take-over performance nor in perceived SA, driver availability, criticality, stress, risk assessment, or adequacy of the TOR. We conclude that brief interruptions of the NDRT to look at the ongoing traffic are unable to maintain the driver's SA during highly automated driving. Future studies should therefore focus on other measures to optimize the recovery of SA.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating interventions for phone distracted pedestrians in a virtual reality environment,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.012,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Pedestrian safety is a significant concern for transportation professionals, especially the risky behaviour of pedestrians using mobile phones, such as entering a road crossing illegally or entering the crossing with a delay. While several investigations have highlighted the significance of mobile phone distraction while walking and interventions developed to mitigate this risk, the effectiveness of such interventions remains unaddressed. This research, therefore, investigated the effects of two distraction warning strategies, in-ground flashing lights and phone app, in a simulator-based virtual reality environment (N = 26). The study was conducted with a repeated measure design where participants participated in three scenarios (two with interventions and one without) while conducting a visually distractive task on a mobile phone. Twelve road intersections in the Brisbane CBD (Australia) were replicated and equipped with in-ground flashing lights or a phone app where the mobile phone screen edge colour changes based on traffic light signalling. A control condition of no intervention was also used. Each intervention was assessed to be beneficial based on reaction time and behaviour. Results showed the reaction time while using in-ground flashing lights as an intervention to be shorter compared to the mobile phone app and the control condition. The impact of in-ground flashing lights is greater in reducing the number of intersections where pedestrians do not comply with traffic signals and undetected green cycles compared to the mobile app. However, in considering traffic lights status checks and gaze toward traffic before crossing, in the mobile phone app condition participants checked traffic lights and road traffic before crossing in more intersections than with in-ground flashing lights. This study has shown that both intervention techniques can be suitable to improve pedestrian awareness at intersections when distracted by a mobile phone. In an environment where reducing the use of mobiles is unlikely, these interventions could be implemented to decrease risky behaviours and should therefore improve pedestrians’ safety. Finally, this research highlighted that in-ground flashing lights could be an effective option to implement in the real-world and inform policymakers of the most effective intervention to implement and contribute to the development of evidence-based policies.",1369-8478,Not found
What to rely on – Implicit communication between pedestrians and turning automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2023.08.004,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Several studies have investigated implicit communication, such as driving dynamics, as a way to communicate vehicle or driver intention to pedestrians, indicating that “good” human driving behavior is sufficient to ensure a subjectively safe crossing, regardless of the vehicle’s automation status. Using a video-based laboratory experiment, the present study investigates the extent to which such findings can be transferred to more complex driving maneuvers, such as turning. The results reveal that even in this case, driving dynamics and distance remain the main determinants of crossing decisions and perceived safety.

Time-series clustering for pattern recognition of speed and heart rate while driving: A magnifying lens on the seconds around harsh events,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.010,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Driving pattern recognition has been applied for the purposes of driving styles identification and harsh driving events detection. However, the evolution of driving behavior around and especially before such events has not been investigated at a microscopic level. The objective of this research is to reveal existing driving patterns around harsh events at the driving ‘pulse’ level i.e. a few seconds before and after the event. For that purpose, a time-series clustering approach is applied on speed and heart rate metrics of individual drivers using data collected from a large naturalistic driving study. Results show that there are distinct speed patterns before harsh braking, harsh acceleration, and harsh cornering events. A deceleration is identified shortly before most harsh acceleration and cornering events, which possibly indicates reckless behavior, i.e. drivers not dedicating enough time to smoothly brake before cornering, or of a brief ‘decision-making’ moment before the harsh manoeuvre. On the contrary, speed seems to be steady before harsh braking events. Regarding heart rate, the analysis revealed certain patterns only after raw data were cleansed and filtered. These patterns may show increasing, decreasing or variable heart rate trends, which may correspond to different stress patterns of drivers around harsh events. Finally, we introduce the concept of driving pattern consistency, which can reveal the share of individual drivers that follow the same harsh event pattern. It is indicated that more than half of the drivers are not consistent, suggesting that driving patterns around harsh events may be more context-related than driver personality-related.",1369-8478,Not found

Difference in perception-reaction time of plain and plateau drivers at expressway exit ramps,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.016,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The low-pressure (and low-oxygen) environment in plateau regions significantly impacts the driver’s perception-reaction time (PRT) and, in turn, road safety. However, drivers faced increased workloads at interchange exit areas while the Tibet region experienced a significant improvement in high-grade highway construction. Therefore, this study aimed to quantitatively analyze the influence of the plateau environment on PRT. Using a UC/win-road simulator, 6 scenarios of expressway exit ramps were constructed. Then, a total of 50 participants (35 males, 15 females) in Nanjing (altitude of 50 m) and 50 participants (36 males, 14 females) in Lhasa (altitude of 3650 m) were recruited for the simulation experiments. The driver’s PRT was measured according to the visual fixation characteristics (using an eye-tracking device) and vehicle running data. The no-difference in PRT for various scenarios was validated using the one-way-ANOVA test. Then, the Spearman bivariate correlation and generalized linear regression model were used to analyze the influence of driver’s age, driving experience, gender, and acclimation period on PRT. In addition, the difference in PRT of different groups of plain and plateau drivers was further analyzed using the Mann-Whiteney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Although driving experience and gender affected the PRT of the plain and plateau drivers, the effect was greater in the plain areas. The low-pressure environment at high altitude had a more significant impact on young novice male drivers. These findings serve as valuable references for refining the design of expressway exit ramps and improving road safety in the plateau areas.",1369-8478,Not found
The self-reported psychosocial and legal factors contributing to drink and drug driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.007,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Drug driving is recognised as a major road safety problem in many countries. In Australia, the primary response to this problem involved the adoption of roadside drug testing (RDT), which was modelled on the policies and practices used to conduct random breath testing (RBT) for alcohol. However, there remain important differences in the way that RDT and RBT are conducted, which might produce differential effects on drug and drink driving behaviour. In addition, various psychosocial factors are known to influence the two behaviours. Thus, there is a need to investigate the relative influence of legal and psychosocial factors on drug driving and explore how they may be similar or different to drink driving. Accordingly, this study utilised Deterrence Theory and Akers' Social Learning Theory, augmented by measures of dependence and a range of psychosocial factors, to examine the factors associated with self-reported drink and drug driving. An online survey was completed by 1394 licensed drivers from the three most populous states in Australia: Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Self-reported drink and drug driving became more likely as level of dependence increased. In relation to legal factors, direct experience of avoiding detection was the strongest predictor of self-reported drink and drug driving. Among the psychosocial factors, a significant positive relationship was found between holding favourable attitudes toward both drink driving and drug driving and self-reported behaviours. The findings suggest that applying legal sanctions in isolation without addressing the psychosocial rewards and punishments for the behaviours is not sufficient to reduce drug or drink driving. Future research should identify countermeasures that integrate deterrence and psychosocial principles in order to reduce these risky driving behaviours.",1369-8478,Not found
Predictive validity of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory in bus drivers’ crash involvement: A follow-up study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.008,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Background The Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI, Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004) is a widely used instrument that assesses private car drivers’ driving styles. However, a key validity check for the MDSI is whether the measurement of driving style is associated with drivers’ crash liability. Methods A one-year follow-up study was conducted, and one thousand bus drivers were randomly recruited from three cities (Hangzhou, Beijing and Bazhong) in China. The participants were asked to complete the Chinese version of the MDSI and a demographic questionnaire, and they needed to report their traffic violation history 12 months after the survey. Violation history data only included traffic violations and crashes that were caused by the study participants rather than other road users. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the factorial structure of the MDSI. The relationships between the MDSI and traffic violation history over the previous 12 months and driving patterns over the 12 months immediately following the survey were investigated. Results CFA results show that the model fitness of the MDSI for bus drivers is acceptable. Both drivers’ traffic violations and crashes over the previous 12 months and driving patterns over the following 12 months were positively correlated with dissociative, risky and angry styles and negatively correlated with a careful style. Cluster analysis results show three clusters, with one unsafe driver group characterized by higher scores on dissociative, anxious, risky and angry styles and lower scores on careful driving styles. The number of drivers with traffic violations or crashes in the unsafe cluster is significantly higher than those in the other two clusters. More importantly, drivers in the unsafe cluster experience more traffic violations and crashes over the following 12 months than the other two driver clusters. Conclusion The findings of the present study not only provide a reliable and valid instrument for assessing bus drivers’ driving styles but also show valid evidence for the predictive validity of the MDSI in measuring bus drivers’ crash involvement.",1369-8478,Not found
Preparing drivers for the future: Evaluating the effects of training on drivers’ performance in an autonomous vehicle landscape,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.013,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The rapid development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has raised concerns about the ability of ordinary drivers to safely interact with these systems without formal training or practice sessions. This study investigates the impact of training on drivers' ability to interact with ADAS functions, aiming to enhance road safety and prepare drivers for future autonomous driving. To do so the study compared novice and experienced drivers' performance across various driving training sessions separated by different time intervals. Using a simulation-based driving scenario, a diverse group of participants with different ages, genders, driving experience, and ADAS usage frequencies was recruited. Participants were instructed to drive a virtual subject vehicle (SV) multiple times with different time intervals and various ADAS functions being activated and/or deactivated. Data on steering wheel input, acceleration, braking, event triggering time, response time, and vehicle lateral position were collected and analysed. Participants' performance, measured in terms of accuracy, reaction time in interacting with ADAS functions, and vehicle control when they are interacting with those functions, was assessed after each training session. Results revealed significant improvements in accuracy, reaction time, and vehicle control for both novice and experienced drivers' performance following training. The results highlight the importance of appropriate training for drivers to safely operate ADAS and autonomous functions, providing valuable insights for policymakers, vehicle manufacturers, and driver education institutions. Furthermore, the findings emphasise the need for further investigations on the effectiveness of various training modalities and the potential benefits of integrating real-time feedback systems or Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted coaching. This study has important ramifications for the future design and implementation of driver training programs, as well as the development of policies and regulations to promote the safe use of ADAS and AV technology in the future.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of a frontal brake light on (automated) vehicles on children's willingness to cross the road,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.014,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"In this study, the effect of a frontal brake light (FBL) on children’s willingness to cross the road was investigated. While recent studies have investigated effects of an FBL their samples consisted exclusively of adults. The results and conclusions of these studies may not be applicable to children due to their partially less developed cognitive capabilities. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an FBL on children’s willingness to cross a vehicle’s path. In a mixed design simulation study, participants were assigned to an experimental condition (EC), in which vehicles were equipped with an FBL, or to a control condition (CC), in which vehicles were not equipped with an FBL. Children aged six to twelve watched videos from the perspective of a pedestrian standing at the curb. A vehicle with an initial speed of 30 km/h approached either by maintaining the speed or by decelerating. In the latter case, the braking onset was varied (55 m or 32 m from the pedestrian’s position). Participants’ task was to indicate their willingness to cross the road in front of the vehicle at five different distances. Results show that FBL affected the willingness to cross the road, especially at an early braking onset (i.e., 55 m). If the vehicle decelerated (i.e., the FBL was activated in the EC), the willingness was significantly higher in the EC than in the CC. In case the vehicle maintained its speed (i.e., the FBL was not activated in the EC), the opposite effect appeared. However, children did not exclusively rely on information gained by the FBL, but still paid attention to distance to the vehicle and braking onset. In conclusion, the effects of an FBL on children are similar to the effects on adults identified in prior studies. Nevertheless, more research in complex scenarios is needed to draw general conclusions about the impact of FBL on road safety in differently aged children and adults.",1369-8478,Not found
The effects of implementing human valence into the behavioral model of a fully autonomous vehicle,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.011,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Objective To test in two experiments whether people would be more willing to use a Level-5 Fully Autonomous Vehicle (FAV) if the FAV's driving model is enhanced with human valence. Background Although it is believed that FAVs will eventually replace manual vehicles, people at present worry about the safety of FAVs, sense discomfort about FAVs, and it is doubtful whether they would be willing to use FAVs. Human valence is the degree to which someone is drawn towards or repulsed away from an object. However, the literature lacks empirical support on whether enhancing FAVs with valence could help ease concerns about safety, discomfort, and willingness to use FAVs. Method In Experiment I, conducted to address this void, participants manually drove in a driving simulator a simulated route at either 50 or 100 km/h and overtook road objects that traveled at either 0 or 50 km/h. Three proxy measures were recorded to infer human valence toward the overtaken objects: time-to-collision, lateral clearance, and perceived risk. The inferred valence was then implemented into Experiment II's driving model of a FAV that different participants drove. Results Participants were most willing to re-use a Safe driving style. However, the enhanced FAV’s willingness was not significantly different from the Safe driving style. Conclusion The first empirical evidence about enhancing the driving model of FAVs with human valence motivates further research. Application FAV manufacturers are advised to include human valence in the driving model of FAVs to increase people's willingness to use them.",1369-8478,Not found

The aim of our research was to determine the impact of Covid-19 on pedestrian accidents, focusing also on the characteristics of injured pedestrians, and the willingness of drivers to give priority to pedestrians. We performed a multi-aspect analysis and used statistical methods to examine the characteristics of pedestrian accidents and injured pedestrians in Budapest between 2018 and 2021, and the changes caused by the epidemic. During the analysis of the accidents, we also created maps using the Kernel Density Function based on the severity index of the accident outcome. Pedestrian and driver behaviour were assessed based on the rates of giving the priority to pedestrians at pedestrian crossings, using the results of our own measurements before and during the Covid-19 period. As the main result of our research, we found that although the epidemic and related measures reduced the number of pedestrian accidents, there was no significant change in accident characteristics. In the case of injured pedestrians, we showed a significant change in the reduction of injuries between the ages of 0 and 18 and in case of the injuries of foreign citizens. In addition, we found that the willingness to give priority for pedestrians was negatively affected by the period of Covid-19.",1369-8478,Not found
“This is where public transport falls down”: Place based perspectives of multimodal travel,10.1016/j.trf.2023.08.006,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"No single transport mode can replace the private car in terms of its support for flexible mobility. Combinations of multiple transport modes are required. If we are to contribute to reduced car dependency it is crucial that we understand what makes such multi-modal journeys difficult. Despite large bodies of literature on mode choice and on perceptions and experiences of various travel modes, few scholars have looked specifically at journeys that combine more than one transport mode. This research fills that gap, taking a qualitative approach to explore end-user perspectives of the challenges therein. Specifically, it focusses on the barriers people in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas perceive when thinking about combining two or more transport modes in a single journey. Thematic analysis of the responses of 146 participants of a series of asynchronous online focus groups revealed an overall picture of challenges shared, with some differences in the relative importance of different barriers for those in different locations. The time incurred, the difficulties in synchronising timetables, and the criticality of each leg’s reliability are core barriers for all, while those in rural areas are more affected by basic service provision and the physical linking of different modes. Of greater significance for urban and peri-urban residents were the complexities around planning a multi-modal journey where there are multiple options available, as well as the facilities available at stations and stops.

Do Dynamic speed feedback signs impact drivers differently based on speeding tendencies?

A study was designed to evaluate how the dynamic speed feedback signs (DSFS) affect drivers while transitioning from a high-speed to a low-speed environment. A total of 5 sites were selected, which included a freeway exit ramp, two speed transition zones, and two high-speed rural highway curves. Vehicle speed profiles approaching and entering these critical locations were collected before and after installing the DSFS. Based on the tracked speed of the free-flowing vehicles before the influence area, drivers were categorized as slower drivers, average drivers, and faster drivers using the 15th and 85th percentile speed at each site. Overall, installing the DSFS resulted in a significant reduction in speed across all locations for all sites. Drivers were found to reduce their speed while approaching the curve, traversing through the speed transition zones, and entering the curves or reduced speed limit areas. Results showed that faster drivers tend to reduce speed more than the average or slower drivers at every location. The faster drivers also reacted to the sign earlier compared to the slower or average drivers. The overall results are encouraging as they indicate that DSFS impact faster drivers more, which can ultimately reduce speeding-related crashes when transitioning from a high-speed environment. Based on the findings, the continued use of DSFS as a speed reduction strategy is recommended.",1369-8478,Not found
Pedestrian interactions with automated vehicles: Does the presence of a zebra crossing affect how eHMIs and movement patterns are interpreted?,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.003,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Previous research has shown that the use of an eHMI can lead pedestrians to make earlier, and more, crossing decisions in front of an automated vehicle (AV). However, there has been little exploration of the impact of crossing infrastructure or AV approach direction on pedestrian behaviour. This CAVE-based pedestrian simulator study investigated the individual, and combined, effects of a pedestrian crossing, AV approach direction, AV yielding behaviour, and a novel external Human Machine Interface (eHMI) on pedestrian crossing decisions at a four-way crossroads. Thirty eight participants took part in a multi-method study consisting of a pedestrian simulator experiment, an online interview, and a short questionnaire. The main independent variables were: (1) presence or absence of a zebra crossing; (2) the direction from which the AV approached (oncoming/right); (3) the AV’s yielding behaviour (yielding/not yielding); and (4) the presence or absence of a light-based eHMI. The AV’s yielding behaviour was the most important source of information for pedestrians, followed by the crossing infrastructure. Participants showed a greater willingness to cross in front of yielding than non-yielding vehicles, and were more likely to cross in the presence of a zebra crossing. The eHMI had the most impact in the absence of a zebra crossing, promoting earlier crossings, and encouraging more participants to cross while the approaching AV was still moving. The results of this study show the importance of eHMIs for situations associated with uncertainty about right-of-way between an AV and other road users, and highlights the interaction between formal traffic infrastructure and explicit forms of communication for future AVs. This knowledge increases our knowledge of when and where explicit communication from AVs can reduce the likelihood of pedestrian misunderstanding of AV intentions, thus reducing the likelihood of accidents occurring around these vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver drowsiness modeling based on spatial factors and electroencephalography using machine learning methods: A simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.08.007,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Driver drowsiness is one of the leading causes of fatal road traffic accidents (RTA). While studies have illustrated the effectiveness of spatial criteria on driver drowsiness, the effects of these factors on drowsy driver behavior have yet to be mapped or spatially modeled properly. Meanwhile, driver behavior has been known as a major factor in the RTA occurrence. This paper investigated the effect of four spatial criteria of chainage, distance traveled after a horizontal curve, horizontal curvature, and slope on drowsy driver behavior in a simulated driving task. Accordingly, the drowsiness level on a monotone 108 km virtual expressway in northeastern Iran was determined by modeling the EEG data of 20 subjects. Four machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely bagged decision trees (BDT), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR), were used to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and to estimate driver drowsiness based on spatial criteria. The results of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed that BDT (0.925), RF (0.919), MLP (0.807), and SVR (0.706) had the highest accuracy in estimating drowsiness level on the virtual road using EEG signals, respectively. Using the estimated drowsiness level by BDT and spatial criteria values, ML algorithms were trained to map driver drowsiness on the Tehran-Mashhad road. Based on ROC results, MLP (0.921), BDT (0.918), RF (0.917), and SVR (0.896) had the most accurate performance in mapping driver drowsiness, respectively. Generated drowsiness level maps were validated, and the estimations of BDT and RF were more consistent with real drowsy driving accident black spots in the study area. In conclusion, mapping driver drowsiness by applying ML algorithms and spatial criteria detects high-risk areas and helps to improve road safety.",1369-8478,Not found

It remains crucial to assess what factors catalyse young people's non-adaptive driving behaviours. In this study, we adapted the SDCaF (Safe Driving Climate among Friends) and RPI (Resistance to Peer Influence) scales to the driving context in Spain, and measured their relationship with the Driving Styles (DS) of young Spanish drivers (using the Spanish version of the Multidimensional Driving Styles Inventory, MDSI). A sample of young Spanish drivers (n = 459; age 18–25) completed an online questionnaire comprised of the Spanish versions of the SDCaF, RPI and MDSI scales, sociodemographic variables, driving habits and history. Evidence of the factorial structure of the Spanish version of the SDCaF scale coincides with those of the original version: the tetra-factorial model of the SDCaF scale obtained adequate values for the adjustment indices of the 4 factors; 2 are maladaptive (Peer pressure and Cost of driving with others) and 2 adaptive (Communication on traffic issues and Commitment to safe driving). The estimated reliability of the SDCaF scale reached acceptable values above (α ordinal greater than 0.80) except for the Communication factor (α = 0.76). Furthermore, evidence of the structure of the Spanish version of the RPI scale coincides with that of the original version, unifactorial model. The estimated reliability of the RPI scale reached acceptable values (α ordinal = 0.81). Most of the SDCaF's relationships with RPI and MDSI measures were as theoretically expected. The MDSI’s maladaptive DS (Reckless, Aggressive and Distracted) correlated positively with the SDCaF’s factors of Peer Pressure and Cost for driving with friends. The opposite occurred for the MDSI’s adaptive DS (Careful and Stress Reduction). SDCaF Pressure and Cost factors correlated negatively with Resistance to Peer Pressure, whereas SDCaF Communication and Commitment factors correlated positively. We found clear differences by sex: Scores were higher on the Pressure factor when the driver was a man, when the passengers were men and when driving to a party. On the other hand, the scores were higher in the Communication and Commitment factors when the driver was a woman, the passengers were women and when driving somewhere other than a party. In conclusion, we obtained quality translated instruments and provided support for their connection with maladaptive driving to evaluate the reckless driving of young people.",1369-8478,Not found
Give us something to chauffeur it: Exploring user needs in traditional and fully autonomous ridesharing for people who are blind or visually impaired,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.004,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"As self-driving technology advances, there is enormous potential to optimize fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) for use by people who are blind and visually impaired (BVI). Today, BVI users often rely on ridesharing services for daily travel, which present both challenges and opportunities for researchers interested in the accessible design of FAVs. The parallels between current BVI travel experiences in rideshares and predictions that FAV services will adopt rideshared models presents an enticing opportunity to use ridesharing as a proxy for understanding BVI needs in future FAV transportation. However, a key challenge is identifying the extent to which FAVs should be designed to provide the same assistance that human drivers currently provide for BVI travelers in rideshares. To address this issue, ridesharing users with visual impairment (n = 187) within the United States completed a survey instrument designed to assess and compare desires for interactions, information, and assistance between human operated and fully autonomous rideshare vehicles, as well as the modality of information delivery (auditory and/or haptic). Results indicate strong support for access to environmental information (e.g., spatial information about the destination) and contextual information (e.g., progress along the route) across the trip with automated vehicles via natural language interactions. Although results suggest significantly less desire for social interaction with the AI “at the wheel” of FAVs when compared to human drivers, findings indicate that participants desire some social collaboration and human-in-the-loop control during autonomous driving. By empirically comparing human and autonomous ridesharing and exploring both the information needs and modality preferences across information category, the study provides much-needed guidance for future design of humanlike, anthropomorphized, FAV AIs with important implications for social autonomous agents more generally. This study also speaks to the ways in which inclusive and accessible user interfaces should best support user needs across the range of vision loss in future transportation networks.",1369-8478,Not found
Aberrant driving behaviour among home healthcare workers,10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.005,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"This study investigates how job demands, such as time and work pressure, as well as fatigue and safety climate are related to aberrant driving behaviour including inattention, speeding, and driving while tired among employees in the Norwegian home healthcare service. The analysis adjusted for demographics, such as age, gender, and years of employment. A questionnaire was devised using validated instruments and PLS-SEM was used to analyse the data which included 210 respondents from municipal home healthcare services throughout Norway. A multiple mediation analysis was developed and tested in a complex modelling framework. We conclude that (i) workers' job demands have a direct and indirect impact (via fatigue) on aberrant driving behaviour, (ii) taking measures to manage fatigue precursors may lead to less aberrant driving behaviour among employees in the home healthcare sector, (iii) work and time pressure are possible precursors of fatigue, and (iv) the importance of management's involvement in promoting a safe driving climate is emphasised.",1369-8478,Not found
"How does drivers’ trust in vehicle automation affect non-driving-related task engagement, vigilance, and initiative takeover performance after experiencing system failure?",10.1016/j.trf.2023.09.001,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Vehicle automation is a potentially highly advantageous concept in terms of reducing traffic accidents, e.g., due to distractions by non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) or decreased vigilance. The driver needs to have a thorough understanding of the vehicle automation system and a moderate level of trust in it for the advantages to be realized. System failures inherently adversely affect trust, however, a completely reliable system is unrealistic. In the present study, we explore how drivers’ trust in vehicle automation affects their NDRT engagement, vigilance, and initiative takeover performance after experiencing a system failure. In the induction experiment, seventy-seven participants were divided into three groups by their level of trust (distrust, appropriate trust, excessive trust) in the highly automated vehicle. All experienced five “hazardous events” in the formal experiment, the second of which was a system failure. Relevant results indicated that the system failure affected drivers differently depending on their levels of trust. Drivers’ NDRT engagement decreased after the system failure due to a decline in trust but increased during subsequent driving as trust recovered. Vigilance was higher in drivers who were distrustful, but the post-failure decrease in vigilance was higher compared to others. Drivers who were distrustful were more likely to initiatively take over the vehicle as evidenced by higher resulting acceleration upon encountering the hazards. The maximum resulting acceleration decreased with the sequence of hazardous events but increased with the level of risks. The findings of this work may be useful in terms of trust calibration processes, technological improvements to vehicle automation systems, and the promotion of automated vehicle usage.",1369-8478,Not found
Identification of factors influencing the riding experience on e-mountain bikes: An analysis of the rider-bicycle interaction,10.1016/j.trf.2023.08.008,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"E-bike riding contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle by offering health and environmental benefits. Especially e-mountain bikes enjoy great popularity in hilly areas. Although the frequency of use depends substantially on the perceived riding experience, little is known about factors influencing the riding experience. The present work aimed to explore factors influencing the riding experience on e-mountain bikes using a two-step approach. Subjective and objective factors influencing the riding experience were determined through qualitative content analysis of data collected in an interview study (Study 1) with 23 active e-mountain bike riders. Results from Study 1 identified riding performance, consisting of perceived handling, exertion and motor performance as a subjective impact factor of the riding experience. Rider behaviour, which is composed of rider cadence and rider torque, motor power and riding dynamics such as speed were identified as objective impact factors of the riding experience. In a next step, the impact of the determined factors was examined with multiple linear regression analysis applied to data collected in a cycling study (Study 2) with 80 active mountain bikers. The data from Study 2 was recorded on a forest uphill track with e-mountain bikes that provided different motor assistance. Results from Study 2 confirmed that high motor performance, good handling and reduced exertion contributed to a positive riding experience ( a d . R 2 = . 68 , F ( 3 , 446 ) = 325.2 , p<.001). Increased rider cadence and rider torque affected the riding experience negatively while increased motor power and speed affected the riding experience positively ( a d . R 2 = . 40 , F ( 4 , 445 ) = 75.89 , p<.001). The findings of the present work help to improve the riding experience on e-mountain bikes by revealing influencing factors and their impact on the riding experience.",1369-8478,Not found

Driving behaviours were categorized into three levels of cognitive control (operational, tactical, and strategical) while the selection of the musical background experienced during simulated driving was left to participants. The following characteristics were considered as candidates to investigate driving behaviours changes: individual characteristics in terms of driving experience and music listener (i.e., individual sensitivity to music reward and frequency of music listening), music parameters (i.e., tempo, mode), and mood and emotional changes induced by music. Ninety-two drivers’ behaviours were analysed in a variety of simulated driving situations. The findings support the rationale that musical background has the potential to impact driving behaviours. Driving behaviours requiring an “operational” level of cognitive control were found to be the most influenced by the musical stimuli. Music listening was also found to generate mood and emotion changes, which can in turn influence driving behaviours, especially when the induced emotional valence is negative. However, background music's influence on driving behaviours, either direct or mediated by emotional or mood changes, seemed rather limited in terms of effect size.",1369-8478,Not found
Differential impacts of road diets on driving behavior among older adults with and without preclinical Alzheimer's pathology,10.1016/j.trf.2023.08.010,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The driving populace of the United States is aging. The prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) will increase in the coming decades. Road diets (that is, the reallocation of one or more lanes of car traffic to other uses) have been proposed as a modification to increase pedestrian safety, particularly for older adults. In contrast, we considered the impacts of road diets on aging drivers, and on those with early pathological accumulation of AD. We observed naturalistic driving data for 60 cognitively normal older drivers (Age Range = 62–87 years, Median = 75 years) driving across three road segments located in the St. Louis metropolitan area, Missouri, United States. We used neuroimaging and lumbar puncture derived biomarker data to determine which of the drivers had preclinical AD. Since previous AD studies identified a variety of changes in driving behavior among older drivers with preclinical AD, we examined driving speed before and after lane repurposing. We found that drivers with preclinical AD drove at lower speeds compared to those without preclinical AD prior to road diet implementation. After lanes were repurposed, there was no statistical difference in the speed between older drivers with and without preclinical AD. We evaluated cognitive performance and found that attentional control had a mediating effect on driver speed, suggesting that an individual’s ability to focus on a specific task and filter out distractions was associated with faster driving. Driving speed after lane repurposing is not mediated by attentional control, suggesting that road diets are impervious to individual driver capacity. We conclude that lane repurposing has potential as an important mobility infrastructure solution that could enhance older driver safety and facilitate aging in place.",1369-8478,Not found
What does an Automated Vehicle class as a hazard? Using online video-based training to improve drivers’ trust and mental models for activating an Automated Vehicle,10.1016/j.trf.2023.08.005,98,2023-10-01,2023,10,"One of the arguments in favour for the introduction of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is that they will improve road safety by reducing the frequency and severity of on-road collisions. However, if drivers have a poor mental model for the capabilities and limitations of the automation, they may over-trust and activate the automation in inappropriate road conditions leading to a collision. To address this, an online video-based training programme was developed to improve drivers’ mental models for when an AV can be activated, and this was compared to the current AV driver training method (i.e. owner’s manual) in a matched pairs experiment. Drivers were matched on their locus of control, age and gender before reading an owner’s manual (control group) or reading an owner’s manual and undergoing the new online training programme (experimental group). Their trust in automation and mental models were measured before and after training. This experiment found that the online training programme in combination with an owner’s manual led to a greater improvement in drivers’ mental models for when the automation can be activated compared to the owner’s manual in isolation. Additionally, as both training programmes exposed drivers to the limitations of the automation, both training programmes reduced drivers’ trust in automation. The online training programme can be completed anywhere, at any time and on any device, which makes it highly convenient. Therefore, there could be greater acceptance amongst current licenced drivers who may not be receptive to more training.",1369-8478,Not found
The relationship between cognitive functioning and street-crossing behaviours in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.018,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Background Pedestrians are vulnerable road users, with 26 % of global road fatalities being pedestrians (and other vulnerable road users). It is argued that pedestrians are involved in crashes due to errors in decision-making due to deficits in cognitive skills. To date there has limited research into pedestrian decision-making. There currently stands no theoretical model to help understand how cognitive function impacts on pedestrian street crossing decisions. Objectives The aim of this review was to synthesize the literature on the relationship between cognitive functioning and street-crossing behaviours, in two population groups: all adults, and older adults with or without a cognitive impairment. Data sources Published literature from three databases (PsycINFO, PubMed and Medline) was searched in February 2022. Studies were required to have investigated the relationship between cognitive functioning and street-crossing behaviours. Results Nine studies were identified for the systematic review, with four cognitive domains and nine street-crossing behaviours examined. Findings from the systematic review suggested that poorer processing speed and visual attention predicted increased unsafe street-crossing behaviours across the two population groups. Additionally, most studies demonstrated a non-significant relationship between executive function and street-crossing behaviours. Results from the meta-analysis on all adults, demonstrated a small effect size for the strength of the relationship between overall cognitive functioning and street-crossing behaviours, with stronger effects noted in individual domains of selective attention and inhibition. Limitations The small number of studies in this space combined with considerable variability in cognitive domains measured, assessment tools utilized, and street-crossing behaviours examined across studies limit conclusions about patterns of the relationship between cognitive functioning and pedestrian safety. Conclusions Findings highlight the important role of visual attention in enabling the engagement of safe street-crossing behaviours, which may assist in the development of targeted interventions to reduce risk of harm to pedestrians. Given unexpected findings regarding the influence of executive functioning, as well as limited findings on other cognitive domains such as mental status and memory, future research should aim to elucidate their role in pedestrian safety. Further research into cognitive function and pedestrian street crossing behaviours is critical if we are to develop a theoretical framework for how pedestrians make road-crossing decisions. If we can better understand the factors that influence street crossing decisions, roadway infrastructure and training programs can be developed to improve outcomes for this vulnerable population.",1369-8478,Not found
"From fear to forecast: The role of simulators, accompanied driving, age, gender, and information-processing style in driver training and beyond",10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.003,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Background Even though accompanied driving and simulator training are common, clarity on their usage trends and effectiveness is lacking. This research aimed to deepen the understanding of the relationships between personal characteristics, pre-licence accompanied driving, self-reported post-licence driving behaviour, and driving performance scores during simulator lessons. Methods We used data from a questionnaire completed by simulator and non-simulator students (total n = 3,761). Data were analysed by dividing the sample into two groups based on variables such as gender, age at licensure, education level, fear of driving a car when starting driver education, information-processing style, participation in accompanied driving, and the number of driving simulator lessons completed. Results Males took fewer on-road lessons and reported lower fear, but they had poorer simulator safety scores than females. Younger learners required fewer lessons and test attempts, were less fearful, and violated traffic rules more than older respondents. Higher-educated respondents had more fear and safer driving scores in the simulator. Thinkers, who were typically more educated, showed more caution in the simulator and on the road, and were older at licensure. Compared to regular students, students participating in accompanied driving were younger at licensure. Moreover, students with a higher driving skill score in the simulator were less fearful and needed slightly fewer attempts to pass the road driving test. Discussion and conclusion The fear towards driving, which is strongly linked to personal characteristics, provides a logical explanation for the progression of students through driver education. Furthermore, this study illustrated the possibility of considering information-processing styles, education level, and driving simulator performance in driving education. However, in order to conclusively study the safety-effectiveness of accompanied driving and simulator training, further research in the form of a randomised controlled trial is necessary.",1369-8478,Not found
Did COVID-19 mandates influence driver distraction Behaviors? A case study in New Jersey,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.019,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The global pandemic, Coronavirus (COVID), impacts almost everything, and human driving behavior is no exception. Since its breakdown in March 2020, transportation researchers have pondered on this matter to investigate the impact of COVID on drivers' travel behavior. Most of these studies are self-reported surveys, 'before and during' crash analyses, and short-duration observational studies. With a wider scope from an observational lens, we aim to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on drivers' distraction behaviors from an extensive observational database of distracted driving in New Jersey. A moving observational vehicle equipped with mounted cameras was utilized to collect the drivers' behavior across the high crash corridors and important highways in New Jersey. Samples collected during the COVID mandates and the post-COVID period were analyzed to assess the impact of COVID on drivers' distraction behavior at various temporal setups and roadway geometry. The results indicate a significant increase in cellphone use, eating, and fidgeting/grooming during the post-COVID period. However, behaviors like radio/reaching objects and talking to passengers decreased significantly after COVID. Utilizing the Mann-Whitney U test, this study conducted significance tests to identify the impacts of various temporal and geometric roadway features on each distraction type. Summer season, toll roads and roads with no signal had reduced distraction during the post-COVID compared to the COVID period. Both COVID and post-COVID period showed significant patterns of change of driver behavior within the temporal variables and road geometry. This research's findings would enable comprehension of human behavioral change for COVID mandates.",1369-8478,Not found
Misuse or abuse of automation?

Sleep was found to impair driver’s take-over performance and lead to critical situations in previous studies. That is why in a follow-up interview study, we tried to understand if and why users would show this potentially dangerous behaviour when using a level 3 ADS in reality. The majority of participants who stated their willingness to sleep during automated driving in reality had a correct mental model of the level 3 ADS and understood that sleep was not allowed. Participants with willingness to sleep had higher trust levels and showed more trust-related behaviours. They slept more frequently during the study and experienced more take-over situations after sleep which they solved with less errors than participants without the willingness to sleep. Semi-structured interviews on the willingness to sleep with a subsample revealed that most of the participants with the willingness to sleep would sleep only under certain circumstances and when they had gained some experience with the ADS. The findings suggest that after some experience with the ADS, drivers are at risk of becoming complacent and they might sleep. Vehicle designers must consider automation complacency in the design of automation designing for appropriate trust levels or by using driver monitoring systems to detect sleep onset.",1369-8478,Not found
Does users’ experience and evaluation of level 3 automated driving functions predict willingness to use: Results from an on-road study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.004,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"To ensure the successful deployment of Automated Vehicles (AVs), it is important to understand users’ acceptance and willingness to use. The majority of previous studies which have investigated Willingness to Use of automated functionalities in vehicles, have relied on users’ imagination of system operational features, without any actual hands-on experience. To close this research gap, we conducted an extensive questionnaire study with participants who had experienced either a Motorway (N = 294) or an Urban (N = 144) Automated Driving Function (ADF) in an on-road study using prototype vehicles, conducted as part of the large-scale European L3Pilot project. We investigated the impact of participants’ demographic characteristics, and their evaluation of the ADFs, on their Willingness to Use these ADFs again in the future. Findings revealed that age was a significant predictor but had a small effect, with younger users showing a higher Willingness to Use the Motorway ADF, but not the Urban ADF. Other user characteristics, such as safety drivers versus ordinary drivers, system familiarity, and gender, did not predict Willingness to Use, for either system. Factors related to users’ Feelings of Ease (e.g., perceived safety, fun, comfort, trust) and Perceived Usefulness of the system, were the most important predictors, with more positive ratings for these factors leading to a higher Willingness to Use, for both systems. Other factors that showed an effect on Willingness to Use include System Monitoring Requirements (i.e., willingness to engage in other tasks instead of monitoring the system), System Information (i.e., wanting to know more about the system’s limitations) and System Expectations being met. This study shows the importance of ensuring that users have a good experience and perceive the system as useful to increase their Willingness to Use the ADF.",1369-8478,Not found
"Exploring parental attachment, perceived social support, theory of planned behaviour and the safe driving of young people",10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.024,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Few studies have investigated psychosocial influences on the safe (as opposed to risky) driving behaviours of young people. In addition, there has been little consideration of interpersonal factors such as attachment between parents and children in this context. Examination of these factors is warranted given the overrepresentation of young drivers in crashes; that engagement and non-engagement in both proactive safe and risky behaviours are conceptually different; and that parents are commonly the main driving supervisor when young people learn to drive. The study was underpinned by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), which was extended with attachment theory, perceived social support, and descriptive norms. Predictors of safe driving intentions and self-reported safe driving behaviours were explored with a sample of provisionally licensed drivers aged 17–20 years from Queensland, Australia. Three scenarios were investigated where safe driving was examined in general (N = 209) and in relation to driving in two common driving situations: stormy/raining conditions (N = 213) and on the highway (N = 199). Participants completed an online survey measuring attitude, subjective norms, Perceived Behavioural Control, and intentions from the TPB, as well as descriptive norms, attachment avoidance and anxiety, and perceived social support (emotional, instrumental, informational, appraisal) for safe driving. Two weeks later, a subsample (n = 66) completed a second survey asking them to report their behavioural opportunity and engagement in general safe driving, and the two safe driving situations. Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to investigate safe driving intentions. PBC and attitude were consistent significant predictors of intentions. Subjective norms predicted intention in the two driving situations but not in general safe driving. Informational support was a significant predictor of intention for general safe driving. Attachment avoidance and anxiety did not significantly predict intentions in any scenario. However, there may be benefit in investigating the action of attachment style on safe driving intentions via parental modelling. Parental modelling was a significant predictor of general safe driving intentions and may be related to attachment style. Due to participant attrition, investigation of self-reported safe driving behaviours was confined to bivariate correlations with intentions and PBC, with no significant correlations found. The findings suggest that TPB factors including PBC, attitudes and subjective norms may be important determinants of intentions for safe driving of young novice drivers. These findings could be used to inform development of road safety inventions such as media campaigns and demonstrate the value of further attention to safety versus risky behaviours in driving research.",1369-8478,Not found

Results indicated that attitudes and both personal and work-related subjective norms were positively associated with adoption intention. An association was not found between perceived behavioural control and adoption intention, and the relationships between psychosocial factors and adoption intention were not found to be moderated by perceived barriers. Concerns regarding the risk of operating errors and fear of equipment or system failure were found to be negatively associated with adoption intention and concerns regarding cost was found to be positively associated with adoption intention. Encouragingly from a safety perspective, it appears that concerns regarding safety are more influential to adoption intention than costs associated with the purchase of the vehicle.

Thirty variables with a total of 723 samples were obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a camera. The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of pedestrian spatial crossing violations at unmarked roadways. A random parameter logit model was used to establish a pedestrian crossing decision model for roadway violations. The results indicate that males are more likely to violate than females; the probability of violation with companions is higher than that of crossing alone; when pedestrians cross with other strangers in the same direction, the rate will decrease; and shorter intersection spacing, a higher vehicle flow, and a longer pedestrian crossing length all reduce the illegal crossing propensity.

Cyclists’ perception of streetscape and its influence on route choice: A pilot study with a mixed-methods approach,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.029,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"To encourage behavioural changes that reduce car use, understanding travel behaviour and interventions in infrastructure are necessary. Understanding the route choices of cyclists and their motivation based on their preferences regarding their trip attributes is essential to improve cycling infrastructure and encourage active travel modes such as cycling. This research aims to explore the influence of streetscape design features (SDFs) on cyclists' route choices by developing a mixed-method approach to collect objective and subjective data from 22 volunteers. We used a survey (Maptionnaire) with a virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking experiment to simulate a bicycle trip in Enschede, The Netherlands. Results showed that despite differences between usual and ideal routes regarding SDFs (such as the presence of vegetation, water bodies, and road intersections), factors such as infrastructure provision and quality have a more significant impact when choosing a route. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in combining data from the different methods to improve understanding regarding the influence of SDFs in cyclists' route choices and raise awareness among the participants about the influence of SDFs on their route choices. These results may encourage future studies to develop and implement alternative mixed-methods approaches to increase understanding of cyclists' travel behaviour. From a practitioner's perspective, implementing such mixed-method for data collection may increase the efficiency of the process to aid in the development of contextual data-driven interventions that encourage the use of bicycles.",1369-8478,Not found
Motives for driving after cannabis use: A scoping review,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.012,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Context Understanding the motives for driving after cannabis use (DACU) is crucial to improve road safety and develop effective prevention programs to reduce this behavior. Objective To synthesize and categorize motives for DACU reported in the scientific literature, using the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) as a basis for motive classification and conceptualization. Method This scoping review followed the methodological guidelines proposed by Arksey and O’Malley (2005), Levac et al. (2010) and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al., 2018). The algorithms used to extract relevant information about the motives for DACU in the scientific literature were designed for Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO search engines. To be included in the review, articles had to describe motives for cannabis use as the main substance used before driving a non-commercial road motor vehicle. Any psychological justification or conscious reason was considered as a motive. A total of 30 articles were selected. A descriptive quantitative analysis and a thematic qualitative analysis were used to synthesize the results. Results The studies mainly originated from the USA (k = 14), Canada (k = 6), Australia (k = 6), the UK (k = 3) and Spain (k = 1). Thirty-two motives for DACU have been classified into six themes: (1) general risk perception; (2) driving is seen as the only possible option; (3) low risk given the road or traffic conditions; (4) risk-seeking; (5) possibility to compensate for the effect of cannabis and (6) subjective norms (i.e., perception if DACU is approved or committed by others). Risk perception was by far the most frequently reported motive. Implications Prevention programs could greatly benefit from a better understanding of the motives for DACU. Increasing risk awareness appears to be one of the main objectives in addition to providing efficient alternative means of transport and development of prevention initiatives tailored for cannabis users.",1369-8478,Not found

In such conditions, road markings and road signs are the main source of information for drivers. Research has shown that road markings and road signs, if properly designed and placed, can positively impact driver behaviour and thus overall road safety. However, it is still not completely clear how different levels of road markings and road signs visibility affect drivers in night-time conditions. For this reason, we used a driving simulator to simulate night-time conditions and different levels of visibility of road markings and road signs in order to analyse the connection between the visibility of these road elements and driver behaviour and cognitive load. The results suggest that the level of road markings and road signs visibility slight increased the driving speed (about 2%), but at the same time it had a positive effect on participants’ cognitive load which was at an optimal level during high visibility. Although there was no significant difference in participants’ eye movements and the number of gazes at road markings, the percentage share of looked road signs was the highest in high visibility conditions, which suggests that the participants were in most cases timely informed and aware of the upcoming situation.",1369-8478,Not found
What is the role of active mobility habits in the relationship between self-determination and modal shift intentions?

In this article we rely on the Self-determination theory (SDT) to assess the relationship between individual motivations (autonomous and controlled) and intentions to modal shift. We additionally evaluate the mediating role of active mobility habits in this relationship. To do this we build and test theoretical models using structural equation modelling. The results show that if habits concerning the use of alternative modes to the car are not taken into account, the autonomous motivation has a significant impact on intention, but not controlled motivation. However, the introduction of habits in the model shows that they fully mediate the relationship between both motivations and intention. These results are useful for a better understanding of the psychological mechanisms of modal choice changes and the targeting of measures aimed at encouraging the use of active modes.",1369-8478,Not found

Objectives The primary aim was to assess the relations between trait anger, cycling frequency and car use frequency as predictor variables, mediated by cycling anger experience and cycling anger expression on RCB among adult cyclists, while controlling for the effects of age and gender. A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cycling anger experience and cycling anger expression on RCB, by means of a descriptive comparison of two surveys gathered before and during the second COVID-19 lockdown. Methods A total of 1,346 participants in 2019 (‘before COVID-19 pandemic’) and 1,241 participants in 2020 (‘during lockdown’) filled in an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a Risky Cycling Behaviour (RCB) variable from the Cycling Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ), the Cycling Anger Scale (CAS), the Cycling Anger Expression Inventory (CAX) and the Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2). Because different participant samples were included in the 2019 and 2020 survey (independent observations), a two-group mediation model with cycling anger experience and expression as mediators was fitted. Results The results from the 2019 and the 2020 cohort are relatively similar with significant direct effects between trait anger and RCB. At both periods, an indirect effect between trait anger and RCB was present through CAX. As compared to men, women tend to report less anger expression (CAX) while cycling in traffic, but experience (CAS) more anger. A small negative association indicated that older participants tended to report less RCB than younger participants. Both in 2019 and 2020, cycling frequency and car frequency showed no or only small direct and indirect effects on RCB. When comparing the 2019 with the 2020 cohorts, we found a stronger direct effect of trait anger on risky cycling behaviour in 2020 and a stronger indirect effect of trait anger on RCB, through anger expression (CAX). Conclusions These results underline the importance to teach cyclists to deal with their anger while cycling. Technics such as relaxation coping skills or a combination of relaxation and cognitive skills (mindfulness) were shown to be effective in cyclists and drivers of motor vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Distracted by familiarity: Implications of ‘autopilot’ as a default cognitive mode,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.021,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Most trips are made, and most travel is done on roads and paths well-known. To provide insight in the cognitive processes involved in visual information processing of familiar traffic environments this paper considers a series of four consecutive empirical studies. The aim of this paper is 1) to discuss the implications of these insights on research methodologies used to measure driver attention and distraction and 2) to provide recommendations for policymaking, road design and vehicle design. This line of work consists of three studies on car driver behaviour (two driving simulator studies and a video-based study) and an observational study on pedestrian behaviour. The recurring theme in the results of these studies is that the progressive exposure to the same traffic environment enables participants to automatise their behavioural performance in traffic up to the point that it could be executed at skill-based level. As a result, attention is easily diverted away from traffic participation, while participating in traffic. Participants could act without thinking about it, so they didn’t always even remember what they had done. People get used to familiar traffic environments so much that they don’t have to think about walking or driving with much conscious focus. Hence, when studying road user behaviour and particularly driver distraction, it is crucial to mimic these natural circumstances as closely as possible. It is therefore proposed that within driver distraction research, route familiarity should be regarded as a context that enables distraction. What is more, is that the results point in the direction of a familiarity paradox: deviating from what is very familiar likely results in involuntary distraction, but being very familiar may lead to underload resulting in (voluntarily) diverting attention elsewhere.",1369-8478,Not found
UTAUT4-AV: An extension of the UTAUT model to study intention to use automated shuttles and the societal acceptance of different types of automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.007,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The aim of this study was to develop a model to analyse the acceptance of Automated Shuttles (AS) in order to predict and explain individuals’ intentions to use and adopt this new type of automated vehicle. Based on a review of the literature, we proposed an extension of the widely used UTAUT model of Venkatesh et al. (2003), named UTAUT4-AV (for Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 4 [for] Automated Vehicles) to specifically study AS acceptance. An online survey was conducted among a representative sample of 2,612 French citizens. From the processed data, it appears that UTAUT4-AV may explain 89% of the variance in the intention to use automated shuttles, which is 20–30% higher than existing models. This better explanatory power is likely due to the inclusion of new constructs related to the mean of transport currently used by the participants, whether in terms of satisfaction with this mode of transport or regarding mobility performance increasing thanks to AS. The inclusion of individual factors, such as attitudes towards new technologies and innovation, also contributed to this highest explanatory power. Moreover, the results obtained also show that UTAUT4-AV is robust enough to be applied to three other types of automated vehicles (i.e., Automated Cars, Robotaxis, and Autonomous Air Mobility Vehicles), with an ability to explain from 90% to 92% of the variance in the intention to use these other automated vehicles. Additional studies will be however required to evaluate the validity of the UTAUT4-AV model among populations of different countries or regarding acceptance of other types of new technologies, to support a better generalization of these results.",1369-8478,Not found
The adoption and application of Intelligent Speed Assistance by private motorists: User and non-user perspectives,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.016,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) is an in-car system that can help drivers to avoid speeding and therefore reduce crash frequency and severity. ISA systems that intervene to reduce vehicle speeds are increasingly available in new cars. Their efficacy in crash reduction will depend on the extent to which they are adopted and used by motorists. Increasing ISA use is therefore a promising new target for behaviour-change interventions seeking to reduce crash involvement. To provide context for intervention development, this study explored the beliefs and attitudes of 20 car drivers who have intervening ISA systems and 20 that do not. Thematic analysis of interview scripts generated five superordinate themes across both sets of drivers relating to: (1) safety, (2) driver control, (3) choice and enforcement, (4) driver identity and behaviour, and (5) enabling roll-out. ISA acceptability was generally high as long as driver choice around turning off and overriding the system was maintained. Drivers described a number of information needs relating to ISA: increased general awareness of ISA, provision of system-specific information for new ISA drivers and reassurances around non-ISA driver concerns (e.g., the responsiveness of the override and the speed control process). Many drivers indicated that ISA adoption would be facilitated by emphasising personal benefits (e.g., protecting driver licences, reduced insurance premiums, improved fuel efficiency, more relaxed driving) as well as safety advantages.",1369-8478,Not found
Cycling under the influence of alcohol and other drugs: An exploratory analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.026,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"We explore several aspects of Cycling Under the Influence (CUI) of alcohol and other drugs. CUI remains a relatively under researched topic, even though evidence suggests that it is a rising safety risk as both cycling mileage and alcohol consumption are increasing. We present the results of a quantitative survey designed to (i) assess the amplitude of the problem among Parisians and (ii) identify precursors for bicycle accident involvement and CUI practices. Our research provides evidence proving that CUI is indeed a common practice among Parisian cyclists (F(alcohol) = 46 % and F(drugs) = 10 %). Cyclists declare to be aware of related risks, but rarely adapt their drinking/cycling behavior to avoid them, even when they have previous accident involvement record. Shared vehicles’ users are more prone to CUI during night leisure outings when public transport is not available. Also, increased previous experience in cycling or in alcohol or drug consumption seems to make riders overconfident and therefore raise the probability of CUI.",1369-8478,Not found
"Effects of risk perception on commuters’ mode choice behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Shenzhen, China",10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.020,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has influenced and is still influencing people’s daily lives worldwide. The infection rate and health and safety countermeasures may influence people’s epidemic risk perception, thus influencing their travel mode choice. It is critical to understand epidemic risk perception and its impact on travel mode choice behavior to ensure the timeliness and effectiveness of health and safety policy implementation. In this study, we conducted an online survey to investigate how commuters’ epidemic risk perception affects travel mode choice behavior in Shenzhen. The online survey mainly includes Likert scale questions and a stated preference experiment with three scenarios to capture commuters’ epidemic risk perceptions and travel mode choice behaviors. First, confirmatory factor analysis was used to obtain three dimensions of epidemic risk perception from the Likert scale questions. Then, three subpopulation groups, including risk-sensitive commuters, risk-insensitive commuters and cautious commuters, were classified based on their risk perception using clustering analysis. Finally, a latent class choice model was estimated to capture the influencing factors of mode choice behavior. Three classes of mode choice behavior were identified, including those who can accept using public transportation, those who avoid using public transportation and tend to bicycles/electric bicycles and those who avoid using public transportation and tend to personal cars. The obtained results can provide valuable support for decision-making during and after an epidemic. Firstly, by offering insights into the intricate risk perception characteristics of Shenzhen residents, these findings can contribute to the effective management of epidemic risks during an epidemic. Secondly, by revealing the factors that influence individuals' preferences for travel modes, these results play a pivotal role in enhancing the market share of the public transportation system after the epidemic.",1369-8478,Not found
Comparing the bad media-fuelled reputation of e-scooters with real-life user and non-user perceptions: Evidence from Sweden,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.005,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"E-scooters, one of the most rapidly growing forms of micromobility globally, entered our cities as an innovative first and last-mile travel mode looking to complement public transit and reduce short car trips. However, there are many voices openly suggesting that e-scooters, despite representing still a very low modal share, have instead been the source of traffic accidents, transport system disruption and public space anarchy. Despite a wealth of e-scooter research appearing lately, knowledge gaps about e-scooters’ current reputation and how this matches actual user and non-user perceptions do exist. Our two-phase mixed method approach means to fill in these gaps by examining the intriguing context of Sweden, a country hosting more than 30 million e-scooter trips on an annual basis but recently enforcing new stricter rules for their regulation. This paper contributes to the state of the art by contextualising the current reputation of e-scooters in Sweden through a discourse analysis of local press items and by analysing an attitudinal survey that ran in Stockholm and Gothenburg with almost equal numbers of e-scooter users and non-users. First our news item analysis identifies six reputation-defining themes: cityscape fit; traffic safety and irresponsible user behaviour; rules, regulations and exploits; business; sustainability; and convenience and concludes that e-scooters’ portrayal in Sweden is very negative. There are approximately five negative comments in the press for every positive one. Our survey offers statistical evidence that there are significant differences in the evaluations of users and non-users when it comes to seven perceived e-scooter qualities (safety; speed; eco-friendliness; cost; convenience; fun; health and wellbeing) and two policy practicalities (regulations clarity; and parking provision). Users’ perceptions are always more positive from those of non-users, but they do agree with them that safety, eco-friendliness, cost, health and wellbeing are areas of concern for e-scooters. Both groups see value in enhanced regulation clarity and better parking provision. Non-users however, to some degree, do recognise that e-scooters offer fast, convenient and pleasant mobility services making this the tripole where image change and positive rebranding could start from.",1369-8478,Not found
Inducers of motion sickness in vehicles: A systematic review of experimental evidence and meta-analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.013,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"With the development of intelligent cabins and the popularity of smart devices, motion sickness has become an increasing concern. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cause of motion sickness in vehicles. However, because of the diversity of the dynamical characteristics, road conditions, and in-vehicle human–machine interaction designs, the influence of the inducers on motion sickness in vehicles has not yet been fully quantified. Thus, in this paper, we aim to review and summarize the influential factors of motion sickness in road vehicles through a systematic review. In total, we identified 57 studies related to influential factors of motion sickness in vehicles, of which, 27 were further included for meta-analysis. In total, we identified eight categories of motion sickness inducers in vehicles, including the type of eye view, non-driving-related task availability, existence of artificial motion cues, head dynamic movement, vehicle dynamics, internal layout of vehicle, individual differences, and others. Most inducers had consistent effects on inducing motion sickness; however, inconsistent results have also been observed in vehicle dynamics, head dynamic movement, eye view, individual difference, and artificial motion cues (i.e., cues regarding the motion states of the ego-vehicle provided through in-vehicle auditory, tactile, or visual interfaces). Additional meta-analysis was conducted for motion cues. It was found that only natural present motion cues (i.e., cues regarding relative movement between the ego-vehicle and the environment through the windshield or side windows) and non-visual artificial anticipatory motion cues (i.e., auditory or tactile artificial motion cues regarding the future motion of ego-vehicle) were effective in alleviating motion sickness. Future research directions have been pointed out. Our study can provide insights into the optimization of vehicle design to mitigate motion sickness among occupants.",1369-8478,Not found
Pedestrian behaviour in integrated street designs: A mesoscopic analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.015,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Recent trends in urban design have called for more equal treatment of all road users and have effected a shift away from the traditional concept of segregation and towards more integration. This usually translates to more pedestrian-friendly layouts with wider footways, fewer protective guardrails and lower (or even no) kerbs. Following-on from previous research on the topic, this study explores changes in pedestrian behaviour in response to integrated street design. A “mesoscopic” level of analysis is adopted, whereby the actions and revealed choices of individual pedestrians are modelled probabilistically, but without a detailed investigation into their attitudes and perceptions. Video footage from London’s Exhibition Road site during periods before and after its conversion from a conventional layout to a more integrated pedestrian-oriented design is used, and an observation scheme focusing on pedestrian actions and discernible characteristics is devised. Inferential statistics methods are used to derive models expressing two behavioural traits: walking/crossing speed, and crossing on red incidence. The results suggest that the additional space provided and the reduced crowding post-redevelopment results in pedestrians walking less hastily and close to their desired speed, while the friendlier conditions created by the street layout increase their confidence to enter the road space and cross, sometimes even on a red signal. In particular, those walking alone (rather than in a group) and walking to work (rather than leisure) appear to walk faster and are also more likely to cross on red.",1369-8478,Not found
Effectiveness of connected-vehicle-based curve speed warning systems with considerations of heads-up display language type's effects on driver behavior,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.009,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Treatments regarding Curve Warning Systems (CWS) were proposed to assist drivers with safer performances driving through horizontal curves. These treatments include curve warning signs and Connected Vehicle (CV) technology. However, there lacks an investigation of CWS-impacted speed compliance from the mechanism perspective, quantitatively linking the real-time speed compliance to human factors, curve geometric, visibility, pavement conditions, and particularly, the language types of in-vehicle visual display messages. Hence, this research aims to identify factors contributing to the effectiveness of CV-based CWS by focusing on these systems’ influences in real-time speed. Three CWS are chosen, namely Level 0 (curve sign-only), Level 1 (one-time curve warning before entering the curve), and Level 2 (guidance-oriented, adaptive to vehicle speed, location, and pavement friction). Three CWS are implemented in a driving simulator. Thirty participants were recruited to drive through a series of curves under CWS with different geometric, illumination, and pavement conditions. Real-time speed compliance was collected in evaluating the CWS’ impacts on speed control. Results show that gender, curve radius, illumination, and pavement conditions significantly impact the effectiveness of CWS. All findings reveal that guidance-oriented and adaptive CWS (Level 2) significantly guides drivers with better speed compliance performances.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving fatigue increases after the Spring transition to Daylight Saving Time in young male drivers: A pilot study,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.014,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The Spring transition to Daylight Saving Time (DST) has been associated with several health and road safety issues. Previous literature has focused primarily on the analysis of historical crash and hospitalization data, without investigating specific crash contributing factors, such as driving fatigue. The present study aims to uncover the effects of DST-related circadian desynchrony and sleep deprivation on driving fatigue, by means of a driving simulator experiment. Eighteen participants (all males, age range 21–30 years, mean = 24.2, SD = 2.9) completed two 50-minute trials (at one week distance, same time and same day of the week) on a monotonous highway environment, the second one taking place in the week after the Spring transition to DST. Driving fatigue was evaluated by analysing several different variables (including driving-based, physiological and subjective indices) and by comparison with a historical cohort of pertinent, matched controls who had also undergone two trials, but in the absence of any time change in between. Results showed a considerable rise in fatigue levels throughout the driving task in both trials, but with significantly poorer performance in the post-DST trial, documented by a worsening in vehicle lateral control and an increase in eyelid closure. However, participants seemed unable to perceive this decrease in their alertness, which most likely prevented them from implementing fatigue-coping strategies. These findings indicate that DST has a detrimental effect on driving fatigue in young male drivers in the week after the Spring transition, and provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between DST and road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Eeg-based mental states assessment of three-wheeler drivers in different environments and traffic conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.011,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Driving in diverse and challenging conditions, including inclement weather, poses potential risks to road safety. While previous studies have primarily focused on examining driver behavior and reactions in different weather and road conditions, there is a lack of research on assessing drivers' mental states during such situations, particularly considering the influence of factors such as road complexity, traffic, demographics, and adverse environmental conditions. This paper aims to address this research gap by evaluating the mental states of drivers across different age groups and driving experience levels through simulated driving scenarios encompassing various environments and traffic conditions. A three-wheeler driving simulator was employed, along with the DSI 7 EEG headset and Q states software, to classify and analyze the drivers' mental states. The findings of this study highlight that young novice drivers exhibit higher fluctuations in mental state compared to their mid and high-experienced counterparts. Furthermore, mid-age drivers face an elevated risk of collision due to frequent changes in mental state and attention. Additionally, it was observed that highly skilled drivers display a transition in attention level and mental state between sessions, shifting from a focused to a relaxed state—an aspect absent in inexperienced drivers. These findings enhance our comprehension of the intricate interaction among drivers' emotional states, age, experience, and driving abilities, consequently opening avenues for tailored interventions and training initiatives focused on improving road safety.",1369-8478,Not found

Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to organize data, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was further used to perform hypotheses testing and effect analysis. The results indicated that PS, Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), and Perceived Usefulness (PU) exert direct effects on use intention. PS and PEU also exerted indirect effects use intention through PU, and the total and indirect effects of PS were found to be greater than those of PEU, which validates the significant influence of PS in TAM.

Using evidence from two representative online panel surveys, comprising over 2,400 New Jersey residents, we analyze bicycle ownership, purchasing, usage during the pandemic and intention to use after the pandemic subsides. We estimate multivariate models and find that the odds that a respondent intends to cycle more in the future (compared to prior to the pandemic) are 4.5 times higher if they have noticed positive changes to their neighborhood during the pandemic. Moreover, the odds that a respondent intends to cycle more are two times higher if they worked from home, compared to working outside the home. Our findings suggest that infrastructure changes successfully induced cycling during the pandemic and increased the intention to cycle in the future. Additionally, because the uptake in cycling has been larger for people who work from home, we highlight the importance of focusing on bicycle infrastructure related to recreation and exercise, in addition to commuting.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors that predict hazard perception in older adult road-users: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.008,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Background: Older adults are more likely to be at-fault and killed in road crashes, and this has been argued to be due to their declining hazard perception (HP). There has been no comprehensive review on what factors predict this decline in HP ability for older adults. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review is to identify any predictors of HP in older adults across all road-user types. Data Sources: The search was indexed in the Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus during January 2022. Studies had to be peer reviewed and written in English language. Participants had to be road-users over the age of 60. Studies had to investigate a relationship between a predictor and HP. Results: 21 articles met the inclusion criteria, 20 for drivers and one for pedestrians. Seven predictors were examined. Results suggested that driving experience and auditory distraction were the most consistent predictors of HP. HP training for drivers significantly improved HP. Results were mixed for visual abilities, cognitive abilities, and age. Training for pedestrians was not a significant predictor of HP. Limitations: Grey literature was not reviewed. Conclusions: Whilst results related to age were mixed, most studies suggested that advancing age is associated with HP decline. Driving experience appeared to be a protective factor against decline in HP. Contrast and motion sensitivity may be important in identifying at-risk drivers. Cognitive function was not a consistent predictor of HP. Auditory distractors consistently negatively impacted HP. Results indicated that there could be potential benefits of HP training. There is a dearth of research into HP in vulnerable road user types. Implications: By identifying the predictors of HP, road safety strategies such as holistic training programs could be developed to assist with keeping older adult road-users safe. Future research is necessary to explore HP in older pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.",1369-8478,Not found

Despite their high energy efficiency, the utilisation of these vehicles remains largely underexplored due to several factors. One of the prominent factors is the phenomenon of range anxiety (RA). This review aims to provide an overview of the range anxiety phenomenon, identifying its primary influencing variables and strategies for mitigating it. The review places particular emphasis on the methodologies and tools employed for assessing range anxiety and related factors. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and APA PsycInfo, using the following keywords: “range” AND (“stress” OR “anxiety”) AND ALL (“electric” AND “vehicle”). The protocol was registered with OSF, registration number is https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FN4VW. The articles were selected by two independent authors. The methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. A total of 17 studies were included in the systematic review. Studies were analysed by sample size, conceptual framework, assessment method and results. The findings highlight that an approach grounded in Human-Factors principles and psychological metrics can significantly contribute to addressing range anxiety. More, individual (level of experience, self-efficacy, threatening perceptions, attitude, technology commitment and personality) and interface features (range estimation, State of Charge, adaptability, GPS, charging points map, road information) have a role in influencing the EV usage and the onset of RA. Among the commonly employed methods for assessing range anxiety were questionnaires (PASA), scenario-based analyses, and behavioral observations (including facial expression and gaze analysis). This review shows that the best solution to reduce the range anxiety may be to design improvements that minimize alterations to lifestyle and behaviour in comparison to the traditional vehicle. The most effective approach for mitigating range anxiety might involve designing improvements that minimise disruptions to lifestyle and behaviours when compared to traditional vehicles. As a novel contribution, this research presents a diagram illustrating the significant relationships between range anxiety and individual, socio-technical, and Human-Factors variables.",1369-8478,Not found
A comparison of pedestrian behavior in interactions with autonomous and human-driven vehicles: An extreme value theory approach,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.006,99,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technologies are expected to result in significant safety and mobility benefits to the road system. However, one of the most important issues that autonomous vehicle technology faces is ensuring safe interactions with active road users such as pedestrians who can have unpredictable behavior. Moreover, road user behavior varies considerably across different traffic environments, which might represent a challenge to implementing AVs as they lack the intuition common in human-driven vehicles (HDV). This study proposes an approach to evaluate crash risk in vehicle–pedestrian interactions. An Extreme Value Theory (EVT) Peak Over Threshold (POT) model is used to compare the crash risk of AV-pedestrian and HDV-pedestrian interactions in four different cities, namely Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, and Singapore. A Bayesian hierarchical structure is used to incorporate the effect of several behavioral covariates, which enables estimating the crash risk of each interaction. Results show that the risk varies considerably depending on the type of interaction and the environment. For example, the impact of behavioral covariates (i.e., minimum distance between road users and maximum pedestrian speed) on the risk of AV-pedestrian interactions is greater when compared to the risk of HDV-pedestrian interactions in Boston, Las Vegas, and Singapore. This might indicate that, in busy and congested environments, road users may not be entirely comfortable with the presence of AVs. In addition, Singapore presented a higher percentage of riskier AV-pedestrian interactions when compared to the other cities. Finally, this study offers significant insights into the challenges of introducing AVs in diverse environments as behavior plays a crucial role in traffic and can influence conflict occurrence.",1369-8478,Not found
Impact of roadside advertisements near traffic signs on driving safety,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.028,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"A common distraction that affects drivers on the road is billboards. It can substantially impact how well drivers manage their speed, maintain their lanes, focus their attention, and react to stressful situations. When the billboards are placed next to vital traffic signs, they negatively affect drivers, impairing their ability to recognize these signs visually and, more significantly, altering their driving behavior. In this case, the impact of billboards on drivers is mainly influenced by two critical factors: billboard size and relative position to the traffic signs. In this study, a driving simulator was used to study the influence of these two factors on drivers. For this purpose, the eye movement, EEG and driving behavior data of drivers under different combinations of these two factors were collected. The data were analyzed and comprehensively evaluated using a two-factor repeated measure variance analysis and matter-element model. The results provided three main conclusions. First, the driver's ability to recognize signs and driving behavior are significantly influenced by the size of the billboard, and the impact is higher the smaller the billboard is. Second, the relative anteroposterior position of the billboard and the signboard significantly affects how people recognize signs and behave while driving. The driver was more affected by the billboard's placement in front of the signboard. Third, the drivers were impacted by the billboard size and relative anteroposterior position between signs and billboards. However, the influence of the relative anteroposterior position was more than that of the size. Based on the study's findings, some guidelines for billboards to avoid accidents in the actual world can be developed. First, when positioning billboards around significant signs, every attempt should be made to put the billboard behind the sign so that the driver may first finish identifying the sign. Second, to minimize the impact on drivers, a large billboard (8 m x 24 m), placed as far away from the sign, should be used wherever possible. Finally, it is vital to develop uniform regulations and norms for the size standards of billboards in various settings due to the vast variations in billboard sizes used in China.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessing the effectiveness of autism spectrum disorder roadway warning signs: A case study in New Jersey,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.006,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the prevalence rate for children identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in New Jersey is 1 in 35 children, the second highest rate of ASD diagnosis in the country. Children with autism face numerous obstacles, including learning road safety and interacting with road elements that could raise the risk of their traffic crash involvement. Many agencies across the nation have used disability warning signs as a tool to eliminate such risks. However, the effectiveness of these signs has not been explored yet. This study assesses the effectiveness of specific disability warning signs for autism at multiple locations in New Jersey using video and speed data. To investigate all drivers' responses to the ASD warning signs, the study defined two proxies of following the speed limit and applying brakes to show caution, where the events that did not correspond with the defined proxies were recorded as non-compliance events. Additionally, the Mann-Whitney U test was employed to evaluate the effectiveness during the presence and absence of ASD sign. Study results showed a high rate of non-compliance events for both proxies, and no significant difference in the driving speed was observed during the presence and absence of ASD sign. Additionally, the estimated relative risk/rate ratio revealed that the drivers that did not follow the speed limit were 1.5 times more likely not to apply brakes than the drivers who followed the speed limit, representing careless driving behavior in the area with ASD individuals.",1369-8478,Not found
Monitoring driver drowsiness in partially automated vehicles: Added value from combining postural and physiological indicators,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.010,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Drowsiness at the wheel is one of the leading causes of road fatalities. Driver monitoring systems (DMS) mainly rely on vehicle-based data and drivers’ facial information to detect drowsiness. However, the introduction of partially autonomous driving will change the way we drive, letting the vehicle manage the driving task while drivers may be free to engage in non-driving tasks. This calls for new ways of detecting drowsiness, and even sleeping, at the wheel. Here, 22 participants drove for 100 min in a static simulator under level-2 automation on a 2 × 2 motorway. Postural (i.e., pressure and movements) and physiological (i.e., cardiac and respiratory) indicators were continuously recorded, while PERCLOS70 was used to classify drowsiness. The results reveal different physiological and postural signatures for the different states of drowsiness defined. While slight drowsiness is mainly associated with a higher heart rate, slower breathing, and an increased number of movements on the seat, being asleep is characterized by a lower heart rate and a slouched position on the seat. This study points to the relevance of using postural indicators in combination with physiological data to detect driver drowsiness. Focusing on the partially automated vehicle, it explores not only resistance to drowsiness but also sleeping at the wheel.",1369-8478,Not found
Why drivers use in-vehicle technology: The role of basic psychological needs and motivation,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.014,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"With a growing amount of assistance and infotainment systems, drivers’ experiences are increasingly affected by in-vehicle technology. Accordingly, to enhance drivers’ well-being, the technology should be designed in an enjoyable and safe way with the central goal to provide a positive user experience (UX). To enhance the understanding of the role of psychological needs and motivations in the UX process, the present study investigated which psychological needs are present in driver-vehicle interaction today, how needs are satisfied for different technology types, and how needs are associated with motivation, UX, and acceptance. Therefore, an online study was conducted examining positive and negative experiences with in-vehicle technology (N = 399). Study results revealed that need satisfaction differs for assistance, infotainment, and navigation systems with an increased need satisfaction for positive experiences. In an exploratory bi-factor model of general and specific need satisfaction, associations with motivation, UX, the intention to use, and positive affect were explored in a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. The results highlight that especially the needs for autonomy, system relatedness, relatedness, and competence are associated with the acceptance of in-vehicle technology. Overall, the findings provide insights into the psychological process of technology acceptance while practical implications for the design of in-vehicle technology can be derived.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the determinants of intention to purchase electric Motorcycles: The role of national culture in the UTAUT,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.012,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Migration to electric motorcycles is urgent to reduce air pollution and prevent climate change. However, the adoption rate of electric motorcycles in Indonesia remains very low compared to the number of conventional motorcycles. This study aims to explore the determinants affecting the purchase intention of electric motorcycles. Because every country has a different culture, the key contribution of our research is developing a model to investigate the purchase intention by integrating national culture into the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This study also investigates the direct and indirect effects of national cultural constructs such as power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, masculinity, and long-term orientation on purchase intention. This study used a survey and a non-probability method, especially convenience sampling, and obtained 936 valid responses. This study used the confirmatory factor analysis to analyze the construct validity and reliability and the partial least square–structural equation model to test its hypotheses. The results showed that the model could explain 63.6% of the variance in the purchase intention of electric motorcycles. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, power distance, and long-term orientation significantly affected purchase intention, while uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and masculinity were insignificant. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence were found to mediate the relationship between national culture and the purchase intention of electric motorcycles. The study provides better suggestions to manufacturers and the Government to make more efficient planning and policies by considering the factors influencing purchase intentions.",1369-8478,Not found
Moving around with an anxiety disorder,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.005,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"People with anxiety disorders may encounter anxiety triggers when (planning to) travel(ing) to a destination, affecting their ability to actively participate in society. Using a Multiple Case Study Design, this paper aims to improve our knowledge on mobility-related problems experienced by people with anxiety disorders and their potential impact on these people’s daily life. In-depth interviews were held with 40 Dutch adults officially diagnosed with anxiety disorders by professionals in the field of psychology. Data revealed that most interviewees experience a mix of problems in using various transport modes. Interviewees often experience the feeling of being locked up and not being able to escape as anxiety triggers. They perceive the mobility system as complex and overwhelming, while mobility-related information can trigger panic attacks or lower respondents’ stress level. Interviewees employ a variety of coping mechanisms: avoidance of transport modes; avoidance of highways, bridges, tunnels; remaining in a familiar, predictable environment; asking for social support when travel is necessary; and searching for adequate travel information to use before and during travel. Coping with anxiety disorders and mobility-related problems may have far-reaching impacts on professional life, including job switching and job relocation. The study shows that it is challenging to define the boundaries of the topic under study and almost impossible to develop a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to alleviate this population’s problems. We end with directions for further research into transport interventions that could benefit people with anxiety disorders.",1369-8478,Not found
Behavioural interventions designed to increase commuter cycling: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.020,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The societal reliance on motorised transport is negatively affecting the health of humans and the environment. Active travel provides a unique solution to both issues by removing the number of motorised vehicles on the road, while also increasing physical activity rates. Interventions that encourage greater uptake of active travel are considered to be highly beneficial to society. This systematic review of the literature sought to provide evidence to answer the question which behavioural interventions increase commuter cycling? Five databases were searched to identify articles that tested a behavioural intervention to increase commuter cycling. Article parameters were defined from the literature and in consultation with the research team. Study selection, quality appraisal and data extraction were undertaken using Covidence. The final 25 articles revealed that personalised travel plans and mobile phone-based platforms were the most common interventions. Unvalidated travel surveys were the most widely used mode of data collection. Modest increases in commuter cycling were observed across studies; however, the heterogeneity of study designs and reporting of results did not allow aggregation of findings. This review highlights the need for high quality behavioural science research into active travel. This will assist us to better understand the most effective interventions that increase levels of commuter cycling, subsequently improving environmental and human health.",1369-8478,Not found
Building a less intimidating cycling environment for women: A structural equation modeling analysis based on a VR-based laboratory experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.001,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Background Security perception significantly affects women's intention to use bikes. This area is under-researched in a context where female cyclists face harassment in a setting of low- or middle-Income countries. Objectives This study aims to contribute to understanding the determinants of security perception as a latent construct by establishing the relationship between perceived security, individual attributes, and built environment features. Methods (i) Participants: a total of 208 women in Tehran participated in a laboratory-like experiment (age ranging from 18 to 42 years [M = 28.8 ± 14.15], 63 % with a household having at least one bike, 75 % never use a bike for daily trips, and 67 % are without any experience of harassment and insecurity). (ii) Apparatus: a two-degree-of-freedom VR-based bicycle simulator comprising sixteen scenarios that combine various states of built environment factors is employed. (iii) Procedure: the test consists of several stages. The experiment for each participant took an average of 26 min. The experiments were conducted over 50 days. (iv) Modeling: a structural equation model (SEM) was developed and estimated using the partial least squares technique. Findings Informal surveillance (i.e., people's presence) is the most important determinant of perceived security. The second most important factor is evidence of incivility (trash in the streets, abandoned cars, damaged urban furniture, graffiti, etc.). The third noteworthy factor is the type of built environment, such as obstacles, vegetation, and underpasses. Contrary to expectations and paradoxically, official surveillance by police forces has a minor impact on women's perceived security. It is a phenomenon in theocratic societies, where the government enforces severe legal constraints against women. The least influencing but still statistically significant factor is lighting conditions. Practical implications Several solutions for increasing the perception of security for female cyclists, especially for new projects, are proposed. We also offered and partially presented the development of a spatiotemporal performance dashboard based on the time-varying perceived security index.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring perceptions of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in older drivers with age-related declines,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.006,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Perceptions of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) were explored in two semi-structured face-to-face focus group studies of 42 older drivers (aged 65 years and older) with and without age-related declines. Study 1 explored perceptions regarding ADAS, focusing on visual, auditory, physical, and cognitive factors. Study 2 extended this by additionally exploring perceptions following exposure to videos and stationary vehicle demonstrations of an ADAS. Participants had a range of visual, hearing, memory, and health characteristics which impacted on their daily life. In both studies, some participants had insights regarding various ADAS technologies prior to the study, but many were unfamiliar with these systems. Nevertheless, overall, participants reported that ADAS would assist them to drive as they age and increase their mobility and independence. There were comments regarding the benefits of warning alerts, although the potential for them to be distracting was also highlighted. Participants with vision impairment preferred audio alerts and participants with hearing impairment preferred visual display alerts. Findings highlighted the potential for ADAS to assist those with age-related declines and the need to increase the flexibility of warning system alerts to suit the varying requirements of older drivers, as well as to reduce the complexity of vehicle interfaces. Collectively, these strategies would maximize the benefits of these vehicles to increase the mobility, independence, and quality of life of older drivers with and without age-related declines.",1369-8478,Not found
Narrow passage interactions: A UK-based exploratory survey study to identify factors affecting driver decision-making,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.009,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Narrow passage interactions have received increased attention from academics seeking to create behavioural models of the interaction and those looking to define how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should interact with their human counterparts in a composite road system. Despite this increased attention, many factors remain unexplored in the narrow passage literature, with the literature also encompassing few driving culture contexts. To this end, this study employs an explorative survey to identify additional factors that affect driver decision-making during narrow passage interactions, as well as driver perceptions of different communications in a UK context. The study’s 243 participants were presented with a range of different narrow passage scenarios and asked to indicate how likely they were to give way/yield to a vehicle approaching the narrow passage from the opposite direction. In addition, they also completed the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory to identify their driving styles and asked to identify which signals they look for from their interaction partner during narrow passage interactions, as well as the meaning of those signals. The results of the study show that situational characteristics such as the vehicle type being interacted with, being in a rush and being followed by vehicles alter the likelihood of drivers giving way at narrow passages, whilst a person’s driving style can also indicate how likely someone is to give way to another vehicle. These results highlight the factors that are considered by drivers, increasing our understanding of the factors that need to be incorporated in driver behaviour models and in AV development.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors influencing the user behaviour of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs): A systematic literature review,10.1016/j.trf.2023.10.027,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The emergence of autonomous driving technologies will transform mobility in the future. Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are crucial elements of sustainable future mobility concepts because they are expected to have a positive impact on urban mobility, infrastructure, travel behaviour and the environment. Driven by the necessity for sustainable mobility concepts and the prospect of accelerated shared usage instead of private ownership, research on the factors influencing user behaviour (e.g., intention and willingness to use, adoption) has increased. However, knowledge in the emerging field of SAVs is still unstructured and the lack of synthesis diminishes the ability to predict user behaviour and use this knowledge to develop improved mobility concepts. In order to lay the foundation in this area and to enable the integration of new knowledge with the wider literature, this paper aims to investigate and identify factors that influence the behavioural intention to use SAVs by conducting a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines. The review aggregates 61 factors influencing willingness and intention to use SAVs, which are grouped into three main categories (user-related factors, service-related factors, time- and weather-related factors). Finally, the review identifies several neglected factors and derives avenues for future research.",1369-8478,Not found
Applying constructivism in driving teacher education: Analysis based on transcripts of videotaped lessons,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.004,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Modern learning focuses heavily on theory and ideals, offering scant practical guidance on execution and outcome evaluation. This research paper aims to show that the integration, in 2018, of a contemporary educational approach into the driving teacher training program at Tallinn University, Estonia, with specific implementation and evaluation criteria, changes actual teaching behavior towards constructivist principles. This approach involved a change in which students began video recording their driving lessons and transcribing them using a web-based speech recognition tool while following specific instructions. This process allowed for feedback and self-analysis throughout the learning process. The study analyzed 145 videotaped driving lessons, which were submitted as final examinations in the driving teacher training curriculum at Tallinn University Haapsalu College between 2017 and 2021. The natural quasiexperimental study compared transcripts of recordings (N = 145; 115 males) before (n = 38) and after (n = 107) the methodology change. The findings reveal a significant increase in the implementation of constructivist principles within the lessons after methodology change in 2018: lesson objectives and evaluation criteria were formulated more often, leading to an increase in open-ended inquiries and a higher prevalence of feedback and analysis. Additional pilot analysis of data from 11 driving teacher certificate renewers in a brief education program supported the efficacy of revised approach: the exam lesson recordings exhibited significantly more constructivist elements compared to the initial stage of the program. There were variations in the length of training both pre and post methodology change. While longer training displayed more constructivist elements, the impact of the methodology shift was notably more pronounced. In summary, the utilization of specific expectations, evaluation criteria and assessment tool in the driving teacher training program promotes a shift in which graduating teachers independently use more constructivist and learning-centered methodology. This approach has the potential to shape more responsible drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Using naturalistic and driving simulator data to model driver responses to unintentional lane departures,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.021,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Unintentional lane departures on straight roads cause many road fatalities each year. The objective of this study was to explore and model drivers’ recovery steering maneuvers in unintentional drift situations, to enable the prospective safety benefit assessment of lane departure warning and avoidance systems through counterfactual simulations. The timing and amplitude of the steering adjustments drivers make to avoid lane departure were studied over three data sets with different origins, consisting of both naturalistic data and experimental data from a driving simulator study. With respect to timing, the main finding was that visually distracted drivers often initiate the corrective steering response prior to looking back towards the road, demonstrating that lane-keeping information in the visual periphery is sufficient to trigger the response. As for steering amplitude, the observed amplitudes were correlated against different lane departure risk metrics from the literature, resulting in a model capable of accounting for human behavior across all three data sets with good performance. Surprisingly, a very simple model (which describes the steering amplitude as increasing quadratically with the vehicle’s orientation to the road) predicted the amplitude of the primary corrective steering adjustment better than models based on more complex lane departure risk metrics. This result indicates that drivers scale the amplitude of their steering adjustment to the steering input needed to get the vehicle back in the lane already at first response. However, it was possible to obtain a similar model fit using a more complex threshold model, with different dynamics depending on the vehicle’s current orientation to the road. We discuss how these findings can be applied to models of human steering for safety benefit assessment.",1369-8478,Not found
Close passes caught on camera – How knowledge and behavioural norms relate to perceptions of liability when cars overtake cyclists,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.002,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Replacing motor vehicle journeys with travel by foot and bicycle is recognised as a means to help achieve a range of health, environmental and economic objectives. Close passes - where a motor vehicle overtakes a cyclist with a minimal lateral clearance - have been identified as both a prominent safety concern and a barrier to increased uptake of cycling. Close passes are the most common type of on-road incident experienced by cyclists where a motor vehicle is involved and are also associated with collisions resulting in deaths and serious injuries. The current study builds on existing research investigating the underlying causes of close passes by examining responses from a sample of drivers to videos of close passes that were submitted by cyclists as driving complaints to an English county Police force. An online survey recorded the opinions of UK drivers (n = 293) on the behaviour of the cyclist and driver featured in each of 8 video clips. The survey recorded participants’ road use habits including the range of driving purposes engaged in (“driverXP”), their self-defined identity on a driver-cyclist spectrum, and their knowledge of recommended practice for bicycle road positioning. It also included the ‘Driving Anger eXpression’ (DAX) scale, which scores tendencies towards different forms of anger expression while driving, including use of vehicle manoeuvres to express anger (“vehicleDAX”). Multiple regressions were used to determine the relationship between these independent variables, and participants’ assessment of how risky the overtake was, and the extent to which the driver or cyclist were seen as liable for what happened. The level of liability apportioned to the cyclists featured in the clips was higher from drivers who were not cyclists themselves, compared with those who did cycle, and from drivers who scored higher on the vehicleDAX and driverXP measures (Identifies as cyclist τ = -0.377, p <.01), (driverXP τ = 0.209, p <.01), (vehicleDAX τ = 0.113, p <.05). Drivers with higher vehicleDAX scores showed lower levels of agreement with the statement “the incident was dangerous” in relation to the close pass clips. The liability apportioned to the cyclists featured was mediated by the drivers’ cycling positional knowledge score (ΔR2 = 0.139, p <.001). This is the first time that naturalistic footage reported by cyclists to Police has been used to examine differing perceptions of the same close pass event. Findings show a need to share knowledge about cycling practice in order to help drivers navigate cycle traffic safely and considerately. This can inform road safety interventions that can contribute to safer cycling and driver behaviours that are more welcoming to existing and potential cyclists.",1369-8478,Not found
A methodology for setting credible speed limits based on numerical analyses and driving simulator experiments,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.008,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Speed management is an integral part of the Safe System approach and tackling unsafe speeds is the first action to fix a transport system that fails to protect people. There is a consensus that where traffic speeds are a safety issue, lowering the speed limit is considered “reasonable and safe” for conditions. Nevertheless, not only should a speed limit be reasonable and safe, but it should also be credible. Otherwise, that posted speed limit is likely to be ignored. In many instances, speed limits are not credible and highway agencies still need guidance on appropriate procedures to set credible speed limits. The main objective of this study is to propose and test a novel methodology to set credible speed limits, based on the integration of the results achieved by numerical analyses and driving simulator experiments. The proposed methodology is innovative since it takes into consideration both the design characteristics of the road infrastructure according to a specific procedure as well as the drivers’ operating speeds, which are evaluated using the results of both speed prediction models and driving simulator experiments. The methodology was tested to set new speed limits on the A16 Naples–Canosa motorway, section Baiano–Candela, in southern Italy, where a posted speed limit of 80 km/h is installed in both travel directions and a new speed limit of 100 km/h is proposed, based on the results of the experiments developed within the methodology. Since the speed limit selection is associated with the expected crash frequency, the final selection of the speed limit should take into account also a safety impact assessment, considering both the expected change in the speed distribution as well as the effects of the safety countermeasures implemented in association to the speed limit change. In this study, the proposed safety countermeasures are the activation of four sections with point-to-point speed control and targeted measures at 45 curves, consisting of (1) high friction surface treatments, (2) correction of superelevation deficiencies, (3) installation of curve warning signs, chevrons, and sequential flashing beacons, and (4) shoulder rumble strips. The safety impact assessment shows that the increase in the speed limit combined with the implementation of the proposed safety countermeasures allows a crash reduction of 23%. The estimated benefit/cost ratio of the safety countermeasures is 4.66.",1369-8478,Not found
Analysis of factors influencing aberrant riding behavior of food delivery riders: A perspective on safety attitude and risk perception,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.007,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This study aims to find the influences of safety knowledge on food delivery riders’ aberrant riding behaviors and to discover the involvement of safety attitudes and risk perceptions in the influence process. The popularity of e-bikes and the development of the food delivery industry have jointly contributed to the growth of the population of food delivery riders, and the aberrant riding behavior of food delivery riders has become a social issue. In this study, the relationship between safety knowledge level and different aberrant riding behaviors was investigated along with the mediation effects of safety attitudes and risk perceptions. In total, 435 questionnaires were collected in a small city in China. Three factors of aberrant riding behaviors and five other factors were obtained through factor analysis, and the path coefficients between the factors were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Food delivery riders’ high self-evaluation of their safety knowledge was found to be significantly associated with their fewer aberrant riding behaviors, which were mediated by their higher risk severity perceptions and better attitudes toward laws, with general violations of traffic rules being the most strongly associated. In addition, particular findings were found on food delivery riders’ risk perception of possibility and influence paths to their distraction and mistakes. These results encourage the mitigation of aberrant riding behaviors among delivery riders through road safety education. They also provide theoretical support for road safety administrators and delivery platform companies to initiate driver safety training.",1369-8478,Not found
“Did you fall asleep?” – Younger and older drivers’ recollection of prior sleepiness while driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.001,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Determining causality and driver culpability in fall asleep crashes requires extensive forensic examination, with post-crash interviews forming a critical part of the process. To date, there is no evidence regarding whether drivers’ recollection of sleepiness and associated symptoms accurately reflects driving impairment during an earlier drive. To address this, our study examined whether established questionnaires assessing sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) and sleepiness symptoms (Sleepiness Symptoms Questionnaire) taken post-drive accurately reflected earlier driving impairment as characterised by near-crash events and lane deviations during a closed loop track drive. Sixteen younger (21–33 years) and seventeen older (50–65 years) drivers completed two 2 h afternoon track drives under supervision of a licensed driving instructor under two conditions: well rested (8 h sleep opportunity) and sleep deprived (0 h sleep). For younger drivers, all sleepiness symptoms (except mind wandering) significantly predicted prior severe (near-crashes AUC 0.78–1.00) and moderate (lane deviations AUC 0.78–0.94) driving impairment, with good to excellent accuracy. For older drivers, only severe impairment was accurately reflected in post-drive ratings (near crashes AUC 0.86–0.94), and for fewer symptoms (8/9 vs. 6/9). Optimal thresholds for the frequency of these symptoms, in addition to thresholds for minimum acceptable false positives are presented. Our data suggest that post-crash interviews should utilise questions around subjective sleepiness and associated symptoms, providing evidence regarding the presence and awareness of drowsiness while driving, taking into account the reliability of self-report evidence. This may aid in the investigation of fall-asleep crashes where drowsiness is suspected.",1369-8478,Not found
A comparison of glance coding approaches for driver attention assessment,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.003,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Eye tracking is a common tool to assess drivers’ attentional state, either in real-time with the goal to prevent incidents, or offline, to understand underlying processes. While seemingly objective, eye tracking data can be coded and interpreted in different ways, which can have substantial effects on the results. The objective of this paper is to highlight and discuss the possibilities and limitations of three different approaches to code glance data: the direction-based encoding, the target-based approach, and the purpose-based approach. The direction-based coding scheme describes glances relative to the direction of travel. The target-based approach classifies the glance targets into different categories. The purpose-based approach needs additional layers of information to deduce the reason for the glance. This information encompasses road layout, traffic rules, and the presence and relevance of other traffic. Data from a field study with 23 participants driving an instrumented vehicle on an urban route was used to illustrate differences between the three methods. The results showed that the coding approach clearly affected the interpretation of the measured glance data. A purely target-based approach is limited by its inability to account for spare visual capacity and that also the absence of a target constitutes valuable information, and a purely direction-based approach does not account for the need to scan areas located off forward. The purpose-based approach requires contextual information that can be cumbersome to integrate. Regardless of the approach used, additional layers of contextual information increase understanding and interpretability, potentially at the cost of increased complexity. The three approaches are suitable for different contexts and their feasibility also depends on the availability of additional data. A key message is that context awareness improves the accuracy of driver attention monitoring and inattention identification.",1369-8478,Not found
Remote driving as the Failsafe: Qualitative investigation of Users’ perceptions and requirements towards the 5G-enabled Level 4 automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.018,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The Level 4 Automated Vehicles (L4 AV) potentially deliver social, economic, safety and environmental benefits. A key feature for the L4 AV is the failsafe mechanism which ensures the safety of the vehicle without human driver input when reaching system limitations. An important solution for the failsafe is the 5G-enabled teleoperation system controlled by a remote driver. However, understanding end-users’ perception, needs and requirements towards the L4 AV is a significant under-researched area. To fill the research gap, this study conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 potential end-users to qualitatively explore the new driver-automation-remote driver interaction in the L4 AV. Results showed that end-users would like to understand how the remote driver operates the vehicle remotely and would not expect them to be multitasking or distracted. They also show that remote drivers’ sensing and information about the driving environment are important. Remote drivers should also be qualified and experienced drivers and must have undergone background security checks before teleoperating the L4 AV. They require remote drivers based in the same country as the L4 AV to prevent issues such as unfamiliar road layouts, different traffic rules, cultural driving style variations, liability concerns, and time differences from affecting performance. They require the remote drivers to clarify what had happened and explain how they will deal with the situation and operate the vehicle in the situation of failsafe in the L4 AV. Dedicated remote drivers are preferred over random ones. A review and feedback system is important for the end-users to evaluate the services and choose preferred remote drivers. Finally, end-users are concerned about the liability and legal implications of utilising a L4 AV, especially during the period that the L4 AV is being operated by the remote drivers.",1369-8478,Not found

The problem of regaining manual control of the vehicle after a period of automated control (i.e., take-over) is critical, particularly concerning visual exploration during the transition phase. A driving simulator experiment was designed to investigate the impact of the level of agentivity manipulated by different levels of motor engagement on gaze parameters during the different temporal stages of a non-critical take-over situation (i.e., overtaking collision zone). The level of motor engagement decreased according to the increase in the level of automation; eye tracking data were collected, and gaze distribution over functional areas of interest was analysed across several periods of interest. Results revealed an influence of the degree of motor engagement on the gaze parameters linked to the integration and processing of visual information for a nominal driving period (i.e., automation activated) as well as during the take-over preparation period. During the period of effective resumption of manual control, most of the ocular parameters went back to their initial values, except for the higher motor disengagement modes (i.e., lowest levels of agentivity). These automation levels seem to show a residual influence of take-overs on manual driving, particularly in the ocular exploration of areas carrying the information useful for the fine regulation of the vehicle trajectory.",1369-8478,Not found
Haptic warnings for a motorcycle jacket and gloves,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.017,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The risk of being killed on the road is much higher for riders than for car drivers. Nevertheless, the number of devices or technologies available to assist riders in avoiding risks and road accidents—or the number of Advanced Rider Assistant Systems (ARAS)—is still scarce. In this article, we present and discuss the development and application of two ARAS technologies using haptic interaction to assist riders on the road and increase their safety: an Haptic GPS Glove and a Warning Jacket. To determine the best locations for conveying haptic warnings in these wearables, we conducted a psychophysics experiment in a motorcycle simulator. We employed an up/down staircase method and measured the absolute detection thresholds in six locations in the hand/gloves (right and left palm, back and wrist) and six locations in the jacket (right and left forearms front and back, and shoulder blades). This experiment was conducted on a motorcycle simulator that mimics the vibrations produced by a motorcyclewhile it is running at different levels of intensity. Tests on all locations were run over three conditions: (1) baseline condition, with participants seated at a table with no background vibration; and two conditions with participants seated at the simulator experiencing two levels of background vibration of (2) minimum vibration intensity, and (3) maximum vibration intensity. Overall, our results show that, in the simulator conditions, subjects were better at detecting vibrations applied to locations covered by the jacket as compared to the areas covered by hands/gloves. Specifically, the forearms and shoulder blades emerged as the most effective locations for transmitting haptic warnings to motorcyclists. For the motorcycle gloves, the back of the hand proved to be the optimal location for conveying tactile warnings. We conclude by discussing the applicability of our results in designing future ARAS.",1369-8478,Not found
"Distracted and unfocused driving in supervised and unsupervised teen drivers: Associations with sleep, inattention, and cognitive disengagement syndrome symptoms",10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.013,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Road crashes are a leading cause of death and disability in adolescence. Various factors can contribute to these crashes including overt risk-taking but also distracted, inattentive, and unfocused driving. Adolescent drivers are likely to be more susceptible to these issues if they experience sleep issues or have symptoms associated with inattention (e.g., ADHD) or cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS; formerly termed sluggish cognitive tempo). In this study we surveyed 365 teenage drivers aged 16–18 years living in New Zealand. The survey included measures of distracted and unfocused driving, self-reported sleep issues, inattention and CDS. Smartphone use while driving was significantly associated with sleep issues, inattention and CDS symptoms among teens who drive unsupervised, but not those who only drive under supervision (i.e., Learners), whereas unfocused driving was correlated with inattention, CDS and to a lesser extent sleep issues in both groups. Modelling revealed that daytime sleepiness mediated the association between sleep issues and distracted driving for unsupervised drivers, but not supervised learners. In contrast, both inattention and CDS mediated the association between sleep issues and unfocused driving, and these effects were not moderated by unsupervised driving status. However, unsupervised teen drivers reported significantly higher rates of all forms of aberrant driving behaviour than supervised teens. These results highlight that sleep issues are a key risk factor for distracted and inattentive driving among young drivers, and that inattention and CDS symptoms influence unfocused driving.",1369-8478,Not found
What influences intentions to offend? A systematic review and meta-analysis on the factors associated with the deterrence of drink-driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.015,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Drink driving is a dangerous behaviour that has severe implications for road safety. Despite decades of deterrence initiatives, drink driving remains relatively prevalent, suggesting there may be limitations within current theories used to explain the process of deterrence. In response, this study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on what factors are associated with drink driving intentions (DDI). Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a literature search was performed on six databases. Studies which met the inclusion criteria were correlational by design, contained a variable relating to DDI, and used generalised samples. After an initial screening process, 19 publications met the criteria for the review and 12 for the analyses. The findings showed that the theory of planned behaviour (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, and behavioural control) sufficiently explained DDI, however, deterrence theory (i.e., risk perceptions), which was notably under-researched, revealed more ambiguous relations to DDI. Experiences with offending and avoidance were also shown to be judicious predictors of DDI, although personal punishment appeared to have a negligible impact, potentially due to the attitude of the offender toward sanctions or the low likelihood of occurrence. The review also highlighted several limitations in the current literature. Firstly, further investigation surrounding the dynamics that underlie risk perceptions of drink-driving is required to reduce the current theoretical ambiguity. Secondly, standardised approaches are needed so that research in this area is more valid and comparable. Finally, researchers may consider operating under an integrated and more comprehensive framework, as there is considerable theoretical overlap between current prominent models of offending, and such approaches will better contextualise individual variables.",1369-8478,Not found
“I saw a fox in Melbourne CBD”: Urban travel behaviour changes during COVID-19 and beyond,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.010,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"An unexpected outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic were the dramatic travel behaviour changes experienced in cities worldwide, which, could result in more sustainable transport systems. Consequently, there is a need for longer-term post-pandemic travel behaviour change research. This study aimed to investigate city-level travel behaviour changes during and post-pandemic. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study exploring the permanency of COVID-19 travel behaviour changes. This study involved a literature review of 41 studies and in-depth interviews with 19 transport stakeholders in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne is a valuable study area, given that it was the most locked-down city globally. Overall, the results of this study suggest that post-pandemic travel behaviour will be different to pre-pandemic, with working from home (WFH) an integral influence on travel behaviour. In addition, several overarching travel behaviour changes were identified: WFH significantly increased during the pandemic and is anticipated to continue post-pandemic. Both public transport and private motor vehicle (PMV) trips decreased during lockdowns; while PMV rebounded quickly, public transport remained low, and a long recovery is expected. Active transport (cycling and walking) increased during the pandemic and appear likely to endure. Finally, while shared travel modes have received less attention, modal variance is expected in the future. This study has made several key contributions. It consolidated our understanding of the wide range of urban travel behaviour changes experienced during and anticipated post-COVID-19. Secondly, it synthesised current knowledge of recent post-COVID-19 travel behaviour change research. Thirdly, this study demonstrated that complementary qualitative studies strengthen transport research by unearthing new insight into the reasons underpinning travel behaviours, which could be vital for developing solutions. Furthermore, this study identified critical future research topics. Given that most countries are learning to live with the virus, it is an opportune time to investigate whether these intended travel behaviours have endured.",1369-8478,Not found
"Pedestrian behavior interacting with autonomous vehicles during unmarked midblock multilane crossings: Role of infrastructure design, AV operations and signaling",10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.003,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"One of the main challenges autonomous vehicles (AVs) will face is interacting with pedestrians, especially at unmarked midblock locations where the right-of-way is unspecified. This study investigates pedestrians' crossing behavior given different roadway centerline features (i.e., undivided, two-way left-turn lane, and median) and various AV operational schemes portrayed to pedestrians through on-vehicle signals (i.e., no signal, yellow negotiating indication, and yellow/blue negotiating/no-yield indications). This study employs virtual reality (VR) to simulate an urban unmarked midblock environment where pedestrians interact with AVs as they cross a four-lane arterial roadway. Results demonstrate that both roadway centerline design features and AV operations and signaling significantly impact pedestrians' unmarked midblock crossing behavior, including the waiting time at the curb, waiting time in the middle of the road, and the total crossing time. But only the roadway centerline design features significantly impact the walking time. Participants in the undivided scene spent a longer time waiting at the curb and walking on the road than in the median and TWLTL scenes, but they spent a shorter time waiting in the middle of the road. Compared to the AV without a signal, the design of yellow signal significantly reduced pedestrian waiting time at the curb and in the middle. But yellow/blue signals significantly increased the pedestrian waiting time. Interaction effects between roadway centerline design features and AV operations and signaling are significant only for waiting time in the middle of the road. Other factors, such as demographics, past behaviors, and walking exposure of pedestrians, are also explored. Results indicate that older individuals tend to wait longer before making crossing decisions, and pedestrians’ past crossing behaviors and past walking exposures do not significantly impact pedestrian walking behavior interacting with AV.",1369-8478,Not found
A qualitative study on transportation experiences of public transport users in Türkiye during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.009,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, people refrained from crowded places; public transport is one of them. The need for movement was restricted as part of governmental precautions. However, some people continue to go to workplaces as usual, and the ones who do not have personal vehicles continue using public transportation. The current study aims to investigate the experiences of public transport users (i.e., passengers) in Türkiye during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten people living in Ankara. As a result of thematic analysis, four overarching themes and fifteen sub-themes were determined. These overarching themes include changes in travel behavior during COVID-19, factors influencing transportation preferences, suggestions for better planning of public transport services, and suggestions for better crisis management. The results suggest significant policy implications at the municipal and governmental level, emphasizing the need for transparent risk communication, timely measures, and enforcement. Additionally, the study highlights transportation inequity, which becomes visible after the pandemic. We believe that qualitative data provided valuable insight to road authorities about road users' transportation experiences during the pandemic and, thus, how to manage better the pandemic's effect on the transport system based on the mobility needs of the citizens. We hope the results could benefit road authorities in developing effective policies and plans for all countries in the world, especially for the ones having a specific need to improve safety in traffic settings.",1369-8478,Not found

This study confirmed that reasons for (against) adoption of technology are also important determinants of the intention to use AVs with the moderating effect of social influence on technological readiness and reasons for (against) adoption AVs are also investigated. Thus, this research adds to the existing literature on AVs adoption by establishing the important roles of consumers’ technological readiness and social influence through their behavioral reasoning processes.

How crowding impedance affected travellers on public transport in the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.008,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behaviour has changed significantly. Governors have introduced different transport policies to maintain the travel demand in the public transport system. Previous studies have developed the measurement of crowding impedance on public transport to determine the degree of transit use and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explores the behavioural differences in crowding impedance to provide transport policies incorporating group segmentations. The D-efficient design process has structured a survey with a reasonable choice set, and questionnaires have been provided to identify the attitudinal groups of travellers effectively. The travellers are divided into four groups according to the values of factor loadings from the factor analysis: i.e., fear of disease, transit preference, time sensitivity, and auto preference. Multinomial logit models explore the behavioural differences in route and mode choices and calculate crowding multipliers. The results show that the group with a fear of disease comprises a high proportion of the elderly owing to their reluctance to expose themselves to infectious diseases; furthermore, the time-sensitive group exhibits less crowding impedance on public transport. Thus, the crowding multipliers differ between the groups and influence the relevant transport policies to promote public transport use. Policymakers are encouraged to introduce customized transport policies depending on the requirements of each group of travellers to cope with the adverse effects of the pandemic.",1369-8478,Not found
"Exploring the occupational fatigue risk of short-haul truck drivers: Effects of sleep pattern, driving task, and time-on-task on driving behavior and eye-motion metrics",10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.012,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Driver fatigue is the leading cause of truck-related accidents. The most significant occupational fatigue factors among short-haul truck drivers are sleep patterns, the round-trip driving task, and the time-on-task. However, the underlying mechanisms of these influential factors remain unclear. This study aims to explore the interactive effects of sleep patterns, driving task, and time-on-task on driving behavior and eye-motion metrics among short-haul truck drivers. We obtained test data from eleven professional short-haul truck drivers, with each driver participating in a three-day test under the conditions of two driving tasks and three different sleep patterns. We applied three-way repeated-measure ANOVA and non-parametric tests to analyze the data. The results reveal that: (1) violation of sleep-related legal requirements, insufficient sleep, and unreasonable time-on-task can have negative effects on short-haul truck drivers' vigilance and driving performance; (2) both driving task and sleep pattern contribute to driver fatigue, and the interaction of time-on-task and sleep pattern exacerbates driver fatigue more than the effects of any single factor alone; and (3) short-haul truck drivers who are sleep deprived exhibit short periods of controlled compensatory behavior during the outbound task, and sleepiness is more prevalent during the inbound task compared to the outbound task due to the monotony and low workload of the driving process. These findings provide theoretical and practical guidance for transportation industry managers to strengthen company-wide fatigue-related regulations, ensure adequate sleep for drivers via regulations, and optimize work schedules to improve safety outcomes of short-haul truck drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of COVID-19 on transportation-related and risky driving behaviors in Canada,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.011,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most disruptive events in recent history, which resulted in the widespread implementation of unprecedented public health measures (Polisena et al., 2021; De Vos, 2020). The implications of these lockdowns on road safety are not yet fully understood, however, available data have consistently revealed increases in risky driving behaviors despite reductions in traffic volumes (Thomas et al., 2020; Wagner et al., 2020). The objective of the present study was to compare self-reported data on travel modes and risky driving behaviors (speeding, distracted driving, drinking and driving, drugged driving, fatigued driving, and seatbelt use) before and during the pandemic in Canada. Data were collected using the Road Safety Monitor (RSM), an annual online public opinion survey investigating key road safety issues administered to a representative sample of road users. Respondents were asked about the frequency of travel using various modes, use of impairing substances, and frequency of engaging in risky driving during the pandemic, as compared to before the pandemic. Results showed increases in personal vehicle and pedestrian travel, with large declines in public transit use during the pandemic. A significant proportion of respondents reported drinking more alcohol during the pandemic (14.9%) or using more THC-containing cannabis (12.2%). With respect to risky driving behaviors, the results indicated the majority of respondents reported no change in their behavior, and most positively, a small proportion said they less often engaged in risky driving behaviors. However, notable proportions did engage in risky driving behaviors more often during the pandemic as compared to before it. The behaviors mainly reported as occurring with higher frequency during the pandemic were driving when likely over the limit for alcohol (6.6% of respondents) and driving within two hours of using drugs (5.2% of respondents). Logistic regression results showed respondents with preferred pronouns of she/her had lower odds of reporting they were more likely to engage in these risky driving behaviors. Age also had a significant effect, as increasing age was associated with lower odds of reporting that these risky driving behaviors were more likely during the pandemic. Overall, the current findings suggested a small proportion of drivers reported being more likely to engage in risky driving behaviors. However, given the large number of licensed drivers, even small percentages are concerning. The findings have important implications for transportation and public health policies and can inform strategies to reduce road risks during future lockdowns.",1369-8478,Not found
How manoeuvre information via auditory (spatial and beep) and visual UI can enhance trust and acceptance in automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.007,100,2024-01-01,2024,1,"In conditionally automated driving (SAE level 3), drivers may take their eyes off the road but will still need to be ready to take control and will, therefore, benefit from information on automation. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of automation manoeuvre information provided through spatial sound, traditional notification sound (beep), and a visual interface. Spatial sounds were designed differentiating four distinct driving manoeuvres: overtaking a leading car, slowing down, turning right, and passing a roundabout. The notification sound consisted of one beep being identical for all manoeuvres. The visual interface showed the automation mode with an image and manoeuvre information with text and images. The impact of these interfaces on trust, workload, acceptance, situation awareness, and sense of control was evaluated with questionnaires and visual attention was evaluated with eye tracking while participants engaged in a visual-motor secondary task in a driving simulator. The results indicate that, with all interfaces tested, manoeuvre information enhances trust, acceptance, situation awareness, and sense of control, without significantly affecting the overall workload. These benefits were more profound, adding auditory information and differed marginally between the traditional notification and the spatial sound, as the effectiveness of the different auditory interface types varied depending on the specific manoeuvre. Findings highlight the importance of designing user interfaces for automation manoeuvre information using auditory cues to improve the user experience in automated driving.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of COVID-19 on speed behavior in Wisconsin,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.009,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on mobility worldwide, specifically through stay-at-home orders. There is a general consensus in the literature regarding the reduction of traffic during that period, and a trend toward increased speeds. However, the literature is still scarce regarding the pandemic's long-term and site-specific effects on traffic volumes and speed behavior. In this context, the present study looks at speed and traffic volume data, using several temporal and spatial filters to isolate the effect of the pandemic from other elements that can influence speeds, such as congestion, construction, weather, and faulty detector data. Data from Wisconsin for the stay-at-home period in 2020 and corresponding time periods in 2019 and 2021 were used. Traffic volume and speed were analyzed using descriptive and inferential (Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test and Mann Whitney U Test) statistics. While the results for traffic showed the expected reduction in 2020 in relation to other years, speeds also showed a reduction in 2020 for eight of the twelve analyzed locations, most of these rural areas. Furthermore, the results show a return of speeds to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, associated with the partial or complete recovery of traffic volumes.",1369-8478,Not found
Examining expressions of cycling anger in China: Further evidence of the validity and reliability of the Cycling Anger Expression Inventory (CAX),10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.002,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Anger and aggression on the road has been generally considered as one potential contributor to traffic crashes. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding road anger among cyclists, mainly whether cyclists would express road anger in an aggressive method. This study aimed to adapt the Cycling Anger Expression Inventory (CAX) to the Chinese context and to explore road anger expression forms among Chinese cyclists. The CAX was translated into Chinese and administered to a sample of 392 active cyclists to investigate its psychometric properties. The scale was then validated using a different sample of 505 active cyclists by examining its relationship with cyclists’ trait aggression, trait emotional intelligence (EI), cycling anger, cycling violations and crash involvement. The CAX yielded a three-factor solution with 13 items, revealing three primary anger expression forms: adaptive/constructive response, verbal aggression and personal physical aggression. Among the three forms, cyclists primarily dealt with road anger adaptively or constructively, while the frequencies of aggressive expression were relatively low. Male cyclists were more likely to express cycling anger aggressively than females. More adaptive/constructive responses and less aggression were significantly related to a lower level of trait aggression, stronger trait EI, lower cycling anger proneness, and fewer cycling violations. Cyclists’ expressions of road anger did not show significant relationships with age, weekly cycling distance or crash involvement. The Chinese version of the CAX demonstrated satisfactory construct validity and internal consistency reliability. Chinese cyclists’ anger expression pattern was similar to that of Danish and Australian cyclists in the existing literature. The CAX could be used as a valid tool for assessing cycling anger expression and would facilitate the development of effective measures targeting cycling aggression to promote cycling safety in China.",1369-8478,Not found

Previous studies presented mixed results regarding the effects of scenarios on takeover performance. According to drivers' strategies for takeover requests, this study selected eight representative takeover scenarios and categorized them into lane keeping and lane changing scenarios. To investigate the effects of scenario type and road environment (highway vs. urban) on drivers' takeover performance and physiological responses, a driving simulation study was conducted as a mixed design with 40 participants (average age = 22.8 years). The results showed that in lane changing scenarios, with the same sensing capability, drivers on highways had deteriorated takeover performance in the form of harsher takeover maneuvers and higher collision risk, as well as higher arousal and stress, compared to urban areas. However, such effects disappeared or even reversed in lane keeping scenarios on the curves, where drivers on highways had smoother takeover maneuvers and lower arousal and stress. These findings will help us understand the vital roles scenario type and road environment play during takeover transitions.

The bigger the better? Investigating the effects of driving simulator fidelity on driving behavior and perception,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.007,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"There is a wide range of different driving simulator systems, which vary greatly in terms of cost as well as system characteristics. Higher fidelity simulators are often assumed to produce more valid results. While there are many studies that have compared simulator driving to real-world driving, to date there has been no large study comparing different simulator systems to each other and to real-world driving. Aiming at closing this gap, the present research offers an extensive comparison of six different driving simulators with the results of a previous real-world study. In terms of absolute validity, most of the simulators provided good results for distance to a vehicle in front and standard deviation of the lateral position, whereas the results for driving speed were inconsistent. Simulator fidelity appears to positively affect distance perception, although differences between higher fidelity simulators were generally small, and no real-world comparison data were available here. With respect to simulator sickness, a clear advantage of using a high fidelity simulator was found, while the effect size depended on the use case. In summary, the results suggest that different simulators are suitable for different use cases to different degrees, and the differences between simulators are not always related to higher simulator fidelity. The presented study can serve as a basis for understanding simulator requirements associated with different use cases.",1369-8478,Not found
Understanding distracted pedestrians’ risky behaviour: The role of walking and visual characteristics through a field study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.003,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Use of mobile phones while crossing the road has become a growing safety concern among pedestrians. Though recently, some studies have attempted to understand risky behaviour of distracted pedestrians by analyzing impacts of distraction on pedestrians’ walking and visual characteristics, the impacts were measured individually. Moreover, most of the existing findings are based on lab-based experiments, whereas the real-world conditions are quite dynamic in nature. Hence, to overcome these gaps, the current study aims to understand to what extent different potential factors (such as distraction, walking characteristics, visual behaviour, etc.) affect the risk of unsafe pedestrian-vehicle interactions in real-world settings. For this purpose, a field experiment was designed to understand the impact of distraction on pedestrians’ risky behaviour using an eye-tracker at an unsignalized intersection in Delhi. The risk assessment was done using Post-Encroachment Time (PET) measure. The results indicate that the use of mobile phone while crossing the road increased the chances of unsafe (PET < 1.5 s) pedestrian-vehicle interactions by approximately eight folds. Surprisingly, pedestrians who crossed the intersection at high speed had higher chances of unsafe interactions, whereas their increased crossing initiation time reduced the probability of unsafe interactions. Moreover, increased pupil diameter and fixating more on vehicles approaching from the right side resulted in a reduced probability of unsafe interactions. However, the high frequency of saccades and higher fixations on the crosswalk's right side negatively affected unsafe interactions. This study highlights that it is important to consider visual characteristics along with demographic and walking and traffic characteristics as they can provide in-depth insights into pedestrians’ road crossing behaviour that are required to design and implement effective countermeasures and policies.",1369-8478,Not found
Analysis of controversial driving licensing policies in Iran: Experts’ viewpoints,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.015,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Objectives Licensing policies for driving play a vital role in promoting road safety and decreasing road traffic injuries. Although there have been notable improvements in driving licensing policies in recent years, some policies in Iran are still contentious and controversial. This research aims to examine these controversial driving licensing policies in Iran by using the perspectives of Iranian experts and reviewing relevant documents. Methods A variety of research methods were used to conduct the study, including focus group discussions (FGDs) and a review of relevant documents. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, using a diverse and comprehensive approach. To collect documents for review, national websites such as the Iranian Parliament, Traffic Police and the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development were thoroughly searched, while some documents were collected in person. The data was analysed using a thematic approach. Results Over the past decades, certain policy issues have continued to pose significant challenges and controversies. These policies within the Iranian driving system have been divided into three main categories including leadership and responsiveness, driver qualifications and vehicle characteristics, and health assessment procedures and standards. Conclusion The development and implementation of evidence-based policies necessitates the thorough examination and analysis of contentious and complicated policies related to driving licensing, and ultimately contributes to an improved driving experience in Iran.

Thirty-six drivers participated in the experiment, who were classified into the high trait anger (HTA) and low trait anger (LTA) groups. Each driver completed driving tasks in two scenarios under time pressure: with and without multi-stage anger-inducing events, and subjective and physiological data were collected. The scenarios with anger-inducing events led to significantly higher anger intensity, skin conductivity, breathing rate, and pupil diameter. Differences between HTA and LTA drivers during anger were mainly in subjective evaluations rather than physiological responses. The results also showed that the drivers in both groups tended to under-report their own anger intensity. This study provides a new method for inducing driving anger.

Evaluation of a user-accessible countermeasure: Effect of manual dexterity gymnastics on passive driver fatigue,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.012,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Driver fatigue remains a critical concern in the realm of traffic safety. In particular, passive driver fatigue, promoted by prolonged exposure to low-workload driving and boredom, not only poses threats to daily driving but also may compromise the effectiveness of takeover in future autonomous driving. Commonly adopted strategies involve activities that drivers can engage in to awaken their bodies and minds, or in-vehicle interactive systems implemented by manufacturers to alleviate boredom. However, there is currently limited focus given to user-accessible in-vehicle physical activities aimed at addressing passive fatigue. Therefore, this study proposed manual dexterity gymnastics as finger exercises that are conveniently implemented against passive driver fatigue. The finger exercises consisted of tapping the fingertip, pressing nail roots, flicking fingers, pressing the sides of fingertips, and closing and opening the fingers. To evaluate this countermeasure, eighteen participants performed a monotonous driving task using a driving simulator. The driving sessions each lasted 90 min. Each participant drove in two sessions consisting of either manual dexterity gymnastics or watching videos. Passive driver fatigue was assessed by physiological indexes, driving performance analysis, vigilance assessment, and subjective evaluation. The manual dexterity gymnastics significantly suppressed driver fatigue according to the percentage of eyelid closure, blink frequency, and steering reversal rate. Furthermore, vigilance was also improved, and the subjective evaluation showed that fatigue was significantly lower. The experimental results suggested that manual dexterity gymnastics may be regarded as an effective countermeasure to suppress the deterioration of passive driver fatigue.",1369-8478,Not found
Frustration control during driving using auditory false heart rate feedback,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.014,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Drivers' frustration and anger during driving may be causes of aggressive driving, such as road rage, which can lead to accidents. Thus, development of a frustration control method is beneficial for preventing accidents. False heart rate (fHR) feedback is a well-known method that alters feelings or mental states of people by presenting a heart rate (HR) that is faster or slower than their actual HR. In this study, we develop a new method for controlling drivers' frustration based on fHR feedback. In the proposed method, drivers are presented with heartbeat-like sounds with a tempo that is slower than their actual HR during driving. In this study, we performed an experiment using a driving simulator (DS) in order to validate the proposed frustration control method. Fifty healthy volunteers participated in the experiment. They repeated a driving simulation while hearing heartbeat-like sounds and answered questionnaires on mental workload, including frustration. Some participants heard heartbeat-like sounds synchronized with their actual HR, whereas others were presented with heartbeat-like sounds with a tempo that is faster or slower than their actual HR. The experimental results showed that a slower fHR feedback pattern with HR − 20 bpm reduced frustration of participants during driving. The experiment also indicated that the proposed method does not disturb driving because the driving operation of participants were not altered by the presented fHR pattern. The present study provides a new driver-assist technique for controlling frustration during driving and will contribute to realizing a society with safe roads in the future.",1369-8478,Not found
An empirical investigation of driver's eye-catching effect in the entrance zone of freeway tunnels: A naturalistic driving experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.004,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This study aims to evaluate the impact of different visual attraction environments at the entrance zone of freeway tunnels on drivers' visual performance and subjective mental workload. Through a naturalistic driving experiment conducted on actual roads, participants experienced various visual attraction environments at the entrance zones of freeway tunnels. The selected visual environments included baseline, landscape-style architecture, tip slogan, and billboard scenarios. Objective visual performance was assessed using eye-tracking devices to collect participants' eye movement data, while subjective mental workload was evaluated through the NASA-TLX measurement reports administered after the driving experiment. The results indicate that the visual attraction environments at the entrance zone of freeway tunnels have significant impacts on drivers’ visual attention level, cognitive workload, and subjective mental workload. Under the billboard condition, participants exhibited the longest first fixation duration (FFD) and paid the earliest attention to visual attraction (reflected by participants positioned their initial fixation at the visual attraction farthest from the tunnel entrance zone (DFT)). Additionally, the tip slogan condition resulted in the highest mean fixation duration (MFD), the largest percentage of total fixation duration on the visual attraction (PTFD), and the highest cognitive workload (reflected in maximum pupil diameter (PD)). Billboard at the entrance zone of freeway tunnel had the greatest effect on attracting drivers’ visual attention, while tip slogan resulted in the highest cognitive workload on drivers. The results of the subjective mental workload evaluation (NASA-TLX) also indicated that tip slogan had the greatest impact on drivers’ subjective mental workload. This study provides valuable insights into the potential impact of different visual attraction environments at the entrance zone of freeway tunnels on drivers' eye-catching effect. The results contribute to both theoretical knowledge and practical applications in the field of transportation safety.",1369-8478,Not found
More afraid of the virus than of bad weather? Exploring the link between weather conditions and cycling volume in German cities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.016,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Cycling can only unfold its full potential for environmental sustainability, livable cities, and health if people cycle under most seasonal and weather conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people preferred cycling over public transit, in order to avoid infection. This change may also have affected the weather–cycling association: the pandemic mainly attracted new, fair-weather cyclists; and it may have encouraged cyclists to continue cycling, even under less favorable conditions. In this paper, we explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the association between weather and cycling. We analyze data from bicycle counting stations in Germany, combined with city- and hour-specific weather information and a continuous measure of pandemic intensity. The data set contains more than 2.2 million hourly bicycle count observations from 69 counting stations, covering the years 2017–2021. Results from the most transit-oriented cities in the sample, Berlin and Munich suggest that the cycling volume was more dependent on weather conditions at times of high pandemic intensity. This suggests that the pandemic put new people in the saddle, but these additional cyclists were largely fair-weather cyclists who only cycled when the weather was sufficiently nice. For policy, this could set two targets. First, encourage the new pandemic-cyclists to stay on the bike and, second, support them in transitioning into year-round cyclists eventually.",1369-8478,Not found
Visualizing ventilation in the bus: Addressing risk perception in public transport passengers,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.019,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Background This study evaluated the effectiveness of a communicative intervention in addressing passengers’ increased risk perception of getting infected with COVID-19 in public buses and thereby improving travel-related well-being after the pandemic. Method A pre-registered quasi-experimental field-study (N = 306) was conducted in two public bus line bundles. The intervention consisted of visualizing the fresh air supply in the bus via tinsel garlands. Findings The intervention successfully increased passengers’ awareness of fresh air supply in the bus (in the intervention group as compared to the control group; d = 0.25). However, this awareness did neither reduce passengers’ risk perception, nor did it increase their subjective well-being in the bus. An explorative analysis identified crowding, and general COVID-19 risk perception as major predictors of risk perception on-board. Conclusion The study revealed first-hand, real-time insights in bus passengers’ risk perception, travel well-being and their major predictors during the out fading COVID-19 pandemic.",1369-8478,Not found
"Impact of the health crisis, COVID 19, on compliance with safety rules by type of user: Comparative analysis of car drivers and motorcyclists",10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.013,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The aim of this article is to examine the construction of the relationship with rules, their links in individuals throughout their lives and their possible interactions. More precisely, this paper looks at the impact of the health crisis, COVID 19, on compliance with road rules among three categories of road user: car drivers, motorcyclists with a cylinder capacity of no more or more than 125 cm3. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to 4382 car users, motorcyclists with a cylinder ca-pacity of more or no more than 125 cm3. representative of the French population. The results show an effect of both the type of vehicle and the health crisis on the frequency and number of safety rules respected. These results confirm the value of differentiating the road-user population by showing the differences between motorists and motorcyclists, which are not due solely to the mode of travel used. In terms of road safety policy, they show the importance of prevention campaigns targeting different modes of travel, and taking into account the specificities of their users in terms of perception of rules and the factors involved in their observance.",1369-8478,Not found
Can cargo bikes compete with cars? Cargo bike sharing users rate cargo bikes superior on most motives – Especially if they reduced car ownership,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.018,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The transport sector and especially private cars pose environmental, economic, and social challenges. For this reason, cargo bikes and shared mobility are considered viable alternatives for road transport. In order to understand the potential and barriers of alternative transport modes, it is essential to analyze underlying motives. Moreover, comparing sustainable alternatives (such as public transport) to cars in terms of motives has been established as a research approach (Steg, 2003). Despite increasing interest in cargo bikes and cargo bike sharing, research on this topic is relatively rare. Particularly, there exists a lack of research addressing the impact of cargo bike sharing on car ownership. Against this background, this study quantifies the car ownership reduction effect of cargo bike sharing. In addition, it is investigated how cargo bikes differ from cars with regard to the underlying motives of users which also helps understanding potential barriers. To answer these research questions, this study is based on a large-scale survey with n = 2,590 cargo bike sharing users. The results imply that cargo bike sharing has a notable impact on car ownership. In general, cargo bikes are rated superior in regard to affective, symbolic, and environmental motives as well as on flexibility and price. However, discrepancies to cars do exist in terms of other instrumental aspects (traffic safety, travel speed, comfort, weather-independence). Notably, users who reduced car ownership tend to rate cargo bikes superior compared to car-dependent users. The results imply that cargo bikes can play a marked role in reducing car dependency. Improving infrastructure and cargo bike technology as well as stimulating favorable social norms for cargo bikes have been identified as beneficial conditions that could help to leverage this potential.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the impact of temperature perception and fear of missing out on distracted walking,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.014,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This research explores the impact of technology on distracted walking behavior. The authors hypothesize that perceptions of warm temperatures cause people to feel fears of missing out (FOMO) by amplifying heightened concerns about missed social opportunities, leading to more distracted walking behavior resulting from maladaptive smartphone usage. One observational study and two pre-registered online studies (N = 1242) utilizing population samples from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia demonstrate that as temperatures increase (decrease), individuals experience heightened (reduced) feelings of FOMO, leading to higher (lower) distracted walking caused by maladaptive smartphone usage.

Drivers’ engagement in NDRTs during automated driving linked to travelling speed and surrounding traffic,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.010,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Previous simulator and real-world studies with SAE Level 2 automated vehicles (AVs) have shown that, when compared to manual driving, drivers are more inattentive to the driving environment when automation is engaged, as reflected by fewer glances towards the forward roadway and side/rear view mirrors, and more focus on non-driving related tasks (NDRTs). Manual driving studies also suggest that drivers are more likely to engage in NDRTs during slow-moving or stationary traffic conditions. The aim of the current study was to understand whether NDRT engagement and visual attention patterns are impacted by the driving environment while drivers experienced a ride in a real-world SAE Level 3 AV. Forty-six video clips, from 32 drivers interacting with NDRTs during L3 motorway driving were analysed for this study. Due to the absence of externally facing cameras, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of driving speed were used as a proxy for assessing the surrounding traffic volume. The number of glances, and mean glance duration away from NDRTs per minute, were used as proxy measures for NDRT engagement. A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to investigate the effect of surrounding traffic on NDRT engagement. Results showed that the number and mean duration of glances away from the NDRT increased significantly when the SD of speed was high. The mean speed had a significant effect on the mean glance duration, with longer glances away from NDRTs when mean speed was low, compared to that in high speed. There was a significant effect of age on NDRT engagement, with older drivers less likely to engage in another task, while female drivers were more engaged in NDRTs than males. Overall, the results indicate that drivers’ propensity to engage in NDRTs is impacted by the AV’s speed, which is influenced by the volume of surrounding traffic. These results are useful for understanding the implications of surrounding traffic on drivers’ self-regulated engagement in NDRTs in the real world during SAE Level 3 driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Ergonomic principles of road signs comprehension: A literature review,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.020,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Road signs are an essential component of a safe driving environment. Understanding road signs is vital to road safety. This paper reviews many earlier investigations into how well drivers understand road signs, considering ergonomic principles. Articles from 2012 to 2023, indexed by Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, IEEE, Semantic Scholar, Science Direct, Cambridge Core, and JSTOR, were used to evaluate the literature on ergonomics and road signs comprehension. The analysis reveals that some evaluation techniques have been created to measure how well road signs are understood. Based on International Standard Organization (ISO, 3846 and 39001), 268 road signs were reviewed out of which, 112 (41.79 %) road signs are associated with lower comprehension scores and may pose a higher risk to road users who many not fully understand their meaning. 156 (58.21 %) road signs associated with higher comprehension scores and likely understood by road users. In conclusion, human traits, cognitive sign design and ergonomic principles are crucial for understanding and producing road signs.

The gender gap in the acceptance of automated vehicles in Europe,10.1016/j.trf.2023.11.002,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Previous research suggests that there might be a gender gap in the acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs): males are typically found to have a higher intention to use AVs than females, although opposite results have been reported in different countries. The conflicting results have yet to be addressed, and only a few studies have attempted to explain the country-level differences based on quantifiable socio-economic indicators. We investigated the gender gap in the acceptance of AVs (SAE Level 3) using a questionnaire study among 8412 car-drivers in eight European countries as part of the European L3Pilot project. For this study, the gender gap in the acceptance of AVs is defined as the difference in the willingness to use, buy and activate the automated driving function in AVs between men and women. Results showed two distinct realities for Europe: in one group of countries, females were less willing to use AVs than males, while in another group, both males and females had similar acceptance towards AVs with higher ratings overall. These country groups were different in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and the Gender Equality Index (GEI). The gender gap in the acceptance of AVs was larger in countries with a higher GDP and GEI. The study findings suggest that the gender gap in the acceptance of AVs is not universal, and the countries’ progress in economics and gender equality are related to people's attitudes toward AVs. This finding enhances policy development and planning future transport solutions to ensure that all potential users can benefit from AVs.",1369-8478,Not found
Climate change and transportation companies: A bibliometric and systematic literature review,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.001,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This research examines the intricate interactions between climate change (CC) and transportation companies (TC). It situates itself within the growing dialogue on environmental sustainability, acknowledging the dual role of TC as both contributors to and victims of CC phenomena. These companies are recognised as significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions while concurrently facing operational challenges due to climate-induced events such as extreme weather conditions. The methodology for this study incorporates a bibliometric and systematic literature review, drawing upon the frameworks established by Bartolini et al. (2019) and Badassa et al. (2020). This approach facilitates an understanding of the relationship between CC and TC. A significant contribution of this study is its broadened perspective on the economic repercussions of CC on the transportation sector, addressing a gap in existing literature. It identifies a disproportionate focus in current research, which tends to emphasise the effects of climate change on TC more than the impact these companies have on CC. This observation highlights the pressing need for sustainable practices within the transportation industry, extending beyond conventional CC discourse. Furthermore, this study enhances the academic understanding of the CC-TC relationship's broader systemic and economic implications. It provides new perspectives on the potential for TC to adapt and move towards sustainability and resilience. The research underscores the necessity of innovative and sustainable approaches for these companies, emphasising their role in reducing environmental impact and adapting to the ongoing changes brought about by CC. In conclusion, this study is a vital guide for future research and policy development. It underscores the complex challenges facing the TC in the context of CC and proposes a direction for proactive and informed action within this field.",1369-8478,Not found

Phase 1 explored the travel adversities, psychological experiences, and consequences of a sample of ten (four women and six men) regular commuters of Bangalore's congested roads using semi-structured interviews. In phase 2, a checklist was developed listing the fundamental themes from phase 1 with Likert-type responses ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (always). Phase 3 gathered data in the checklist and tested the statistical validity of the thematic model in a sample of 190 (81 women and 103 men) regular commuters. Attride-Stirling model thematic network was established with 57 fundamental themes categorized and assigned under the organizing themes of travel adversities (n = 6), negative affect (n = 28), fight (n = 7), flight (n = 6), and negative road occurrences (n = 10), in the global theme, psychological experiences and consequences. Structural equation modeling indicated that (1) negative affect significantly predicted fight and flight, (2) fight is a significant predictor of negative road occurrences, and (3) psychological experiences and consequences create a self-perpetuating cycle, with travel adversity triggering negative emotions, which results in fight responses leading to negative road occurrences, further intensifying travel adversity. A mathematical model is established based on this statistical validation, which holds potential applications in real-time traffic algorithms.",1369-8478,Not found
Cycling subjective experience: A conceptual framework and methods review,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.021,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"When evaluating cycling subjective experiences (CSE), mobility researchers have questioned the depictions of cycling as an efficient, fast, and solitary mobility mode. By reframing cycling in terms of its emotional impact on the cyclist, research to date has explored dimensions such as fun, relaxation, and sociability of cycling experiences. Yet, these insights have not been integrated into a holistic understanding of CSE. Addressing this gap, this paper asks: what is the CSE exactly and how do we measure it? We selected and analysed in-depth 50 articles with the aim of unpacking the innate characteristics of CSE. The paper makes a contribution to the research on CSE by presenting a novel framework that clarifies the relationships within existing literature, and identifies measurement methods aligned with this framework. The three interrelated core aspects of CSE are 1) sensory interpretation, 2) affective states, and 3) cognitive construction. Additionally, the three identified methods are 1) retrospective, 2) interceptive, and 3) mobile methods. Notably, retrospective surveys and interviews emerged as the dominant methods employed in the field. However, there has been a growing interest in mobile methods, which enable the collection of real-time and context-specific data, thereby enhancing the generalizability of research findings. Through our analysis we have found that the positive values of cycling experiences have been largely ignored in our sample of studies, revealing a bias of researchers to focus on mobility as a disutility. Based on our findings, we urge planners and scholars to rethink their implicit efforts to mitigate the negative effects of cycling experiences and look for opportunities to optimize for positive cycling experiences.",1369-8478,Not found
A scoping review of E-scooter safety: Delightful urban slalom or injury epidemic?,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.015,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Introduction E-scooters are a convenient, relatively inexpensive and fun new mode of transportation with rapidly increased use in cities throughout the world. Despite the popularity of e-scooters, increases in rider injuries and fatalities have become a public health concern. Objective. To characterize the types of safety issues associated with e-scooter use. Methods. Scoping review methods focused on any safety issues associated with the use of dockless, stand-up, motorized, electric kick scooters from companies offering short-term rentals or through private ownership, published in English between January 2017 and March 2022. Databases included Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus, SocINDEX, TRID Database, and Web of Science databases. After abstract screening and full text review, a total of 81 studies were included in the scoping review. Results. Few e-scooter riders wear helmets except where legally required. Alcohol impairment is a primary contributor to e-scooter injuries. Younger males, underage riding, double riding, speeding and rider distraction were also identified as behavioural contributors to e-scooter injury crashes. Environmental contributors included crash locations (e.g., sidewalks, bike paths, roads) parking issues (e.g., tripping hazard), fixed object collisions (e.g., lampposts, parked cars), road surface and slope (e.g., uneven, curbs, downhills) and insufficient nighttime visibility. E-scooter reliability was affected by brake failures and design limitations (e.g., stability over rough terrain). Injury patterns included mechanism of injury (loss of balance and/or control, fall) and moving object collisions (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists). The head, face, upper and lower extremities were the most common anatomical locations injured. Fractures, contusions, concussions, lacerations, and sprains were the most frequent injury types. Discussion. Policies, regulations and interventions that address helmet requirements, alcohol and drug use, rider skill and knowledge acquisition, restrictive speed limits, education and enforcement are discussed with respect to evidence-based safety guidance for transportation policy and decision makers. Conclusion . Behavioural, environmental and device design safety issues associated with e-scooter use require effective interventions to reduce the frequency and severity of rider injuries.",1369-8478,Not found
A field evaluation of an in-ground lighting intervention for safety at a road crossing,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.017,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"There are limited numbers of naturalistic studies of behaviours in response to safety interventions, such as novel lighting products at road crossings. The study used a theory-based approach to evaluate behavioural responses to a novel, ground-mounted lighting intervention at a zebra crossing at a university campus. An evaluation framework was developed to explore the extent to which the intervention was implemented in practice and collect a range of data types to assess the outcomes and impacts of the lighting intervention, in terms of the responses and behaviours of crossing users. The study was primarily observational, collecting and analysing video recordings of the road crossing episodes for people alone or in small groups (n = 269). This was supported by a small consultation exercise to help understand user-perceptions, achieved through an online questionnaire of crossing users (n = 59). The observations contributed to understanding crossing behaviours in this location, generally demonstrating safe crossing behaviours, such as looking for traffic and walking within the marked crossing features. There was no observable indication of users noticing or responding overtly to the lighting. However, 29% of the small sample responding to the questionnaire stated that the lights had influenced the way that they used the crossing. The survey responses indicated that users understood the intention of the lighting and cited positive attributes and perceived benefits, which may improve behaviours and safety for both pedestrians and drivers. It is concluded that the lighting intervention has the potential to improve safety-related behaviours at crossings, but further investigation of its efficacy would be recommended. Guidance is provided on how to respond to various methodological and situational challenges that have been encountered in this study, such as how to improve observational data collection for field studies in this type of context. Future development of the intervention might involve sensor-based activation and variation in the lighting (e.g., differing flash rates and colours).",1369-8478,Not found

This research examines the interplay between young drivers’ psychological traits and traffic variables to better understand overtaking behavior. A total of 111 licensed drivers between the ages of 18 and 28 (inclusive) successfully completed four unique traffic scenarios presented in random order. In all four scenarios, the lead vehicle was a truck for which the speed and passing gap size varied. A standardized self-report questionnaire captured demographic and psychological factors including impulsiveness, mindfulness, attitude towards driving and depression. Results revealed that, irrespective of the traffic scenario, the propensity to overtake a lead vehicle is associated with lower attitudes towards rule violations and speeding. In more difficult traffic scenarios, the effects of impulsiveness and mindfulness are more pronounced. Concerning moods, young drivers with higher depressive symptoms are more likely to overtake in the most dangerous scenarios. These findings can enhance driver education campaigns and targeted curricula for young drivers promoting safe driving to lessen the social and economic burdens of high-impact crashes.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the effect of nudge approach on driver's willingness to use driver tracking,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.016,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Driver tracking has the potential to improve driving skills and reduce traffic accidents. Nudging drivers toward the widespread utilization of driver tracking holds significant potential for enhancing traffic safety. Nudge approach gained popularity by changing environmental factors through careful design and guiding people to make certain choices under non-mandatory conditions. This research is dedicated to examines the impact of nudge approach on driver’s willingness to use driver tracking across different age, marital, and income groups. Survey data were collected from a sample of 1054 respondents throughout Japan in 2020. Together with the PLS-SEM model and multigroup analysis, results reveal that (1) natural consequences, comparison of behavior, shaping knowledge, covert learning, identity nudge approaches could all have positive impact on driver’s willingness to use driver tracking; (2) it is significantly effective to deploy shaping knowledge nudge approach for the drivers under 50 years old to encourage them to use driver tracking; (3) natural consequence nudge approach is more suitable for drivers older than 50 years old, while the convert learning nudge approach is more appropriate for drivers younger than 50 years old; (4) natural consequences nudge approach is more effective in influencing the willingness of unmarried respondents to use driver tracking, while the covert learning nudge approach is more effective in influencing the willingness of married respondents; (5) comparison of behavior nudge approach is 2 times more effective at persuading drivers to use driver tracking for the higher income group, while driver’s identity nudge approach is 2 times more effective for the lower income group.

Offence trajectories of young Australian novice drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2023.12.011,101,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This paper aims to add to the sparse research on patterns of traffic offending in young novice drivers by examining the trajectories of young Australian novices throughout the graduated driving licensing system (GDLS). Data on licensing, crashes and traffic offences for all persons aged under 25 years first licensed from July 2007 to June 2008 in New South Wales were supplied by transport authorities, with follow-up to January 2014. Eight hierarchical categories of offence were defined by seriousness. Total numbers of offences per month were plotted for one year after initial licensure while under supervision (L), after transitions to the first (P1) and second (P2) provisional licence phases and to unrestricted licensure (U). After excluding novices not transiting to P1, 75,470 novices (51.5 % male, 77.7 % 16 years old at L) remained. Of these 63,070 had a year of follow-up after P2 (52.5 % male, 82.3 % 16 years old at L) and 28,861 had a year of follow-up after U (55.5 % males, 91.7 % 16 years old at L), Offences were uncommon under at L but spiked after P1 and again after P2. Omitting GDLS offences there was a small increase after U. Patterns were broadly similar by age at L and time in L. Novices aged at least 18 years at L had the highest offence rates in the learner phase; those aged 17 years at L had the highest rates in P1 and P2. The longer novices spent in the supervised driving phase the lower their subsequent offence rates even allowing for age at P1. Urban or regional residence had little influence on offence rates but lower aggregate socio-economic status as measured by a census-derived index was associated with appreciably higher offence rates. Speeding was the most common offence type; dangerous/negligent driving was common immediately after P1, declining thereafter. These results are in broad agreement with previous research in noting the increase in offending as GDLS restrictions eased. They highlight the need for better understanding of the function of a GDLS in improving the safety of young drivers. They may also inform future enforcement and education policies for novice drivers. For example, rehabilitative interventions should occur coupled with enforcement soon after citation. Visible display of GDLS status would assist their identification.",1369-8478,Not found

The impacts of nine subjective perception factors on public acceptance of AVs revealed by the papers are reanalysed following a rigorous meta-analytic process. The results show that people’s perceived usefulness of AVs and attitude toward using strongly affect their acceptance of AVs. The increase of perceived ease of use could slightly increase the acceptance. Lower perceived risk often leads to higher acceptance of AVs. Social influence hardly affects people accepting AVs.

With changes in health, aging increases the likelihood of ceasing to drive. Driving cessation is associated with a host of negative physical and mental health outcomes. Increased readiness to transition to non-driving status may mitigate some of the adverse consequences of driving cessation, making the transition to non-driving a pivotal period for intervention. We examined the relationship between attitudes towards driving (positive and negative) and readiness for mobility transition. Participants (n = 253, mean age = 79.13) completed measures of health, cognition, personality, attitudes towards driving, and readiness for mobility change. The results from the multiple hierarchical regression analysis showed that individuals who reported more positive attitudes towards driving relative to themselves (i.e., pro-self scale) and others (i.e., pro-other scale), as well as scored lower on the personality trait agreeableness, were less ready for mobility transition.

Self-Explaining Roads: Effects of road design on speed choice,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.007,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"One of the leading principles for road design is the notion of Self-Explaining Roads(SER). According to this notion, the design and layout of the road environment should automatically elicit behavior that is appropriate for that type of road. The current study investigated the effects of the road environment (i.e., the presence of particular road elements such as the presence/absence of edge lines, and a physical separation between driving lanes) on driving speed choice in the Netherlands for roads in- and outside the city limits (ICL and OCL). A total of 462 participants (all car drivers) were exposed to either 152 ICL or 152 OCL pictures of road environments for either a short (300 ms in Experiment 1, 200 ms in Experiment 2) or long duration (1500 ms) and indicated as fast as possible which speed they would drive given the road environment they viewed. All images were labeled with respect to the presence or absence of particular road elements. A linear mixed model was used to determine the effects of road elements on speed choice and response time. The results showed that the presence of certain road elements impacted the speed chosen. For example, inside the city limits, relative to no bicycle lane, a bicycle lane painted on the road reduced driving speed while a separate bike lane increased the speed chosen. Also, central line markings (relative to no line marking) and a road made of asphalt (relative to pavers) were associated with higher speeds. Outside city limits, having multiple lanes (versus one lane) was related to higher speeds and having two driving directions without separation (versus a one-way road) was related to lower speed choices. Importantly, exposure duration (200 /300 ms versus 1500 ms) only had a marginal effect, indicating that road users generally only need a brief glimpse of the road to be able to decide what speed to drive. Consistent with the principles of SER, we conclude that categorization and the associated speed decision is fast, operating within a single glance and is impacted by the road elements present in the environment. Finally, we believe our method constitutes a valuable tool in road design, as it allows one to efficiently and effectively gauge the impact of various road elements in large population samples.",1369-8478,Not found
Naturalistic study of vehicle-bicycle lateral passing distance on high-speed rural two-lane roadways with paved shoulders,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.006,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In the United States, 91.4 cm (3.0 ft) has been considered a safe lateral distance when passing bicyclists; however, this threshold may be more suitable to urban environments where most bicycle safety research has originated—limited research is available on rural roadways. In this study, a road bicycle was instrumented to collect naturalistic data and analyze vehicle-bicycle lateral passing distances (LPD) on high-speed rural two-lane roadways with paved shoulders. The bicycle was ridden in the center of the shoulder. Overall, 2,119 observations of vehicles passing the instrumented bicycle were obtained from a study segment. The impacts of different variables on distributions of vehicle-bicycle LPD measurements were analyzed. Passing vehicles with opposing traffic passed the bicyclist significantly closer than passing vehicles without opposing traffic. More predominant with opposing traffic, heavy vehicles passed the bicyclist closer than passenger vehicles. Similarly, following vehicles passed the bicyclist closer than leading vehicles. The study segment was repaved during the data collection period, so data before and after the roadway improvement was available. Vehicles with old pavement/marking passed the bicyclist closer than vehicles with new pavement/marking conditions. Distribution of LPD measurements was skewed to the left towards smaller values and had a long tail to the right towards larger values. Through maximum likelihood estimation, the Log-normal distribution was found to best fit the data distribution. Using empirical and theoretical density distributions, LPD was formally specified as a function of opposing traffic with a theoretical mixture distribution and generalized to estimate the probability of vehicles passing bicyclists below a certain threshold.",1369-8478,Not found
Unveiling the drivers of modal switch from motorcycles to public transport in Southeast Asia,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.009,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Most studies on commuter and public transport mode choice rely on theoretical frameworks that draw boundaries between the utility function, social-ecological system, demographic and socio-economic attributes, and psychological theory. While models predicting the shift towards public transport are commonly applied in developed countries, there is a lack of similar studies that construct these models in developing countries. In addition, in some developing countries, the motorcycle is one of the main private motorised travel modes. Therefore, the modal shift from motorcycles to public transport in Southeast Asia to reduce private mobility is one of the important topics to examine. This paper presents a systematic literature review, utilising a comprehensive search strategy across electronic databases and reputable sources to identify directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), revealing factors influencing the choice and intention to shift to public transport. Data synthesis from selected studies highlights the intrinsic and extrinsic variables influencing public transport use, motorcycle use, and the modal shift to public transport. The study also proposes a theoretical framework for the modal shift in usage from motorcycles to public transport.",1369-8478,Not found
"Acceptability of connected automated vehicles: Attributes, perceived behavioural control, and perceived adoption norm",10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.012,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) could be dominating the roads in the near future. CAVs are fully automated vehicles equipped to communicate and share data with other devices both inside and outside the vehicles, and can increase traffic safety and decrease greenhouse emissions from traffic, as they can ensure a more efficient traffic flow and reduce traffic jams. However, CAVs can only achieve this potential when they are accepted and widely adopted by the public. In this paper, we propose a model to explain the acceptability (i.e. evaluation before experience) of CAVs. We hypothesize that the acceptability of CAVs is higher when people evaluate its attributes more favourably, feel more able to use CAVs (i.e. higher perceived behavioural control), and think close others would consider adopting CAVs (i.e. the perceived adoption norm). We identified seven key attributes that could be important for the acceptability of CAVs, namely: safety, instrumental, hedonic, control, symbolic, environmental, and trustworthiness attributes. Results from a large-scale online questionnaire (N = 3783) showed that the proposed model explains acceptability well. Together, the evaluation of attributes of CAVs, perceived behavioural control, and perceived adoption norm explained 60 % of variance in acceptability. Positive evaluations of attributes were the strongest predictor of acceptability of CAVs, in particular safety, instrumental, and environmental attributes. Interestingly, we found that symbolic attributes predict acceptability better when the perceived adoption norm is low. The results suggest the acceptability of CAVs may be enhanced by improving the evaluations of its key attributes and by introducing it as a status product in the early adoption phase.",1369-8478,Not found
“A reservation I have is that presumably no travel app will improve the actual services”: Place based perspectives of mobility as a service,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.010,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Understanding the perceptions and needs of different types of prospective end-users of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is an important step towards successful scheme and customer-facing app design. The travel behaviour literature typically favours quantitative approaches; however, qualitative methods can offer unique insights in this regard. To this end, this article reports on a series of online focus groups held with 146 residents of a region in which Mobility as a Service is on the cusp of being rolled out. Participants’ perceptions of MaaS, in terms of their information needs, the incentives that might help them use it, and the challenges they perceive, were explored with respect to their place of residence: urban, peri-urban, or rural. Inductive thematic analysis of over 30,000 words of text lead to the identification of a variety of themes and sub-themes. Accurate, reliable, and up-to-date information is a core requirement for all. For those in urban areas, the presentation of multiple journey options, with associated information on travel time and cost, are key. For those in peri-urban areas, detailed route information that facilitates the linking of private transport with public transport, and the facilities available at stations and stops, are of particular significance. For those in rural areas, fundamental service provision limitations hamper the potential for traditional, urban-focussed MaaS schemes reliant on public transport networks. A successful rural MaaS system will be distinct from urban MaaS, with a lesser focus on traditional public transport, and peri-urban residents represent an important target group for encouraging modal shift and improving transport system sustainability.",1369-8478,Not found
Comparing first- and third-person perspective in a driving simulator,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.011,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This study explores the effects of changing the viewing perspective from a first-person perspective (a traditional viewing perspective in virtual reality) to a third-person perspective (a view from behind the vehicle, as used in many computer games) on driving behaviour, presence, and simulator sickness. In a driving simulator participants drove the same route twice, once for each perspective. Measures for driving behaviour were recorded during the rides, and both simulator sickness and feeling of presence were measured after each ride. Participants also evaluated the perspectives for the different situations they encountered. Results show that changing viewing perspectives leads to a lower feeling of presence, but does not result in lower simulator sickness scores. While lane control is similar between perspectives, participants drove faster and more to the left in the third-person perspective. The first-person perspective was evaluated more positively in all situations, and was preferred by almost all participants. These results indicate that a third-person perspective is unlikely to be an effective method for reducing simulator sickness in driving simulators, and the results show that the third-person perspective is not advised in driving simulator behavioural research.",1369-8478,Not found

Results showed that the unique road characteristics of I-80 resulted in higher levels of cognitive load as demonstrated by the slower DRT response times. Likewise, different levels of workload were found across the four vehicles, with higher workload levels found for one of the four vehicles.

Comparing implicit communication via longitudinal driving dynamics: A cross-cultural study in Germany and the UK,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.008,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"To ensure safe and uninterrupted traffic flow, (semi-)automated vehicles must be capable of providing comprehensible and agreeable implicit communication cues to human drivers. This driving simulator study investigated the assessment of implicit communication at a motorway slip road through longitudinal driving dynamics (acceleration, deceleration, and maintaining speed). The second aim of the study was to determine whether expectations of automated vehicles are different from those of human drivers. And thirdly, we investigated whether these findings are country-specific or can be (partially) generalised to other countries. The perception of three means of communication in connection with the presence of a labelling as an automated vehicle (eHMI) was examined in two samples in Germany and England. 27 participants drove from a slip road onto the motorway and interacted with another vehicle. After a stretch on the motorway, they passed a second slip road on which there was a vehicle merging onto the participants lane. This was repeated six times to test all variables. After each situation, the perceived cooperativity and criticality was recorded, as well as the time headway (THW) to the other vehicle. This paper presents the findings from the UK sample and compares them with the German results, which were previously published. Results show, that when the cooperating vehicles are on the slip road, participants from both countries prefer this vehicle to decelerate. However, when participants themselves are on the slip road, expectations for vehicles on the target lane are ambiguous in the UK sample. Except for one aspect (perceived cooperativity of decelerating vehicles on the slip road), the perception of automated vehicles is similar to those of manual drivers. Also, UK participants do not maintain a different safety distance from these vehicles, while this is the case in the German sample. This paper contributes valuable insights into the cross-cultural evaluation of driving dynamics, shedding light on implications for the development and acceptance of automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Revealing inherent interrelationships of direct and indirect factors impacting Driver's stop-or-go behaviors at Yellow-Light,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.005,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"To address critical safety issues caused by a yellow-light dilemma, existing research identified individual direct factors contributing to a driver’s stop-or-go behavior with a lack of exploring factors that may indirectly influence it. Comprehensive knowledge covering all possible direct and indirect factors contributing to the behavior is highly demanded. This paper adds such knowledge to the literature by discovering, revealing, and validating factors indirectly contributing to stop-or-go behaviors from environmental conditions of traffic and roadway geometry. At four high-speed signalized intersections in Ohio, data was collected for 46 h, with qualified trajectories of 1,572 vehicles being included. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis results reveal that site speed has the largest indirect effect on the decision, followed by yellow-interval duration, traveling in the left-through lane, being a heavy vehicle, and yellow-onset distance from the stop-line. These factors indirectly impact the decisions via mediating effects of direct factors, including yellow-onset speed, cycle volume, and following a passing vehicle.",1369-8478,Not found
Development of a nuanced approach to aggressive driving: An investigation into the self-regulatory and attitudinal profiles of aggressive drivers and their contextual role in negative road interactions,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.012,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This study aimed to provide a novel perspective on aggressive driving behaviour (ADB) by developing a self-report measure of aggressive driving styles (the Aggressive Driving Styles Questionnaire; ADSQ) and comparing how different types of drivers (according to their attitudes and self-regulatory functioning) might differentially engage in such driving styles. An online survey was completed by a sample of Australian adult drivers (N = 527), who reported engaging in an ADB in the past month. An initial confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the proposed factor structure of instrumental, reactive, proactive and interpersonal driver aggression, was a good fit for the data, and reliability tests suggested that the ADSQ had good internal consistency (α = 0.73 - 0.91). Next, correlational analysis showed that the ADSQ had positive associations with (a) driver anger and rumination; (b) problematic attitudes towards instrumental and hostile aggressive driving; and (c) various domains (i.e., cognitive, attentional, emotional) of self-regulatory dysfunctioning. K-means cluster analysis was then used on the variables to determine potential profiles of ‘self-regulated’ drivers among the participants. The results suggested that three driver types significantly differed according to their attitudes and level of self-regulatory dysfunction: self-regulated drivers (high functioning; low attitudes), antisocial drivers (medium functioning; high attitudes), and dysregulated drivers (low functioning, high attitudes). These cluster groups were shown to significantly differ in their tendency to engage in aggressive driving styles and what behaviours they perceived as most triggering when driving on the road.

Study on physiological representation of passenger cognitive comfort: An example with overtaking scenarios,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.003,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"During autonomous driving, the subjective cognition of scenario risks may lead to cognitive discomfort of occupants. This is a new concept of ride comfort for vehicles, which is being included in the performance evaluation of autonomous vehicles. The observation methods, generation mechanisms, prediction methods, and optimization methods of this cognitive discomfort remain to be explored. In order to quantify the risk cognition of passengers and evaluate cognitive comfort, this paper proposes a physiological representation method using overtaking scenarios as an example. Firstly, physiological data of passengers are collected through road test, and 19 physiological indicators are extracted, including 6 galvanic skin response (GSR) indicators, 5 electrocardiogram indicators, and 8 eye movement indicators. Secondly, the physiological indicator set related to the subjective evaluation results of comfort is constructed through correlation analysis. Finally, a multiple linear regression model is established to represent the level of passenger discomfort, with physiological indicators as inputs and subjective comfort indicators as outputs. The indicators that contribute significantly to the output results in the model are the maximum amplitude of GSR, the rise time of GSR, the maximum pupil diameter, and the average fixation time. The validation results indicate that the overall accuracy of the model is 86.90 %.",1369-8478,Not found

One factor that may impact adolescent safety in traffic is the presence of peers. We conducted a quasi-experimental research study to examine the impact of peer presence, peer familiarity, and peer group size on adolescent pedestrian risk-taking intentions in both sidewalk and street-crossing settings. Methods 607 students aged 12–18 years from Nantong city, China, completed a questionnaire that presented 20 traffic scenarios. The scenarios varied based on a 3 (peer group size: no peer vs. one peer vs. multiple peers) x 2 (peer familiarity: familiar vs. unfamiliar) x 2 (traffic setting: crossing the street vs. walking on the roadside) experimental design. Adolescents’ responses indicated safer vs riskier intentions in each situation. Results (1) Adolescents were safer when walking on the sidewalk than when crossing the street; (2) Whether crossing the street or walking on the sidewalk, adolescents’ behavioral intentions were safer when there were peers present than when there were no peers present; (3) Adolescents’ safety tended to be higher overall with unfamiliar peers than with familiar peers; (4) Adolescents were less safe when crossing the street with familiar peer(s) than with unfamiliar peer(s), but no differences emerged when walking on the sidewalk.

Modelling yielding dilemma zone for drivers at non-signalised crosswalks,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.018,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In developing countries like China, non-signalised crosswalks represent a considerable risk to pedestrian safety. This study introduces a “yielding dilemma zone” model to tackle the decision-making challenges encountered by drivers at these crosswalks. Field data collected via drones at three non-signalised crosswalks in Xi'an (China) facilitated the analysis of 1687 instances of driver yielding behaviour. The study employed Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) models to establish the boundaries of the dilemma zone. Additionally, it utilized surrogate safety metrics, such as the deceleration rate required to stop (DRS) and time to crossing (TC), to compare risks between dilemma and non-dilemma zones. Each modelling approach provided insightful findings. The SVM and ANN models identified the speed-distance dilemma zones, while the BLR model determined the multifactorial dilemma zones by considering characteristics such as pedestrian, vehicle, and traffic condition. The findings underscore the significance of the “yielding dilemma zone” for understanding driver-pedestrian interactions at non-signalised crosswalks. The innovative multi-model approach uncovered that pedestrian speed, vehicle type, vehicle approach speed, adjacent vehicle number, driving directions, and pedestrian crossing stage significantly influence this interaction. indicated a higher probability of collisions within dilemma zones compared to non-dilemma zones across all models. The study suggests that the SVM model could be instrumental in creating passive physical warning signs, while the ANN and BLR models could significantly contribute to real-time pedestrian and driver assistance systems. The “yielding dilemma zone” model, with its comprehensive approach, presents a promising avenue for enhancing pedestrian safety, intelligent transportation systems, and traffic management at non-signalised crosswalks.",1369-8478,Not found

Development and validation of the Driver Attention Regulation Scale: A measure of the perceived ability to regulation attention on the road,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.015,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The ability to regulate attention while driving is a vital skill for remaining safe on the road. However, there is no current self-report method that measures such a construct, potentially limiting research in the area of attention and distraction. This study aimed to develop and validate a new measure, the Driver Attention Regulation Scale (DARS), that can be used to identify how drivers perceive their ability to regulate attention while driving. To achieve this aim, two online surveys were shared with unique samples of Australian drivers. Following the development of an initial item pool, principal components analysis and follow up confirmatory factor analysis were used to test the structure of the items and revealed that three factors emerged: attentional presence (e.g., focus; vigilance), attentional flexibility (e.g., awareness; shifting), and attentional capacity (e.g., processing speed; cognitive resources). Each of the subscales (α = 0.75–0.88) and the total scale (α = 0.87–0.91) exhibited a good internal consistency across the samples. Evidence of external validity was also demonstrated, as the DARS was positively associated with generalised attention regulation measures, and driver confidence, but negatively associated with emotion regulation difficulties, driver stress, and driving errors/lapses. Mediation analyses also indicated that the attentional constructs measured by the DARS may indirectly influence driving behaviours, via their effect on driver stress and confidence. Overall, the DARS has demonstrated promise as a new measure of driving-related attentional skills that can be used in future research to better understand how situational factors may impact drivers’ confidence, and also how confidence may influence driving behaviours (e.g., speeding).",1369-8478,Not found

What factors contribute to in-role and extra-role safety behavior among food delivery riders?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.01.013,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Food delivery riders face significant road safety risks globally. Previous studies have primarily focused on the direct relationship between job demands, job resources, and road safety behaviors, often neglecting the potential indirect paths through dual processes, namely the health impairment process and the motivational process, which may lead to dangerous riding behaviors. Additionally, the impact of organizational citizenship behaviors on the safety of food delivery riders within the industry remains unexplored. This study aims to address these gaps by applying the dual processes of the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) to identify factors influencing the safety behaviors of food delivery riders in Vietnam. Data were collected through face-to-face surveys with 410 riders in public places. The findings show a nuanced interplay between job demands, resources, and safety behaviors. Specifically, job burnout acts as a bridge, mediating the influence of job demands on in-role safety behaviors. On the other hand, job resources-encompassing facets like job autonomy, performance feedback, technology support, and work support-indirectly shape both in-role and extra-role safety behaviors via the conduit of motivation. These resources not only bolster motivation but also serve as pillars in fostering a culture of safety among riders. This research not only deepens our understanding of the determinants of food delivery riders' safety behaviors but also highlights the pivotal role food delivery companies play in shaping these behaviors. By prioritizing the holistic well-being of their riders and offering robust support, these companies can foster an environment conducive to safety. Additionally, by integrating additional dimensions of job demands and resources into the JD-R model, this study paves the way for more comprehensive and nuanced future research in this domain.",1369-8478,Not found

MAD-DAX: Anger and driver behaviours on the road,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.016,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Anger is a common emotion in everyday life, and in the context of driving, the experience of greater anger has been positively associated with aggressive behaviour, near-misses and crashes. Although the effect of anger on driver behaviour has been studied, the role of the source of anger and the perceived level of skill of the driver experiencing anger, based on self-reported behaviour, is not well understood. In this context, the aim of the current study was to investigate the relationships of trait anger and driving anger with driver behaviours in relation to driver skills. A total of 369 drivers aged 18–58 years (M = 24.53, SD = 7.65) completed a questionnaire consisting of the Trait Anger Scale (TAS), the Measure for Angry Drivers (MAD), the Driver Skills Inventory (DSI), the Driver Behaviours Questionnaire (DBQ), the Positive Driver Behaviour Scale (PDBS) and the Driving Anger Expression Inventory (DAX). The factor analyses for the Turkish adaptations of the MAD and DAX supported the original factorial structures. For less skilled drivers, experiencing more anger due to the behaviours of others was associated with more errors. For skilled drivers, higher levels of anger due to the behaviours of others were associated with more personal physical anger expression and positive behaviours. Similarly, for the same group of drivers, higher levels of anger due to traffic delays were associated with more errors. The findings revealed a complex relationship between driving-specific anger and driver behaviours based on different levels of driver skills, contrary to non-significant relations of trait anger. Anger provoked by the context/situation-based reason, as opposed to trait anger, was associated with more general driving style (i.e., errors and positive behaviours) through driver skills. For the first time in literature, the relationship between anger and driver behaviour has been addressed in this study within the context of driver skill. The results provided valuable information to better understand how different situations that can trigger anger may relate to different behaviours for drivers with different levels of perceived skills. The results may contribute to more targeted intervention programmes to reduce driving anger, aberrant behaviour, and associated outcomes.",1369-8478,Not found
Crossing roads in a social context: How behaviors of others shape pedestrian interaction with automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.008,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Automated vehicles (AVs) are going to enter public roads in the near future and will inevitably encounter more than one pedestrian on roads. Very little is known about how multiple pedestrians will interact with AVs and their external human–machine interfaces (eHMIs). This study investigates the social influence of others on the pedestrian decision-making process during their initial encounters with AVs. In a virtual reality experiment, 26 male and 55 female participants in three experimental conditions made crossing decisions – either alone or next to other simulated pedestrians – in front of AVs equipped with abstract eHMIs showing yielding or non-yielding intentions. The results show that the behaviors of others significantly influenced pedestrian crossing decisions. While the appropriate behaviors of others contributed to faster crossing decision-making, misleading behaviors of others led to riskier crossing decisions and greater difficulty in understanding the eHMIs. However, the impacts from others on pedestrian crossing decisions disappeared once participants became more familiar with eHMIs. Qualitative data revealed that participants acquired knowledge about AVs and eHMIs through direct experience, observing others, and drawing from their past experiences. Additionally, there was a tendency among certain pedestrians to overly rely on and misuse eHMIs. To ensure the safe deployment of AVs, it is therefore essential to adequately educating the public about this novel technology and to optimize eHMI designs for effective communication with multiple pedestrians.",1369-8478,Not found
A brief pc-based hazard prediction training program improves young novice drivers' hazard perception skills compared to a control group over time,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.007,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Young novice drivers are overrepresented in crashes. One of the causes is their poor hazard perception skills. Can a brief PC-based hazard prediction training speed up the acquisition of these skills? To investigate this a training was developed and tested. The training consisted of eight short videos from the driver’s perspective that ended in a crash or an emergency brake incident. Participants watched each video twice but only up until the moment the dangerous scenario started to unfold. During the following minute, they made as many predictions as possible about what would happen next. After this, the video was played again, including the remaining part with the crash or emergency brake incident. Thereafter, with the aid of stills from the video with highlighted areas and arrows, a voice-over explained which areas an experienced driver would have attended to, to avert the crash or emergency brake incident and which other latent hazards experienced drivers would have attended to that did not materialise. To evaluate the training, all participants first drove an approximately 15-minute simulator drive while an eye tracker recorded their gaze directions. In this drive seven latent hazards were staged that did not materialise. Then participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group that completed the hazard prediction training (N = 19) or a control group (N = 20) that completed a placebo training with the same look and feel of the hazard prediction training but that did not train hazard prediction. Directly after, both groups drove the same simulator drive again but starting from a different location than the pre-training drive. Controlled for their gazes at latent hazards during the pre-training drive, the experimental group gazed at significantly more latent hazards during the post-training drive than the control group. Approximately five months after the intervention both groups completed an online hazard perception test consisting of animated videos. In these videos latent hazards were staged that were conceptually the same as those staged in the simulator drive. This online test was also completed by a group of experienced drivers (N = 19). The experimental group scored significantly better on this test than the control group. Experienced drivers scored better than the control group and worse than the experimental group. However, neither difference was significant. The results indicate that a short PC-based hazard perception training can indeed enhance hazard prediction skills and there are indications that these skills have retained.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring beliefs and perceptions towards Advanced Rider Assistance Systems (ARAS) in motorcycle safety,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.011,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The study applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to explore motorcycle riders’ underlying behavioural, normative, and control beliefs towards Advanced Rider Assistance Systems (ARAS). Each belief was explored in terms of three categories of technologies, (i) advanced technologies that help riders manage riding according to situations and conditions, (ii) advanced technologies that help riders to stop, and (iii) advanced technologies that help riders to corner. Eight focus groups were conducted with 39 motorcycle riders (Mage = 44.54 years, 27 males) who resided in Australia. First, participants completed a short online questionnaire which asked demographic information (e.g., age, gender, riding experience), before taking part in a 50-minute semi-structured online focus group. Participants’ knowledge of ARAS differed depending on the type of technology, with most participants reporting good to excellent knowledge of cruise control and standard anti-lock braking system (ABS) and a poor to fair understanding of selectable riding modes and cornering ABS. For behavioural beliefs, two common advantages reported for all three categories of technologies were safety and that the technologies would benefit new riders or riders with less experience. The three common disadvantages included concerns over riders’ reliance on the technologies, cost, and loss of skill or false sense of security. For normative beliefs, participants reported that their loved ones (i.e., partner, family, and friends) would approve of them using these technologies, with participants perceiving that ‘purists’ (i.e., riders who prefer to ride traditional motorcycles) would disapprove. For control beliefs, cost, lack of information on the safety of advanced technologies, and not being able to switch off systems were reported as barriers to use. Lowering insurance premiums, education/test rides, technologies as selectable options, and availability, were all identified as factors that would encourage use of ARAS. By providing information about ARAS, riders will become more informed about ARAS, which may enhance trust and user acceptance. Additionally, ongoing research and development are essential to ensure the evaluation and improvement of ARAS and mitigate any unintended consequences.",1369-8478,Not found
"On-road driving performances at traffic signs and signals, complex intersections and left turns distinguish fit and unfit older drivers",10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.010,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Background Aging goes along with cognitive and non-cognitive changes leading to impaired driving skills in a relevant proportion of older people. However, it is unclear which driving dimensions are affected in unfit older drivers and how performance in these dimensions is related to driving-relevant cognitive and non-cognitive factors. Methods In a prospective cross-sectional study, 110 healthy older drivers completed a standardized 50-minute on-road driving assessment being accompanied by a driving instructor and a driving expert. The driving expert evaluated practical driving skills with the TRIP protocol (TRIP total score) and determined fitness to drive (fit versus unfit). We used repeated-measures analysis of variance to compare fit (n = 89) and unfit (n = 21) older drivers with respect to their practical driving performance in the 12 dimensions of the TRIP. Moreover, we explored how driving performance in the different TRIP dimensions is related to driving-relevant cognitive and non-cognitive factors. Results Results revealed performance differences between the different TRIP dimensions across all drivers (main effect of TRIP dimension) with the poorest overall performances in speed adaptation. Unfit older drivers showed poorer practical driving performances than fit older drivers across all TRIP dimensions (main effect of group). The most pronounced group differences were observed at traffic signs and signals, complex intersections and left turns (TRIP dimension × group interaction). Driving performance in these dimensions was associated with different driving-relevant cognitive and non-cognitive factors. Conclusions The results of the current on-road study show that impaired driving skills of unfit older drivers can be observed in multiple driving dimensions, but particularly involve traffic signs and signals, complex intersections and left turns. The findings provide both high diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. Why does this paper matter? This paper matters, because the current study identified those dimensions of practical driving behavior that best distinguish between fit and unfit older drivers. In a standardized on-road driving assessment, we identified traffic signs and signals, complex intersections and left turns as being those driving dimensions that involve the greatest difficulties for unfit compared to fit older drivers. In a diagnostic context, the results show which driving dimensions deserve a closer look when evaluating fitness to drive. In a therapeutical context, they show which driving dimensions need more intense training. Finally, in a practical context, the results imply that traffic signs and signals need to be optimized to facilitate and accelerate their perception.",1369-8478,Not found
Analyzing road user risk perception among Indian drivers on varying curve geometry: A structural equation modeling approach,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.004,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Driver risk perception ability depends on how they perceive and interpret information from different sources to safely and comfortably operate their vehicles based on the highway features ahead. The present study is divided into two parts to review these aspects: (a) identifying the factors that influence driver risk-taking behavior, and (b) evaluating the soundness of the identified factors by comparing them with quantitative risk perception. For that, 1075 user perception data were collected using a developed questionnaire form through face-to-face interviews. A questionnaire form consists of a total of 33 questions/variables. After applying the factor reduction techniques, namely principal component analysis, the most significant variables (19 questions/variables) influencing the user’s perception are identified. Then, considering these significant variables, five separate risk perception models were developed using the Structural Equation Modeling technique for five varying curve geometries. The results revealed that the user’s risk perception changes for the same user for varying curve geometry. It is also identified that male drivers have more risky behavior (lower risk perception) than female drivers. Besides, Garrett’s ranking technique is also adopted to rank the user risk perception for the varying curve geometry to identify the dangerous curves by assigning the rank. Lastly, to check the feasibility of the results, the risk perception score is also compared with the quantitative risk score. Based on the study results, it is concluded that the study findings will be helpful for highway planners and authorities to introduce some safety measures to alert users of the potential hazards on the roadside and increase their capacity for taking risks on complex curves; hence, the likelihood of crashes can be minimized.",1369-8478,Not found

Sleep in automated driving – Effects of time of day and chronotype on sleepiness and sleep inertia,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.003,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Sleep is a desired use case in highly automated driving and promises drivers relief from sleepiness. Benefits of sleeping on subjective mood and performance in the driving task may be opposed by sleep inertia, the post-sleep grogginess and performance impairment. The magnitude of both, sleepiness and sleep inertia may depend on sleep-homeostatic and circadian factors. We therefore investigated how the effects of sleep inertia are affected by the time of day a nap is taken during automated driving and the role of individual chronotypes both in comparison to the effects of sleepiness. In the presented driving simulator study, 10 distinct morningness and 10 eveningness chronotypes were invited to two test sessions, one in the early morning (starting at 6 a.m.) and one in the late evening (starting at 9 p.m.). Participants slept during an automated drive and were requested to drive manually before and after an instructed nap. We examined the time course of the subjective state, driving behavior and vigilance in dependence of time of day and individual chronotype under sleepiness and sleep inertia. Effects of both, sleepiness and sleep inertia on subjective arousal, wellbeing, motivation, and driving speed were stronger when the time of day did not fit the individual chronotype. This counts particularly for morningness types. Subjective arousal, wellbeing, and motivation were more impaired after the instructed nap in the evening than in the morning. Analogously, driving speed was slower and take-over times were longer after napping in the evening compared to in the morning. Compared to sleepiness, lane keeping and reaction times were not significantly impaired under sleep inertia, probably because the task induced workload could be compensated by reducing speed and prolonging take-over times. Under sleepiness, driving was characterized by distinct time-on-task effects, which caused mood, lane keeping, and vigilance to deteriorate with driving time. In contrast, the investigated measures were more stable with time on task under sleep inertia, possibly due to a compensation by speed reduction and a balance between beneficial and detrimental effects of the intermediate sleep.",1369-8478,Not found
Development and validation of the beliefs about driver anger questionnaire: A scale to predict anger propensity on the road,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.002,102,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Aggressive driving is an aberrant, complex, and resilient road behaviour. The concept of how people perceive mental processes has been shown to have a strong influence over how well emotion is regulated. This study aimed to develop and validate a new self-report measure of beliefs, the Beliefs about Driver Anger Questionnaire (BDAQ), that can predict mental processes known to be associated with driver aggression (i.e., anger rumination and anger). Two distinct Australian samples (N = 294; 165) completed online surveys regarding demographics, anger-related beliefs, self-regulatory ability, anti-social traits, and anger-related tendencies. Analyses were then implemented to test the internal and external validity of the measure. Specifically, principal components analysis and a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis revealed that five prominent beliefs emerged: positive beliefs about the utility of rumination and anger, negative beliefs about the controllability of rumination and anger, and antisocial beliefs about anger expression. Reliability tests showed that the subscales all demonstrated a sound internal consistency (α = 0.72 to 0.85). Bivariate correlations revealed evidence for concurrent validity, as the BDAQ subscales were positively associated with existing measures of metacognitive beliefs, self-regulatory dysfunction, anti-social traits, anger rumination, trait driver anger, and driver aggression. Finally, path analysis was used to test the predictive utility of the BDAQ and the associated theory behind the measure. The results showed that the BDAQ subscales both uniquely and indirectly influenced and explained sizeable portions of the variance in anger rumination (54.3%), driver anger (49.6%), and driver aggression (38.7%). Overall, the BDAQ appears to be a valid self-report measure of anger-related beliefs and is associated with psychological phenomena that underlie aggressive driving behaviour. The measure can therefore be used to better understand driver anger and how to intervene on the potentially dangerous behaviours that follow.",1369-8478,Not found
Towards safer streets: A review of child pedestrian behavior and safety worldwide,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.005,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Children are regarded as the most liable road users as pedestrians because of their specific traffic behaviours, which demand close investigation. The present study conducts a comprehensive systematic review aiming to draw attention to the need for a thorough understanding of child pedestrian safety, especially in the Indian context, and to provide insights that can guide the implementation of evidence-based initiatives to safeguard children on roads. Using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the study searched Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar and Scopus for relevant literature. Finally, 78 research papers and 8 reports were examined and reviewed. The review analysed the literature on the basis of study locations, methods of data collection, parameters affecting child pedestrian behaviour and safety, and existing techniques and models for analysing child pedestrian behaviour and safety. Additionally, worldwide strategies adopted to improve child pedestrian safety were reviewed. The findings across the literature revealed a significant contribution of studies from China, with limited representation from India. Numerous studies have employed questionnaire surveys as a means of data collection and regression analysis to model the behaviour and safety of child pedestrians. The findings of the study sheds light onto the parameters influencing child pedestrian behaviour and safety, with special emphasis on socio-demographic characteristics, peer influence, adult supervision, distractions, disabilities, socio-economic factors, and human factors. The study establishes a foundation for targeted interventions that can reduce pedestrian risks and create a safe environment so that children can navigate independently. The study also discusses limitations and the scope for further research on child pedestrians’ behaviour and safety on streets, especially in Indian context.",1369-8478,Not found
Non-driving-related tasks and drivers’ takeover time: A meta-analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.012,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"In the pre-era of fully automated vehicles, humans occupy a pivotal role within the driving system. Extensive research has been conducted to explore how drivers interact with automated vehicles across diverse scenarios. This article presents a meta-analysis of 42 papers to examine the influence of non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs) on takeover time (TOT). To consolidate the effect of NDRTs on TOT, this paper classified the NDRTs into four dimensions (visual, auditory, motoric, and mental), which aimed to provide a unified understanding of this impact. This paper employed the following three analyses to understand this impact. Firstly, a synthetical analysis was conducted to compare the effect sizes across primary studies. Secondly, a two-group analysis was performed on studies that included eligible control and experiment groups. Lastly, a moderator analysis, incorporating seven potential moderators, was conducted to further explore the underlying mechanism. The results from the synthetical and two-group analyses revealed that both visual-mental-motoric (Vi-Me-Mo) and visual-mental (Vi-Me) tasks could increase TOT, with the former having a greater effect than the latter. The moderator analysis, including subgroup analysis and meta-regression, further confirmed the significance of moderators within their respective subgroups. However, most moderators exhibited non-significant effects across different scenarios. The findings of this study underscore the crucial importance of attending to TOT and tailoring automated driving systems based on individual driver characteristics. Furthermore, this paper contributes significantly to the advancement of scientific research and engineering design by providing valuable insights into the automotive industry.",1369-8478,Not found
Development and validation of automated driving behavior questionnaire (ADBQ),10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.014,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), which is rooted in Human Factors, is a common tool used in the context of driving behavior. However, it does not consider driver behavior when automated-driving systems are active. The primary objective of this study is to construct a questionnaire with high levels of reliability to assess the driving behavior of automated-vehicle (AV) users. This paper presents the development and validation process of a 16-item automated driving behavior questionnaire, composed of three factors of the driving process (perception, cognition, and action) and two factors of automated driving systems (user literacy and dependency). Responses from 441 active AV users were collected and analyzed. The application of factor analysis resulted in the identification of a five-factor solution, and the results showed that male drivers exhibited higher levels of literacy, action, and reliance on AVs than female drivers. In terms of trust, those with complete trust reported higher AV dependency, whereas those with low trust reported lower AV dependency and higher cognitive scores. Addressing gender- and trust-based disparities is crucial for traffic safety, especially among male and less-trusting drivers. The developed ADBQ will serve as a supporting tool for system developers and researchers to assess the driving behaviors of AV users.",1369-8478,Not found
Monitoring fatigue and drowsiness in motor vehicle occupants using electrocardiogram and heart rate − A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.008,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Background Fatigue is a complex state resulting in decreased alertness, often accompanied by drowsiness. Driving fatigue has significantly contributed to traffic accidents globally, highlighting the need for effective monitoring techniques. Various technologies exist to enhance driver safety and minimize accident risks, such as fatigue detection systems that alert drivers as drowsiness sets in. In particular, measuring heart rate (HR) patterns may offer valuable insights into the occupant’s physiological condition and level of alertness and may allow them to understand their fatigue levels. This review aims to establish the current state of the art of monitoring strategies for vehicle occupants, specifically focusing on fatigue assessed by HR and heart rate variability (HRV). Methods We performed a systematic literature search in the databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed, using the terms vehicle, driver, physiologic monitoring, fatigue, sleep, electrocardiogram, heart rate, and heart rate variability. We examined articles published between the 1st of January 2018 and the 31st of January 2023. Results A total of 294 papers were identified from which 71 articles were included in this study. Among the included papers, 57 utilized electrocardiogram (ECG) as the acquired signal for HR measures, with most ECG readings obtained through contact sensors (n = 41), followed by non-intrusive wearable sensors (n = 11). The majority of the works rely on subjective self-reported fatigue ratings (n = 27) and video-based observer ratings (n = 11). Regarding validation, 16 papers do not report validation of any kind. From the included papers, only 13 comprise a fatigue and drowsiness estimation system, 9 with reported validation. Some report acceptable performances, but reduced sample size limits conclusions. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of HR analysis and non-intrusive instrumentation for continuously monitoring driver’s status and detecting sleepiness. One major issue is the lack of sufficient validation and estimation methods for fatigue, contributing to insufficient methods in providing proactive alarm systems. This area shows great promise but is still far from being reliably implemented.",1369-8478,Not found
Analysis of drivers’ take-over ability improvement and behavioral steady state in human–machine codriving vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.007,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"During human–machine codriving, drivers need to take over the vehicle when a take-over request (TOR) appears. If drivers have not received relevant training before driving, they may be unable to complete the take-over within the limited time, or the stability of subsequent vehicle control may be insufficient, which can lead to accidents. In this study, two types of take-over ability improvement methods are proposed. Participants were recruited and randomly divided into a control group (n = 15, no take-over training) and two experimental groups (n = 15, text-based training; n = 15, behavioral spectrum-based training). One-way ANOVA or the Kruskal–Wallis test and post hoc contrasts were used to analyze the differences in data indicators between the three groups of drivers after 20 take-over operations, and another method was proposed to validate the efficiency of the take-over operations on the stability of take-over ability. The results show that compared with the control group, both experimental groups demonstrated a significant improvement in take-over ability, with the behavioral spectrum-based training group exhibiting better take-over performance than the text-based training group. Moreover, after 14 take-over operations, drivers’ take-over ability in the behavioral spectrum-based training group stabilized. The findings of this study can contribute to the safety of human–machine codriving vehicles and the design of future driver training systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessment of the effect of attentional control and experience on event-related potential P300 in visual perception during vehicle driving,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.004,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Numerous types of objects in traffic scenes are visually perceived and recognized to determine safe driving maneuvers. Visual attention is the most important brain function for selecting and processing necessary information in the driving environment. To perceive various targets during driving, attentional resources are distributed across the entire scene. Direct control of attention through instruction and/or cues, which result in tuning the resolution of attentional areas, aids the performance of attention. Additionally, the fixation point distribution of an experienced driver becomes wider and tends to shift to the location where the vehicle will be in the next few seconds. Electroencephalography studies have shown distinct characteristics in the attention-related event-related potential known as P300 between experienced and beginner drivers. These findings suggest that experience allows for the optimization of visual attention and direct attentional control. However, it remains unknown how they differ in altering visual attention performance and related brain activity. This study experimentally investigated the effects of driving experience and attentional control on the perception of driving scenes using the event-related potential P300. Our results showed a greater improvement in P300 latency for perceptual targets with driving experience rather than an increase in visual attention intensity. The results suggest that experience enhances visual attention more effectively than attentional control in terms of acceleration of brain signal processing.",1369-8478,Not found
"Modeling the impact of driving aggression on lane change performance Measures: Steering compensatory Behavior, lane change execution duration and crash probability",10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.001,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The current study aimed to investigate the influence of driving aggression on lane change behavior. Drivers belonging to three levels of aggressive driving styles (aggressive, moderately aggressive, and non-aggressive) participated in lane change experiments, and 232 lane change maneuvers were recorded. Steering behavior during lane change maneuvers was investigated using three steering performance measures, including the standard deviations of steering angle, steering reversal rates, and maximum steering swerve. Three separate generalized estimating equation models were developed to analyze the effects of aggressive driving behavior on the standard deviation of steering angle, steering reversal rates, and maximum steering swerve. A Weibull accelerated failure time model with clustered heterogeneity was developed to analyze the effect of aggressive driving behavior on lane change execution duration. Additionally, to model the crash probability during lane change, a random effects logistic regression model was developed. The findings indicate that aggressive and moderately aggressive drivers completed lane changes 59% and 38% faster, respectively, compared to non-aggressive drivers. This implies a propensity for aggressive and moderately aggressive drivers to execute lane changes more swiftly than non-aggressive drivers. Aggressive drivers increased their standard deviation of steering angle, steering reversal rates, and maximum steering swerves by 180%, 60%, and 62%, respectively, compared to non-aggressive drivers. This implies that aggressive drivers engaged in extreme steering behavior as a compensatory measure for their reckless driving in order to avoid a collision during lane change maneuvering. However, despite their vigorous compensatory steering behavior, the crash rate (number of crashes observed) increased by 5.10 and 2.83 times for aggressive and moderately aggressive drivers, respectively, compared to non-aggressive drivers. The findings have implications for developing driving assistance systems and lane change simulation models.",1369-8478,Not found

The goals of this paper were to adapt the FCRSS to Chinese culture and language, examine its relationships to sociodemographic characteristics and self-reported traffic accidents, and compare young Chinese drivers' perceptions of Family Climate for Road Safety (FCRS) to those reported by young drivers from other countries. A sample of 864 young Chinese drivers participated in this study and completed a four-part questionnaire: FCRSS, Reckless Driving Habits Scale (RDHS), DULA Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI), and sociodemographic characteristics and traffic accidents. A total of four valuable conclusions were drawn by analyzing these data. Firstly, a 7-factor 54-item Chinese version of the FCRSS had acceptable reliability and validity. Secondly, significant gender, age, educational level, and driving experience differences in the perception of the FCRS were found. The drivers who scored higher on the perception of the FCRS were female, younger, better-educated, and less experienced in driving. Thirdly, young drivers who were prone to traffic accidents showed lower levels of perception of the FCRS. Fourthly, the propensity for perception of the FCRS in China was different from that reported by young drivers in most other countries. These findings showed that the Chinese version of the FCRSS is an instrument with practical usefulness and real-world significance.",1369-8478,Not found
Predicting Undergraduates’ willingness to engage in dangerous e-scooter use behaviors,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.003,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Introduction The misuse of electronic scooters (e-scooters), particularly among young adults, is increasingly being linked to hospital admissions and injuries in cities across the globe. Yet, despite growing concern about dangerous e-scooter use, there remains a dearth of research on the determinants of engaging in risky behaviors while using an e-scooter. Method A sample of 262 Australian undergraduate students completed measures relating to the theory of planned behavior, risk perceptions, and knowledge of laws in the context of three e-scooter risk behaviors: riding over the speed limit on footpaths, riding without a helmet, and riding after consuming alcohol, as well as a risk identity implicit association test. Participants then recorded their willingness to engage in each of the three behaviors. Results The model predicted a modest portion of variance in willingness to engage in each of the three e-scooter risk behaviors. Subjective norm predicted all behaviors, while attitude, risk perceptions, and perceived behavioral control each predicted two of the three behaviors. Gender had a significant total effect on willingness for each behavior, partially mediated by the theory of planned behavior constructs, while knowledge of laws had minimal effects and only on helmet use. Conclusions Social cognition factors show promise in explaining willingness to engage in dangerous e-scooter use and may provide an important formative basis for future research and behavior change interventions to reduce such risky behaviors.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of methamphetamine use and dependence: A systematic review on the cognitive-behavioural implications for road safety,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.002,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Methamphetamine (MA) users are over-represented in vehicle crash statistics but under-represented in the road safety research literature. This systematic review evaluates the current research base relating to MA use and its associated cognitive-behavioural outcomes; and aims to discuss the implications that these findings may have towards driving and future road safety research directions. Following PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted on research studies using six different databases. Inclusion criteria were acute and chronic MA use in humans, with outcome variables relating to cognitive performance, behavioural tendencies, or psychopathology. Primary exclusion criteria included outcomes that were not directly translatable to road safety outcomes (e.g., health) or very specific samples that may have confounded the effects of MA use (e.g., prisoners). In total, 101 publications met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The literature showed that firstly, acute use (but not abuse) of MA may lead to cognitive enhancements, although these findings are not likely translatable to real-world use. Secondly, evidence suggested that chronic MA use is associated with cognitive impairments, self-regulatory difficulties, and increased aggression, suggesting that MA users may be at a significantly increased risk on the road, in a variety of domains. In addition, chronic MA use has been linked to a range of psychological issues (e.g., psychosis; anxiety; depression), which may exacerbate the negative cognitive-behavioural effects of MA. Finally, abstinence from MA was shown to reduce the aversive impacts of chronic MA use, although cognitive improvements have been demonstrated to take much longer, compared to behavioural and psychopathology conditions. The limitations associated with the current MA literature base were evaluated and methodological suggestions were made for future research to better understand the effect of MA use patterns on driving performance and behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Text-based information design for in-vehicle displays: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.025,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Reading short texts at a brief glance behaviour has been increasing, especially in the in-vehicle interface of the multitask context of driving.

Different smartphone tasks and traffic complexity affect pedestrian awareness of co-existing road objects and cerebral oxygenation during shared space walking,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.019,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Distraction, primarily owing to the widespread use of cell phones and mobile devices while walking, is a contributing factor to pedestrian injuries. Pedestrians distracted by smartphones exhibit decreased situational awareness, influenced by the nature of concurrent tasks. However, little is known about the neural correlations between smartphone use and pedestrian responses to safety–critical events in a walking environment. This study recruited 30 young adults to investigate pedestrians’ ability to selectively respond to road objects while using smartphones (texting and reading) while walking in an immersive virtual environment system. The level of traffic complexity for the road conditions was manipulated by varying the number of safety–critical road objects coexisting in the environment at any given time and the number of required responses to the number of objects. During each 7-min task condition, cerebral oxygenation was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, smartphone task performance, response times to road objects, and perceived workload were also measured. The participants exhibited reduced texting speed and reading performance when responding sequentially to coexisting road objects. Compared with other road conditions, those requiring two responses to four objects resulted in an increased workload and longer object response times. Participants perceived a higher workload in conditions involving tasks with smartphones than those without smartphones. More importantly, increased concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex were observed when participants were concurrently performing smartphone and pedestrian tasks. Compared to smartphone reading, smartphone texting induced greater cerebral oxygenation in the bilateral frontopolar cortex. These results suggest that continuously texting while walking may demand additional cognitive resources for executive function. The findings of this study represent an initial step towards elucidating the cognitive mechanisms underlying attentional impairments experienced during smartphone distraction and working towards a viable solution to mitigate pedestrian risk.",1369-8478,Not found
Examining the impact of different LED road stud layouts on driving performance and gaze behaviour at night-time,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.024,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The risks associated with night-time driving on dimly lit roads are substantial and are attributable to the limitations of human visual abilities. As a result, drivers often struggle to distinguish road geometry from ordinary road markings, thus increasing the likelihood of mistakes. These circumstances contribute to a 60 % higher likelihood of road crashes compared to daytime conditions. To mitigate these risks, active LED road studs, which previous studies have shown to have a positive influence on driving performance, can be used. However, there remains a gap in research regarding the optimal arrangement of these studs along road markings for an improvement in driver behaviour and traffic safety. In this study, we assessed the influence of five different LED road stud layouts (unlit, edge, centre, edge-centre, and lane) during night-time driving on two-lane rural highways with curves of different radii (120, 210, 300, 440 m) and directions (left, right). Following a within subject design, thirty-five participants drove in a simulator along a road track with 8 spiralled curves (4 radii × 2 directions) linked to straights. We monitored the longitudinal (i.e., speed), transversal (i.e., lateral position and standard deviation of lateral position) and gaze behaviours. Our findings indicate that the presence of LED road studs promotes safer driving, by helping drivers to adjust their speed when negotiating curves. Transversal behaviour analysis revealed layout-dependent effects on lateral position. The presence of road studs both at the lane centreline and edge allows drivers to maintain centred trajectories and improve steering control. Gaze behaviour analysis uncovered interesting patterns, demonstrating a strong correlation between road stud layout and the driver's focus on specific road targets. Illuminated markings prompt drivers to concentrate their gaze on distinct points, subsequently altering their transversal behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
"Sociodemographic, contextual and psychological factors predicting secondary task engagement: A nationwide interview study among car drivers in Germany",10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.008,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"One of the leading causes of crashes is the distraction of drivers caused by performing secondary tasks. This study investigated the impact of sociodemographic, contextual factors, and driver characteristics on secondary task engagement while driving in Germany. We conducted a nationwide face-to-face semi-standardized interview study with car drivers in Germany. In total, 1,072 drivers were interviewed. The data of 949 drivers were included in the analysis. Overall, they reported 2,146 secondary tasks. Drivers performed, on average, 2.3 non-driving-related activities (SD = 1.7) during the last 30 min of their trip. Consistent with previous findings, the presence of passengers was associated with a decrease in the amount of other secondary tasks, especially on the mobile phone. Young drivers (<25 years), in particular, were twice as likely to undertake secondary activities on the phone compared to older ones. Among drivers with a high mobile phone addiction score, tasks on the mobile phone were significantly more likely to be performed while driving. During longer trips, more secondary activities are performed within the last 30 min than during short trips (<30 min). Surprisingly, the purpose of the trip also has a significant influence insofar as trips for leisure activities, in particular, are more frequently associated with secondary activities than shopping and business trips. The results of this study help to determine better crash probabilities based on influencing factors, which in turn should form the basis for specific customised information and educational campaigns.",1369-8478,Not found
Heart rate variability as an indicator of fatigue: A structural equation model approach,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.015,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Driver fatigue significantly impairs performance and is a major risk factor for road crashes. However, fatigue is difficult to objectively measure and quantify. This study aimed to elucidate associations between heart rate variability (HRV) metrics and multidimensional fatigue construct encompassing objective and subjective measures in young drivers with self-reported short sleep. Eighty-four young adults underwent assessments during simulated driving. HRV indices RMSSD and LF/HF ratio were derived from an electrocardiogram, while relative Theta power, oculography drowsiness, lane position variability, and Karolinska Sleepiness Score measured fatigue. RMSSD negatively correlated with Theta power, and LF/HF ratio positively correlated with position variability. Exploratory factor analysis extracted three factors, with RMSSD and LF/HF loading onto one. Structural equation modelling tested the prediction of a latent fatigue construct from HRV. Two models demonstrated an acceptable fit. RMSSD negatively predicted fatigue, explaining 6.4 % of the variance, while the LF/HF ratio positively predicted fatigue, accounting for 3.7 % of the variance. In summary, HRV, particularly RMSSD, showed significant relationships with multidimensional fatigue. Lower RMSSD and higher LF/HF ratio are associated with greater fatigue levels. This study demonstrates that HRV indices exhibit significant relationships within a multidimensional model of fatigue incorporating objective performance, ocular, and subjective measures. The findings provide initial evidence towards using HRV for monitoring complex manifestations of fatigue, rather than single dimensions. Further applied research should investigate translating these findings to naturalistic settings and validating HRV thresholds predictive of on-road impairment.",1369-8478,Not found
Does recognizability of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) platoons affect drivers’ behavior and safety?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.021,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Platoons of connected and automated Vehicles (CAVs) comprising both passenger cars and trucks are expected to appear on highways in the coming years. Though prior studies explored driver behaviors in the presence of CAV platoons, it remains unknown whether it is necessary for a traditional vehicle’s driver to recognize CAV platoons in a mixed traffic environment for safe maneuvering. This study aims to test the hypothesis that drivers behave differently when interacting with recognizable CAV platoons compared to interacting with non-recognizable CAV platoons. A driving simulator experiment was conducted featuring four merging and diverging scenarios. Participants were informed beforehand that blue-colored vehicles driving with short gaps would be CAV platoons. However, they also encountered CAV platoons consisting of several vehicles with different colors (not blue). The blue-colored platoon was considered as recognizable CAV platoons and the latter as non-recognizable CAV platoons. Performance indicators including speed, maximum acceleration and deceleration, standard deviation (SD) of speed and acceleration, and time-to-collision (TTC) were considered to examine drivers’ behavior. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach was applied to evaluate the effect of recognizability and demographic characteristics on driver performance. The GEE results revealed significant improvement in drivers’ behavior in the presence of recognizable CAV platoons. The merging SD of speed and acceleration were around 32% and 29% lower, respectively in the presence of recognizable CAV platoons. The merging TTC was around 20% higher in the presence of recognizable CAV platoons. Although no significant main effect of recognizability was found for diverging maneuvers, a noteworthy result was that male drivers had around 37% higher diverging TTC than female drivers in the presence of recognizable CAV platoons. The findings also suggested significant effects of gender, age, driving experience, and education on driver performance while merging, as well as effect of gender and prior crash involvement on driver performance while diverging. These findings provide valuable insights to transportation planning authorities in determining the potential need for making CAV platoons recognizable and developing associated guidelines for safer traffic movements in mixed traffic environments.",1369-8478,Not found
Designing user interfaces for partially automated Vehicles: Effects of information and modality on trust and acceptance,10.1016/j.trf.2024.02.009,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Trust and perceived safety are pivotal in the acceptance of automated vehicles and can be enhanced by providing users with automation information on the (safe) operation of the vehicle. This study aims to identify how user interfaces (UI) can enhance drivers' trust and acceptance and reduce perceived risk in partially automated vehicles. Four interfaces were designed with different levels of complexity. These levels were achieved by combining automation information (surrounding information vs surrounding and manoeuvre information) and modality (visual vs visual and auditory). These interfaces were evaluated in a driving simulator in which a partially automated vehicle reacted to an event of a merging and braking vehicle in its front. The criticality of the events was manipulated by the factors merging gap (in meters) and deceleration (m/s2) of the vehicle in front. The reaction of the automation was either to brake or to change lanes. The results show that an optimal combination of automation information and modality enhances drivers' trust and acceptance. More specifically, the most advanced UI, which provided surrounding and manoeuvre information via the visual and auditory modalities, was associated with the highest trust and acceptance ranking and the lowest perceived risk. Manoeuvre information delivered through the auditory modality was particularly effective in enhancing trust and acceptance. The benefits of the UIs were consistent over events. However, in the most critical events, drivers did not feel entirely safe and did not trust the automation completely. This study suggests that the design of UIs for partially automated vehicles shall include automation information via visual and auditory modalities.",1369-8478,Not found
"Improving interest in public, active, and shared travel modes through nudging interventions",10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.020,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Nudging is a popular approach to changing behavior by designing interventions to encourage, for instance, sustainable or healthy actions without necessarily limiting freedom of choice. Nudging could show particular potential in changing travel behavior by providing governments with softer policy options to reduce the negative impacts of private vehicles in urban areas. This study examines the efficacy of nudging in changing interest in using public transport, active modes, and carsharing in Flanders, Belgium (n = 292), focusing on moral nudges, highlighting individual and social benefits, and norm nudges, using social pressure to promote appropriate behavior, through independent and paired sample t-tests, ANOVA mean-comparison tests, and multiple linear regression models. Results indicate that moral nudging is effective overall, but particularly for improving interest in carsharing, potentially providing an option for individuals wanting to make environmentally and socially conscious choices without drastically changing their lifestyles. Norm nudging was effective for public transport and especially active travel, indicating that mobility cultures and social acceptance are important to these modes. Attitudes toward public transport and carsharing were important to nudge susceptibility. Women might have greater concerns about making environmentally moral choices, resulting in higher moral nudge susceptibility, particularly for active travel, and trips taken with companions might be more easily swayed toward active modes. Those with greater time flexibility who are younger might be a target group for carsharing, especially when influenced by moral arguments, while older retired and full-time employed individuals may not be willing to give up their private cars and carsharing may not be practical for families with children. Nudging might be effective in changing travel behavior in conjunction with other policy measures to promote sustainable and healthy transport, ideally through a nudge unit to test, advise, and implement these subtle nudges. Further, the location, quality of transport services, and geographical density of cities are crucial aspects regarding the effectiveness of nudges in real-life scenarios.",1369-8478,Not found
Interpreting pedestrians' head movements when encountering automated vehicles at a virtual crossroad,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.022,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"In the future, Automated Vehicles (AVs) may be able to use pedestrians’ head movement patterns to understand their crossing intentions. This ability of the AV to predict pedestrian crossing intention will improve road safety in mixed traffic situations and may also enhance traffic flow, allowing the vehicle to gradually reduce its speed in advance of a yield, eliminating the need for a complete and erratic halt. To date, most of the work conducted on studying pedestrian head movements has been based on observation studies. To further our understanding in this area, this study examined pedestrians' head movements when interacting with AVs during a range of road crossing scenarios, developed in a VR environment. Thirty-eight participants took part in this CAVE-based pedestrian simulator study. Head movements were recorded using stereoscopic motion-tracking glasses, as pedestrians crossed the road in response to an AV which approached from the right (UK-based road). A zebra crossing was included in half of the trials to understand how it affected crossing behaviour. The effect of different approaching speeds of the AV, and the presence of an external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI), on head movements and crossing behaviour was also studied. Results showed that the absolute head-turning rate (change in pedestrians' head-turning angle, per frame) increased significantly at around 1 s before a crossing initiation, reaching a peak at the crossing initiation, where pedestrians presented a “last-second check” before the crossing decision. Another increase in absolute head-turning rate to the right was seen at the end of the crossing (∼1.5 s after crossing initiation), to check the proximity of the approaching vehicle. A higher rate of head-turning was also seen for AV-non-yielding scenarios. Finally, the least number of head turns was seen for the yielding conditions which included an eHMI, in the presence of the zebra crossing. These results show the value of infrastructural and vehicle-based cues in assisting pedestrians’ crossing decisions and provide an insight into how head-turning behaviour can be used by AVs to better predict pedestrians’ crossing intentions in urban settings.",1369-8478,Not found
How to resolve the contradiction between driving safety and lighting energy conservation in a highway tunnel? − An experiment on linear guiding system,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.018,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"High rates of traffic accidents and lighting energy consumption are significant problems in highway tunnels. To address these problems, this study proposes a linear guiding system that uses line-shaped visual guiding facilities to improve the local luminance and contrast, and outlines the tunnel contour and road alignment. In addition, the principle, function, setting method, and composition of the linear guiding system are discussed. Using the existing highway tunnels as prototypes, we built simulation scenarios with different luminance and conducted driving simulation experiments and questionnaire surveys. We analysed the human factor demands of tunnel driving, studied the change rule of various human factor indicators under different luminance levels, and comprehensively evaluated the impact of linear guiding system on driving safety from multiple perspectives of the driver’s vision, psychology, and behaviour. We introduce the concept of equivalent luminance, quantify the impact of linear guiding system on the driver, and explore the role of linear guiding system in energy conservation. The results showed that the linear guiding system has a positive effect on driver vision, psychology, and behaviour, particularly in low-luminance environments. A linear guiding system can optimise a driver’s visual reference frame, enhance driver visual perception in a tunnel environment, and alleviate driver tension. It helps drivers to accurately perceive their own spatial position and speed, providing a good sense of position, speed, and comfort. A 2.3 cd/m2 luminance highway tunnel with a linear guiding system is equivalent to a 4 cd/m2 luminance traditional tunnel. For highway tunnels with luminance values of 4, 5, 6, and 7 cd/m2, the equivalent luminance values of the linear guiding system are 1.7, 1.8, 1.8, and 2.1 cd/m2 respectively, which can reduce the energy consumption by 30–42 %.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving patterns in connected environments: A case study of intersection-approaching behavior of professional and non-professional drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.014,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The in-vehicle communication provides promising opportunities to improve the road safety and traffic efficiency. Previous studies demonstrated that the professional drivers have better driving skills than the non-professional drivers who allocate more attention to secondary tasks. However, they may not be sensitive to the new in-vehicle technology. In addition, these qualitative studies failed to elaborate on the visual and response behavior differences among different driver groups (professional drivers such as taxi, bus, motorcoach, and non-professional drivers), and lacked the quantitative analysis of driving patterns in a new environment. This paper explores the differences in visual interaction, response characteristics, driving performance, and behavior patterns between the professional and non-professional drivers in the connected environment through a case study of intersection-approaching behavior using a driving simulator. More precisely, two driving scenarios (baseline and human–machine interface (HMI)) were designed in the driving simulator, and 65 participants, including 34 professional drivers and 31 non-professional drivers, completed the experiment. In the HMI scenario, the driver was provided with the signal light phase and phase transition remaining time of the current intersection. This paper also proposes a driving pattern extraction model based on the Bayesian non-parametric method combined with a text clustering algorithm to perform a quantitative description of the driving patterns. The results show that the professional drivers tend to interact less with the HMI compared with the non-professional drivers. Moreover, the professional drivers’ first gaze at the HMI occurs and responds earlier. The proposed driving model can effectively describe 7 patterns of intersection-approaching behavior. The connected information can significantly improve the efficiency of the intersection traffic and the driving behavior. However, the professional drivers are more responsive and behave more consistently. This study can provide insights into the development of personalized assisted driving systems, as the two driving populations differ in their interactions, responses, and behavioral patterns.",1369-8478,Not found
For whom is sharing really scaring? capturing unobserved heterogeneity in perceived comfort when cycling in shared spaces,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.017,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Shared spaces for active mobility prioritize the safety and comfort of vulnerable road users by segregating them from motorized vehicles. However, the diverse speed regimes of pedestrians and cyclists can lead to encounters that may affect their comfort. In addition, the very perception of comfort may vary across individuals depending on their demographics, and therefore the determinants of comfort and their effects may not be fixed across all individuals. Despite these complexities, there is limited research in understanding the heterogeneous interactions between cyclists and other road users in shared spaces. To bridge this gap, we conducted an intercept survey complemented by an experimental section involving 594 cyclists in Sweden. This study focuses on gaining insights into cyclists' experiences, particularly their comfort levels during 'passing' and 'meeting' events with other road users in shared spaces. We then used the collected data to develop a random effect latent class ordered probit model to scrutinize the determinants of cycling comfort in passing and meeting scenarios. The latent class specification is employed to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the data. Findings reveal that female cyclists generally perceive less comfort compared to their male counterparts in both scenarios. Passing events have a more negative impact on older adults, leading to less comfort compared to younger cyclists. We also found that previous cycling experience increases comfort in shared facilities, particularly for older adults. These results highlight the intricate nature of perceived comfort in interactions, particularly concerning demographic characteristics, contributing to the promotion of user diversity in shared spaces.",1369-8478,Not found
Music as a countermeasure to fatigue: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.016,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Listening to music while driving is a commonly adopted fatigue-coping strategy, yet its effectiveness has been explored in only a limited number of studies. Here, we aim to evaluate its impact on passive task-related driving fatigue, as measured by a set of both objective and subjective indicators. A driving simulator experiment was conducted involving 60 participants, who completed a 50-minute driving task on a monotonous highway scenario. The participants were divided into a control group, which did not listen to any music, and an experimental group, which drove for 20 min without music and then listened to a self-selected music playlist played at the preferred intensity for the remaining 30 min. Results show that music had a positive acute effect on objective measurements of driving fatigue. However, this effect was transient (15–25 min duration), and more prominently observed in subjective measures of fatigue. An exploratory analysis of song features suggests that higher intensity, higher tempo, more danceable, and less instrumental music tend to be more effective. These findings indicate that listening to music can serve as a viable short-term countermeasure to driving fatigue.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of the presence and utilization policy of a dedicated lane on drivers’ preference to use automation and driving behaviour on motorways,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.013,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Dedicated Lanes (DLs) have been proposed as a potential alternative for the deployment of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to facilitate platooning and increase motorway capacity. However, the impact of the presence and utilization policy of such a lane on drivers’ preference to use automation and their behaviour has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this study, a driving simulator experiment is conducted, where participants drive a CAV in the presence of a DL with different utilization policies. Drivers have the possibility to choose between driving in an automated mode or in a manual mode. In automated mode they could adjust the driving speed and time headway and initiate automated lane changes. Two utilization policies were examined: mandatory versus optional use of DLs when driving in an automated mode. The impact of the presence and utilization policy of the DL on drivers’ preference to use automation and their behaviour in car-following and lane changing are investigated. The study found that while the presence of a DL does not increase drivers’ preference for automation use, it encourages drivers to utilize the DL more when the utilization policy is mandatory (i.e., drivers can only use automation mode when driving on this lane). Furthermore, drivers are more conservative in automated mode and when driving in mixed traffic. However, they perform closer car-following and merge into smaller gaps when driving on DLs which on one hand can increase the capacity of the DLs, but on the other hand can increase the risk of collisions. These results are useful for road operators, and in setting-up a more realistically traffic simulation studies.",1369-8478,Not found

In this onsite driving experiment, 34 urban residents completed seven driving tasks on different urban road routes in a randomized order with one-day intervals. A total of 238 tasks were conducted, each lasting an hour, assessing psychophysiological, visual, and muscular fatigue. A cardiovascular activity monitor (BioHarness) continuously measured the driver's heart rate, with lower rates indicating reduced psychophysiological fatigue. Visual and muscular fatigue were self-reported using a Visual Analog Scale questionnaire administered before, at the midpoint, and after completing the driving task. Deep transfer learning semantic segmentation analyzed road landscape characteristics and traffic conditions recorded from the drivers' view. Statistical analysis demonstrated that higher mean and variation in greenness significantly predicted lower psychophysiological fatigue after adjusting for multiple covariates. These results indicate that enhancing both the quantity and diversity of green landscapes along urban roads is vital for reducing driver's psychophysiological fatigue. This study reveals that roadside landscapes in urban settings are not trivial decorations, and they should be considered an essential component of transportation infrastructure.",1369-8478,Not found
Will automated vehicles encourage more jaywalking? Results from a stated preference survey,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.011,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"When interacting with driverless cars, pedestrians might be emboldened to jaywalk knowing the vehicles will slow down for them automatically. Increased jaywalking might disrupt traffic flow and pose challenges for traffic law enforcement. Few studies examined pedestrians’ attitudes toward driverless cars’ safety implication, management strategies for the interactions between pedestrians and driverless cars, and how pedestrians would expect their street crossing behavior to change in the presence of driverless cars. We conducted an online stated preference survey of 1,000 residents in the Philadelphia and the Seattle metropolitan areas to investigate respondents’ attitudes toward driverless cars and their preferences of jaywalking under different driverless car saturation levels. Through descriptive data analysis and multilevel binomial logit analysis, we found that overall pedestrians felt less safe with driverless cars on the road. Pedestrians preferred limiting the speeds of driverless cars or disabling driverless functions in areas with heavy pedestrian traffic to increasing enforcement for jaywalking laws. Multilevel binomial logit analysis showed pedestrians were more likely to jaywalk in the presence of driverless cars in high visibility and low traffic volume, and were deterred by bigger, faster streets. Respondents’ current crossing behavior might serve as an indicator of their crossing behavior in the presence of driverless cars. Our findings remind cities that sound street design strategies could help to ensure safer interactions between pedestrians and driverless cars and greater acceptance of driverless cars on urban streets.",1369-8478,Not found
Pedestrians’ responses to scalable automated vehicles with different external human-machine interfaces: Evidence from a video-based eye-tracking experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.005,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"To enhance the efficiency and safety of interactions with pedestrians, numerous external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) concepts for automated vehicles (AVs) have been proposed and evaluated, predominately based on singular pedestrian-AV interaction scenarios. This leaves a gap in comprehending the efficiency and robustness of eHMIs during interactions with scalable AVs. To bridge the gap, this study pioneers an exploration of pedestrians' road-crossing decisions, perceived clarity, and gaze behaviour during synchronous interactions with multiple AVs equipped with different eHMIs. An eye-tracking experiment was conducted, involving 48 video stimuli depicting two AVs (with yielding patterns and eHMIs manipulated) approaching a predetermined road-crossing location from the same side of a two-way, four-lane, un-signalized road. Each yielding AV will present one of four eHMI manipulations (i.e., light band, smiling expression, pedestrian symbol, and no eHMI as baseline), resulting in 16 unique eHMI combinations and video stimuli. Eighty-seven participants were recruited and tasked to respond to approaching AVs, during which their road-crossing decision time, perceived clarity, and gaze metrics were recorded. Findings revealed that different eHMIs across AVs were associated with prolonged road-crossing decision times, diminished perceived clarity, and intensified visual attention as evidenced by increased fixation counts and durations. Regarding AVs equipped with the same eHMIs, the pedestrian symbol-based eHMIs resulted in heightened clarity perception, reduced crossing decision times and visual engagement, in contrast to eHMIs presented in abstract light bands or smiling expressions. Furthermore, for eHMI-different AVs, those featuring only one eHMI within AVL-AVR pairs were perceived as less clear, eliciting heightened visual cognitive load and decision times. Integration of a pedestrian symbol-based eHMI in AVL-AVR configurations garnered superior clarity ratings and facilitated time savings. These findings of this pioneering study provide insights for eHMI design for future AVs in complex traffic scenarios with scalable road users.",1369-8478,Not found
From self-reports to observations: Unraveling digital billboard influence on drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.010,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The objective of this current study was to evaluate the impact of digital billboards (DBs) on self-reported and observed driving behavior, given their established association with distracted driving. This investigation focused on driver behavior in Iran using a dual-pronged approach. Initially, self-reported driving behavior was analyzed using a Driving Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), which was completed online by 453 drivers. The factor analysis of the questionnaire data emphasized the significant role of DBs in generating driving errors, lapses, unintentional violations, and intentional violations. The DBQ questions exhibited a clear factor structure, demonstrating high factor loadings and satisfactory internal stability. The findings indicated that advertising signages notably influenced drivers' behavior, particularly in instances of neglecting the behavior of the leading vehicle's driver (Lapse), disregarding pedestrian crossings (Error), disregarding red lights (Intentional violation), and overtaking without considering traffic flow behind (Unintentional violation). Subsequently, participants engaged in an Instrumented Vehicle Study (IVS) to explore observed driver behavior when encountering DBs (899 samples). Four factors were identified as significantly influencing the likelihood of driver distraction: the driver's crash history, time of day, driver's age, and road type. A logistic regression analysis was conducted using the IVS data, revealing that drivers with prior crash experience approached DBs with 8.8 times more caution than those without such a history. Moreover, young adults were 8.25 times more susceptible to distraction from DBs compared to their older counterparts. Notably, the findings suggested that drivers were nearly four times more prone to distraction at night compared to daytime. Additionally, drivers were twice as likely to be distracted at intersections compared to other road types. The outcomes of this study can offer insights for policy interventions regarding the content and placement of DBs, aiming to minimize their impact on road safety while still enabling advertisers to target their intended audience.",1369-8478,Not found

Two mental workload indexes (Frontal Theta/Parietal Alpha and Frontal Midline Theta) and a mental fatigue index (Alpha + Theta/Beta) were calculated using the band powers. Drivers were found to experience a higher mental workload in road sections with heavy traffic and variable road parameters by analyzing EEG data in real traffic. The correlation coefficients between the fatigue index and the two workload indexes were found to be 0.577 and 0.678, respectively. The workload decreased with increasing driving experience.

Florida teen driver crash risk factors and injury severity before and during COVID-19 pandemic: An application of structural equation modeling,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.003,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Motor vehicle injuries and deaths among adolescents are a significant public health concern in need of persistent attention. During the COVID-19 pandemic, standard traffic safety procedures and policies, including driver licensing systems, were changed, but little is known about whether the changes affected crash outcomes among teen drivers. The purpose of this study was to establish a baseline of teen driver crash factors, including driver/passenger characteristics, vehicle types, roadway conditions, and crash levels. The study then sought to determine injury severity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using 2018–2021 Florida traffic crash data. For data analysis, a Mediation Model (MM), a type of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), was used to investigate the pathway impact among teen crash factors. In addition, temporal instability was explored to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the study period. Results indicate that impaired/aggressive driving (especially drug-related), non-restraint use, rural indicators, dark conditions, head-on collisions, and risky behaviors from other drivers (i.e., distraction and speeding) were statistically significant factors associated with teen driver severe injuries (p-value < 0.01). Further, the presence of peer passengers showed a positive impact by reducing distraction of teen drivers (p-value < 0.01), subsequently resulting in the decreased likelihood of teen drivers’ contributing actions and severe injuries (p-value < 0.01). Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of teen drivers involved in Florida traffic crashes in 2020 was reduced by about 22.6 percent compared to previous years. However, fatalities in teen crashes increased by approximately 17 percent during 2020–2021 compared to before COVID-19 (2018–2019).

Results The traffic density (n = 6), traffic behavior(n = 6), and traffic control (n = 4) are the main traffic situation factors; the road type (n = 14) and geometric design (n = 6) are the main road condition factors; weather, light, and landscape conditions (n = 6) are the external driving environment factors; and the air quality, in-vehicle devices (n = 7), and trust and takeover problems caused by human–machine interaction (n = 16) are the internal environment factors. These impacts on DS are reflected in the behavior of drivers, as well as their physiological and psychological states. Conclusion The future experiments must be conducted with multi-dimensional tasks, and multi-modal fusion methods; more abundant research is needed to explore the impacts of the high complexity of urban traffic and landscapes, the interactions between drivers and assisted driving systems, as well as the mixed driving mode of autonomous and manual vehicles on DS. Based on the different generation mechanisms of DS under different conditions, strategies, and suggestions for the alleviation of DS are proposed from the perspectives of driving assistance, traffic control, and landscape construction.",1369-8478,Not found
"From young to old: The effects of information presentation type, multimodal display, and age on situation awareness and processing time in automated vehicles",10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.002,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Research has revealed that conditionally automated vehicles can adversely affect situation awareness, a crucial factor in ensuring a safe transition of driving control during takeover, particularly for older adults. The objective of this study was to design and test more complex multimodal interfaces capable of delivering critical real-time road information, including obstacle locations, statuses, and lane availability, to effectively assist drivers who may experience age-related cognitive and physical declines, when navigating complex automated systems. This study investigated the effects of displays (single tactile, and visual and tactile combined), information presentation type (instructional, informative, baseline), and age (older and younger adults) on participants’ takeover performance (i.e., information processing time and situation awareness). In general, the utilization of informative information resulted in an enhancement of drivers’ situation awareness and information processing time, compared to when using the instructional information type. Moreover, multimodal displays were associated with faster processing speeds compared to unimodal displays. However, no significant main effect of the display was observed on the level of situation awareness. Likewise, there was no discernible age-related disparity in situation awareness levels. Yet, younger adults exhibited shorter information processing times than older adults. This research aims to improve situation awareness and processing time to help drivers, especially older adults, prevent time-critical accidents during the takeover process in automated driving. The findings from this study may inform the design of next-generation in-vehicle human–machine interfaces.",1369-8478,Not found
Influence of straylight on simulated driving performance,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.020,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Purpose This study aimed to investigate how an increase in straylight (SL) affects the driving capability of healthy volunteers in various simulated driving circumstances. Methods Participants were asked to (virtually) drive along a certain course in a driving simulator in four conditions: a regular drive (baseline), a drive in the presence of a glare source and a drive in the presence of a glare source while wearing two types of straylight filters (SLF1 and SLF2). The driving scenario included six different driving events (e.g. pedestrian crossing the road). The van den Berg straylight meter (Oculus C-Quant) was used to quantify the glare experienced by participants. Results Twenty-one participants between the ages of 19 and 38 were included. There were significant differences in straylight measurements between the baseline and while wearing SLF1 and SLF2 (1.09 ± 0.05, 1.34 ± 0.04 and 1.49 ± 0.02, respectively; ANOVA: P < 0.001). Over thirty driving parameters were analysed and significant effects of increased straylight was predominantly observed in the parameters pertaining to the events closest to the glare source (e.g., stationary motorcycle in the middle of the road). In those situations, significant increases in detection and reaction times were observed, as well as in stopping distance. In addition, increased glare hindrance prompted drivers to significantly reduce their speed. Conclusion This experiment assessed how straylight, a visual parameter, affects driving behaviour and found that increased straylight leads to impairments in specific driving conditions, but also with some adaptions through compensatory strategies. These observations highlight the importance of straylight measurements to assess driving capability, particularly in those with glare-related impairments.",1369-8478,Not found
From Visions to Reality: Investigating the Interplay of Vehicle Kinematics and Light-band eHMI in a Real Vehicle Study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.004,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Highly automated vehicles (HAVs) will interact with pedestrians in urban environments. This requires efficient communication tools to ensure mutual understanding. Past research showed that pedestrians mostly used vehicle kinematics to communicate with vehicles, e.g., the vehicle’s speed and distance. However, pedestrians required further explicit communication signals when the traffic situation was ambiguous. Light-band external human–machine interfaces (eHMIs) transmit additional explicit communication signals to pedestrians, e.g., the vehicle’s yielding intent. To this point, the precise interplay of vehicle kinematics and eHMIs for HAVs has not yet been determined. Nevertheless, previous research showed that combining both means of communication has great potential to increase pedestrian perceived safety and to ensure a safe interaction. Only a little research used real vehicle studies to investigate the interaction between pedestrians and HAVs in a close-to-reality experimental setting. However, this would ensure the transferability of experimental results to future urban traffic. Therefore, this study aimed to address this research gap by investigating the effects of vehicle kinematics, eHMIs, and their interplay in a real-world pedestrian crossing on pedestrians’ behaviors and subjective evaluations. In this field experiment, we applied a light-band eHMI on a Wizard-of-Oz test vehicle, an actual vehicle instructed as an HAV. We investigated the effects of vehicle kinematics (early yielding vs. late yielding) and the eHMI status (no eHMI, static eHMI, dynamic eHMI) on pedestrians’ crossing behavior and subjective evaluation in a low-speed real-world setting. The static eHMI displayed the vehicle automation status by a static illuminated eHMI. The dynamic eHMI conveyed the automation status and the vehicle’s yielding intent. This study focused particularly on the interplay of vehicle kinematics and eHMI status. We assumed that the crossing initiation was shorter when a dynamic eHMI was combined with an early yielding compared to a late yielding in this real-world setting. Moreover, we hypothesized that pedestrians’ subjective evaluations are more positive for a well-coordinated interplay of eHMI and vehicle kinematics. The results showed that pedestrians initiated their crossing earlier with dynamic eHMI vs. no eHMI or static eHMI. Furthermore, they perceived a dynamic eHMI as safer and more trustworthy compared to no eHMI or a static eHMI. Combining an early yielding and dynamic eHMI increased participants’ perceived safety of the vehicle behavior and trust and improved pedestrians’ affective evaluations compared to a late yielding with dynamic eHMI. Overall, this real vehicle study highlighted the importance of implicit and explicit communication signals and their well-coordinated interplay for pedestrians’ future interactions with HAVs in a real-world setting.",1369-8478,Not found
Safety evaluation and prediction of takeover performance in automated driving considering drivers’ cognitive load: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.021,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Automated vehicles alleviate the need for driver attention and control. However, a takeover request (TOR) to the driver remains essential for emergencies and safety–critical scenarios beyond automation's capability. Thus, accessing drivers’ safety performance in various TOR scenarios is crucial for conditionally automated driving (SAE L3). However, TOR safety performance is seldom examined concerning drivers' cognitive load, despite its presumed relevance to TOR scenarios and human–machine interaction. Moreover, the adequacy of the time window preceding a TOR, critical for TOR safety prediction, remains inadequately explored. This study aims to assess safety performance across diverse TOR scenarios in Level 3 conditional automation, incorporating drivers’ cognitive load, and predict TOR safety by considering the time window's impact. A driving simulator experiment gathered eye movement and driving behavior data from 37 recruited participants. Participants were instructed to take control of the vehicle from automated driving within a time budget (TB) of 3 s or 7 s in obstacle avoidance (OA) or lane keeping (LK) scenarios while engaging in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). Participants’ subjective cognitive load in the different TOR scenarios was scaled using NASA-TLX. Furthermore, safe TOR performance was predicted utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) across different time window sizes preceding a TOR. The results indicate that: 1) cognitive loads in takeover scenarios ranked from highest to lowest as TB = 3s_OA, TB = 3s_LK, TB = 7s_OA, TB = 7s_LK; and the cognitive loads of the NDRTs ranked from highest to lowest as mistake finding, texting, chatting, monitoring; 2) the takeover safety performance in the four scenarios from lowest to highest was TB = 3s_OA, TB = 3s_LK, TB = 7s_OA, TB = 7s_LK; likewise, the takeover safety performance during the four NDRTs ranked from lowest to highest as mistake finding, monitoring, texting, chatting; 3) the time window size before the TORs significantly affected the prediction performance of the model. A 30-second window was recommended as optimal for predicting takeover safety using the CNN model, achieving an average F1 score of 0.8120 and 81.98 % accuracy. This study's findings enhance our comprehension of driving behavior characteristics during TOR and offer valuable insights for detecting driver states in conditionally automated driving contexts.",1369-8478,Not found
Victim blaming in police road injury prevention messages? A case of bicycle helmets,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.001,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Introduction In recent years, the way in which police and the media report on road crashes, especially those involving cyclists, has received increased attention from both researchers and the general public. They are often accused of engaging in victim blaming. The aim of this study was to analyze the perceived level of victim blaming in six hypothetical scenarios that include a preventive measure communicated by police. Our main focus was on the bicycle helmet scenario, since discussions about bicycle helmets produce a lot of emotional responses. Methods We collected survey data from two samples: a representative sample of Finnish residents older than 17 years (N=1207) and a convenience sample of Finnish traffic safety experts (N=61). Results Overall victim blaming ratings were low in both samples. Education seems to be an important predictor, in that more educated respondents gave lower ratings. In the bicycle helmet scenario, cycling exposure was positively related to the perceived victim blaming ratings. Conclusions We conclude that a preventive measure aimed at potential future road crash victims will not be perceived as victim blaming if it also addresses those responsible for a crash. However, it seems there will always be groups, sub-groups, and individuals who may perceive such messages as victim blaming. Thus, constructing a preventive message which will not be perceived as victim blaming represents a challenge.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of situational factors known to elicit anger on the willingness to take over the driving activity in a highly automated vehicle: A scenario-based study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.014,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Motor vehicle accidents, in part due to human error, continue to cause significant fatalities, a situation that automated vehicles can address when users relinquish driving. However, when the human behind the wheel decides to take over the driving activity, human error is back in the loop. In the context of improving the safety of motorized transportation, this study examines the role of anger in the willingness to take over the driving activity of an automated vehicle classified as levels 4 to 5 according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). Our study indirectly induces anger by strategically manipulating factors such as motive consistency, agency caused by others, and control potential - factors that are well documented for their role in eliciting anger. Using a scenario-based approach where participants were instructed to catch an emergency train, we manipulated combinations of four factors selected for their association with anger (e.g., late departure × delayed train × reduced speed due to fog × road blocked by another vehicle). Participants (N = 313) were asked to rate their willingness to take over the driving activity as if they were the protagonist. The results showed that the willingness to take over the driving activity aboard a highly automated vehicle could be influenced by emotions, especially anger, elicited by the evaluation of the driving environment. Participants were more willing to take over driving when they judged the driving environment to be inconsistent with the goal of their trip. However, interaction analyses revealed that increasing motive consistency could moderate the negative influences of control potential and other-caused agency on willingness to take over driving. Cluster analysis revealed four distinct subgroups of drivers: High Takeover Willingness, Low Takeover Willingness, Influenced by Other Road Users, and Goal-Directed drivers, each of which showed a unique response to the driving scenarios. This study suggests that understanding the impact of emotions on the willingness to take over driving will help prevent this type of behavior and improve safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Trust in self-driving vehicles is lower than in human drivers when both drive almost perfectly,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.019,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Studies have investigated the determinants of trust in self-driving vehicles (SDVs) and confirmed that the ability to execute the driving task flawlessly is essential to promote trust. However, little is known about the extent to which errors decrease trust in SDVs. This study conducted four experiments (N = 2221) and tested whether people’s trust in SDVs was lower than that in human drivers when they made errors without causing negative events. In Experiments 1 and 2, which manipulated the driving accuracy of the drivers, the participants checked nine different pieces of information that showed accuracy. The results demonstrated that the SDV was less trusted than humans only when there was a slight possibility of making an error. This study did not identify factors explaining lower trust in the SDV. Experiments 3 and 4 consisted of participants watching videos showing that the SDV and human driver made minor errors, such as taking a long time to park. This study showed that the minor errors largely reduced trust, regardless of whether the vehicle was self-driven or driven by humans. These findings imply that errors without describing severe accidents are less likely to cause a gap in trust between SDVs and human drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
Driver heterogeneity in willingness to give control to conditional automation,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.013,103,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Drivers with varying locus of control may exhibit differences in their choices between manually controlling dynamic driving tasks and monitoring the automated vehicle where they act as a “fallback-ready user”. Additionally, response variations in relinquishing control to automated driving are evident, as drivers have diverse preferences for the extent of utilizing driving automation in different situations influenced by their perceived understanding of the automated features. In this study, the driver's willingness to give (WTG) control in conditionally automated driving is objectively assessed in a virtual reality based driving-rig, through their choice to give away driving control and through the extent to which automated driving is adopted during a trip in a mixed-traffic environment. Within- and across-class unobserved heterogeneity and locus of control variations are taken into account. The binary choice of giving away control is estimated through the mixed logit (MIXL) and mixed latent class (LCML) model, having the binary logit as a base mode. The significant latent segments of the locus of control are developed into internalizers and externalizers by the latent class model (LCM) based on the taste heterogeneity identified from the MIXL model. The obtained results highlighted the significant factors influencing the choice and levels of automated driving adoption. Results suggest that drivers choose to ‘giveAway’ control of the vehicle when greater concentration/attentiveness is required (e.g., in the nighttime) or when they are interested in performing a non-driving-related task (NDRT). In addition, it is observed that internalizers demonstrate more heterogeneity compared to externalizers toward the binary choice of WTG in conditional automation.",1369-8478,Not found
Predicting drivers’ intentions to voluntarily use intelligent speed assistance systems: An application of the theory of planned behaviour,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.003,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) could substantially decrease road traffic crashes and is becoming more common in vehicles in high income countries. Increasing ISA adoption and usage is key to realising the potential safety benefits. Therefore, identifying the predictors of intentions to use ISA is important to understanding how to encourage its use via road safety education during roll out. The current study used the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to predict intentions to (i) turn ISA on and (ii) override ISA when turned on among 554 drivers who reported not having ISA currently installed in their vehicle. The TPB explained 76% and 59% of the variance in turning on and overriding intentions respectively. Attitudes were key predictors of both ISA behaviour intentions. Subjective norms predicted intentions to turn on but not override ISA while perceived behavioural control did not independently predict intentions towards either behaviour. Important beliefs included that ISA could reduce the risk of crashes and speeding penalties and fines, and that driving with ISA makes driving more relaxing. The beliefs identified can be targeted in interventions aiming to increase ISA usage and adherence.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of passing rates on driving behaviour in variable speed limit-controlled highways: Evidence of external pressure from a driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.022,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Variable message signs on motorways can show dynamically changing speed limits for traffic safety or efficiency reasons. While the effects of variable speed limits have been studied in the literature, the effect of (drivers in) vehicles operating under different speed limit information − caused by transitioning from one speed limit to another − has received relatively little attention. During such a transition, drivers can either be overtaken by vehicles operating under a higher speed limit, or conversely, drivers overtake slower vehicles operating under a lower speed limit. In both scenarios, opposite forms of external pressure are expected to be exerted by the surrounding traffic. Sixty-seven participants performed three randomised drives (201 drives in total), each reflecting one of three different passing rates scenarios, i.e., the number of vehicles overtaking the driver, or vice versa, caused by a speed limit change. Passing rates varied from as low as 90 veh/h to as high as 360 veh/h. Increasing passing rates act as a proxy for increasing levels of external pressure applied to drivers. Statistical analyses are conducted using a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) and a Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) approach, accounting for correlation caused by the panel nature of the data. The LMM indicates that the driving behaviour indicators are indeed affected under different passing rates and that these differences are statistically significant. Results indicate that drivers in higher passing rate scenario(s) tend to accelerate and drive faster compared to the low(er) passing rate scenario(s). Further, the GEE model for speed selection indicates that drivers from different age groups and gender select different speeds in response to the impact of external pressure caused by surrounding traffic. Similarly, the GEE model for speed variation within a driver suggests differential speed variations of age groups and gender under different passing rates. Overall, this study finds pronounced effects directly related to the imposed external pressure via the surrounding traffic, where high passing rates lead to significant speed variations that increase the chances of drivers engaging in safety-critical events.",1369-8478,Not found
How does hands-free cognitive distraction influence cycling behaviour and perceived safety?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.026,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Previous studies using a survey or field observational approach show that secondary task engagement negatively impacts cyclists’ performance. Prohibiting handheld phone use, while allowing hands-free use via headphones, is applied to reduce safety critical impact of secondary task engagement. Hands-free secondary task engagement limits visual-motor distraction, but cognitive distraction might still impact cycling performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the behavioural effects of hands-free cognitive secondary task engagement while riding alone on different kinds of cycle paths as well as when overtaking other cyclists and reacting to typical events like stopping at a traffic light or evading a pedestrian or an obstacle on the cycle way. Using the cycling simulator at the Department of Traffic and Engineering Psychology at the TU-Braunschweig, a mixed design was used with three levels of secondary task engagement as the independent between-factor: no task (NT), podcast task (PC), acoustic speech task (AS). Additionally, three types of lane markings of the cycle way and three events were varied as within-factors. N = 58 participants (36 female, 22 male) completed the experiment. In none of the situations and none of the parameters examined, an effect of secondary task engagement was found, although cyclists subjectively felt more distracted. This was not due to a lack of sensitivity to the parameters measured, as the types of infrastructure significantly influenced cycling and overtaking behaviour. In line with multiple resource theory, results suggest that secondary tasks requiring cognitive but not visual-motor resources can be done while cycling without adverse effects on behaviour. However, this might also be an effect of task difficulty and may change when the cycling task or the secondary task becomes more complex. Thus, additional studies including more complex traffic situations, are relevant.",1369-8478,Not found
Spare visual capacity and driver inattention in dynamic car following scenarios,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.017,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Drivers often look away from the forward roadway. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are inattentive, as they might be utilizing their spare visual capacity (SVC). Because of the safety–critical risks associated with inattentive driving, it is imperative to analyze how much visual capacity a driver can afford to use for secondary activities while avoiding the possibility of an accident. This study aimed to define and identify driver inattention in a car following task based on an estimate of the driver’s situational SVC. A mathematical model of SVC in car following was created based on the possible but unlikely worst-case scenario in any situation. The model generates situation-specific marginal values of the minimum time that can lead to a possible collision when a driver looks away from the lead car. A classification algorithm was developed to define and identify inattention based on the model’s estimates. The model reveals that SVC in car following varies significantly from situation to situation, depending on relevant situational, technical, and cognitive factors. A driving simulator study (N = 32) indicated that drivers are often willing to occlude themselves in car following when there is a chance of a rear-end collision and that this behavior becomes more likely with higher speeds. A strong linear association between distance headway and brake response time was also found. Quantifying SVC in driving helps in determining driver inattention against a valid baseline based on what is possible. The proposed modeling approach can be utilized for the development of improved safety guidelines and effective context-sensitive (in)attention monitoring systems.",1369-8478,Not found
The association between physiological and eye-tracking metrics and cognitive load in drivers: A meta-analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.014,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Driving performance can be impaired by a high cognitive load of drivers. Thus, it is important to estimate drivers’ cognitive load. Although physiological and eye-tracking metrics have been widely used in many studies to assess cognitive load while driving, conflicts still exist regarding the association between physiological and eye-tracking metrics and different levels of cognitive load. Through a meta-analysis, our study aims to quantify the association between physiological, eye-tracking metrics and cognitive load induced by n-back tasks. A total of 18 articles met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The results indicate four types of metrics, including the sensitive-to-low ones that can only differentiate the low to medium level of cognitive load (i.e., the power spectrum of θ wave of electroencephalogram at Fp1 channel); high-resolution ones that can differentiate all levels of cognitive load (including pupil size, heart rate, and skin conductance); and low-resolution ones that can only differentiate low and high cognitive load (including the total power spectrum of electrocardiogram, eye blink rate, and respiration rate) and others (the power spectrum of θ wave of electroencephalogram at Fp2 channel). Furthermore, the association between metrics and cognitive load can be modulated by the n-back version, modality of n-back task, automation level, and percentage of male participants. In summary, this study contributes to the literature by quantifying associations between physiological and eye-tracking metrics and different cognitive load levels. Practically, we provide evidence for the selection of physiological and eye-tracking metrics for future driving cognitive load monitoring system design.",1369-8478,Not found
A qualitative study of the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: The impact on alcohol consumption and driving behaviours,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.016,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"COVID-19 influenced life in a multitude of ways beyond immediate health impacts. This included driving behaviours. People drove less often during the early months of the pandemic, yet crash rates increased. There were reports of increased alcohol consumption during this same time which was considered to impact on driving behaviours such as drink driving. This study explores the thoughts and opinions of Queensland, Australian drivers (n = 798) concerning driving behaviours, alcohol consumption, and drink driving behaviours during the early phases of the pandemic (April – August 2020). Participants responded to qualitative questions in online questionnaires over three phases that prompted thoughts in these domains. Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological model was found to explain participants’ comments with the six layers seeming to impact driving, alcohol consumption, and drink driving behaviours. That is, these behaviours were influenced at an individual level (e.g., coping mechanisms), the microsystem level (e.g., reduced opportunities for socialisation), the mesosystem (e.g., work demands impacting family), the exosystem (e.g., large scale random breath testing was suspended and road police deployed to border control), the macrosystem (e.g., Australian drinking culture), and the chronosystem (the pandemic). Understanding the perspectives of individuals during a sudden shift in life caused by COVID-19 highlights the broader impact of the pandemic on people’s behaviours. In addition, this study also provides important insights into the intricacies of driving, drinking and drink driving behaviours.

Positive associations were also found between the father’s driving style and that of his son. Moreover, the dimension of modeling in the family climate for road safety served as a mediator in the association between the driving styles of the father and son, with the exception of the anxious style. The findings highlight the importance of the personal example fathers provide to their sons in influencing the young driver’s behavior behind the wheel, especially in a culture that honors respect for and compliance with the father’s values and demands.

How interchange spacing effects drivers’ visual performance in high-density interchange groups − a naturalistic driving study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.011,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of interchange spacing on the visual characteristics and visual load of drivers in the exit zone of the urban expressway. A naturalistic driving experiment was conducted in a high-density interchange group on the North Ring Expressway in Chongqing, China. Eye-movement data from 47 participants were collected to assess the pattern of visual performance, seven indicators were selected to characterize drivers’ visual characteristics, and the entropy weighting method was used to assess the drivers’ visual loads under different interchange spacing and driving zones. The results show that insufficient spacing of the interchange affects drivers’ visual behavior and increases their visual load level. The fixation duration for drivers is significantly affected by interchange spacing, with longer fixation duration in the diversion and ramp zones of small-spacing interchanging(SSI). The mean horizontal visual angle of drivers was mainly distributed in the middle of the field of view, and there was a tendency for the overall left side to be shifted under the conditions of SSI, and the mean vertical visual angle was mainly distributed in the nearer part in front of the lanes. In the ramp zone of SSI, the driver’s attention to the vehicle dashboard had a significant increase. In normal-spacing interchange(NSI), drivers’ horizontal saccade amplitude and speed were higher than those in SSI, and the difference was most significant in the diversion zone. Vertical saccade amplitude and speed of the driver were found to be significantly affected by interchange spacing only in the ramp zone. Drivers’ visual load had the highest correlation with pupil variation, and the visual load scores of drivers at SSI were 39.65% and 17.7% higher than at NSI in the diversion and ramp zones, respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of the high-density interchange group on the visual performance of drivers on urban expressways, and the results provide a theoretical basis for the spacing control of interchanges.",1369-8478,Not found
How to design driver takeover request in real-world scenarios: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.012,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Conditional automated driving systems have become a reality. Ensuring the safety during the driving takeover process has become a crucial concern, with the takeover request (TOR) playing an important role. Existing review studies often focus only on a particular aspects of the TOR and fail to consider the varied requirements of TOR in specific scenarios. In this review, we conducted a systematic literature search and identified 75 studies related to TOR design. Through the summarization of literature, we naturally arrived at the final research themes, which encompassed the key aspects of TOR design and specific situational factors. Our findings indicate the necessity for dynamic time budget (TB) in automated driving systems, emphasizing that longer TB contributes to improved safety. There is a need for multimodal capabilities within TOR, followed by tailored modal selection and combinations based on specific takeover scenarios. The integration of additional informative prompt in TOR is beneficial, provided that the type and content are carefully considered.

Methodological challenges of scenario generation validation: A rear-end crash-causation model for virtual safety assessment,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.007,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Safety assessment of crash and conflict avoidance systems is important for both the automotive industry and other stakeholders. One type of system that needs such an assessment is a driver monitoring system (DMS) with some intervention (e.g., warning or nudging) when the driver looks off-road for too long. Although using computer simulation to assess safety systems is becoming increasingly common, it is not yet commonly used for systems that affect driver behavior, such as DMSs. Models that generate virtual crashes, taking crash-causation mechanisms into account, are needed to assess these systems. However, few such models exist, and those that do have not been thoroughly validated on real-world data. This study aims to address this research gap by validating a rear-end crash-causation model which is based on four crash-causation mechanisms related to driver behavior: a) off-road glances, b) too-short headway, c) not braking with the maximum deceleration possible, and d) sleepiness (not reacting before the crash). The pre-crash kinematics were obtained from the German GIDAS in-depth crash database. Challenges with the validation process were identified and addressed. Most notably, a process was developed to transform the generated crashes to mimic the crash severity distribution in GIDAS. This step was necessary because GIDAS does not include property-damage-only (PDO) crashes, while the generated crashes cover the full range of severities (including low-severity crashes, of which many are PDOs). Our results indicate that the proposed model is a reasonably good crash generator. We further demonstrated that the model is a valid method for assessing DMSs in virtual simulations; it shows the safety impact of shorter ‘longest’ off-road glances. As expected, ‘cutting away’ long off-road glances substantially reduces the number of crashes that occur and reduces the average delta-v. This work highlights the need to both a) thoroughly understand the process of generating virtual scenarios and b) have the tools to validate them. While more work to develop validation processes for scenario generation is needed across all levels of crash severity, the transform and other validation tools that were developed bring us one step closer to accurate validation methodologies.",1369-8478,Not found
"Representations of truck platooning acceptance of truck drivers, decision-makers, and general public: A systematic review",10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.008,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Truck platooning, involving two or more automated trucks virtually linked in a convoy through vehicle automation and communication technologies, has become a core topic in the long-haul freight transport industry. Despite its potential benefits – fuel efficiency, reduced carbon emissions, operation cost savings, improved road safety, and alleviated traffic congestion – further research is required to understand the representations of technology acceptance that will mediate its adoption across different stakeholders. This study presents a systematic review of the representations of decision-makers, truck drivers, and the general public on truck platooning acceptance. A total of 35 papers were included in the review and grouped into (i) studies with no platooning experience, (ii) studies with a simulated platooning experience, and (iii) studies with an on-road platooning experience. Representations were extracted using thematic analysis to synthesize the perspectives of each stakeholder and organized in themes. Even when similar themes emerged, representations highlight each stakeholder singular perspective. Although decision-makers have a more positive outlook on the potentialities of the technology, they are concerned about several obstacles related to its implementation and risks that may undermine the promised efficiency benefits of truck platooning. Regarding general public, peripheral drivers are mainly concerned about the reliability and safety of truck platooning and the potential traffic conflicts. Truck drivers denote the potential advantages in driving comfort and road safety, but highlight their concerns about employment, the reliability of the automation, loss of driving pleasure, trust in the platooning systems and their elements, and additional stress associated with the reconfiguration of their activity by the technology. Meanwhile, considering the role of experience, when the technology was experimented on-road, representations became more positive. Still, although these experiments are closer to real-world context, they only focused on basic driver-truck interactions and did not account for multitask driving scenarios, nor explored truck drivers’ employment concerns.",1369-8478,Not found
How various urgencies and visibilities influence drivers’ takeover performance in critical car-following conditions? A driving simulation study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.007,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Drivers of Level 3 automated vehicles are relieved from the driving task in specific circumstances but are required to take over control once the takeover request is prompted. Previous studies have investigated drivers’ takeover performance in non-critical car-following. However, little is known about drivers’ takeover behaviors in critical car-following, especially in low-visibility weather, which remarkably increases the risk of car-following. A driving simulator experiment with a 2 × 3 × 3 factor within-group design was conducted. The design matrix contained two weather conditions (clear and foggy), three car-following time headways (2 s, 3 s, 4 s) and three deceleration rates of the lead vehicle (LV) (0, 2 m/s2, 4 m/s2). A total of 30 participants completed the experiment. The results showed that in critical car-following situations, drivers faced greater challenges in negotiating with adjacent vehicles rather than the LV itself. Urgency and visibility did not significantly impact the likelihood of a crash with the LV due to drivers’ adoption of stronger braking. However, decreased visibility and higher LV’s deceleration increased the crash rate when drivers attempted lane changes. As urgency increased, drivers tended to change lanes earlier, leading to higher lane-changing risks and compromised lateral stability. This study can provide some insights for the car-following strategies of automated driving vehicles and the design of dedicated takeover schemes in various transportation environments.",1369-8478,Not found
Changes in older drivers’ risky driving behavior over time: Insights from a naturalistic study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.009,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"This study aimed to investigate changes in the risky driving behavior of older drivers with age using naturalistic driving data. The driving behaviors of 44 drivers aged 60 years or older at baseline were tracked for two to five years. Harsh events characterized by elevated g-forces were used as driving outcomes. A multilevel modeling approach was used to examine (1) the heterogeneity in individual trajectories of risky driving behaviors and (2) the factors associated with the average risky driving behavior over the study period and changes in risky driving behavior over time. The results indicated that there was heterogeneity in individual trajectories of risky driving behaviors. Older female drivers and a higher level of sensation seeking (i.e., the tendency to pursue new and different sensations, feelings, and experiences) were associated with higher rates of harsh events over the study period. A reduction in driving exposure was associated with an increase in harsh event rates, and driving exposure can partly explain the sex difference in risky driving behaviors. The cluster analysis indicated that the heterogeneity in individual trajectories of risky driving behaviors can be explained by the presence of three subgroups of drivers, with each group exhibiting specific trajectories. Initial levels of risky driving behaviors were much more important than time slopes in identifying subgroups of drivers, indicating that differences between drivers existed early and remained relatively consistent over the study period. A multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the predictors of class membership identified by the clustering algorithm, and the findings were similar to those from the multilevel regression analysis. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of how older drivers’ risky driving behaviors change with age and indicate the distinctive individual processes of change in driving behaviors with age.",1369-8478,Not found
Perceived effectiveness of traditional and technology-based speeding-related countermeasures,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.010,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Introduction: Speeding behaviour contributes significantly to road crashes and subsequent injuries and fatalities. The purpose of this study was to examine which traditional countermeasures (i.e., police enforcement and on-road signs) and technology-based countermeasures (i.e., advanced driver assistance systems [ADAS] and in-vehicle speed audio alerts) drivers perceived as effective in assisting them to comply with posted speed limits. Methods: Participants (N = 680; Mage = 49.34 years) who held a current driver’s licence completed a 20-minute online survey. Participants in the experimental condition were randomly assigned to read one of four scenarios which differed based on location (urban or regional) and posted speed limit (60 km/hr or 100 km/hr) or to the control condition (no scenario), before answering questions about the perceived effectiveness of the traditional and technology-based interventions. For the experimental conditions, participants were instructed to respond to these questions based on how they would drive in the situation outlined in the scenario. Results: Low-level speeding behaviour was common, with 40.7 % reporting regularly driving 5 km over the posted speed limit in a 60 km/hr speed zone and 50.4 % reporting regularly driving 5 km over the posted speed limit in a 100 km/hr speed zone. A mixed ANOVA revealed that participants perceived police enforcement activities to be the most effective at assisting them to comply with posted speed limits when compared to other traditional and technology-based approaches. Further, ADAS was rated by participants as significantly more effective at assisting them to comply with the posted speed limit in the 100 km/hr urban condition compared to the 60 km/hr urban condition. Conclusions: Low-level speeding behaviour remains common practice and there is a need for continued roadside police presence to discourage this behaviour. Drivers with ADAS-equipped vehicles could also be encouraged to use systems, such as adaptative cruise control, to assist with speed management on high-speed roads.",1369-8478,Not found
Are we always aggressive or only behind the wheel? Exploring differences and similarities through social information processing theory,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.006,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Questions such as “Are people always aggressive?” or “Is it only inside the car?” have been studied in previous research. However, the focus is mostly on anger and anger expression and not on an interpersonal perspective. The current study aims to explore this gap in the research by analyzing aggressive driving behavior through the application of Social Information Processing Theory (SIP). For that purpose, the trait of aggression was compared with aggressive driving behavior and SIP patterns on and off the road. To achieve these goals, 562 Portuguese drivers completed a self-reported survey concerning trait aggression, aggressive driving behavior, and social information processing in various contexts. The results indicated that deficits in SIP positively correlate with aggressive behavior in daily and driving contexts. Secondly, the trait of aggression is positively correlated with aggressive driving behavior. Finally, SIP deficits in the daily context were also positively correlated with SIP deficits in the driving context. Nevertheless, significant differences were found between SIP variables in the daily context and the driving context. The results, implications, and limitations of the study are discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Gamification in the Transport and Mobility Sector: A Systematic Review,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.004,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Gamification is an emerging concept that is often used and cited for its known motivational and engagement qualities. Although gamification is studied and applied in a variety of fields, to our knowledge no overview exists in the field of transport and mobility. There is thus a need for a comprehensive understanding of the research conducted, the empirical evidence it yields and the type of research that could still be lacking. These findings could contribute to more effective and better-accepted transport interventions, whether they aim to improve safety, mobility or eco-friendliness. Our review provides an overview of the literature on gamification in relation to mobility and transport and offers suggestions for future research and interventions. A PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review was conducted on SCOPUS, Web of Science and Pubmed, resulting in 49 eligible papers. The results of the analysis of these papers indicated heterogeneity in multiple areas: objectives of the intervention (e.g., safe or eco-friendly driving), methodologies (i.e., different sample sizes, different experimental designs), types of experiments (e.g., questionnaires, simulation or fleet studies) and gamification processes (e.g., with leaderboards, rewards, narratives), but also and more importantly, in the observed empirical evidence. No consensus seems to have been reached on the effects of gamification nor on the underlying mechanisms in the field of transport. There is a lack of knowledge on the most effective ways to propose a gamified intervention in the field of mobility and transport, whether it aims to change behaviours or attitudes. Further research should rely more on specific theoretical frameworks to justify their approach and assess the effect of gamification more methodologically and empirically in order to build applicable and reliable knowledge. The acquired knowledge could increase road safety or help nudge people towards more eco-friendly modes of transport.",1369-8478,Not found
Bicycle rider evaluations of an intersection safety alert system: Learnings for similar technologies from a field trial,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.005,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Bicycle-mounted crash avoidance technologies have been developed to improve cyclist safety. However, their effectiveness in alerting cyclists of potential dangers and the preferences of cyclists regarding the types and mechanisms of receiving alerts have not been examined extensively in field trials. To address this gap, this paper aims to understand how safety alerts are best communicated to cyclists. This aim was achieved by undertaking a field trial of a smartphone app, which was the user interface of an innovative Intersection Safety Alert System (ISAS). A total of 38 participants rode bicycles equipped with the ISAS in a 2-day field trial in downtown Melbourne, Australia, and then completed a technology acceptance survey. The survey data were analysed using statistical and thematic analysis methods to derive insights on how cycling safety technologies should be designed to ensure a good level of user acceptance. Results showed that cyclists would be willing to use or recommend a safety app that is free from privacy or security concerns, be able to provide alerts that can effectively notify about dangerous situations, and be effective in improving the safety for the whole cycling community. Cyclists preferred to receive simple and clear safety alerts that provided information on high-risk locations and the nature of dangers through an easy-to-use user interface that runs in the background and communicates with other cycling and navigational apps. They wanted the alerts to convey real-time and non-obvious traffic conditions and unpredictable movements of other road users. Preferences and comments regarding auditory, visual and haptic modalities of presenting alerts differed among riders.",1369-8478,Not found

Methods A review of existing literature on AR-HUD and applicable human factors and human–computer interaction guidelines was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. In total, 121 articles were selected, and an initial set of guidelines for developing an AR-HUD was drawn up. We analyzed AR-HUD development and categorized the articles based on HMI features relevant to in-vehicle AR-HUD: virtual image distance, field of view, and brightness. Furthermore, research findings on projected information and legibility were investigated. Results Nine guidelines were devised for developing the AR-HUD human–machine interface. This study also compared the traditional AR-HUD and windshield AR-HUD, defining the requirements for future studies using the term AR-HUD and providing a framework for AR-HUD design. Conclusions Existing research on AR-HUD is limited. Future research is needed on virtual image distance, field of view, brightness, and legibility.

Driver preference regarding merging strategies at work zones,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.023,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Merging at work zones with lane closures is associated with delays and conflicts that often result in crashes. To minimize these undesirable effects of merging, researchers have studied and evaluated various merging strategies, such as Early Merge (EM), Late Merge (LM), Joint Lane Merge (JLM) and Signalized Merge (SM). While these studies provided important insights on the efficiency and safety aspects, a key gap exists in the literature where limited knowledge is available on driver preference and perceptions of the merging strategies. This paper aims to examine drivers’ preferences of merging strategies and how demographic and travel characteristics influence their preference. Using an online survey of 455 drivers in Australia, data on these strategies and the Australian Conventional Merging (CM) setup were collected. This survey sample is equally split between drivers with and without work zone-related employment experience, thus capturing insights and viewpoints of both groups. Results from an ordered probit model showed that drivers with less driving experience drivers preferred CM more and SM less than the experienced drivers. The JLM strategy was less preferred by female drivers than male drivers. Non-conventional merging strategies like EM and SM were preferred over the CM strategy by those without any work zone-related employment experience than those who have such experience. These findings regarding drivers’ merging strategy preferences have important implications for implementing merging strategies in future work zones, including potential improvement in driver compliance rates.",1369-8478,Not found
Does the visual input matter? Influence of non-driving related tasks on car sickness in an open road setting,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.002,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"With the development of highly automated driving functions, drivers will no longer be in full charge of the driving task and can instead engage in a variety of non-driving related tasks (NDRTs), such as reading or watching a movie. However, engaging in these tasks increases the risk of experiencing motion sickness in a car. So far, most studies have compared everyday tasks such as reading and watching movies regarding their impact on car sickness. In this on-road driving study, a more theoretical approach was taken and controlled tasks were chosen to compare certain task characteristics regarding their impact on car sickness. In a within subject design, N = 20 moderately to severely susceptible participants completed three experimental drives on separate days, each with one task. To induce car sickness, a standardized driving profile including highly dynamic manoeuvres was driven on open roads. Three tasks with different types of visual input were selected: an auditory n-back task, a static visual n-back task, and a dynamic visual task. Participants were instructed to look down at a tablet throughout the drive and not to look up through the windscreen in all conditions. Driving dynamics, task performance and mental workload of the tasks were used as control variables. The effect of the tasks on the occurrence of car sickness was evaluated using subjective misery scale ratings. On average a medium to high level of car sickness could be induced over all trials. The extent of car sickness differed significantly between task conditions. Both visual tasks produced more car sickness than the auditory task, with the visual dynamic task leading to the most severe symptoms. Visual input in NDRTs, particularly moving images, seem to play a crucial role for the occurrence of car sickness. Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed and methodological implications for the use of NDRTs in realistic driving studies to elicit car sickness are derived.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of within-trip subjective experiences on travel satisfaction and travel mode choice: A conceptual framework,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.024,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Modest shifts from car use to active travel can result in substantial health, emissions, and economic improvements that result in cleaner, greener, and healthier cities. To achieve modal shift towards active travel, the transport field has long considered how psychosocial factors outlined by theories such as the theory of planned behaviour underpin travel mode choice. Recent models of travel behaviour detail how travel satisfaction – a person’s cognitive and affective evaluations of their travel – influences mode-related attitudes which in turn influences desires and intentions to use a specific travel mode. In this conceptual paper, we introduce the concept of within-trip subjective experiences – cognitive and affective responses to individual events and stimuli during travel – and propose potential mechanisms for how within-trip experiences affect travel satisfaction and mode-related attitudes. Specifically, people have emotional and cognitive reactions to individual stimuli (e.g., near miss incident, pleasant scenery, heavy traffic) which are mediated by the process of appraisal. Over the course of a trip, the sum of these subjective reactions form the basis of their within-trip experience, which heavily shape perceptions of travel satisfaction and subsequently influence attitudes and intentions to use a specific mode. Furthermore, within-trip subjective experiences to stimuli potentially modify the beliefs that mode-related attitudes consist of, further highlighting the importance of considering within-trip experiences to individual stimuli for understanding travel behaviour and mode choice. The consideration of within-trip experiences highlights the individuality of peoples’ responses to stimuli. Understanding and addressing this individuality and the unique needs of all potential user groups may assist in achieving mass modal shift towards cycling and active travel.",1369-8478,Not found
Autonomy bias: A deception experiment to isolate the effect of vehicle automation on perceptions of pedestrian comfort &amp; safety,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.020,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Ensuring comfort and safety for pedestrians is essential to the responsible introduction of automated or self-driving vehicles (SDV). Few studies have attempted to isolate the effect of vehicle automation on perceptions of pedestrian interactions with SDV, separate from the potentially confounding effects of vehicle operation or appearance, and we still have limited understanding of the explicit and implicit attitudes mediating those perceptions. The objectives of this study are to determine 1) if there is an “Autonomy Bias” in the population of British Columbia, Canada (i.e., whether people perceive pedestrian-SDV interactions as inherently more or less comfortable and safe than otherwise equivalent interactions with human-driven vehicles or HDV), and if so, 2) which personal attributes influence Autonomy Bias. We isolate the effect of vehicle autonomy on perceptions using a novel deception-based experiment in which 1,133 participants rate 8 video clips of pedestrian interactions in a crosswalk; all clips show HDV, but a random half of the videos for each participant are described as SDV. Results show that Autonomy Bias varies widely across the population, with a small but significantly (p < 0.05) negative mean value (i.e., SDV interactions are perceived as less comfortable and safe). To ensure that an average person is as comfortable crossing with SDV as they currently are with HDV (i.e., to offset their Autonomy Bias), SDV must allow at least 0.4 s additional passing time at crosswalks; at least 3.7 s additional time is needed to ensure equivalent comfort for 85 % of the population. The implicit attitude of Autonomy Bias is strongly related to but distinct from explicit, self-reported attitudes toward technology and SDV, and may improve with SDV familiarity.",1369-8478,Not found
"An analysis of EV charging and route choice behavior considering the effects of planning ability, risk aversion and confidence in battery in long-distance travel",10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.026,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The increasing demand for long-distance and intercity travel is driven by the progress in regional transportation integration and the establishment of charging infrastructure. This increase suggests that the use of electric vehicles (EVs) for long-distance trips is likely to become more prevalent in the future. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more studies on the travel behavior of EV drivers for long-distance trips. However, there are few studies looking at the travel behavior of EV drivers on long-distance trip and multiple charging during trips. To fill this gap, this study identified EV drivers’ preferences for charging and route choice in long-distance or intercity travel on the basis of a stated preference survey, with the Shandong highway network as the travel scenario. A nested logit (NL)-based hybrid choice model was used to investigate the impacts of personal attitudes, namely planning ability, risk aversion and confidence in battery, on the drivers’ charging times choice behavior. The NL structure consists of two levels, with the upper level focusing on the charging times decision process, and the lower level analyzing the choice behavior of routes with no charging, routes with charging once, and routes with charging twice. The results show that the initial state of charge, and attitudes significantly influence the decision on charging times. In addition, EV drivers who are risk-averse and lack confidence in the battery tend to charge, whereas drivers with strong planning ability prefer to charge once in long-distance travel. Charging and resting simultaneously is the best way to meet the needs of charging and resting, and reduce the time lost while driving. These results provide insights on drivers’ travel planning and charging infrastructures planning for long-distance trips.",1369-8478,Not found

Although many studies have focused on route choice, the actual behavior considering real-world networks and the mechanisms that govern it have eluded complete characterization. Part of the difficulty has been in accounting for the growing availability of information sources that may influence drivers’ route choices, precluding collection of adequate observational data. In addition, with the continuing emergence of new forms and sources of information, such as social media with varying degrees of interactivity, engagement, and immediacy, existing frameworks and models for representing these choices and the influence of new information sources have been lacking. This study uses an agent-based modeling approach to investigate the effects of social influence on drivers’ route choices. In the model, all drivers communicate with each other in the same social network, and this information is combined with their previous experiences. The first aim of this study is to investigate the impact of social network connectivity and information exchange on route choice. The second is to characterize situations in which all drivers in the social network are satisfied with their route choices. The simulation results show that an equilibrium is achieved when all drivers in the given social network are satisfied with their current route choices.",1369-8478,Not found

One of the most critical points for pedestrian traffic is the pedestrian crossing, where pedestrians and vehicles interact. Due to the speed and weight of vehicles, sufficient attention by drivers and pedestrians is essential for accident-free crossing. Our research aimed to identify the parameters that influence drivers’ willingness to yield the right of way. The focus of our research was on the distractors of pedestrians and drivers. Our study involved on-site investigations. The measurements were taken at designated pedestrian crossings, with a road sign and road markings. During the measurements, we recorded all situations where there was a pedestrian-vehicle interaction. We recorded several parameters about drivers and pedestrians. The data were analyzed using both descriptive statistics and a discrete decision model. We have shown that the drivers’ willingness to stop depends on distractions. We showed that distractors on the part of pedestrians slightly increase the drivers’ willingness to stop, while distractors on the part of drivers strongly decrease the willingness to yield. In addition, we have shown that distractions from both sides result in the lowest willingness to yield the right of way. We have also shown that driver behavior depends on the gender, age, and behavior of pedestrians.

Heavy vehicle driver fatigue: Observing work and rest behaviours of truck drivers in Australia,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.016,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The extant transport literature suggests that truck driver fatigue is a leading contributor in truck crashes. Various factors are known to affect a truck driver’s ability to comply with work and rest requirements, including long working hours, irregular work schedules, sleep deprivation and driving at night. In Australia, while control measures restrict the number of hours of work a truck driver may undertake without rest, they travel vast distances and work with a high level of autonomy. This makes it difficult for transport companies to monitor and manage truck drivers’ work and rest compliance; thereby relying on them to self-manage driver fatigue at designated rest-stops. However, there is little Australian research examining rest-stop behaviour of truck drivers in relation to driver fatigue compliance. To better understand how truck drivers manage driver fatigue, an exploratory participant observation study of truck drivers (N = 378) was undertaken at two Australian truck rest stops in rural New South Wales. The findings indicate that while most truck drivers comply with rest requirements regarding driver fatigue, load type, driver changeovers, access to parking, and time spent on work-related activities at the rest areas affects the time truck drivers spend at rest, and these factors are likely to increase the risk of truck drivers not complying with driver fatigue regulation. They are also likely to increase the number of truck drivers involved in fatigue related crashes.",1369-8478,Not found

From a dual research perspective, i.e., a variable-centered and person-centered perspective, a theoretical model of prosocial driving is constructed based on the following three levels: environmental, psychological and behavioral. According to the results, First, rational, affective and moral factors at the individual psychological level play mediating roles between urban traffic climate at the environmental level and prosocial driving behavior at the behavioral level. As indicated by the results of a mediating pathway analysis, rational, affective and moral factors are intricately linked by five complex mediating paths at the psychological level. Second, there is a differentiated environmental-psychological activation mechanism between individuals’ prosocial driving and aggressive driving.

Does a cautious driving style reduce the crash risk of older drivers? An analysis using a novel driving style recognition method,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.019,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Older drivers who are aware of their declining functions tend to adopt a cautious driving style to compensate for their declining driving abilities. However, whether cautious older drivers are associated with a reduced crash risk has not been well studied. In this study, we examined the association between older drivers’ cautious driving style and crash risk using a novel driving style recognition method. We proposed a driving style recognition method that does not require predefined thresholds and applied it to the driving data of 71 drivers comprising 59 drivers aged 65 years or older (mean age 72.4; 67.8 % male) and 12 drivers aged 51–64 years (mean age 58.3; 66.7 % male). Drivers were classified into cautious and relatively aggressive groups based on the classification results of their speed, acceleration, and braking styles. The results showed that cautious drivers were characterized by older age, poorer Trail Making Test Part B performance, less frequent night driving, and lower driving exposure, indicating that older drivers may adopt multiple compensatory strategies. Although the crash involvement rate of cautious older drivers was approximately half that of relatively aggressive drivers, the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, this difference was expected to decrease when driving exposure was considered. Older drivers who adopted a cautious driving style but were involved in traffic crashes had poorer visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. The results of this study indicate that a cautious driving style alone may not be sufficient to compensate for older drivers’ declining functions, particularly the loss of two visual functions observed in the present study.",1369-8478,Not found
Problematic substance use and implications for road safety: An investigation on psychological dysfunction and risky driving styles,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.011,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Problematic alcohol and cannabis use has been linked with psychological dysfunction and engagement in risky behaviour. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between alcohol and cannabis use patterns with self-regulatory dysfunction (i.e., worry; anger rumination; mindlessness; impulsivity), psychopathology (i.e., anxiety; depression; anger), and risky driving styles (i.e., anxious; dissociative; angry; reckless driving). An online survey was administered to three unique samples (n = 200 each) of Australian adults: frequent alcohol users, frequent cannabis users, and non-frequent substance users (i.e., the control group). Eligible participants did not use any other substance more than once per month. Comparative analysis (MANOVA) showed that frequent cannabis users had the highest self-reported psychological dysfunctioning and risky driving styles, followed by frequent alcohol users, and then the control group. Bivariate correlations revealed that most prominently, the severity of substance dependency and the frequency of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and cannabis were positively related to specific forms of psychological dysfunctioning and risky driving styles. Such findings highlight the potential relevance of both chronic and acute influences on driving behaviour. Finally, four separate path analyses were implemented which predicted specific risky driving styles (e.g., anxious driving), with substance use dependency as the moderator, and the corresponding self-regulatory dysfunction (e.g., worry) and psychopathology (e.g., anxiety) variables as mediators. The results suggested that substance use dependency indirectly affected risky driving styles, through its influence on specific self-regulatory dysfunction, and psychopathology, whilst controlling for the effects of DUI. Together these findings highlight the increased road safety risks associated with problematic alcohol and cannabis use, outside of acute-related influences.",1369-8478,Not found
"How do vulnerable road users evaluate automated vehicles in urban traffic? A focus group study with pedestrians, cyclists, e-scooter riders, older adults, and people with walking disabilities",10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.017,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"In today’s urban traffic, vulnerable road users (VRUs) have a somewhat ambivalent relationship with human drivers. The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) that are no longer controlled by such human drivers could impact this relationship, both in positive and negative ways. Five focus groups (pedestrians, cyclists, e-scooter riders, individuals with walking disabilities, and older adults) were conducted to investigate how different VRUs evaluate the participation of AVs in urban traffic and whether they hold specific requirements or concerns. The discussions focused on exploring potential interactions with AVs and the effects of mixed traffic scenarios (encompassing AVs and conventional vehicles (CVs)) on the well-being of VRUs in urban traffic. The results revealed that the concerns and expectations about AVs in urban traffic were quite similar among the various VRU groups. Regarding their interaction with AVs, participants expressed advantages (e.g., eliminating human errors) and disadvantages (e.g., lack of communication possibilities). In the context of mixed traffic, especially cyclists and individuals with walking disabilities feared aggressive behavior from CVs taking advantage of rule-abiding AVs. They also saw the risk of increasing complexity in mixed urban traffic, as AVs are likely to behave differently from CVs. In addition to the increased caution described by most VRUs, a few participants could imagine taking advantage of the defensive driving style of AVs. The cyclist group discussed the possibility of sabotaging AVs to make a general statement against cars in urban traffic. Furthermore, essential requirements were gathered for vehicle manufacturers (e.g., external Human-Machine Interfaces) and policies (e.g., stringent regulation enforcement for car traffic in the city) that could enable successful coexistence between VRUs and AVs in urban traffic.",1369-8478,Not found
A new tramway and the formation of emotional commuting experiences,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.018,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Sustainable urban mobility transitions require various measures that impact peoples’ everyday lives. Implementing these measures, such as transport infrastructure projects, requires public acceptance. However, there is a lack of research on how sustainable urban mobility transitions impact commuters’ emotional experiences. This study aims to understand the formation of emotional commuting experiences and to analyse the impact of the introduction of a tramway on those experiences. The findings are mainly based on qualitative data (33 interviews) but also on quantitative data on the participants’ commuting behaviour collected in a Finnish city, Tampere, which launched a new tramline a couple of months prior to data collection. The research shows a variety of triggers for negative and positive emotional commuting experiences and highlights the role of critical incidents in the formation of emotional experiences. It reveals how launching a tram in a city impacts emotional commuting experiences on many levels, even for those who do not change their main mode of commuting. It also shows the dynamics involved in emotional commuting experiences, demonstrating how emotional experiences in the construction phase may differ greatly from those after the new commuting mode has been launched. Based on the findings, we suggest that in order to guarantee public support for sustainable urban transport projects, practitioners should recognise the wide range of emotional experiences associated with commuting, even for those who do not adopt the new mode of transport, and take these experiences into account not only during the lengthy infrastructure-building phase but also during the utilisation phase.",1369-8478,Not found
Assessing shared auto-rickshaws adoption by intra-city commuters as part of the public transport system: The influence of negative encounters on passenger satisfaction,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.009,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Emerging research has highlighted the significant role auto-rickshaws play in travel services, and yet, compared to other transport modes, they have received relatively less attention in research. No study has investigated travel behaviour and negative encounters in shared auto-rickshaws. The assumption that negative encounters deter users from utilising shared auto-rickshaws has not yet been validated. Moreover, previous studies have focused on adopting auto-rickshaws and travel behaviour, neglecting the specific dynamics of shared services within the public transport landscape. Here, we investigate the determinants influencing shared auto-rickshaw usage as a distinct mode in Ghana. We also identify negative attributes by drawing the link between negative user encounters and their impact on satisfaction, loyalty, and openness to policy propositions. The study deployed structural equation modelling, which is generally preferred in transport research. We discovered that ‘Availability’ is the most significant factor in predicting the adoption of shared auto-rickshaws. The estimated model established that negative encounters substantially impact users’ satisfaction, and users’ satisfaction was impacted by discomfort with seating arrangement, driver conduct, fleecing of users, and long travel time, among others. Older commuters reported higher levels of satisfaction than younger commuters, whereas commuters with higher levels of education tend to report lower levels of satisfaction. This research expands the limited understanding of shared auto-rickshaw usage by advancing our theoretical grasp of how negative encounters influence satisfaction and loyalty from a user-centric perspective. These insights can aid policymakers, service providers, and transport authorities in crafting legislation that prioritises user needs, enhances service quality, and creates a positive commuting experience. Furthermore, this study discusses managerial implications for transport authorities and policymakers.",1369-8478,Not found
A distributed simulation study to investigate pedestrians’ road-crossing decisions and head movements in response to different vehicle kinematics in mixed traffic,10.1016/j.trf.2024.04.023,104,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The impending deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) will lead to mixed traffic conditions, where pedestrians will be required to interact with both AVs and human-driven vehicles. For traffic flow to be safe and efficient, AVs’ understanding of pedestrians’ behaviour and intention is as important as pedestrians’ perception of AVs’ status and intent. To investigate pedestrians’ road-crossing decisions and interactive behaviour in mixed traffic, a distributed simulation study was developed by linking a CAVE-based pedestrian simulator and a desktop driving simulator. Twenty-five pairs of pedestrians and drivers were recruited, and each pair experienced 32 trials, where pedestrians decided to cross (or not) before an approaching vehicle at an un-signalised, single-lane, road. The driving pattern of the approaching vehicle (controlled by either a predefined program or human driver) and braking mode (braking/non-braking) were manipulated. For the predefined vehicles, the braking pattern was subdivided into hard braking and soft braking to provide more kinematic variability. Human drivers were also instructed to yield, or not, in different trials. Pedestrians’ road-crossing decisions and head movements were recorded and analysed. Results revealed a significant difference in head-turning patterns between crossing and non-crossing manoeuvres, demonstrating pedestrians’ head movements as a valid indicator of their road-crossing intentions. Moreover, results identified a ‘last moment check’ behaviour before pedestrians’ crossing initiation, with a significant increase in head-turning during the last 2 s. Finally, pedestrians made a similar percentage of road crossings and displayed a similar pattern of head movements, in response to human-driven and predefined vehicles, suggesting that the difference of implicit cues in the current mixed traffic setup does not impact their behaviour prior to road crossings. The findings from this study extend our knowledge of how pedestrians behave when crossing the road in mixed traffic, particularly in terms of their head-turning behaviour. We hope this information can be used by future AVs to better predict pedestrians’ road-crossing intentions in urban settings.",1369-8478,Not found
Socially responsible behaviour of a pedestrian − Obligation or necessity?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.003,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"As vulnerable road users, pedestrians are the object of research in various areas of road safety. One of the ways to reduce the level of risky behaviour of pedestrians is to increase their social responsibility by applying the “traditional” 3 E: engineering, education, and enforcement. Social responsibility involves a focus on responsibility for both actions related to personal safety and actions that benefit society. This paper deals with the results of a survey of pedestrians regarding their risky behaviour while walking, namely, violation of crossing rules and distraction by using a smartphone or listening to music through headphones. It was found that risky behaviour depends on the age of pedestrians, and listening to music through headphones also depends on the person’s gender. It was established that respondents’ assessment of the safety of transport modes does not correlate with data on mortality in road traffic accidents using different types of transport. It is proposed that social responsibility of pedestrians can be increased by analyzing the causes and events that lead to traffic accidents during the study of safety disciplines in higher education institutions.",1369-8478,Not found
Hazard prediction and risky decision-making by drivers affected by non-hemineglect strokes,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.029,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The stroke survivor’s independence is severely limited if they are prevented from driving, and regaining this ability could be vital to their recovery. Our pioneering study analysed hazard prediction and risky decision-making among drivers who had suffered non-hemineglect strokes. Two groups of experienced drivers were recruited with one group comprising 37 healthy drivers (M = 54.5 years old, SD = 6.59) and the other consisting of 37 drivers who had had non-hemineglect strokes (M = 55.1 years old, SD = 13.7). In terms of lesion location, 59 % (n = 22) had suffered a left-hemisphere injury, 35 % (n = 13) a right-hemisphere injury, and 5 % (n = 2) a bilateral injury. Hemineglect patients were excluded. Participants were shown naturalistic driving video clips which had been recorded from the driver’s point of view. These were filmed both in the participants’ familiar home country (Spain) and also in an unfamiliar country (England). The hazard prediction test showed a number of hazardous situations which were caused by another road user (e.g. an oncoming car invading the lane). Each video clip ended as the hazard began to unfold, and participants had to choose the correct response to identify the hazard, where it occurred, and the likely outcome in that particular traffic situation (situation awareness). In the risky decision-making test, participants were shown video clips whereby the hazards were possibly caused by risky driving behaviour (e.g. driving through a junction with an amber traffic light). The participants were also shown video clips which set up the potential for risky behaviour and they were asked how likely they were to proceed with that risky manoeuvre (e.g. to overtake a cyclist or drive through a junction with an amber traffic light) on a 6-point Likert scale. In the hazard prediction test, a statistically significant group effect was found, with healthy drivers attaining greater accuracy compared to drivers who had suffered a stroke. More specifically, drivers with left-sided strokes had lower hazard prediction accuracy (M = 59.1 %, SD = 16.7) than drivers with right-sided strokes (M = 64.6 %, SD = 11.8) and healthy drivers, who had the highest accuracy percentage (M = 68.6 %, SD = 13.1). Moreover, a significant effect was found regarding familiarity, and driver accuracy in the hazard perception test was found to be greater in the video clips filmed in Spain than those filmed in England. However, the interaction between these factors was not significant. Regarding the risky decision-making test, the only statistically significant effect was with the familiarity of the video clips, whereby drivers displayed a greater disposition to assume risks in the English video clips (unfamiliar driving environment) than in the Spanish clips. Hazard prediction training would be particularly helpful for drivers who had suffered left-hemisphere strokes since it is more difficult for such drivers to process details.",1369-8478,Not found
Effect of riding experience on changing opinions toward connected and autonomous vehicle safety – Evidence from field experiments,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.023,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are considered one of the most promising mobility technologies to be implemented in the near future. A recent study (Shi et al. 2021) investigated how riding experience influences perceptions of autonomous vehicle safety through field experiments. This study used the same dataset as Shi et al. (2021) but focused on investigating the factors influencing people’s initial opinions toward CAV safety and how these opinions will change following a successful CAV ride. A random parameter ordered probit model was adopted to analyze people’s initial opinions before the CAV ride, which resolves the fixed parameter estimations limitation of the traditional ordered probit model. Furthermore, a hierarchical ordered probit model was used to study people’s opinion changes after experiencing the CAV ride, overcoming the fixed thresholds limitation of the traditional ordered probit model. Based on the estimation results, we identified the characteristics of prospective CAV users, such as individuals who drive alone, have Auto Pilot ride experience, have high income, have a long commute time, and have high education levels. Therefore, the needs of these demographics should be well considered in future CAV technology development. We also found that high-education individuals tend to have more negative initial opinions regarding CAV safety compared with others. However, their opinions are more likely to shift toward the positive side after experiencing a successful test ride. In addition, we found that although CAV technologies can enhance traffic efficiency through communication with traffic signals, this improvement may raise people’s concerns about the safety of CAVs. The results obtained from this research provide valuable managerial and regulatory insights for the future development and popularization of CAV technologies.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating impact of situation awareness-based displays of semi-autonomous driving in urgent situations,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.018,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Semi-autonomous vehicles still require drivers to take over in an unexpected situation. In this situation, the increased cognitive load on the driver can lead to distraction, which in turn reduces situational awareness (SA) and prevents appropriate responses, increasing the risk of accidents. For this reason, providing interfaces that enhance SA is essential to ensuring safety and optimal performance. However, existing SA-based display research often overlooks the levels of SA and effectiveness of modalities, especially in urgent situations where a driver’s SA might be compromised. The present study aims to design SA-based display that considers the urgency of the situation and the level of SA in line with a specific design framework and modality effectiveness. We conducted an experiment using simulated videos to evaluate the effectiveness of the SA-based display. This experiment assessed the effects of three urgent situations and three levels of situational awareness-based displays on drivers’ SA, situational trust, mental workload, and perceived urgency. We employed a 3x4 mixed-factorial design for the experiment. The between-subject factors were the SA levels (perception, comprehension, and projection) and a baseline. The within-subject factors were urgency scenarios (low, medium, and high). The results showed that as urgency increased, displays reflecting Level 3 SA, which requires prediction, significantly improved SA compared to other displays. We expect our findings to contribute to the practical design of automotive displays by providing useful considerations for SA-based display design.",1369-8478,Not found
Openness to experience is associated with better on-road driving performance in older adults,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.017,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Background Particularly in older age, personality has been an underrepresented predictor of driving safety. However, when changes in driving-related abilities are inevitable, on-road performance declines and personality traits may play an important role because the need for self-assessment and self-management is rising. Methods In a prospective on-road study with data from N = 81 older drivers, we therefore examined whether and to what extent the Big Five dimensions predict on-road driving performance. Statistical analyses included a multiple regression of on-road driving performance onto the Big Five dimensions. Moreover, we explored the relation of the Big Five dimensions with specific driving dimensions and different driving-relevant variables. Results Among all Big Five dimensions, only openness to experience significantly predicted on-road performance in older drivers. Moreover, it showed positive correlations with most driving dimensions and several driving-relevant variables. Both openness to experience and extraversion were associated with greater driving practice. Discussion Among different personality factors, our results highlight the relevance of openness to experience for on-road driving behavior in older adults. Although personality alone does not appear to adequately predict on-road performance, the examination of specific personality traits may help to identify at-risk drivers and aid in prevention and intervention.",1369-8478,Not found
Self-Regulating compliance to enhance safe driving behaviours,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.021,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Risky and non-compliant driving behaviours contribute to road crash fatalities and serious injuries globally. Enforcement measures are essential but shown to be limited in reach and effectiveness. As such, it is critical to examine root causes of engagement in non-compliance to develop effective countermeasures. Self-regulation is an under-researched construct recently found to be important in reduced engagement in unintentional and deliberate risky driving behaviours. This study explored factors that are associated with regulatory processes for mobile phone use while driving and speeding, guided by self-determination theory. Licensed drivers aged 17 years and over (n = 1,146) were recruited to participate in an online survey. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted finding internal (self) and external regulation accounted for 28 % of the variance in mobile phone use while driving and 39 % of the variance in speeding. Across the behaviours, internal regulation was found to be similarly influenced by legitimacy, risk perception and repeated engagement in the behaviours, with greater perceived legitimacy of enforcement, a higher risk perception and less engagement in non-compliance predicting greater internal regulation. Females, who comprised 53 % of participants, and older participants (age range 17–82 years) reported greater capacity for internal regulation across the behaviours, and fewer hours spent driving was predictive of internal regulation. Greater external regulation was predicted by higher perceived certainty of apprehension for both behaviours, and a lack of regulation was predicted by habitual behaviours for mobile phone use while driving. While there were similarities between the regulation of speeding and mobile phone use while driving, nuances were recognised that are important for targeted interventions and identifying effective components of countermeasures. The findings are anticipated to enhance current systems of enforcement to have a greater impact on reducing engagement in risky behaviours and consequential road trauma with countermeasures informed by self-determination theory.",1369-8478,Not found
Rule-orientation and adherence to traffic laws among French drivers: An exploratory study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.022,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"In 2022, 30 million traffic offences were recorded by the enforcement authorities on French roads, resulting in more than 16 million penalty points being deducted from driving licences. Why do French drivers not always comply with the rules of the road? Previous studies have shown that Attitudes, Subjective Norms and Perceived Behavioural Control are strong predictors of the intention to obey traffic laws (Theory of Planned Behaviour, TPB, Ajzen, 1991). In this paper, we investigate drivers’ relationship with traffic rules in more depth. We identified several other factors as potential extensions of the TPB in explaining compliance with traffic rules. To test the impact of these dimensions on compliance and to understand the motivations behind French drivers’ lack of compliance, we conducted an online questionnaire survey among a representative sample of 1021 French drivers (mean age: 44.3, 49.9 % women). In addition to the TPB measures, we used a combination of existing scales (Conformity and Sensation Seeking) and exploratory items specifically designed to measure additional components. We named these four distinct components Conditionality, Discourtesy, Authority Rejection, and Egonomy, respectively. Aside from the TPB components, Conditionality and Conformity predicted intentions to always obey traffic rules; testing the same model on reported drink-driving, we found an effect of Discourtesy and Sensation Seeking, but not of the TPB components measured at a general level (“towards traffic rules”); whereas Authority Rejection, Egonomy and Attitudes towards traffic rules were linked to attitudes towards police checkpoints. These findings open up new perspectives for the study of rule orientation in the field of road safety, raise questions about the relevance of conducting general prevention campaigns targeting specific behaviours, and reveal the difficulty perceived by the participants in ’always’ respecting the rules of the road.",1369-8478,Not found
The functional capabilities of young drivers and implications for fitness-to-drive,10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.018,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Concussion among young drivers can impact driving performance. This can affect overall road safety and their likelihood of crash involvement. Existing studies often separate individuals into concussed and non-concussed when deciding fitness-to-drive. However, there are neurocognitive markers that may provide better insights on driving abilities. This study uses six neurocognitive measures that have been shown to impact driving in a cluster analysis to better assess driver’s neurocognitive functioning ability. Data from a driving simulator study with 102 participants (51 concussed and 51 non-concussed) ranging in age from 16 to 25 years were used within the cluster analysis. The results showed three clusters based on high, moderate, and low-functioning capabilities with a mix of concussed and non-concussed in each cluster. The low functioning cluster group had the highest proportion of concussed drivers, the highest concussion symptom severity scores, the least driving experience, and the slowest response time on a tactile detection response task. However, there were drivers with no identified concussion in this same group. Findings suggest that neurocognitive testing is an important tool for predicting individuals that may be at the highest risk for driving difficulty regardless of whether they have sustained a concussion, and these can be considered in an easy-to-use fitness-to-drive test in a clinical setting.",1369-8478,Not found
Impact of variable message signs on drivers’ situation awareness in freeway exit areas,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.007,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The driving environment in the freeway exit areas is complex, and the installation of relevant signs can enhance the creation of a safe and smooth exit area environment. This study investigated the situation awareness (SA) scores of two types of drivers using different signs in the freeway exit areas and the correlation between drivers’ eye movement, driving behavior, and SA scores. The driving tasks were divided into two situations: continuing on the mainline and entering the exit ramp. The independent variables included scene type (static speed limit signs, static speed limit signs plus variable message signs, variable speed limit signs, variable speed limit signs plus variable message signs), and participant type (experienced and inexperienced participants). The dependent variables were SA, eye movement, and driving behavior. Each participant completed a driving simulation experiment with the two driving tasks, totaling eight scenes. The SA scores were measured using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). The driving behavior and eye movement were collected during the experimental data analysis segment, and the sensitivity indicators for evaluating drivers’ SA were determined by calculating the correlation with the SAGAT scores. This paper focuses on applying variable message signs (VMS) to speed limits in freeway exit areas from the driver’s perspective to enhance driving safety. The findings showed that drivers have better SA in scenes with VMS, and experienced drivers have better SA than inexperienced drivers in the same scene.

Driving data were collected using a driving simulator, including 15 participants in 210 tests in seven scenarios (3150 experimental samples). Drivers with similar driving behaviors were grouped. The model was validated using both in-sample and out-of-sample data for both individual and representative drivers. It was found that the error rate of the predicted data was approximately 7 %.

Risky riding behaviors among motorcyclists and self-reported safety events in Pakistan,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.016,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Motorcycles are the most prevalent mode of transportation in many developing countries, particularly in Asia. Despite their popularity, motorcycles inherently pose risks to riders, which are further amplified by risky behaviors such as speeding, non-helmet use, non-compliance with traffic rules. Exploring motorcycle crashes has been the most widely employed approach to identify risk factors, but comprehensive crash data are often unavailable in Pakistan. Instead, Motorcycle Rider Behavior Questionnaire (MRBQ) is employed in this study, which has been served as a valuable tool to comprehensively investigate the risky behaviors among motorcyclists. Nevertheless, variations in the factor structures of the MRBQ across different geographical contexts underscore the necessity of refining the MRBQ based on cultural and regional characteristics. Thus, there is a crucial need to tailor the MRBQ to the local dynamics, considering diverse cultural norms, licensing regulations, and motorcyclists’ experiences. Moreover, while existing MRBQ studies have provided valuable insights into factors including traffic errors and speeding violations, there is a notable gap related to safety behaviors directly affecting motorcyclists’ well-being. Therefore, this study aims to not only validate the MRBQ framework in the Pakistani context but also integrate safety-related behaviors, offering a comprehensive understanding of motorcyclists’ risk behaviors. To achieve the objective, a sample of 1,344 responses from Pakistani motorcyclists was collected online. Exploratory factor analysis of the adapted MRBQ resulted in a refined 45-item questionnaire characterized by a five-factor structure (i.e., speeding violations, traffic errors, safety violations, stunts, and control errors). Findings confirm the construct validity of the proposed modified MRBQ, revealing coherent distributions of items across the five distinct factors. Notably, the modified version of the questionnaire brings to light a unique factor: safety violations, reflecting the specific safety-related behaviors particularly observed in Pakistan. In addition, the results reveal a significant association between the MRBQ factors, especially speeding violations, traffic errors, safety violations, and risk indicators. Moreover, the findings highlight that younger motorcyclists, those with lower education or income levels, and those without a valid license have a higher likelihood of crashes, near-crashes, and traffic violations, while riders with a daily riding duration of less than an hour have a lower likelihood of such incidents. Based on the findings, the study recommends urgent policy measures, including strengthening traffic law enforcement to address speeding and safety violations, implementing targeted training programs and educational initiatives for young motorcyclists, addressing regulatory deficiencies in licensing through improved enforcement, and devising tailored public awareness campaigns for enhancing motorcycle safety in Pakistan and other countries with similar characteristics.",1369-8478,Not found
Examining the effectiveness of an education-based road safety intervention and the design and delivery mechanisms that promote road safety in young people,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.019,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Background Road traffic collisions (RTCs) are the leading cause of deaths for young people worldwide. Whilst educational interventions that adopt fear-based messaging are commonly used to improve road safety in young people, limited focus has been directed to examining how they are delivered. Accordingly, this mixed-method study aims to i) measure the effectiveness of a UK intervention called Safe Drive Stay Alive (SDSA) for improving road safety knowledge, attitudes and intentional behaviors, and ii) what design and delivery mechanisms are important for achieving this. Methods In study one, participants completed online questionnaires that measured road safety knowledge, attitudes, and behavioural intentions pre- (n = 1304) and post-intervention (n = 407), and two months later (n = 72). In study two, focus groups were conducted with 10 young people post-intervention to understand what mechanisms were important for promoting road safety. Results Statistical analysis of questionnaires showed that road safety knowledge, attitudes, and intentional behaviours significantly improved post-intervention. However, descriptive comparisons of the smaller number of two-month follow-up questionnaires indicated that ratings returned to pre-intervention levels. Thematic analysis of focus groups highlighted that having emotive, realistic, and relatable content was important for encouraging young people to attend to the message. However, more focus was needed on how to address peer pressure. Conclusion SDSA improves road safety knowledge, attitudes, and behavioural intentions. However, there are indications that benefits may be short lived, requiring ‘top up’ interventions. Whilst young people also perceive SDSA to be useful, engaging, and delivering an important message, support is needed for addressing peer pressure.",1369-8478,Not found
Understanding drivers’ perspectives on the use of driver monitoring systems during automated driving: Findings from a qualitative focus group study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.015,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The ability to measure psychological states such as fatigue will become increasingly important with the introduction of automated driving systems (ADS) to everyday driving. Driver monitoring systems (DMS), which will soon be a required feature in all new vehicles, will be responsible for assessing the driver’s mental state in real-time. This will help to maximise the safety and social benefits of ADS. However, little is known about drivers’ perceptions of DMS. This qualitative focus group study used a reflexive thematic analysis approach to understand drivers’ perspectives on the use of DMS during automated driving. Seventeen drivers with no prior experience of ADS or DMS were interviewed across three focus group sessions and were shown a video outlining some of the capabilities of both systems. A semi-structured interview guide was used to gather qualitative data concerning drivers’ perceptions of the prospect of driver monitoring within automated driving and the expectations that they have. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to develop five themes. The findings show that drivers have more favourable attitudes towards DMS than ADS, due to an expectation that the latter will require a greater sacrifice of the driver’s control. Nonetheless, participants were sceptical of the reliability, security and privacy of driver monitoring, and expressed that it could detract from the enjoyment derived from driving. Participants were also concerned regarding the potential for driver data to be sold to third parties and used against them in various ways. Overall, drivers are sceptical of the value of driver monitoring and ADS and perceive them as separate entities as opposed to two systems working in partnership. This highlights an emerging challenge for researchers and system manufacturers, which will need be addressed in order to fully realise the individual and societal benefits of these new forms of technology.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving avoidance performance on Sand-Covered roads during sand and dust storms under different visibility conditions,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.014,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Sand and dust storms (SDS) are characterized by their instantaneous and abrupt characteristics, and the accompanying, often quick, accumulation of aeolian sand on road surfaces contributes to increased driving risks on expressways. We investigated the combined effect of visibility conditions and accumulated sand on drivers’ avoidance performance. We utilized a driving simulator to simulate SDS events and conducted tests across six different visibility conditions using 45 drivers. We analyzed the drivers’ control of the vehicle’s speed based on longitudinal speed and acceleration in test road segments defined as Clear, Transition, and SDS. We divided the drivers’ risk avoidance maneuvers on sand-covered road segments into two strategies, lane-keeping and lateral avoidance, with a focus on the latter. We divided the drivers’ lateral avoidance process into three stages: perception, decision-making, and maneuver. Key performance indicators were selected to analyze the drivers’ performance in terms of their lateral and longitudinal control of the vehicle. The findings suggest that drivers reduce their speed to compensate for the limited field of view during SDS events. Lower visibility corresponds to a greater distance required for drivers to reach a relatively stable driving state and leads to higher standard deviation values for the speeds. The coupled effect is reflected mainly in the percentage of lateral avoidance maneuvers. When the visibility was 150 m or above, more than 60 % of drivers in this study chose lateral avoidance over lane-keeping, with no significant difference between visibility conditions. Only when the visibility dropped to 100 m or below did the percentage of lateral avoidance instances significantly decrease. In SDS environments, light and visibility conditions are poor and a thin layer of sand is spread across the road surface. Even under relatively good visibility conditions, a thin layer of accumulated sand is difficult to discern until the driver is relatively close to sand-covered road segments. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of driving avoidance behavior under SDS conditions. The findings can contribute to proactive intervention strategies for driving during SDS and offer theoretical insights for developing driving safety assistance systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Acceptance towards advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS): A validation of the unified model of driver acceptance (UMDA) using structural equation modelling,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.011,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are linked with enhanced transportation system efficiency and safety. However, prior research highlights the indispensable role of drivers’ acceptance in realizing these benefits. Several models have been introduced to investigate drivers’ acceptance of ADAS. This study examined the predictive validity of the Unified Model of Driver Acceptance (UMDA) using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), expanding beyond multiple regression utilized in the past and taking the full conceptual Model of Driver Acceptance proposed by Rahman et al. (2018) as the theoretical starting point. Specifically, we focused on Belgian car drivers’ acceptance towards a retrofitted ADAS bundle, encompassing forward collision warning, headway monitoring and warning, and lane-keep assist. Because of the new European law, the provision of certain ADAS technologies in vehicles will be mandatory, and this will accelerate the retrofitting of ADAS into older vehicles. Therefore, knowing the determinants of drivers’ acceptance of retrofitted systems is important. Data was collected through an online structured questionnaire based on the UMDA framework. The final dataset consisting of responses from 322 participants underwent Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the factor structure, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to verify it, and path analysis to reveal determinants of ADAS acceptance. Additionally, the study employed independent sample t-test and ANOVA to assess how driver-related variables moderated the model’s constructs. Descriptive findings indicated moderate overall acceptance, with participants generally favouring system-specific characteristics. PCA and CFA identified and confirmed four distinct factors: endorsement, attitude, usability, and affordability. SEM path analysis unveiled that attitude played a dual role— mediating the impact of affordability and endorsement on behavioural intention to use ADAS as well as exerting a direct effect on behavioural intention. Other variables directly impacting behavioural intention included endorsement and usability. Demographic and driving-related variables moderated the influence of system-related factors on intention to use ADAS. To conclude, the study identified a factor structure distinct from the original UMDA hypothesis. Moreover, the application of SEM provides novel insights into ADAS acceptance that could be helpful, specifically in the EU context where ADAS retrofitting into vehicles is under consideration. The findings suggest that policymakers should prioritize strategies encouraging ADAS adoption and use. This prioritization should extend beyond shaping decision-making processes alone.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluating self-reported pedestrian behaviour and investigating factors influencing road interactions in Jordan,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.008,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"A variety of self-reported questionnaires have been developed worldwide across to classify pedestrians’ behaviours. However, to the best of our knowledge, no pedestrian behaviour questionnaire has been validated to investigate Jordanian pedestrians’ behaviour. Thus, this study aimed to develop and validate a self-reporting pedestrian behaviour questionnaire for the Jordanian population (JPBQ), spanning all ages. Our JPBQ consisted of 40 items describing pedestrian behaviour, whilst the validation study itself included 400 participants (45.25% females). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a four-factor structure: transgressions, lapses, positive behaviours, and aggressive behaviours for both Long (31-item) and short (20-item) versions of the JPBQ, confirming validity (significant association with p < 0.05) and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha > 0.7) for each factor. This addressed the reliability issue with positive behaviour factor found in previous self-reported questionnaires by incorporating effective questions concerning positive behaviours while walking. Across the four factors, the highest mean scores that pedestrians reported were for positive behaviours, while the least commonly reported behaviours were aggressive behaviours and lapses. Male participants were found to declare higher rates of violations and aggressions, while young participants reported more violations and fewer lapses. The lack of alternatives to walking was positively associated with unsafe behaviours (violations, errors, lapses). Income level was negatively associated with aggressive behaviours towards other road users. Divorced individuals were found to self-report lower rates of lapses and positive behaviours. Overall, this study contributes to understanding pedestrian behaviours in Jordan, providing a reliable validated questionnaire for research and road safety initiatives.",1369-8478,Not found
Anticipatory cues can mitigate car sickness on the road,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.006,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Car passengers experience much more car sickness than car drivers. We assume that this is because drivers can better anticipate the car’s motions. Does helping passengers to anticipate the car’s motions then mitigate car sickness? Indeed, laboratory studies have shown that anticipatory cues which announce one-dimensional motions of a linear sled mitigate sickness to a small extent. Does this mitigation generalize to real car driving? We tested this in a car ride on a test track along a trajectory involving lane changes, accelerations, and decelerations. We show that vibrotactile cues mitigated car sickness in passengers. Auditory cues were less effective. The mitigating effect of the vibrotactile cue was considerable: a 40% decrease in car sickness symptoms, a larger effect than we found in the laboratory. Automated vehicles can predict their own motion very well. They could thus provide vibrotactile cues to mitigate car sickness in their passengers.",1369-8478,Not found
Self-reported pedestrian falls in 15 countries worldwide,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.009,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Background Many factors are associated with pedestrian injuries and accidents. If a pedestrian is injured in an outdoor public space, we are talking about a “pedestrian fall”. Pedestrian falls are a more common cause of pedestrian injuries than traffic crashes but have received less attention and the literature on this topic is scarce. Aims and methods The aim of this work is to describe at a general level the prevalence and consequences of pedestrian falls and injuries, to make international comparisons of pedestrian falls and to identify risk factors and not least to examine the relationships between the prevalence of falls and pedestrian risk behaviour. A total of 6,373 participants from 15 different countries were recruited to take part in this study. To collect data a questionnaire was used. To cover the risky behaviour of pedestrians we used a short version of Pedestrians Behaviour Scale (PBS). In order to identify groups of countries with a similar pedestrian transport situation, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. The analysis produced four groups of countries based on pedestrians’ safety level, popularity of walking and GDP. Results and conclusions As for the results, we can conclude that young people and older people are more frequently involved in falls and that women report more frequent involvement in falls than males. However, the risk of getting injured in a fall is not higher than that of men. Frequent walking is associated with a lower risk of falling while walking. In contrast to this, physical activity increases such risk. The prevalence of falls and injuries seems to be weakly related to pedestrians’ risky behaviour, thus other factors such as safety infrastructure probably play an important role.",1369-8478,Not found
How might advertising campaigns rehumanize cyclists?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.020,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Although riding a bicycle is an efficient, healthy and sustainable mode of travel, in low-cycling countries there continues to be negative attitudes, harassment and aggression toward riders. Recent studies have found that part of this hostility could be due to dehumanization – the belief that cyclists are lesser humans. These beliefs are relatively common, yet we don’t yet know how we could reduce or counteract dehumanizing beliefs. In this paper we hypothesize that a ‘humanizing’ ad campaign may improve attitudes and reduce dehumanization relative to ‘non-humanizing’ campaigns. Using a survey of cyclists and non-cyclists in the Australian Capital Territory, in this study we developed four version of a static campaign poster, portraying cyclists either from in front (humanizing) or behind (non-humanizing), as a photo (humanizing) or graphic design (non-humanizing). We found that posters using photographs were more humanizing than graphic design, but design had no effect on attitudes. However, photographic posters were seen as less clear, memorable and effective than graphic posters. Showing cyclists from the front vs. the back had no significant effect on dehumanization, attitudes or effectiveness. This study suggests that if the aim of a campaign is to humanize cyclists, that photographic images may help with this effort. Given the high baseline rates of dehumanizing beliefs among the population, it would be counter-productive if safety campaigns failed to humanize this group.",1369-8478,Not found
Principal components analysis of driving simulator variables in novice drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.021,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Objective Although driving simulators are powerful tools capable of measuring a wide-ranging set of tactical and operational level driving behaviors, comparing these behaviors across studies is problematic because there is no core set of driving variables to report when assessing driving behavior in simulated driving scenarios. To facilitate comparisons across studies, researchers need consistency in how driving simulator variables combine to assess driving behavior. With inter-study consistency, driving simulator research could support stronger conclusions about safe driving behaviors and more reliably identify future driver training goals. The purpose of the current study was to derive empirically and theoretically meaningful composite scores from driving behaviors of young people in a driving simulator, utilizing driving data from across a variety of driving environments and from within the individual driving environments. Method One hundred ninety adolescent participants aged 16 years or 18 years at enrollment provided demographic data and drove in a high-fidelity driving simulator. The simulated scenario included 4 distinct environments: Urban, Freeway, Residential, and a Car Following Task (CFT). A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was conducted on the variable output from the driving simulator to select optimal factor solutions and loadings both across the multi-environmental drive and within the four individual driving environments. Results The PCA suggested two components from the multi-environmental simulated drive: vehicle control and speed. The individual driving environments also indicated two components: vehicle control and tactical judgment. Conclusion These findings are among the first steps for identifying composite driving simulator variables to quantify theoretical conceptualizations of driving behavior. Currently, driving behavior and performance measured by driving simulators lack “gold standards” via driving scores or benchmarks. The composites derived in this analysis may be studied for further use where driving behavior standards are increasingly sought by clinicians and practitioners for a variety of populations, as well as by parents concerned about the readiness of their novice driving teen.",1369-8478,Not found
User evaluation of comfortable deceleration profiles for highly automated driving: Findings from a test track study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.05.025,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"As automated vehicles advance and become more widespread, it is increasingly important to ensure optimal driving comfort for passengers. Recent research has focused on developing driving styles for automated vehicles that are perceived to be most comfortable. However, there is still little understanding of whether, and how, possible driving styles need to be adjusted for specific traffic scenarios. In this study, 36 participants experienced three different deceleration profiles (a linear deceleration profile ‘One-Step’, and two versions of stepwise deceleration profiles ‘Two-Step V1 and V2’) across different driving scenarios (deceleration before curves, approaching a speed-limit sign, and a stop sign). Deceleration profiles were rated by participants and the impact of non-driving related activities on driving comfort was investigated. Results showed a positive rating for all deceleration profiles in terms of comfort. For decelerations to a standstill at a Stop Sign, participants seemed to prefer the One-Step approach, in which there is a continuous, and constant deceleration. However, participants described the Two-Step V1 as a gentle and calmer approach and ranked it more frequently as a personal favourite than the One-Step profile or the Two-Step V2 profile. The visual distraction of the passenger through a non-driving activity had no impact on passenger comfort or profile preferences for the scenarios tested within this study. Nonetheless, participants reported perceiving a lower intensity of longitudinal vehicle movements when visually distracted during the drive. The results of the study provide insights into the design and implementation of comfortable deceleration profiles.",1369-8478,Not found
Help-seeking for driving anxiety: Who seeks help and how beneficial is this perceived to be?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.003,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Driving anxiety can be common. When extreme, drivers may lose independence as they change their driving patterns or cease driving altogether. This can lead to poorer quality of life and work. It is therefore important to understand how to support people to manage this anxiety and continue to drive, should they wish to do so. The aims of the current study were to 1) understand the types of help sought by people who experience some level of driving anxiety, and 2) understand factors associated with help-seeking and what support is perceived as beneficial. A total of 1,314 people (women = 77 %; ranging in age from 18 to 89; M = 27; SD = 13 years) responded to an online survey providing responses to questions about driving anxiety levels, onset of anxiety, level and causes of shame about the anxiety, perceived driving skill and help-seeking behaviour. Fourteen various types of help-seeking were included covering non-professional help (such as talking to family or friends, vehicle technology) and professional help (such as driving training/re-training, therapy or medication). Based on responses to these, participants were classified into three help-seeking groups: those who have or are currently seeking help (55 %); those who intend to seek help (22 %) and those who have no intention of seeking help (22 %). Those not intending to seek help were mainly men and who experience low levels of anxiety that originated due to traffic concerns (such as being fined, etc). Those whose anxiety was more generalised tended to be seeking help for their driving anxiety as well. The results highlighted potential avenues to support anxious drivers. These include the support and understanding of family and friends. Further driver training, that may focus on anxiety is another potential avenue. Potential benefits of vehicle technology to support driving anxiety were also noted.",1369-8478,Not found
Pedestrians’ receptivity to fully automated vehicles: Assessing the psychometric properties of the PRQF and survey in France,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.005,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"One of the biggest challenges facing the human-centered design of fully automated vehicles (FAVs) is their interaction with vulnerable road users. Measuring pedestrians’ perceptions is particularly important to know whether they will be receptive to the introduction of FAVs on the road. In this context, the present study aimed to examine and validate the structure of the Pedestrian Receptivity Questionnaire for FAVs (PRQF) in France. A second objective was to explore the receptivity of French pedestrians towards FAVs, its effects on behavioral intention when interacting with FAVs, and acceptance of FAVs. To meet these objectives, 474 participants living in France answered an online survey (age range: 18–83 years; 39 % of males), which included the PRQF, the behavioral intention to cross the road in front of a FAV and their acceptance, as pedestrians, of the introduction of FAVs on the road. Several scales and items were also included to measure familiarity with FAVs and new technologies, as well as self-reported pedestrian behavior using the pedestrian behavior scale (PBS) and sociodemographic information. A series of statistical analyses indicated a three-dimensional factor structure in the answers of the French respondents to the PRQF, i.e., Positive Attitude, Supportive Social Norms, and Compatibility. These dimensions differed from those revealed in earlier questionnaire validation studies. However, in line with other studies on automated vehicle acceptance, these dimensions were influenced by several sociodemographic factors (age, sex, level of education, walking frequency, location, possession and duration of driving license). The results also indicated a mixed receptivity of the French respondents to FAVs. Their behavioral intentions to cross the road in front of an approaching FAV were further explained by the Positive Attitude dimension of the PRQF and their self-declared behaviors as pedestrians, particularly in terms of positive and violation behaviors. Acceptance of FAVs in the respondents’ living area was predicted by the Positive Attitude dimension and by self-declared behaviors as pedestrians (in terms of aggressive behaviors particularly). The respondents’ age and familiarity with FAVs and new technologies were also predictive of their FAV acceptance. Several research and practical perspectives are proposed accordingly.",1369-8478,Not found
Does exposure to online content encouraging illegal driving influence behaviour? Exploring perspectives of different age groups,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.004,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"A substantial amount of online content on illegal driving behaviours is shared on social media platforms. Yet, the influence of online content on behaviours remains unclear. Accordingly, this qualitative study explored perspectives across different age groups on a) the nature and extent of social media content that encourages illegal driving behaviours and b) whether such content influences engagement in these behaviours. Sixty-six licenced drivers within Queensland, Australia, participated in a focus group. The sessions were conducted with three different age groups: younger drivers (17–25 years), middle-aged drivers (26–49 years), and older drivers (50 + years). Data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, resulting in three recognised themes: 1) exposure to online illegal driving behaviours on social media, 2) the influence of online illegal driving content on behaviour, and 3) drivers’ engagement with online content that encourages illegal driving behaviours. A key finding was that young drivers are frequently exposed to online content encouraging illegal driving behaviours, whereas middle-aged and older drivers are rarely exposed to this content. Opinions surrounding the influence of online content on illegal driving behaviours was varied, yet across ages it was believed that young drivers may be most susceptible to this content. The findings from this study provide support for the potential link between social media exposure and illegal driving behaviours. Implications for future research are discussed, with an emphasis on longitudinal research to examine the impact of social media content on changes in behaviour, specifically for younger drivers.",1369-8478,Not found
"Effectiveness, influence mechanism and optimization strategies of variable message Sign: A systematic review",10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.028,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Variable Message Sign (VMS) has been broadly implemented to spread roadway and traffic guidance information dynamically so as help to promote rational distribution of traffic flow and improve traffic safety. However, there are still some inconsistence in VMS related research results and application standard. This study aims to provide a systematic review of existing researches on the effectiveness and influence mechanism of VMS as well as optimization strategies for better VMS information dissemination. Individual driver behavior and road operation characteristics were the two main aspects in discussing the VMS information effectiveness, but previous researches were biased towards the independent analysis of these two dependent variables. Driver characteristics, trip characteristics, and information content and format were found to be influential on the guidance results of VMS information. However, most researches focused on exploring which factors affecting VMS effectiveness but rather analyzing how these attributes influenced drivers’ decisions and behaviors. In addition, abundant research results on the VMS information dissemination strategy including layout, site selection, and spatio-temporal release strategies were found. There was still lacking of optimization strategies that considering spatio-temporal characteristics sufficiently. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the complete influence chain from individual to group effects for assessing VMS effectiveness comprehensively, explore the deeper mechanisms of VMS effectiveness by further exploring how driver, trip and message attributes affect drivers’ decisions and behaviors, and develop multi-objective planning model to seek information dissemination strategy by considering the combined effect of site selection, induction cycle and other factors. Moreover, it is urgent to explore how to coordinate VMS with in-vehicle navigation or mobile feedback terminals in order to better travel information spreading as well as cost-effectiveness.",1369-8478,Not found
The effect of taillight shapes and vehicle distance on rearward drivers’ hazard perception,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.002,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Rear-end collisions are prevalent during night driving. Taillights are vital in conveying hazards between leading and following vehicles at night. Taillights highlight a vehicle’s presence, particularly for vehicles following from behind. Therefore, it is essential to design taillights that maximize the perception of hazards for drivers behind them. This study explored how different taillight shapes affect rear drivers’ hazard perceptions during nighttime driving. Two experiments were conducted using ERP measurements to study the effects of taillight shapes (three square types in Experiment 1: solid, array, and contour; two linear types in Experiment 2: through type and non-through type) and the distance to the leading vehicle on participants’ hazard perceptions. Participants responded to images of nighttime driving scenarios during the experiments while their ERP and behavioral data were recorded. The stimulus images showed the view from a driver looking at the vehicle ahead on a clear night. The neural process of hazard perception consists of two stages: automatic detection (early) and evaluation (later). In this study, P2 indicated attention bias to the stimulus during the detection stage, and LPP indicated the negative emotion triggered by the stimulus during the evaluation stage. Experiment 1 showed that solid-shaped taillights were perceived as more hazardous and processed faster than other square taillight shapes. Experiment 2 found that non-through-type and through-type linear taillights were perceived as more hazardous during the automatic detection and subjective evaluation stages, respectively. However, the behavioral data showed that through-type taillights were considered more hazardous and were associated with shorter response times. Thus, solid square taillights and through-type linear taillights can be optimal ergonomic solutions. These findings can serve as a reference for taillight designers, manufacturers, and potential car buyers regarding safety considerations.",1369-8478,Not found
Revision of the driver behavior questionnaire for bus drivers in China based on in-vehicle monitoring data,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.021,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Among surface transportation systems. bus crashes contribute to particularly high rates of death, injury, and property damage. The driving behaviors of bus drivers regularly appear as contributing factors in these negative safety outcomes. The Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) is a validated self-reporting instrument, used to measure driver behavior, that is influenced by driver type, region, and time. Little research has used objective measurements to adjust DBQ items, and researchers using this method have entirely ignored bus drivers as a potential population of interest. Instead, adjustments to DBQ items have typically relied on interviews and subjective judgment. Naturalistic driving data offers widespread and quantitative insights into real-world driving behaviors. Using the 25-item DBQ developed by Maslać et al. in 2018 as a basis, this study adjusted the DBQ items by comparison with the actual driving behaviors of bus drivers. In-vehicle monitoring data was used to identify and code 88 types of actual driving behaviors. Actual driving behavior rate and DBQ factor rate were calculated for individual characteristics (age and bus driving experience) and the DBQ’s five factors (ordinary violation, aggressive violation, error, lapse, and positive behaviors). Results showed that (a) bus drivers across all demographic groups demonstrated positive behaviors and errors, but were less likely to commit ordinary and aggressive violations; and (b) there were weak correlations between factor rates and DBQ scores, and only minor variances between divided factor groups. Based on these findings, a new 26-item questionnaire was created for Chinese bus drivers, adding 15 actual behaviors, modifying five previous DBQ items, and leaving six DBQ items unchanged from the Maslać’s DBQ. This study’s method for revising the DBQ based on actual driving behavior can be applied to other types of drivers in various regions.",1369-8478,Not found
Differences in driver takeover performance and physiological responses in conditionally automated driving: Links to emotional instability,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.001,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"When the automated driving system reaches its technical limit, drivers will have to take over control from the vehicle within a limited time. The drivers’ emotional instability may affect whether they can safely control the vehicle during takeover transitions. Accordingly, this paper explores the association between emotional instability and physiological responses and driver takeover performance. 42 drivers engaged in negative emotion induced by movie clips were involved in a sequence of takeover events in a driving simulator. Personality questionnaires were used to assess the driver’s level of emotional instability. Their physiological data before the takeover request (TOR) and operational behavior data fragments for the takeover process were extracted. The results demonstrated that integration of subjective evaluations with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals allows for more objective measurement of drivers’ level of emotional instability. The statistical analyses indicated that emotional instability has a significant effect on drivers’ heartbeat interval, heart rate, the frequency bands of θ(4–8 Hz), α(8–12 Hz), β(13–30 Hz), γ (30–50 Hz) and lateral takeover performance. Those findings of differences in driver physiological responses and takeover performance under emotional instability may provide additional support for the design of driver state monitoring and adaptive warning systems.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the effects of traffic light countdown displays on the driving behaviours of drivers with different personality dispositions: A VR-simulated study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.023,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The dilemma zone, where drivers must decide whether to stop or proceed through an intersection as a traffic signal turns yellow, poses a substantial risk for traffic accidents. One factor affecting the dilemma zone is the inconsistency of green light countdown displays across intersections. This VR simulation study aims to investigate how different countdown display settings impact driver behaviour in the dilemma zone. Using a simulated traffic intersection developed using Unity3D, 31 participants completed driving tasks under 5 different green light countdown displays. Vehicle speeds were collected objectively in the experiments. Questionnaires were employed to assess drivers' hesitation levels and personality dispositions. The results from the statistical analysis reveal that drivers with diverse personality dispositions exhibited consistent hesitation levels across countdown displays. While longer countdown displays tended to reduce drivers' hesitation, the countdowns set between 5-10 seconds resulted in lower vehicle speeds through the intersection compared to other shorter or longer settings. This indicates that the optimal green light countdown display for mitigating the dilemma zone is 5-10 seconds. Findings of the study provide useful insights into the relevant research field. Transportation departments may apply these findings to improve driver safety, refine policies, and standardise countdown timers across intersections.",1369-8478,Not found
Influence of surrounding traffic on lane change dynamics: Insights from a video-based laboratory study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.025,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The inherent complexity associated with lane-changing manoeuvres can significantly disrupt traffic flow and increase the risk of collisions. While the lane-changing vehicle influences the surrounding traffic, it is also simultaneously influenced by it. This study aims to examine how the presence and behaviour of surrounding vehicles affect the lane changer's behaviour. A study was conducted in the laboratory using video stimuli of various simulated lane-changing scenarios to achieve the research aim. The study used a two-block design. In the first block, the impact of the lag vehicle was evaluated by varying its gap and behaviour (acceleration, deceleration or maintaining speed) relative to the lane-changing vehicle. In the second block, both the lead and lag gaps were manipulated with respect to the lane-changing vehicle. Data from the participants (n=29) were collected on dependent variables, including lane change decisions (gap acceptance or rejection), perceived cooperation, and reaction time. The analysis was conducted using an Aligned Rank Transform ANOVA. The findings of this laboratory-based study suggest that the lag vehicle, specifically its behaviour, has more influence on lane change decisions than the lead vehicle in the target lane. Additionally, when a lag vehicle decelerates to create a gap in response to a lane changer's request, its actions are perceived as more cooperative, compared to when it accelerates or maintains speed. Furthermore, decisions to change lanes are made faster when the lag vehicle shows a deceleration behaviour. The results of this laboratory-based study provide valuable insights for improving current lane-changing models. We also discuss the implications of findings for improving algorithms governing autonomous vehicle interactions in mixed traffic. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of laboratory-based approaches in studying causal relationships among different factors, as well as the generalizability of our findings.",1369-8478,Not found
Evaluation of driver's situation awareness in freeway exit using backpropagation neural network,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.018,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Based on combining the relevant studies on situation awareness (SA), this paper integrated multiple indicators, including eye movement, electroencephalogram (EEG), and driving behavior, to evaluate SA. SA is typically divided into three stages: perception, understanding and prediction. This paper used eye movement indicators to represent perception, EEG indicators to represent understanding, and driving behavior indicators to represent prediction. After identifying indicators for evaluating SA, a driving simulation experiment was designed to collect data on the indicators. 41 subjects were recruited to participate in the investigation, and the experimenter collected data from each subject in a total of 9 groups. After removing 4 groups of invalid data, 365 groups of valid data were finally obtained. The grey correlation analysis was used to optimize the SA indicators, and 10 SA evaluation indicators were finally determined. There were the average fixation duration, the nearest neighbor index, pupil area, the percentage power spectral density values of the 3 rhythmic waves (θ, α, β), rhythmic wave energy combination parameters (α / θ), mean speed, SD of speed and acceleration. Taking the optimized 10 indicators as input and the SA scores as output, a backpropagation neural network model with a topological structure of 10-8-1 was constructed. 75% of the data were randomly selected for model training, and the final network training’s mean square error was 0.0025. Using the remaining 25% of data for verification, the average absolute error and average relative error of the predicted results are 0.248 and 0.046, respectively. This showed that the model was effective, and it was feasible to evaluate the SA by using the data of eye movement, EEG and driving behavior parameters.",1369-8478,Not found
Risk-taking behind the wheel: Validation of the Road Traffic Behaviours Questionnaire based on data from Polish car drivers,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.024,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Applying appropriate measurement tools is necessary when examining risky driving behaviours. The aim of this paper is to present a revised Road Traffic Behaviours Questionnaire, i.e., KZD(R), for studying the tendency towards risky behaviour on the road. The study was conducted on a group of 1281 Polish passenger car drivers (630 females) with an average age of 38.78 years (SD = 13.16). The psychometric properties of the questionnaire have been checked by means of factor analysis and adequate reliability measures (the McDonald’s omega index of reliability was 0.92, showing a high internal consistency of the scale, and the stability index after a year was at the same level). Positive correlations of the questionnaire results with impulsiveness and venturesomeness from the IVE questionnaire, as well as negative correlations with empathy (IVE) and agreeableness from the Big Five model, confirmed the validity of the tool to measure risk-taking behind the wheel. Moreover, the ROC curve analysis was performed to assess the differentiating ability of the tool’s scores in relation to the self-reported data collected from the drivers on the number of road accidents, traffic tickets received, and situations of driving after alcohol usage. The cutpoint above 10 points was established as optimal for classifying drivers into the group of potential dangerous risk-takers in road traffic.

Computerized cognitive training to improve executive functions and driving skills of adolescents with and without symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.019,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Introduction Youth with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) face challenges with road safety. While executive functions are developing in all young drivers, those diagnosed with ADHD have deficits in executive functions that are known to be important in driving. The aims of this study were to compare the executive functions and driving skills of adolescents identified with and without ADHD, and to evaluate whether a computerized cognitive training program is associated with improvement in executive functions (i.e., attention, working memory, inhibition) and driving skills. The hypotheses were: a) compared to a group of adolescents without ADHD, executive functions and driving skills of adolescents with ADHD will be poorer at pre-training; and b) while both groups will improve their executive function and driving skills after receiving the computerized cognitive training, the improvement will be greater in the ADHD group. Method This study used a quasi-experimental pre- and post-training control group design. Thirty adolescents aged 16 to 18 years with no prior driving experience participated in the study. Half (50 %) were diagnosed with ADHD and groups were matched by age. The Integrated Visual and Auditory (IVA-2) functional test was administered to insure proper inclusion in both groups. Twelve 45-minute sessions aimed at improving executive functioning were provided to both groups with the Captain’s Log cognitive training software. Executive functioning was measured with cognitive tasks: attention with the Continuous Performance Task (CPT), working memory with the N-Back task, and inhibition with a Go/No Go task. Driving skills were appraised with a virtual reality driving task measuring speed management (mean, variability, percentage over the speed limit) and stopping (deceleration, and frequency of stopping at red traffic lights and pedestrian crosswalks). Executive functioning and driving skills were measured at pre- and post-training. Two repeated measures MANOVA were used to test the research hypotheses. Results Results from the IVA-2 confirmed group membership. At pre-training, the analyses showed that the ADHD group performed more poorly than the non-ADHD group on the CPT, N-Back, Go/No Go, and driving task (higher average driving speed, higher speed standard deviation and stopping less at red lights and crosswalks). At post-training, there was a significant improvement in executive functions and driving skills in both groups. Compared to the non-ADHD group, the cognitive training program was associated with stronger improvement in executive functions for the ADHD group. However, improvement in driving skills did not differ between groups. Conclusion Results confirmed previous findings that computerized cognitive training is associated with greater improvement in executive functioning in adolescents diagnosed with ADHD than in non-ADHD individuals. Results also suggest that the training may have some potential to improve driving skills of both adolescents with and without ADHD in the pre-driving stage. Future research is recommended to examine computerized cognitive training aiming more directly to improve on-road driving performance of young ADHD individuals.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the factors influencing user trust and driving performance in level 3 automated driving from the perspective of perceived benefits,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.013,105,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Individual trust can depend on the trade-off between perceived risk and perceived benefits (PBs). However, previous studies have primarily focused on risk-related factors, ignoring the potential trust factors of automated driving systems (ADS) in low-risk situations from the perspective of PBs. This study conceptualized the sub-dimensions of PB based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and examined the effects of two types of automation capability—processing capability and detecting capability—and interactive guidance framework on driving performance and driver trust in a simulated level 3 ADS. Results showed that processing capability and interactive guidance framework were critical factors in drivers’ PB and trust in the ADS. Higher processing capability and the use of a graphic interface were associated with increased PB and trust. Detecting capability affected driving performance, earlier ADS detection corresponded with slower driver reaction times. PB mediated the effects of processing capability and interactive guidance framework on trust. These findings enhance the understanding of human trust in ADS from the PB perspective and provide guidance for designing guided tutorials and interactive guidance program to improve human trust and human-ADS interactions.",1369-8478,Not found
Attitudes toward driving after cannabis use: A systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.005,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"As cannabis policies become more permissive, there is concern that driving after cannabis use (DACU) will increase. From a prevention perspective, understanding whether attitudes toward DACU are positive or negative can guide messaging to reduce DACU. This meta-analysis summarizes quantitative data on attitudes toward DACU safety. Four electronic databases were searched from their inception to February 2024 for studies reporting quantitative data on attitudes toward cannabis use and driving. A total of 1,099 records were retrieved. We summarized data from studies reporting the proportion of respondents endorsing a response option(s) and studies reporting means and standard deviations of endorsed Likert-scale response options using inverse-variance methods. Most respondents had unfavorable views on DACU safety. Among 32 studies, the pooled proportion of respondents endorsing negative attitudes toward DACU was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.62; 0.75). Only ten studies reported the mean and standard deviation of Likert-scale responses; attitudes in these studies were in line with results from the analysis of proportions. Although most people have negative attitudes toward DACU, it is concerning that around one third do not. Prevention initiatives can capitalize on the association between attitude and behaviour to design public messaging.",1369-8478,Not found
Gender affects perception and movement times during non-critical takeovers in conditionally automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.004,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"The upcoming introduction of automated vehicles is expected to reduce the incidence of traffic accidents caused by human error. However, conditionally automated driving faces a significant challenge in that the driver must promptly take control when a request to intervene (RtI) is issued. Given this context, many studies have investigated the characteristics of the time it takes drivers to take control following an RtI and the factors influencing this time. It is also known that the driver's take-over response following an RtI is similar to the driver's braking response to the brake light of a lead vehicle or the yellow light of a traffic signal. Hence, findings on driver braking responses can provide valuable insights for take-over research. For example, gender was found to differentially affect perception time (PT) and movement time (MT), which are both subcomponents of the brake-response time in manual driving. Positive correlations were observed between these two times. These characteristics could be expected for PT and MT in take-over time (TOT) due to the similarities between braking and take-over responses; however, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet examined these characteristics. Therefore, the present study was conducted to experimentally determine whether driver gender differentially affects the PT and MT, which are both subcomponents of TOT. Additionally, the correlations between these components were examined. This study provides novel insights into PT and MT during non-critical takeovers, facilitating a better understanding of TOT. Specifically, among drivers up to middle age, who were the target demographic group of this study, females tended to have a shorter PT, whereas males tended to have a shorter MT. This indicates that gender-specific approaches may be effective at reducing TOT, as gender is associated with differences in PT and MT. In addition, positive correlations were observed between PT, MT, and TOT. The correlation between PT and TOT indicates PT as an effective predictor of TOT. TOT data were collected in non-critical take-over scenarios, which are typical for conditionally automated vehicles. A total of 311 trials were performed using a driving simulator with 15 male and 15 female participants, resulting in 300 take-over data points. TOT was divided into PT and MT using video coding performed by two coders. Gender in this study was defined as being a biological male or female, and was obtained following the participants' permission.",1369-8478,Not found
Research on the effect of control size and location of human-machine interface display on drivers’ multi-resource demands,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.019,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Interaction by touching a human–machine interaction (HMI) display has gradually evolved into the mainstream mode of human-vehicle interaction. Limiting the level of driver distraction caused by HMIs is an important concern. To explore the different positions and sizes of controls based on the multi-resource demands of the driver, a driving simulator experiment was conducted. The goal was to collect behavioral and subjective workload data from drivers performing secondary tasks under various conditions. Overall, the resources required by the driver to perform secondary tasks were relatively low on the left side of the HMI display and relatively high on the right side. Specifically, the lower-left position of the HMI display required the least resources, whereas the upper-right position required the most. Consequently, the results indicate that the resource demands of the secondary task on the driver decrease as the size of the controls increases. Most drivers preferred a “compromise” control size (18 mm). To reduce the resource demand, the control size of the HMI display should be set to at least 14 mm. This study has high industrial application value, and the results provide guidance for designing in-vehicle HMI displays with improved safety and usability.",1369-8478,Not found
Drivers’ situational awareness of surrounding vehicles during takeovers: Evidence from a driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.016,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"This study aimed to understand the influence of surrounding vehicle configuration, driving lane, and traffic density on drivers’ situational awareness (SA), takeover performance, and eye-tracking behaviors in conditionally automated driving. An experiment was conducted with the participation of 40 university students using a fixed-base driving simulator configured to simulate SAE Level 3 automation. During the experiment, participants were engaged in playing Tetris on a tablet as a non-driving related task in automated driving mode. Upon hearing an auditory takeover request, participants were instructed to take control of the vehicle, and then complete a scene reconstruction task to report their SA after transferring control back to the automated driving system. Our findings showed that drivers often neglected vehicles at their sides and rear during the takeover, which was associated with higher collision risks. Higher oncoming traffic density led to drivers’ worse SA of surrounding vehicles but more cautious driving behavior. Driving in the right lane generally resulted in smoother takeovers with lower collision risks. Interestingly, while SA did moderate the impacts of driving conditions on safety margins, a higher level of SA did not consistently relate to improved performance, especially in complex scenarios. This suggests the need for support systems that guide drivers to focus on safety–critical objects rather than simply amplifying SA in general. These insights have significant implications for the design of driver monitoring and support systems in automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
"Location, location, location! An application of situational action theory to phone use while driving in different environments",10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.020,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Situational action theory (SAT) is a comprehensive theory that explains offending behaviour from the context of the interaction between interpersonal factors, such as morals, self-control, and habits, with situational factors, such as environmental risk and social conditions. Illegal hand-held mobile phone use while driving (MPUWD), a prevalent and risky road behaviour, has yet to be examined under the SAT framework. Therefore, by utilising SAT, this exploratory study sought to investigate the interpersonal and situational factors preceding hand-held MPUWD in three distinct road environments (highways, built-up areas and stopped-at-traffic lights). To achieve this, Queensland drivers aged over 18 who owned a mobile phone (N = 821, Mage = 41.7 years, SD = 20.9 years) were invited to complete an online survey. Repeated measures ANOVAs demonstrated significant mean differences for participants’ perceived risks associated with MPUWD and subsequent likelihood of offending across the three environments, with traffic lights being more conducive to MPUWD behaviours. Three hierarchical multiple linear regressions also revealed that age, attitude, risk of judgement, and self-control were significant predictors of MPUWD across all environments, while the results for gender, risk of injury and risk of being apprehended varied across the different driving contexts. Together, these factors explained 38.5–39.6 % of the variance in the perceived likelihood of illegally engaging in MPUWD. Overall, the findings indicated that the application of SAT has predictive utility in determining MPUWD engagement and can provide a more comprehensive framework for approaching and intervening in MPUWD behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Subjective assessment of traffic rules compliance in bulgaria: Role of personality and driving style,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.013,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"It is generally accepted that driving is safer when the rules are obeyed. Therefore, the pursuit of greater compliance with traffic rules is often seen as an intermediate goal in ensuring road safety. The article presents two studies that aim to investigate the subjective assessment of traffic rules compliance and the role of personality and behavioural factors such as anxiety, sensation seeking, driving anger, aggressive driving, and risky driving (Study 1; N=1433) on the one hand, and driving style (Study 2; N=456) on the other hand. The studies also examine the differences in traffic rules compliance by age, sex, driving experience, and negative driving outcomes such as registered violations, driving licence suspensions, and involvement traffic accidents. Self-report methods are used to assess personality factors, driving style, traffic rules compliance, and negative driving outcomes. The results show a generally positive assessment of compliance with traffic rules among the participants, with the majority reporting compliance in their daily driving behaviour. Study 1 indicates that all personality factors investigated are significant predictors of traffic rules compliance. Study 2 demonstrates that the risky style, the irrational style, the distress-reduction style, and the patient and careful style are significant predictors of traffic rule compliance. Demographic differences are also observed, with women being significantly more likely than men to perceive themselves as compliant drivers. In terms of negative driving outcomes, both studies demonstrate that individuals with a record of driving violations in the last three years, a suspended driving licence, and involvement in a traffic accident are significantly less likely to rate themselves as compliant. The results can contribute to the development of prevention programmes and road safety strategies to promote safer driving behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
Dynamic and quantitative trust modeling and real-time estimation in human-machine co-driving process,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.001,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"The development of automated vehicles (AVs) will remain in the stage of human–machine co-driving for a long time. Trust is considered as an effective foundation of the interaction between the driver and the automated driving system (ADS). Driver’s trust miscalibration, represented by under-trust and over-trust, is considered to be the potential cause of disuse and misuse of ADS, or even serious accidents. The estimation and calibration of trust are crucial to improve the safety of the driving process. This paper mainly consists of the following two aspects. Firstly, a dynamic and quantitative trust estimation model is established. A framework for trust estimation is constructed. Driver’s perceived risk and behavior features were monitored and a Kalman filter was used to dynamically and quantitatively estimate the driver’s trust. We conducted a driver-in-the-loop experiment and generated model parameters through a data-driven approach. The results demonstrated that the model exhibited precision in trust estimation, with the highest accuracy reaching 74.1%. Secondly, a reminder strategy to calibrate the over-trust of the driver is proposed based on the model from the first part. A scenario with four risky events was designed and the ADS would provide voice reminders to the driver when over-trust was detected. The results demonstrated that the reminder strategy proved to be beneficial for safety enhancement and moderate trust maintenance during the driving process. When the driver is over-trusting, the accident rates of the reminder group and the non-reminder group were 60.6% and 13.0%, respectively. Our contribution in this paper can be concluded by four points: (1) A real-time trust estimation model is proposed, which is dynamic and quantitative, considering the evolution pattern of driver’s trust and the perceived risk; (2) Mathematical modeling and machine learning methods are combined; (3) A trust-based reminder strategy that aims to enhance the safety of human–machine co-driving is designed; (4) Driver-in-loop experiment validates the effectiveness in enhancing the safety, maintaining driver’s trust and reducing trust biases in human–machine co-driving.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the causes of frequent accidents at highway tunnel exits: Coupling analysis of the slack effect and white hole effect in extra-long tunnels,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.018,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In this paper, the causes of frequent traffic accidents at the exits of highway tunnels are investigated. This study recruited 34 subjects to conduct vehicle experiments using an illumination meter, eye tracker, Smarter Eye and OBD to measure the illumination, eye movement characteristics, driving trajectory, and speed while driving in a tunnel exit. A questionnaire was used to investigate drivers’ subjective feelings while driving. The change trend of each indicator in the area near the tunnel exit was analyzed, and the relationships among the light environment, driver physiology, driving behavior, and driver psychology were explored. The psychological and physiological inconsistency phenomenon and abnormal acceleration behavior were observed at the tunnel exit, and the slack effect was verified. As the tunnel exit area is driven through, with the rapid increase in illumination, the rate of change of the driver’s pupil area increases, and the distance between the vehicle and the tunnel sidewall increases. It is unreasonable that in a tunnel exit with a poor traffic environment, some drivers experience psychological slack and tend to increase their speed and accelerate out of the tunnel. The slack effect is observed in most drivers, approximately 79.4% of the total. The white hole effect interferes with drivers’ vision and reduces their ability to obtain traffic information. The slack effect reduces drivers’ attention and increases vehicle speed. A coupling effect exists between the white hole and slack effects, which together threaten traffic safety at the tunnel exit.",1369-8478,Not found
Impact of traffic signs on driving speed at mountain highway tunnel entrances − The role of low-volume intermittent information,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.021,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Driver’s perception of speed is the basis of driving safety, and installing speed limit signs at tunnel entrances is an intuitive means of controlling a driver’s driving speed. Therefore, tunnel entrance signs should be set up effectively to ensure each signage can fulfil its intended effect. Quantifying the information volume conveyed by traffic signs, discovering the impact of different information volumes on driving speeds, and understanding the effects of typical signs are the prerequisites for the effective use of signage. This study collected the speed variations of 40 drivers driving at nine mountainous highway tunnels with different entrance traffic signs through a naturalistic driving real vehicle test. The effect of low-volume intermittent information at tunnel entrances is identified in terms of the black hole effect on drivers (BHD), white hole effect on drivers (WHD), velocity fluctuation trend (VFT), and effect of speed limit signs (ELS). The study’s results confirm that the effect of speed limit signage with traffic sign information volume (TSIV) in the range of 8.904 to 33.318 bit is significant. In comparison, the sign will lose its effectiveness in guiding drivers to control their speed when TSIV is greater than 58.641 bits. Using low-volume information speed limit signs or tunnel warning signs repeated twice before entering a tunnel can alert drivers and regulate their driving speeds. The speed limit sign (sign ①) for each type of vehicle is set individually, and the combined speed limit and no lane change sign (sign ②) used in two stacks have a strong speed control effect. Moreover, the sign ②, when used alone, has the best timeliness; the effective distance of speed control can reach 1522 m; using it before short tunnels or long tunnels less than 1500 m can achieve better effectiveness.",1369-8478,Not found
The proportions of severe and less severe bicycle crashes and how to avoid them,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.027,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Background In collaboration with a bicycle airbag helmet company, data were collected to help explain events where head protections are deployed. The head protection records activations continuously, and when a head protection is deployed, this information is sent to the company. The company invited affected cyclists to (i) participate in a web survey, and (ii) share their data with researchers. The first aim of the study was to investigate the proportions between different severities of crashes, i.e., how many crashes with serious injuries occur for every crash with minor injuries, while the second aim was to predict when bicycle crashes will occur. Method: A total of 196 cyclists completed the web survey. Participants were 20–76 years old (mean age 46 years) and consisted of 125 women and 55 men. The cyclists were highly educated, and 73 percent had completed a university or college education. In addition, head protection data were collected from 355 other cyclists, of which 264 had their helmet deployed. Results: One of the 182 (included events) cyclists ended up in hospital care. The data collected indicated the proportions of cyclists who needed hospital care (1 = severe injuries), cyclists with injuries (15), slight injures (85) and cyclists who could continue as before (81 = no injuries). The head protection data confirmed the web survey findings, but also demonstrated that the head protection, on journeys that ended with head protection deployment, had a higher degree of activations before the event) compared to journeys where it was not deployed. Furthermore, on trips made after deployment, the head protection had lower levels of activations, which can be understood as the cyclists adapting their behavior by, for example, riding more carefully (but not slower). Conclusion: This study highlights the proportions of events leading to minor injuries versus hospitalization. Activation measures (head protection conditions) can predict when events will occur, and cyclists will adjust their behavior accordingly following events.",1369-8478,Not found

Objective This follow-up study aimed to examine the effects of external factors, such as alternative design and pedestrian density, on motorists’ subjective experiences, and the speed and placement of their vehicles within a shared space. Methods To investigate this, Q-methodology was used to examine 32 motorists’ subjective experiences, and video recordings were analysed to measure the speed and placement of 150 vehicles on Fisherman’s Square in Västervik, Sweden, both without (75 vehicles) and with (75 vehicles) large flowerpots deployed. Results The motorists preferred when the large flowerpots were deployed to recreate the traditional division. The results also showed that both the large flowerpots and high pedestrian density decreased vehicles’ mean maximum speed. The deployment of large flowerpots also decreased the distribution of vehicles over the square. Conclusion Recreating some type of division between protected and unprotected road users appears to be preferred.

Measuring heterogeneity in pedestrians’ perceived importance towards crossing facilities: An experience in Roorkee,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.012,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Although several studies in the past discussed the effects of socio-demographic and trip characteristics on users’ preferences towards crossing facilities in urban areas, they were mostly confined to metro cities or million-plus cities. Adequate investigation has not been performed for the same in the small-sized cities where pedestrian activities are expected to be more frequent because of the higher share of shorter and walkable trip lengths. Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate the heterogeneity in the perceived importance of crossing facility attributes among different pedestrian groups based on gender, age group, and walking preference. The study was conducted in a small-sized city, Roorkee, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. A face-to-face questionnaire survey of 554 pedestrians was conducted to collect their perceived importance towards 12 crossing facility attributes under study using a 5-point Likert-type ordinal scale. Collected data was analyzed using the non-parametric tests to measure the heterogeneity in the perceived importance of crossing facility attributes among aforementioned pedestrian groups. Subsequently, the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was used to derive relative importance scores of attributes found statistically significant in heterogeneity tests for different pedestrian groups. The findings of the present study reveal that perceived importance towards crossing facility attributes is heterogeneous based on the pedestrians’ age group and walking preferences; however, it remains unaffected by gender.

Studies have shown that peer influence/pressure has a significant role in the traffic environment as well as in many other social settings, especially for risky behaviours. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine age and sex differences in respect of peer pressure and the role of peer pressure on driver behaviour in Türkiye. A total of 405 drivers with a mean age of 23.84 (SD=4.82) years completed an online survey consisting of the Peer Pressure on Risky Driving Scale (PPRDS), the Brief Sensation-Seeking Scale (BSSS) and the Short Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (S-DBQ, measuring aberrant and positive driver behaviour). First, the psychometric structure of the PPRDS, used for the first time in Turkish, was found to support the original structure, addressing direct pressure in the form of risk-encouraging or risk-discouraging and indirect pressure. Indirect pressure was seen to decrease with age for both males and females, whereas risk-discouraging direct pressure increased with age only for males. Sensation-seeking was positively related to aberrant behaviours. Risk-encouraging direct peer pressure and indirect pressure were positively associated with aberrant (risky) driver behaviour, whereas indirect peer pressure was associated with decreased aberrant driving behaviour and increased positive (helpful, polite) driving behaviour. The findings suggested that drivers feel strong peer pressure in traffic, but it varies by age and sex, and this pressure is stronger for young males.

This widespread reliance has resulted in negative impacts on individuals, societies, as well as the environment and the climate. Reducing car use would therefore come with considerable benefits. While the role of many socio-economic, structural and psychological factors in car use reduction is well established, the socio-cultural context of automobility is not well conceptualised and integrated into quantitative studies. The goal of this paper was to explore the role of the socio-cultural context of automobility, differentiating between past and future car use. To this end, we applied Automobility Engagement (AE) as a concept operationalising consumer interactions with cars within the automobility system. In regression models predicting past car use (i.e., one week of actual travel behaviour) and the intention to reduce car use in the future, we tested the explanatory power of AE’s seven facets in addition to selected socio-economic, structural and psychological factors. We recruited a sample of more than 2,000 participants in the German federal states of Baden-Württemberg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the summer of 2023. Results showed that the AE facets perceived car dependence, concern about the negative environmental effects of car use, house ownership preferences and car identity made small but significant contributions to our models whilst the three remaining AE facets did not. We found stronger associations with several socio-economic, structural and psychological variables such as owning a car, degree of urbanisation and transportation habits. We discuss the relevance of AE as an operationalisation of the socio-cultural context of automobility, its relatedness to other psychological factors and derive implications for policy design.",1369-8478,Not found
Driven to distraction: A systematic literature review on the role of the driving context in mobile phone use,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.006,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Mobile phone use is one of the most frequent causes of distraction among drivers. While there have been a significant number of studies that have examined individuals’ intentions to use a mobile phone while driving, the influence of individuals’ in-situ judgement of driving conditions has received considerably less attention. The aim of this investigation was to provide a systematic understanding of how factors associated with the driving context and environment influence a driver’s decision to engage in mobile phone use while driving. Following a systematic classification scheme, 41 research articles from the years 2011 to 2020 were reviewed and synthesised to identify the contextual determinants of mobile phone distraction. Overall, the findings provided support for the role that contextual features play in influencing individuals’ mobile phone use engagement. This finding was particularly the case in instances where mobile phone tasks required relatively high cognitive and physical demands on an individual, such as texting and/or reading mails. The findings also indicated that as contextual complexity increases, mobile phone use decreases as well. A deeper understanding of the relationship between contextual factors and phone use while driving may aid in the design of more efficient driver support systems and the development of distraction-sensitive road design guides. This understanding can also assist in the identification of mobile phone use hotspots and the improvement of law enforcement and educational strategies to prevent the behaviour.",1369-8478,Not found
How to define the threshold of takeover response ability of different drivers in conditional automated driving,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.013,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In conditional automated driving, the takeover response ability threshold is necessary for driver qualification assessment and liability division of automated vehicle accidents. The primary objective of this study is to establish a clear and quantifiable threshold for drivers’ takeover response ability in conditional automated driving scenarios. This threshold aims to serve as a benchmark for evaluating drivers’ readiness and developing safety regulations in automated driving. We designed 18 takeover events and invited 42 drivers to participate in the driving simulation experiment, and obtained their takeover time data. First, we analyze the differences of takeover time among drivers with different attributes (gender, age, driving year). Second, based on the Peaks Over Threshold and the generalized Pareto distribution model, we use the graphic method to calculate the range of takeover time threshold for drivers with different attributes. The result shows that the difference in the threshold range of takeover time between male and female drivers is relatively tiny. There are differences in the threshold range of takeover time for different age drivers, and the threshold is negatively correlated with age. Drivers with high driving experience within a safe range are allowed to have longer takeover times. Finally, the rationality of the takeover time threshold for drivers with different attributes has been verified. The return level curves are approximately linear (R2 > 0.77), indicating that the GPD model can capture the overall trend of the return level, which is changing with the probability level. This proves that the takeover time threshold is reasonable. This study uses TTC min to calibrate takeover safety, and the takeover time threshold has a good classification performance for takeover safety (accuracy > 85 %). The above content proves the rationality of the takeover time threshold. The contribution of this study is to calculate the takeover time threshold of drivers with different attributes, which can help regulatory authorities assess the driver’s takeover response ability and support the liability division of automated vehicle accidents.",1369-8478,Not found
Enhancing work zone Safety: A psychological and behavioral analysis of Anti-Tailgating strategies using dynamic message signs and fixed warning signs,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.007,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Rear-end collisions in work zones, particularly those resulting from tailgating, pose a significant safety challenge that has not been adequately addressed in road safety research. Existing studies have extensively investigated speeding, but the psychological triggers and behavioral patterns leading to tailgating remain largely unexplored. Bridging this critical gap, this research introduces an anti-tailgating strategy using dynamic and fixed message signs, designed with a deep understanding of driver psychology. The methodology involved a user-centric survey assessing the effect of positively toned, non-numerical anti-tailgating messages, which favored clearer comprehension and elicited favorable psychological responses from drivers. Field experiments demonstrated that these signs effectively increased headway and decreased tailgating, without the traffic disruptions associated with pavement markings or the technological limitations of in-vehicle alerts. These encouraging results underscore the potential of strategically placed message signs to positively influence driver behavior. This research not only fills a significant void by elucidating the behavioral factors of tailgating in work zones, but also paves the way for the implementation of behaviorally informed and nonintrusive road safety interventions. The use of dynamic and fixed message signs emerges as a promising, technologically inclusive, and psychologically effective tool for improving road safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Lessons learned from naturalistic driving data processing in a secure data enclave: Preliminary discoveries from analyzing dash camera videos,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.012,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"This paper provides preliminary insights on the challenges of processing Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) videos and data, particularly those with Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Insights and lessons learned are presented from a study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of High Visibility Crosswalks (HVCs). Over a one-month period, 15,379 videos were processed in the secure data enclave of Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI). As these videos are not available outside of the secure data enclave due to PII restrictions, researchers visiting the secure data enclave for the first time may face several challenges: navigating the software interface; identifying the video views and frames of interest; and identifying and extracting information of interest from the video views, etc. These challenges, the procedures followed to address them, and the process for identifying and classifying distracted driving behaviors are discussed. Lastly, hypothesis tests are conducted to investigate distracted driving behavior, with the results revealing that HVCs have the potential to make drivers more cautious in their proximity. The information presented in this paper is expected to aid researchers who intend to utilize SHRP2 NDS or similar videos for future research, to preemptively plan for the video processing phase.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of public transport priority policy on private car own and use: A study on the moderating effects of bus satisfaction,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.010,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"China started implementing a public transport priority policy in 2004 to encourage people to use public transit, especially buses, and reduce reliance on private cars. This paper used 334 questionnaire survey data from Changzhou City, China, and explored the moderating role of bus satisfaction based on the examination of the antecedents and consequences of affective motivation for private cars through two studies. Study 1 explored the antecedents of affective motivation for private cars and the moderating effect of bus satisfaction. The empirical results revealed that instrumental motivation is the most relevant predictor of affective motivation favoring private cars, followed by symbolic motivation. The moderating effect of bus satisfaction on the relationship between symbolic motivation and affective motivation was significantly negative. Study 2 explored the consequences of affective motivation for private cars and the moderating effect of bus satisfaction. Empirical results indicate that decisions regarding private car ownership and use are significantly negatively influenced by bus satisfaction. Bus satisfaction has a significantly positive moderating effect on the relationship between affective motivation and private car ownership and use. The marginal effect of bus satisfaction on the probability of simultaneously owning and using private cars is significantly negative, and it strengthens the influence of affective motivation in promoting both ownership and use of private cars. These results demonstrate that for individuals with experience using both buses and private cars, the public transport priority policy focused on improving bus service quality can effectively reduce private car ownership and use. These results can serve as evidence to support policymakers in continuing to enhance the public transport priority policy.",1369-8478,Not found
Do one's moral foundations impact how they respond to information on climate change emissions? A vehicle choice experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.026,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Transportation is a major source of climate change emissions. Providing people with better information on those emissions is one means of helping individuals make climate-friendly choices. However, not everyone is influenced by the same type of information. Previous research has demonstrated that Goal Framing Theory could help improve the influence of climate change emissions information and that different framings have different levels of influence depending on a number of socio-demographic and attitudinal characteristics. However, apart from climate change motivation, what other underlying psychological factors might help us understand why the framings vary in their influence between individuals? Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) identifies key values that influence people’s moral decisions, providing a useful framework for understanding diverse responses to information. The objective of this study is to understand whether MFT can help explain different responses by individuals and identify which framings are associated with stronger responses for different moral foundations. This study investigates the moderating effects of moral foundations on individuals’ responsiveness to different emission information framings. Utilizing data from discrete choice experiments involving 2015 Canadian drivers, we examine how different moral foundations impact the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reducing emissions. The results reveal that the impact of emissions information framing varies significantly according to individuals’ moral foundations. Specifically, moral values associated with Authority, Fairness, and Purity play negative moderating roles on WTP for CO2 emissions under different framings, whereas Ingroup and Harm foundations have positive moderating effects on WTP with the framings tested. Additionally, innovative communication tools like new emojis demonstrated strong positive effects on WTP, especially among those with strong Ingroup, Fairness, and Purity values. Conversely, individuals with a strong Authority value showed the lowest WTP when presented with pressure gauge visuals. Using appropriate framing based on Moral Foundation Theory can considerably change the willingness-to-pay for climate change emissions for different parts of the population, with a notable increase in WTP observed among individuals inclined to alter their behavior. Future framings should incorporate MFT in their design.",1369-8478,Not found
Predicting trucking accidents with truck drivers’ safety climate perception: An in-depth evaluation of the pretrain-then-finetune approach,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.009,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"There is a rising interest in using AI-powered safety analytics to predict accident outcomes. However, companies face the challenge of developing accurate safety analytics models. One possible solution is to use a pretrain-then-finetune parameter-transfer learning approach for a “target company” to utilize knowledge generated from the data of other “source companies”. However, transfer learning is uncommon in safety analytics due to reasons such as lack of publicly available large-scale pre-training data and pre-trained models, differences between the source and target companies, andlack of guidelines. To fill the above gaps, we conducted experiments to study the effectiveness of transfer learning in the context of using truck drivers’ safety climate data for predicting trucking accidents. To facilitate the experiments, we developed SafeNet, a deep neural network algorithm for classifying accident outcomes. The safety climate survey data are from seven trucking companies with different sample sizes. Three new evaluation indicators are proposed to evaluate the difference between finetuned models and models trained from scratch. The study shows that transfer learning is not effective in about 20% of the cases that usedpretrained models trained on one source company’s data. Instead of sample size and data diversity, the study found that accuracy of the pretrained model is more important. The trucking industry may, thus, consider developing different pretrained models for different types of companies. To promote the adoption of transfer learning in safety analytics, we make our code and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/NUS-DBE/Pretrain-Finetune-safety-climate.",1369-8478,Not found

The purpose of this study is to generate a scale that will allow evaluation rider aggression in Spanish-speaking countries. Through a two-phase methodology, a scale that evaluates this variable was constructed. The first phase consisted of gathering content validity for the scale, and a large group of items was comprised. Then, the second phase consisted of gathering 800 riders from Mexico and Spain, which provided the data from which construct validity was attempted and the indicators here presented were generated. Through this effort, a scale that evaluated Rider Aggression is constructed and is ready for its use in Mexico and Spain, although more research is warranted, and a larger number of Spanish-speaking countries is indicated. In the end, a definition for Rider Aggression is provided by the authors, and it was interesting that it lacks the component of Risky Driving, probably because all motorcycle use is risky in itself.",1369-8478,Not found
The impact of cognitive load on a lane change task (LCT) among male autistic individuals: A driving simulator study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.030,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"This study investigated the impact of cognitive load on driving among autistic individuals with the use of an adapted, driving simulator-based, Lane Change Task (LCT). A secondary task was used to induce increasing verbal WM load. A total of 51 male participants, 17 autistic and 34 non-autistic individuals participated in the study. Participants drove the simulator-based LCT without (baseline) and with a three-level auditory-verbal response N-back task (i.e., 0-back,1-back, and 2-back) developed to tax working memory capacity. The included driving parameters were: mean deviation in the lane change path (MDEV), percentage of correct lane changes (PCL) in response to a lane change sign, and lane change initiation (LCI). The percentage of error rate (PER) was included to measure participants’ performance on the secondary task. Dual-task performance of both groups deteriorated with increasing cognitive load, but this effect was more pronounced in the autistic group. Specifically, the performance of both group on MDEV, PCL, and PER suffered from the increasing cognitive load. Nevertheless, neither PCL nor LCI differ between autistic and non-autistic participants. Notably, LCI also deteriorated with increasing cognitive load for non-autistic participants, but not for autistic participants. Similar to previous research, it is suggested that distracted driving should be eliminated as much as possible before occurring in the first place. Specific suggestions for eliminating distraction in autistic drivers are provided.",1369-8478,Not found
The role of innovative visibility aids on e-scooter riders’ conspicuity in daylight,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.024,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Objective This study explores how different visibility aids of contrasting colours could enhance the e-scooter riders’ conspicuity under daylight conditions. Background With the rise in popularity of shared e-scooter services, an increase in incidents involving e-scooter riders and motorized counterparts was noticed. Method 48 licensed drivers (mean age = 24.6 years) detected the e-scooter riders in the videos and images featuring a simulated urban road environment in daylight, while performing a secondary task (n-back). The time to detect standing and moving e-scooter riders and subjective conspicuity ratings were assessed in three visibility aid conditions: Control (grey clothes and grey backpack), Patterned Jacket (jacket and backpack with checkerboard black and yellow pattern) and Wheels-Backpack (yellow stripes on the e-scooter wheels and on a dark backpack). Results Improved detectability was observed for e-scooter riders in the Wheels-Backpack condition, resulting in a minimum 168 ms increase in detection time compared to other two conditions. In terms of conspicuity ratings, participants gave higher scores to riders wearing Wheels-Backpack and Patterned Jacket (6.02 and 6.31, respectively, on a Likert 10-point scale), with no significant difference between them. Detection from videos or images showed similar effects. For all of these analyses, Bonferroni post-hoc tests followed a Repeated-measures ANOVA. Conclusion Distributing contrasting colours across the e-scooter and the rider enhanced their daylight conspicuity better than when contrasting colours were located on the riders’ upper body. However, drivers did not realise that these two visibility aids were not equal in terms of conspicuity benefits.",1369-8478,Not found
Promoting a sustainable behavioral shift in commuting choices: the role of previous intention and “personalized travel plan” feedback,10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.027,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"According to the European Environment Agency (European Environmental Agency, EEA, 2018), road transport is responsible for 72% of all transport-related greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union (EU), which accounts for 25% of total energy-related emissions (Eurostat, 2018). Thus, it is crucial to identify drivers and barriers to more sustainable transport behaviors. In this regard, the Norm Activation Model and Theory of Planned Behavior have often been used as conceptual frameworks for predicting such behaviors. The present study aimed to analyze the differential impact of both socio-psychological factors and persuasive messages sent through a Personalized Travel Plan (PTP) on Sustainable Transport Choices (STC). To reach this aim we administered a survey two times (T1: Oct./Dec. 2020; T2: March/May 2021) to 398 car users. Measures of constructs included in the Norm Activation Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior, such as behavioral intention, attitude, perceived behavioral control, beliefs, and personal and social norms, were detected. Participants were then exposed to a PTP built on feedback information regarding kilocalories, CO2 emissions, cost, and time savings when using sustainable transport compared to driving a car. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis shows that intention to use sustainable transport in T1 is on one side directly predicted by personal norm, perceived behavioral control, and attitude, and on the other side emerged as the main predictor of sustainable travel choices in T2, together with kcal spent, whereas time was the major barrier. Implications and future developments are discussed in the light of the conceptual framework.",1369-8478,Not found
What drives the change in safety perception and willingness to re-ride shared automated passenger Shuttles?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.008,106,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Recognizing the potential transformative impact on transportation systems, safety perceptions of Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs) have gained significant attention from researchers in recent years. Yet, the critical factors influencing perception changes and the willingness to re-ride (WTR) have not been extensively studied despite their relevance to SAV operations. This study applied Bayesian Networks (BNs) and Text Network (TN) methodologies to analyze survey data from a shared automated passenger shuttle (SAPS) pilot program conducted between March and April 2023, at Fred G. Bond Metro Park in Cary, North Carolina. Participants in the survey provided feedback on their safety perceptions of the SAPS before and after riding, as well as their willingness to ride again. Key findings reveal that shuttle operations, especially timely arrival and drop-off, significantly affect both perceptional change and WTR. Furthermore, users who accessed the shuttle by walking, biking, or public transportation were more likely to positively change their perception and express a willingness to ride the shuttle again. Also, individuals with initial perceptions of the SAPS as very unsafe or unsafe showed a higher likelihood of perception change. Conversely, older respondents were less likely to experience safety perception changes and WTR. Text network analysis further illuminated that the primary motivations for WTR were the enjoyable experience and convenience offered by the shuttle. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on SAVs by providing practical implications for the future development and testing of SAPSs. These insights are invaluable for policymakers and planners in optimizing SAPS operations, providing a deeper understanding of user experiences and expectations.",1369-8478,Not found

We conducted a systematic review with the main aim of summarizing the existing research literature on road traffic suicides covering all road users who attempt or die by suicide in road traffic. A secondary and more specific aim was to examine the consequences for possible secondary participants. Our ultimate aim was to identify prevention measures. Relevant publications (N = 48) were identified in Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and supplemented with three studies from a personal database. We covered and discussed the following twelve topics: Countries where the data has been collected; Publication years – a historical overview; The main purpose of the studies; Data sources; How suicide was confirmed/defined (Differences between decisions by crash investigators and those of official forensic examinations); The proportion of suicides on roads; Types of crashes; The second party; Who dies by suicide in road traffic?

Anticipatory vibrotactile cues reduce motion sickness in car passengers during stop-and-go driving,10.1016/j.trf.2024.10.011,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Approximately 2/3 of all people have suffered from carsickness at some point in their lives with symptoms including disorientation, headache, apathy, nausea, or even vomiting. The development and introduction of automated driving functions are expected to further increase the frequency of occurrence and the symptom severity of carsickness, in particular when the passenger’s eyes are no longer on the road during non-driving related activities. Although the symptoms associated with carsickness are unpleasant and may limit the acceptance of automated driving functions, effective and applicable countermeasures are still scarce. In the genesis of carsickness, the ability to anticipate upcoming vehicle movements may be a relevant factor. Previous studies examining the effects of anticipatory cues on carsickness, mostly using laboratory setups, revealed mixed results, some suggest a positive effect of anticipatory cues on carsickness, others do not. In the present study, we investigated the effect of anticipatory, vibrotactile stimuli on the development of motion sickness in a partially automated drive on a test track. In a repeated measures design, 37 participants experienced two 17-minute stop-and-go rides. During the ride, they watched a movie and were asked about their current motion sickness level every minute using the Fast Motion Sickness Scale (FMS). In the intervention condition, participants also received vibrotactile cues about upcoming braking and acceleration via a vibrotactile belt one second in advance of the event.

What does it take for rural-urban commuters to switch from driving to carpooling?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.10.007,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This study aims at identifying the potential ways to increase the willingness to carpool, particularly in rural–urban travel settings, where there is no/minimal public transit service (due to low population density) and purchasing a personal vehicle poses a significant financial burden for many households. To do so, we used time flexibility, defined as the tolerance for increased commute time (which can happen because of re-routing and picking up others when carpooling), as a proxy to willingness to carpool. Using structural equation modeling and survey responses from about 1000 workers and college students living in a rural county in Central Pennsylvania, we analyzed the sociodemographic, attitudinal, and situational factors that can lead to higher time flexibility when carpooling. We also investigated whether people’s time flexibility changes when they are offered monetary incentives (in terms of travel costs reimbursement). The results indicated that being a driving fan and seeking privacy when traveling reduces time flexibility, while being conscientious about environment and health leads to higher time flexibility. Moreover, females, people who had inconvenient past carpool experiences, and those living closer (within 20 min of driving) to their workplace/college showed lower time flexibility. On the other hand, people with lower income and higher driving costs were willing to tolerate longer commute times if reimbursed for a portion of their travel costs. We also found that if there is no initial level of willingness to carpool, reimbursement offers cannot do much to sway people’s decisions.",1369-8478,Not found
Augmented reality HMI for distracted drivers in a level 3 automation: Effects on takeover performance and safety,10.1016/j.trf.2024.10.002,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"With an increased level of automation, drivers can divert attention from the road environment and engage in non-driving-related tasks, thus reducing situation awareness, which could impact safety in cases of manual takeover requests. In this research, an augmented reality situation-adaptive human–machine interface (HMI) was simulated in a virtual environment. The HMI aimed to improve the quality of takeovers by boosting the reconstruction of situation awareness in distracted drivers following a takeover request in a Level 3 automated driving situation. To this end, the HMI displayed salient visual cues (bottom-up process) for important elements that drivers should pay attention to. Instructions from a user manual were also provided, detailing how to regain situation awareness by presenting the ideal takeover sequence (top-down process), which was necessary for the use of the HMI. For this purpose, an experiment was conducted using a medium-fidelity static driving simulator with a sample of 35 participants distributed according to three between-subjects conditions: “control – basic user manual without HMI,” “ideal takeover sequence focused user manual without HMI,” and “ideal takeover sequence focused user manual with HMI.” According to the results, the augmented reality HMI improved safety in takeovers involving lane changes in heavy traffic and emergency braking, with better traffic insertion and higher time to collision. Participants who only received the user manual dedicated to the ideal takeover sequence (top-down process) exhibited less visual exploration of the driving environment in the takeover situations, which could lead to safety issues.

Do dotted extensions help guide drivers at a transition area of partial-shadowed left-turn lane? An investigation based on eye movement behavior and visual attention,10.1016/j.trf.2024.10.009,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"When adding an exclusive left-turn lane at an intersection, a transition area is needed to allow through and left-turn traffic to move into appropriate lanes smoothly. However, whether a dotted extension should be applied at such a transition area remains inconclusive. The need for recommending a dotted extension is further complicated at intersections where an approach taper partially shadows a left-turn lane. This study aims to shed light on whether dotted extensions should be recommended in a transition area and research the impacts of dotted extensions on guiding drivers from their perspectives. Scenarios with and without dotted extensions were created for a video-viewing experiment. Driver eye movement behavior and cognitive load rating served as evaluation indicators in each target scenario. Thirty participants were recruited and randomly assigned to with and without dotted extension groups. Results show that: (1) With the dotted extension, participants could focus on fewer objects and, therefore, would not need to divert their visual attention toward the surrounding vehicles. (2) The dotted extension assists through-traffic drivers in maintaining more focused attention on information critical to their driving task. (3) Dotted extensions help drivers reduce stress, mainly because of clearer indications of lane configuration. Altogether, our findings suggest that a road with dotted extensions provides better guidance in a transition area than one without dotted extensions.",1369-8478,Not found

Susceptibility to distracted driving: The role of personality and individual factors,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.013,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The present study aimed to investigate the association between the Big Five personality dimensions with the susceptibility of distracted driving (i.e., engagement in voluntary distraction, attitudes toward distraction, and susceptibility to involuntary distraction) comparing samples of Australian and Italian drivers. Distracted driving remains a significant global challenge to road safety, contributing to the occurrence of motor-vehicle crashes with serious consequences on public and environmental health. Despite efforts to explore factors underlying distracted driving, less is known on the role of the driver’s personality in affecting the tendency to report distraction. Five hundred and fifty-one participants (55 % females; age range: 18–82 years; M ± sd: 40.4 ± 17.5) from Australia and Italy completed an online survey including questionnaires on personality and distracted driving. The invariance of the tested model was assessed through a multigroup path analysis considering personality traits as predictors and different facets of the susceptibility to distracted driving as outcomes, in a unique model. The effects of age, gender, and education were also controlled in the analyses. Results showed differences among nationality groups in personality traits as well as in susceptibility to distraction. The tested model showed invariance across nationality groups, suggesting positive effects of Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness on all dimensions of susceptibility to distracted driving. Furthermore, Conscientiousness was found to affect attitudes toward distraction, perceived control, and perceived social norms. Finally, the tendency to report susceptibility to involuntary distraction was influenced by Openness.

We surveyed 369 drivers to investigate the factors that predict trust in ADAS for current users. Participants were required to have experience using ADAS, specifically systems that simultaneously control longitudinal and lateral movement of the vehicle (participants reported using adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist systems at the same time in their vehicle at least 1–4 times per month). In addition to assessing trust, the survey included questions to assess objective knowledge about ADAS limitations, self-reported understanding of ADAS (i.e., how correct and complete drivers thought their understanding of ADAS was), number of methods they had previously used to learn about ADAS, frequency of ADAS use, familiarity with technology, propensity to trust technology, and demographics. Regression results showed that self-reported understanding, but not objective knowledge, predicted trust in ADAS, with higher self-reported understanding being associated with higher trust. Self-reported understanding was not correlated with objective knowledge; participants rated their self-reported understanding highly, but only identified an average of 42% of the system limitations included in the survey. Propensity to trust technology was also a significant predictor of trust in ADAS, with higher propensity to trust technology in general associated with higher trust in ADAS. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at supporting appropriate trust in ADAS could be designed to increase drivers’ awareness of potential gaps in their understanding and adjust expectations of ADAS for those with a high propensity to trust technology.",1369-8478,Not found
Validating risk behavior in driving simulation using naturalistic driving data,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.026,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The absence of physical accident risk in driving simulation, which allows for safely studying critical driving situations, also reduces the driver's risk perception, which may result in unrealistic driver behavior. Validation studies in this context are rare for ethical reasons, making it difficult to assess the extent of this issue at present. The present study addresses this gap by utilizing naturalistic driving data. Four critical cut-in situations on German highways were extracted from naturalistic data and replicated in a driving simulator study with N = 58 participants. Both in-situ self-ratings on subjective criticality and post-hoc video-based ratings (from the driver and objective observers), as well as presence ratings, were collected to supplement driver behavior. Although driver reactions in the simulator and the field were not equivalent in absolute terms, drivers in both the simulation and the real world exhibited accident-avoidance behavior through braking reactions, indicating relative validity. No clear mediating role of the sense of presence towards a more careful driver behavior was found. This work shows that drivers exhibit accident-avoiding behavior in the simulator and tend to react to hazards in the simulator similarly as they would in a real situation, while absolute numerical values should only be interpreted with caution.",1369-8478,Not found
Driving behavior in Hazardous situations: The interplay between risk scenarios and dimensional emotions,10.1016/j.trf.2024.10.004,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"As the contradictions among the human-vehicle-environment elements in road traffic systems intensify, the resulting traffic safety issues are becoming increasingly severe. Emotions, as critical psychological factors influencing safe driving, directly impact drivers’ perceptions and judgments of surrounding information. Simultaneously, potential risks during the driving process can affect drivers’ decisions and driving behavior. On the basis of the definition of dimensional emotions, this study analyzes the impact of different valence, arousal, and risk level scenarios on drivers’ collision avoidance behavior. A total of 21 drivers aged 18 to 50 years, with driving experience ranging from 1 to 10 years, participated in a simulated driving experiment. This study employs the decision tree (DT) algorithm to define the quantitative relationship between the occurrence of different driving behaviors and their influencing factors. It predicts vehicle avoidance behavior in two emergency conditions to determine whether collision avoidance can be achieved. The results indicate that the model’s prediction accuracy improves when emotion and risk level information are combined, reaching 88.89 %. This is a 5.56 % improvement over the model using only emotion information and a 2.53 % improvement over the model using only risk level information. Compared with the impact of subjective emotional factors on driving behavior, risk scenarios exhibit a more stable trend in influencing driving behavior. Under the interaction of emotions and risk factors, the accuracy and generalization ability of the driving behavior prediction model based on the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm have been greatly improved. This research provides a theoretical basis for addressing adverse driving behavior caused by driver emotions and analyzing the factors influencing collision avoidance processes.",1369-8478,Not found

Electric vehicles need to be charged. For maximal efficiency the charging times should be as short as possible. In the US charging stations are classified as Level 1 charging 5–10 miles/h, Level 2 25 miles/h and Fast DCFC stations 150–1000 miles/h. We asked participants to select one of two upgrades of charging stations that would save most charging time for a vehicle. The alternatives were upgrading L1 (5miles/h) to L2 (25 miles/h) or L2 (25miles/h) to Fast (250 miles/h). In all, 86% of the participants wanted to upgrade to a Fast station, which objectively saves less time than L1 to L2. The second study replicated the first study and 91% of the participants wanted to upgrade to the Fast (250) station. The third study offered alternatives with smaller objective efficiency differences than the earlier studies: upgrading L2 (30) to Fast (150) and Fast (150) to Fast (600) and 68% of the participants preferred the second incorrect alternative. Verbal justifications showed that many participants seemed to assume that differences in charging time are proportional to charging time saved. The results have practical implications and illustrate the difficulty to process reciprocal variables leading to incorrect decisions. Finally, we suggest two strategies for counteracting biased intuitive decision making when charging efficiencies are compared.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring the influence of a virtual reality experience on user acceptance of shared autonomous vehicles: A quasi-experimental study in Brussels,10.1016/j.trf.2024.10.003,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This paper investigates the intention to use shared autonomous vehicles in Brussels before and after an experience in virtual reality, in which a scenario of a city with shared autonomous vehicles was visualized taking into account transformations that are not possible to implement in real life such as urban form changes. 51 participants took part in a quasi-experiment and their acceptance of autonomous vehicles was measured before and after, using surveys based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we model user acceptance pre- and post-VR experience and compare the change in influencing factors. Results show that, under the conditions we defined, the intention to use autonomous shuttles was influenced by the virtual reality experience, as there was an increase in the behavioral intention and a change in the significant predictors. Overall, we found evidence that the virtual reality experience did influence the acceptance of autonomous vehicles, and can then be an effective test bed to visualize future impacts of autonomous vehicles that are impossible to project in real life. Our study constitutes then a first step into exploring potential usages of virtual reality to project long-term visions of future developments of cities with shared autonomous vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Beyond private-sphere pro-environmental action: Explaining shared mobility using the Theory of Planned Behavior and solidarity-oriented variables,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.014,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Shared mobility behaviors can decrease the negative environmental effects of the transport sector, yet they have received limited attention. Models such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) have been widely used to explain primarily individual private-sphere pro-environmental behaviors (PEB). However, as shared mobility behaviors are not completely limited to the private sphere but require social cooperation, solidarity-focused variables that emphasize social interactions may meaningfully complement the TPB variables. In three university samples (Study 1: N=261, Study 2: N=1411; Study 3: N=544), we tested relationships between the TPB variables and shared mobility, and whether solidarity-oriented variables are relevant predictors of shared mobility beyond the TPB variables. The analyses confirmed attitude ( β = 0.38 − 0.59, p < 0.001) and social norm ( β = 0.17 − 0.43, p < 0.001) as predictors of shared mobility intention. Furthermore, the solidarity-oriented variables universalism ( β = 0.09 − 0.18, p < 0.05) as well as specific collective efficacy ( β = 0.08 − 0.10, p < 0.05) and opinion-based social identification ( β = 0.18, p < 0.001) positively predicted shared mobility intention. Psychological variables showed no consistent connection to self-reported shared mobility behaviors in logistic regressions. We discuss the scope of solidarity-oriented variables that need social cooperation to complementarily explain PEB beyond the private sphere.",1369-8478,Not found
Willingness to utilize autonomous vehicles following accidents: A fresh perspective from mixed-methods research,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.022,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"While autonomous vehicles (AVs) show promise, several challenges remain in their implementation. In this regard, adverse incidents can alter public perceptions and acceptance of this technology. This study used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a random-parameters ordered probit model and a structural causal model to investigate public concerns regarding AV incidents and their influence on the public’s willingness to adopt AVs. Using LDA to analyse mass media data, this study identified seven latent variables related to AV incidents. To consider changes in public attitudes following incidents, attitude was introduced as a new latent variable. The impact of various variables on public willingness to use AVs was analysed using a random-parameters ordered probit model. The findings indicated that perceived trust, attitude, perceived risk, mass media, perceived value, brand effect, privacy concerns and policies and regulations are crucial factors influencing AV adoption. Subsequently, a causal structure model was developed to determine the inter-relationships between variables. The model indicated that policy interventions increased public willingness to adopt AVs by 28%, suggesting that policymakers’ interventions help create an early market for AVs. In addition, good branding and mass media campaigns influence the public’s psychological characteristics and encourage the use of AVs. These findings hold crucial implications for mitigating the negative impacts of adverse incidents, fostering public acceptance and providing valuable insight for theoretical understanding and practical implementation of AV usage.",1369-8478,Not found
The Predictive Role of visual attention bias in aggressive driving decisions among violation-involved drivers on attitudes of right-of-way,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.024,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This study, based on dual-process theory, explores the aggressive driving decision-making characteristics and cognitive processing of violation-involved drivers in right-of-way infringement scenarios. It aims to identify an eye-movement indicator that can predict drivers’ prosocial behaviors. The study recruited 75 drivers aged 19–58 years, who completed a video-based aggressive driving decision-making test and the Driver Attitudes of Right-of-way Questionnaire (DARQ). The results indicate that age moderates the relationship between violation history and visual attentional bias. Younger drivers with a history of violations exhibit an attentional bias towards aggressive words, whereas older drivers do not. After controlling for age, violation-involved drivers demonstrated a higher rate of aggressive decision-making, especially in situations with very short lane-change time headway. Visual attentional bias towards aggressive words can effectively predict positive emotions in attitudes towards the right-of-way. This suggests that early eye movement indicators during the driving decision-making process represent a form of socioemotional characteristic. The more positive the driver’s right-of-way attitude, the stronger their prosocial behavior and the weaker their intuitive impulsiveness during the early cognitive processing stages of driving decision-making. This indicates that the driving decision-making eye-movement assessment paradigm is an objective and effective method for evaluating drivers’ pro-sociality.",1369-8478,Not found
Road-crossing behavior and safety of pedestrians facing autonomous vehicles with an acceleration indicator eHMI in VR traffic flow,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.023,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"To support pedestrian road-crossing behavior in the presence of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we propose a novel external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) that enhances the vehicle’s inherent motion cues, which pedestrians already use in traditional traffic. Based on the Beta Movement, the eHMI design consists of light bands with multiple arrows moving forward or backward to indicate the vehicle’s accelerating or decelerating motion state. We measured pedestrians’ behavior and perceived safety when faced with AVs equipped with this acceleration indicator eHMI in a virtual reality (VR) street scene, where pedestrians had road-crossing tasks and vehicles did not always yield. We found that pedestrians exhibited crossing behavior according to the motion state of the oncoming vehicle. They almost always crossed if the vehicle yielded but considered the gap size to cross when it did not. With the acceleration indicator eHMI, they crossed more frequently if the vehicle yielded, yet less frequently if it did not. Although risky crossings could not be fully prevented, pedestrians crossed faster and maintained larger safety margins when the non-yielding vehicle used this eHMI. Additionally, pedestrians started to cross earlier when the eHMI indicated the vehicle’s decelerating state. Regarding pedestrians’ perceived safety, the eHMI did not increase perceived safety for decelerating vehicles but effectively decreased the perceived safety for accelerating vehicles. These results demonstrate the potential of enhancing vehicles’ inherent motion cues with eHMIs, but also imply that making vehicles’ motion state more apparent might not simply increase pedestrians’ perceived safety. Overall, a trade-off seems to exist that it is pedestrians’ sense of unsafety that leads to their safe road-crossing behavior. Suggestions for future research and VR experiments were also discussed.",1369-8478,Not found
Sensor fusion to connect gaze fixation with dynamic driving context for driver attention management,10.1016/j.trf.2024.07.025,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Objective The paper aims to integrate interior and exterior sensing signals to explore gaze-context connections for more context-aware driver attention management. Background Driving context is important for crash risk assessment, but little is known about how it modulates attention requirements for developing driver monitoring systems. Method Twenty-four participants drove a Tesla Model S equipped with Autopilot on the highway, during which driver gaze, headway, speed, and driving mode were sampled from the driver monitoring system, Mobileye, and CAN Bus. These signals were processed and synchronized over each single gaze fixation and incorporated into a Bayesian generalized linear model to assess the effects of dynamic contextual factors on the duration of individual gaze fixation. Results During car following, gaze fixations on eccentric locations in the road scene were shorter. Changes in headway led to longer fixations on the lead vehicle. Moreover, higher vehicle speed and larger acceleration/deceleration, regardless of being in the manual or assisted driving mode, led to longer fixations on the road center. In addition, driving mode itself had a small effect on fixation duration. Conclusion Sensor fusion, along with computation models, explains the connections between driver attention and dynamic context in real-world driving. Application: The gaze-context connections provide insight into developing more context-sensitive gaze metrics to support adaptive driver attention management.",1369-8478,Not found
In the driver's mind: Modeling the dynamics of human overtaking decisions in interactions with oncoming automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.020,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Understanding human behavior in overtaking scenarios is crucial for enhancing road safety in mixed traffic with automated vehicles (AVs). Computational models of behavior play a pivotal role in advancing this understanding, as they can provide insight into human behavior generalizing beyond empirical studies. However, existing studies and models of human overtaking behavior have mostly focused on scenarios with simplistic, constant-speed dynamics of oncoming vehicles, disregarding the potential of AVs to proactively influence the decision-making process of the human drivers via implicit communication. Furthermore, despite numerous studies in other scenarios, so far it remained unknown whether overtaking decisions of human drivers are affected by whether they are interacting with an AV or a human-driven vehicle (HDV). To address these gaps, we conducted a “reverse Wizard-of-Oz” driving simulator experiment with 30 participants who repeatedly interacted with oncoming AVs and HDVs, measuring the drivers' gap acceptance decisions and response times. The oncoming vehicles featured time-varying dynamics designed to influence the overtaking decisions of the participants by briefly decelerating and then recovering to their initial speed. We found no evidence of differences in participants' overtaking behavior when interacting with oncoming AVs compared to HDVs. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence of brief decelerations of the oncoming vehicle affecting the decisions or response times of the participants. Cognitive modeling of the obtained data revealed that a generalized drift-diffusion model with dynamic drift rate and velocity-dependent decision bias best explained the gap acceptance outcomes and response times observed in the experiment. Overall, our findings highlight that cognitive models of the kind considered here can provide a generalizable description of human overtaking decisions and their timing. Such models can thus help further advance the ongoing development of safer interactions between human drivers and AVs during overtaking maneuvers.",1369-8478,Not found

While much research on the design ofHMIsexists, unique associations and meaningful relationships must be considered collectively to offer guidance for vehicle automation. The purpose of the current study was to: (a) review and synthesize existing research and guidance on HMI design as it related to requests to intervene (RTI) for driving automation systems and (b) propose a clear and comprehensive set of recommendations that could inform future system development and implementation. A thorough literature search and selection process was followed the PRISMA guidelines and resulted in the review of 93 articles. The review’s outcome indicates multimodal alerts are prominent, useful, and effective. Many of the HMIs reported in the literature were similar in that they abided by well-established HMI-design guidelines. A small subset ofHMIsestablished evidence for distinct and innovative design principles. Taken together, this study proposed 10 recommendations for HMI design in driving automation systems, ranging from the utility of auditory versus visual alerts to the timing, sensitivity, and location of alerts.",1369-8478,Not found
Trust calibration through perceptual and predictive information of the external context in autonomous vehicle,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.019,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Maintaining an appropriate level of trust is critical for driving safety in autonomous vehicles. While enhancing the driver’s situation awareness (SA) of system information in autonomous driving is known to significantly promote trust calibration, it remains unclear whether enhancing the driver’s SA of the external context during driving contributes to this calibration. This study addresses this gap by improving SA of the external context during Level 3 (L3) driving automation across various driving environments. Driving contexts were manipulated using distinct road conditions containing low, medium, or high contextual risks. To enhance driver’s SA of the driving context, we redesigned the in-vehicle central control panel to display real-time perceptual and predictive information about the external driving context. We hypothesized that SA of driving contexts would facilitate trust calibration rather than merely enhancing trust, allowing trust to adjust to appropriate levels under different driving conditions. Experiment 1 examined the impact of perceptual information about the road, traffic infrastructure, and surrounding vehicles on drivers’ trust. We found that driver’s trust decreased with increased contextual risk only when the reconfigured panel was used, while the number of accidents was not affected. Experiment 2 investigated the effect of predictive information about the external context on drivers’ trust by marking safe and dangerous zones around driver’s vehicle with green and red areas, respectively. We revealed that the predictive information calibrated the trust according to road conditions and increased overall trust levels, while the number of accidents was not affected. Together, these findings suggest that enhancing perception and prediction of external contexts helps drivers align their trust with contextual risk levels in L3 driving automation without compromising driving safety.",1369-8478,Not found

Thematic analysis was employed to identify and contextualise factors influencing CAV acceptability, encompassing usefulness, ease of use, effectiveness, affordability, and social acceptability. Results emphasised safety as a top priority for both drivers and pedestrians. Trust and system reliability were also common concerns, varying with participants’ roles and transport experiences. Both drivers and pedestrians identified cost and economic benefits as significant barriers to CAV acceptance. Moreover, shared apprehensions about justice in adopting CAVs acknowledged the imperfections inherent in technological advancements. Participants supported CAVs but raised concerns about potential harm to vulnerable road users. Both car drivers and pedestrians expressed concerns that introducing CAVs could exacerbate existing injustices these road users face. This study offers valuable insights into how individual differences influence CAV acceptability, contributing to understanding their preparedness to adopt advanced automotive technologies.",1369-8478,Not found

The role of psychological resilience in driving anger expression: The mediating effect of cognitive emotion regulation,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.016,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Emotions that occur while driving, especially anger, can significantly impact driving-related safety. Due to the potential risks of aggressive driving behaviour, which include hazardous driving and traffic accidents, it is important to explore strategies to effectively manage anger, thereby enhancing driving-related safety. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among psychological resilience, cognitive emotional regulation, driving anger, and the expression of driving anger. A total of 350 drivers (aged 21–50 years) completed online questionnaires, including the Connor–Davidson Psychological Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), the Driving Anger Scale (DAS), and the Driver Anger Expression Inventory (DAX). The results indicated that a higher level of psychological resilience is associated with a greater tendency to employ positive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and a greater tendency to exhibit more adaptive expressions of driving anger. In contrast, a lower level of psychological resilience is associated with negative cognitive emotion regulation strategies, resulting in elevated levels of driving anger and a higher frequency of nonadaptive expressions. Additionally, cognitive emotion regulation mediated the relationship between psychological resilience and driving anger. These findings suggest that drivers with high levels of psychological resilience and those who engage in effective cognitive emotion regulation strategies are more likely to remain calm in irritating driving situations, thereby enhancing overall driving-related safety.",1369-8478,Not found
The synergistic effect of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and technology-based inattention on reduction of driving performance,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.015,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and technology-based distraction on driving performance. In this study, using a simulator radio system was considered as a technology-based distraction factor. Driving performance was measured using three parameters: the number of collisions with obstacles, reaction time, and lateral deviation of the car. Participants were divided into case and control groups based on their scores from the Connors Adult ADHD Disorder Questionnaire. They participated in driving experiments under two scenarios: 1) without interacting with the radio system, and 2) while interacting with the radio system. The findings revealed that interacting with the radio system led to a significant increase in the number of collisions, reaction time, and lateral deviation (P-value < 0.05). ADHD, in combination with the distraction factor (working with the radio system) while driving, had a significant impact on increasing the number of collisions and reaction time (P-value < 0.05). However, it did not have a significant effect on the degree of lateral deviation (P-value > 0.05). Engaging in a secondary task (working with the radio system) while driving reduced the driver’s situational awareness and impaired cognitive function, resulting in an increase in the number of collisions, reaction time, and lateral deviation. The distraction factor exacerbated the already poor concentration and attention of individuals with ADHD, further impairing their decision-making and driving reactions. Therefore, ADHD and technology-based distractions had a synergistic effect on driving performance.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the influence of connected information on driver behaviour: An analysis of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts in the middle section of urban road,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.012,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Due to the vision obstruction caused by visually blind obstacles on urban roads, pedestrians suffer a high crash risk in pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. At the same time, the connected information can potentially improve driver behaviour with an earlier warning and driving aids. To ensure safer interactions between pedestrians and motor vehicles in the middle section of urban roads, this simulator-based study aims to investigate drivers’ behaviour under the influence of connected information and predict crash risk during their interaction with pedestrians on urban roads, involving six conflict scenarios based on real-world traffic situations. The test employed a mixed experimental design, with connected information as the between-subject variable. A total of 70 participants were divided into a control group and an experimental group to complete the test. Results from linear mixed-effects models indicated that the presence of connected information and crosswalks positively influenced driver braking behaviour, resulting in a shorter reaction time, longer braking duration and distance, smaller maximum deceleration, and a reduced standard deviation of deceleration. Conversely, visual obstacles led to longer reaction times, while parked cars and buses negatively affected driver behaviour. Further, aggressive drivers exhibited poorer braking behaviour compared to neutral drivers. An explainable machine learning model was developed to predict pedestrian-vehicle crash risks during interactions, demonstrating satisfactory predictive accuracy. The presence of connected information and crosswalks was found to have a positive effect on reducing crash risks and improving safety margins. These findings provide valuable insights for implementing connected driving technology and developing measures to enhance pedestrian safety.",1369-8478,Not found
Parents’ perspectives on transporting their children in autonomous vehicles – A contextual interview study with parents in Germany,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.030,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Driverless or autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to address children’s mobility disadvantage by enabling them to become more independent from their parents and other adult drivers before they reach the legal age for obtaining a driver’s license. In an online contextual interview study, we interviewed N=22 parents of underage children from Germany to investigate their willingness to use AVs for unaccompanied transportation of their children. The goal of the interview study was to investigate whether AVs are a suitable option to support unaccompanied transportation of children from the parents’ perspective and how these AVs should be designed considering the parents’ concerns and needs. In contrast to former acceptance studies, we familiarized the participants with an existing AV concept called autoELF. We created a user scenario to enable the parents to better imagine the situation. In the study, parents first described their children’s current mobility in a normal week. Parents were then asked about the expected benefits, concerns, child-related prerequisites and technical requirements for using AVs, as well as the possibilities for integrating AVs into their family’s mobility. Results showed that AVs can be a solution to provide children with unaccompanied transportation. In contrast to previous studies, the majority of parents interviewed in this study were willing to use the AV for the transportation of unaccompanied children, but only after parents had gained initial experience with the vehicle and trained their children in its use. Regarding the unaccompanied use by their children, parents based their consent to use the AV on their children’s emotional and cognitive abilities rather than on their age. In their children’s daily mobility, parents intended to replace most of the previously accompanied car journeys during leisure time with the autoELF vehicle without compromising their children’s active mobility, such as walking or bicycling. In contrast to previous literature, only a few parents cited school commuting as a use case for the autoELF vehicle. Our qualitative interview study highlights the potential of AVs for unaccompanied child transportation. Moreover, it stresses the importance to use specific, tangible concept when investigating family AVs.

Investigating the effect of auditory takeover request signals frequency on drivers from an acute stress perspective,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.008,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This study examines the effect of auditory displays, which are typically used as takeover signals in highly automated driving, on drivers during emergencies. Acute stress was assessed by analyzing physiological features within 10 s post-stimulation, in particular the root mean square of successive differences, raw-skin conductance, and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio. Sixteen participants were recruited to perform autopilot tasks in a simulated cockpit. Acute stress was induced using three sets of beeps with inter-pulse intervals of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 s, which serve as the auditory takeover request (TOR). The participants were required to immediately initiate vehicle takeovers and perform lane-changing maneuvers following each TOR, and their physiological, psychological, and behavioral data were acquired for analysis. The results show that the relationship between acute stress and signal frequency conforms to Stevens’ power law, thus highlighting the significance of the signal frequency with respect to acute stress. Although correlations are observed between perceived urgency and acute stress, the acute stress does not correlate significantly with the takeover parameters, such as the takeover time, information-processing time, and steering wheel speed. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of TORs on drivers in terms of acute stress, thus contributing to enhanced driving safety and guiding the design of auditory TORs.",1369-8478,Not found
Do cyclists disregard ‘priority-to-the-right’ more often than motorists?,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.010,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The integration of autonomous driving into mixed traffic environments poses unique challenges, especially at unsignalized intersections where communication and cooperation with human road users is necessary. This study addresses a critical research gap by investigating the adherence to the “priority-to-the-right” rule at an urban unsignalized intersection, comparing behavioral patterns of cyclists and motorists. Utilizing stationary mounted cameras, a 12-day traffic observation of an urban T-intersection in Braunschweig, Germany, was conducted. The class and the trajectory of road users as well as their scenarios were identified. In 202 cases, cars appearing from the right (ego, with priority) encountered cars or bikes coming from the left (foe, without priority). The study analyzed the impact of variables, ego’s direction, foe’s class and lateral position and their arrival time on their passing order through descriptive statistics and logistic regression. The findings reveal that cyclists disregard the “priority-to-the-right” rule more often than motorists. Additionally, road users who have the priority are more likely to yield when turning right, arriving at the intersection later, and encountering an opposing road user who is close to the center of the road. This study highlights the importance of implicit communication in traffic and provides essential benchmarks for developing more human-like autonomous driving systems, capable of interpreting and responding to nuanced road user interactions at unsignalized intersections.",1369-8478,Not found
Why do drivers resist the use of partial automation features? A perspective from psychological reactance theory,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.007,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Autonomous vehicles equipped with automation driving assistance features are attracting significant public attention for their safety, innovation, and efficiency.

Taking the lens of psychological reactance theory, this research investigates the impact of driver type and car class on resistance to using automation features. We conducted a survey (N=391) and found that drivers with limited experience exhibit higher resistance to using these features compared to experienced drivers. This effect is mediated by the perceived threat to driving freedom and is moderated by car class. Specifically, this effect only holds for economy cars but not high-end cars. Our findings can help managers develop personalized recommendations for consumers regarding autonomous vehicles, and provide a reference for designing driver assistance systems tailored to car class.",1369-8478,Not found
Exploring implications and current practices in e-scooter safety: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.004,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The proliferation of e-scooters in urban spaces has introduced safety concerns despite their potential to reduce traffic congestion and provide an environmentally friendly solution for short-distance trips. This study consolidates existing knowledge on e-scooter safety through a systematic literature review of 168 academic studies and grey literature, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our primary objective is to identify the key e-scooter safety concerns from existing literature, together with the strategies stakeholders use to address these concerns, and highlight areas for further research. The literature shows that e-scooter riders are commonly injured in single-vehicle incidents, with a clear association between severe injuries and violations of traffic rules such as speeding and alcohol consumption. Frequently recommended safety measures include separating e-scooters from pedestrians, instituting licensing and mandatory training, and enforcing helmet usage and zero alcohol consumption. On top of that, clear legislative definitions for e-scooters ease and improve enforcement, and setting technical requirements for e-scooter design can improve stability, handling performance, and reduce incidents. Understanding the differences between user types and the underlying factors influencing risky behaviour is crucial for developing effective interventions. Users of shared schemes often lack knowledge of rules and have poorer riding skills, possibly due to their less frequent use. Conversely, private e-scooter owners pose enforcement challenges for speeding and prohibited riding, as these scooters lack geofencing and tracking capabilities often found in shared scheme e-scooters. Helmet non-use, where mandatory, is attributed to a lack of support from riders for increased law enforcement and a low perception of risk rather than a lack of knowledge about the laws. Similarly, illegal sidewalk riding is linked to factors of comfort and convenience rather than infrastructure preference or unawareness of illegality. Proactive measures that are user-based, time-based, and location-based require further investigation. Consistently collecting and analysing data informs region-specific safety decisions and allows policymakers to monitor safety risks over time and assess intervention effectiveness, which are largely absent in current literature.",1369-8478,Not found

These methods often limit causal inference and are prone to recall bias. This study adopts a novel approach by utilizing time-stamped stress level data (objective) and experience sampling of moods (subjective) to assess the varied stress responses triggered by daily commuting. Our aim is to reexamine the effects of daily commuting on mental well-being, with a particular focus on evaluating how subjective (self-reported moods) and objective (biosignal data) measurement techniques capture these psychological and physiological responses differently. We involved 203 employees from Beijing, who wore portable smartwatches over a week. Throughout five working days, we conducted three random experience sampling surveys daily to collect real-time mood data. Initial analysis visualized the relationships between stress levels, moods, and commuting characteristics such as duration, mode, and timing. Subsequent analysis using mixed-effects models quantified the impacts of these commuting attributes on stress and mood. Our findings reveal that commute duration and mode significantly affect both mood and stress during commuting. Specifically, longer commutes are associated with poorer moods but surprisingly, lower stress levels. Regarding commuting modes, taking the bus and bicycling were found to enhance moods relative to traveling by car. Conversely, walking and cycling appeared to elevate stress levels the most, while shuttle bus use correlated with the lowest stress levels. Our study also highlights a discrepancy between physiological stress, as measured by biosignal technology, and psychological stress, as reported in surveys. This discrepancy underscores the complexities of measuring mental well-being and enriches the ongoing discussion about the intricate relationship between daily commuting and mental health.",1369-8478,Not found

This has sparked controversies about spatial conflicts between moped users and cyclists, especially since the emergence of e-moped rental systems in 2017. Drawing on mobility studies and social identity theory, this paper explores the stereotypes of moped users and their behaviours to understand the spatial complexities of a shift towards more micromobility in the Netherlands. By analysing interviews with moped users and how users are discussed in the press, the paper empirically maps stereotypes of the users of different mopeds i.e. (1) fuel-based and privately owned, (2) electric and privately owned, and (3) electric and rental, and their behaviour on the bicycle path. Our study shows how debates tend to focus on the behaviours of moped users and their interactions with cyclists on shared bicycle paths while the spatial domination of automobility remains unchallenged. This paper contributes to transport behaviour research on spatial conflicts and identities in the context of the rise of micromobility − a key pillar of transitions to more sustainable mobility, alongside other changes such as fleet electrification, reduction of car use, and increased public transport uptake. Micromobilities entail what was traditionally understood as active mobility or non-motorised transport, such as cycling, but also what is now often discussed under the umbrella of MaaS or (light) electric vehicles, such as motorised two-wheelers, and also 'hybrids' such as e-bikes, fatbikes or cargo bikes. This paper exemplifies how identities, stereotypes and behaviours are relevant for understanding interactions around these modes and debates, in the quest towards low-car urban transitions.",1369-8478,Not found
Fictional or Real? a review of how gamification types effect eco-driving on the road,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.036,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This study reviews the research on the use of gamification in the eco-driving context. Through a systematic literature review (N=28), it analyzes the effectiveness of different gamification types (i.e., achievement, social, and fictional). Their effectiveness is investigated from a theory of affordances perspective, and gamification affordances, psychological outcomes, and behavioral outcomes are analyzed in detail in the reviewed corpus. The results show that achievement-oriented gamification is the most prominent type of gamification that has been studied and has shown largely positive results in improving energy-efficient driver behavior, such as reduced fuel consumption and acceleration. In contrast, there is little research on the effectiveness of social and fictional gamification. Additionally, there is a need for research to clarify the psychological effects of specific gamification affordances. In light of the current research, the study provides design implications as well as avenues for future research.",1369-8478,Not found
Transparent internal human-machine interfaces in highly automated shuttles to support the communication of minimal risk maneuvers to the passengers,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.006,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"In Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs) without operators on-board, user interaction with the vehicle automation plays an important role for a safe and inclusive use of these services. Especially when Minimal Risk Maneuvers (MRM) are performed by the system, passengers are faced with uncertain situations. A possibility to deepen passenger’s understanding and predictability of these systeḿs and reduce their uncertainties is to enhance automation transparency. However, literature shows a lack regarding enhancing system transparency of HAVs during MRMs. Therefore, we investigated the impact of “observability” and “reasoning” as transparency influencing factors. In an online study, participants evaluated multiple internal Human-Machine Interfaces (iHMI) as shuttle passengers. The presented iHMIs varied regarding their level of transparency by giving different information about what the vehicle’s “perception” and its “reasoning” is. Results show significant differences in the passengers’ understanding between different iHMI variants providing evidence that information regarding the “perception” and “reasoning” of HAVs enhance system transparency. Results of the study may provide first insights into passengers’ informational needs when using HAV. They highlight the potential benefits of system transparency when designing interfaces for HMIs of automated vehicles.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the potential of a battery swapping method at refuel stations for electric vehicle: A case study of INDIA,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.005,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are introduced to mitigate environmental problems and develop sustainable modes of transport across the globe. Researchers often report that the non-availability of charging infrastructure is the primary concern for EV adoption. The traditional plug-in EV charging method has a higher waiting time, discouraging users from adopting EVs. Many countries, including India, are promoting an alternative battery swapping method (BSM) for EV charging to reduce the waiting time. But the user preference and willingness to adopt BSM remain unexplored, especially in developing countries. The existing refuel stations are a potential location for developing charging infrastructure that provides the EV charging service and helps create awareness among users because of their wide visibility. Thus, this study aims to bridge the research gap by exploring the influential factors, user preferences, and willingness to use the BSM at refuel stations. For this purpose, 1013 samples were collected from road users who visited 51 refueling stations using the random sampling method in the twin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. An integrated partial least squares-structural equation modelling with the artificial neural network method was adopted in this study. The study’s findings reveal that the development of public EV charging facilities at refuel stations significantly impacts the user’s willingness to shift to EVs. The convenience and cost-related motivating factors like a lesser waiting time compared to the plug-in charging method, reduced range anxiety, no concern about battery usage, reduced initial purchase cost of an EV, and comparatively lower maintenance costs significantly motivates user’s willingness to adopt BSM. Similarly, battery-related demotivating factors like the non-reliable range of the swapped battery, non-standard battery design in terms of type, size, capacity, and brand across the country, additional cost for leasing or renting the battery, and chances that EV batteries might be replaced with fake batteries concern BSM adoption.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating pedestrians’ red light running intentions at urban intersections in different traffic Environments: A scenario-based analysis guided by theoretical frameworks,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.003,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Pedestrian risky behaviors are one of the contributing factors to crashes involving pedestrians. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the mechanisms by which pedestrians interact with many influential components in the traffic environment. This study aimed to evaluate pedestrians’ red light running intentions and related factors under different traffic flow scenarios, including straight traffic flow, right-turning traffic flow, and left-turning traffic flow. A theoretical approach based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the prototype willingness model (PWM) was employed. Data were collected from an online survey of 2250 participants in Tehran, Iran. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to identify the significant factors that explain intentions. All models successfully explained the behavioral intention for red light running violation; however, the findings revealed that the integrated model was the best-performing model to represent violation and, thus, was selected for interpreting the results and drawing relevant conclusions. Different traffic flow scenarios had varied effects on violation intentions for individual characteristics and model constructs. Previous crash experiences and driving-related background variables emerged to impact pedestrian violation intention across three scenarios. The findings also suggested that the rational constructs (attitude, perceived behavioral control, and facilitating conditions) had a more robust impact on violation intention compared to reactive constructs (prototype similarity, prototype favorability), with facilitating conditions being the strongest predictor of the model, followed by attitudes toward violation as a significant predictor of intention for red light violation. According to the results, the mechanism of risk-taking varies depending on the direction of the traffic flow. Higher risk was associated with the violation at the intersections with straight traffic flow compared to the intersections with turning traffic flow. Based on the findings of this study, several implications, including interventions focusing on individuals’ transportation safety attitudes, countermeasures to increase the risk perception of pedestrians toward turning vehicles, and countermeasures regarding the use of mobile phones while walking for the context of this study were proposed.",1369-8478,Not found
Prevalence and predictors of driver distractions in Cyprus: An observational study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.035,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Objective Driver distractions are a significant contributor to road accidents and fatalities worldwide. The present research investigated the prevalence of observable driver distractions on both sides of Nicosia, as well as exploring the effect of drivers’ characteristics and time-related variables on their prevalence. Methods Roadside observations were conducted at eight randomly selected locations in the city of Nicosia, Cyprus. Four of these sites were located in the area of Nicosia controlled by the Republic of Cyprus, and the other four were in the area that is referred to as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) by its administration. Results A total of 16,070 drivers were observed, with 8,948 being in the Republic of Cyprus (South) and 7,122 in the Turkish-controlled section of Nicosia (North). A slightly higher proportion of drivers were observed driving distracted in the South (28.0%) than was found in the northern part of the city (25.7%). The most commonly observed secondary tasks in the South were using headphones (9.2%), talking to a passenger (8.1%) and using a mobile 0.4%, 3.7% talking and 2.7% texting). In contrast, the most commonly observed secondary tasks in the North were talking to passengers (10.2%), wearing headphones (8.4%) and using a mobile 0.6% for talking and 2.5% for texting). Gender-related differences were found for a number of different distractions (i.e., talking to passengers, drinking, and handheld mobile phone conversations), and age emerged as a significant predictor for most secondary tasks, including talking to passengers, smoking, hands-free mobile phone use, handheld mobile phone use, texting/keying numbers, drinking and engagement in any type of distraction (all distractions combined). The overall pattern for age was that middle-aged and older drivers were less likely to be distracted than younger drivers. Conclusions A relatively high proportion of drivers on both sides of Nicosia were engaged in a secondary task while driving. These findings clearly indicate that younger drivers are more likely to drive distracted, which probably contributes to their higher crash rates.",1369-8478,Not found
Easy listening or driving distraction? The relationship between audiobook complexity level and driving performance on simple routes,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.002,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Drivers engage in a variety of secondary activities while driving. Research suggests that many secondary tasks interfere with driving, making performance worse as compared to single-task driving, but a recent study suggests that in simple environments (low scenery and traffic) listening to an audiobook may actually benefit driving performance. Nonetheless, these effects may vary based on both the textual complexity of the audiobook and the working memory capacity of the driver. In this study, we used a driving simulator to compare single-task driving with that when the driver was listening to an audiobook (dual-task). We manipulated the complexity of the audiobook as measured by Lexile scores (a standard index of text difficulty). Licensed drivers did two 30-minute drives on simple roads, alternating between driving while listening to an audiobook (dual-task) or single-task driving. Drivers did one drive with the simple and the other with the complex audiobook (order counterbalanced). Listening to the simple audiobook improved driving performance as compared to single-task driving: braking response times to hazards were lower, as were steering and headway variability. Conversely, listening to the complex audiobook interfered with driving; braking times to hazards and steering variability were higher when drivers were listening to the audiobook than for single-task driving. Individual differences in working memory capacity as measured by the OSPAN (Operation Span) predicted how much listening to an audiobook benefitted performance, with the highest OSPAN scorers benefitting most, though these OSPAN-related differential benefits were restricted to reduced hazard response times while listening to the simple audiobook.",1369-8478,Not found
The Impact of Pedestrian Interactions in Intersections on the Three Levels of Drivers’ Situation Awareness,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.023,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Evaluating drivers’ situation awareness (SA) is important in the implementation of alert prioritization. This study investigates the relationship between driving performance measures (speed, acceleration and brake usage, steering wheel and lane deviation), pedestrian interaction (location, direction and motion), and driver SA. To achieve this, a controlled study was conducted with 56 participants using a Balanced Incomplete Block Design, where each participant drove 18 out of 48 possible intersections in a driving simulator environment. The Situational Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) method was used to assess drivers’ SA. Mixed effects logit models were developed to examine the different SA Levels (perception, comprehension, projection). The driving performance measures were aggregated across three time windows (1, 3, and 5 s). The findings show significant contributions from both driving performance measures and pedestrian interactions in predicting driver SA. More specifically, a one-second time window was useful for predicting pedestrian direction and a three-second time window was best for predicting pedestrian location and intention to cross. The results indicate the importance of considering different time windows for predicting various levels of driver SA responses. These findings offer insights into factors to be considered in driver SA predictive models.",1369-8478,Not found
Factors influencing the perception of safety for pedestrians and cyclists through interactions with automated vehicles in shared spaces,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.032,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Research has demonstrated the benefits of external human–machine interfaces (eHMIs) in increasing vulnerable road users’ (VRU) feeling of safety in interactions with automated vehicles (AVs). However, two key gaps exist in the literature. First, existing studies examined AV-VRU communication aspects in the context of conventional roads with traffic controls, but not for shared spaces where VRU-AV interaction is reliant on communication between the two parties. Second, limited knowledge is available on the differences between cyclists and pedestrians when interacting with AV. This paper aims to address these gaps through an online questionnaire among 254 cyclists and pedestrians in Australia and the UK. Perceived safety was measured in terms of willingness to cross in front of an AV, feeling of security, and feeling of relaxation. Results from a three-stage least square regression analysis identified differences in the factors for pedestrians and cyclists. Pedestrians that were male, over the age of 35, not regular cyclists, or residents of the UK reported lower feelings of safety, relaxation, and willingness to cross than their counterparts. Similar results were found cyclists who are older than 45 years, and UK residents compared to other cyclist participants. Both pedestrians and cyclists reported more willingness to cross and higher feelings of security and relaxation when an eHMI was present. These findings indicate that for effective use and understanding of eHMIs targeted interventions are needed to address the specific concerns of different demographic groups, as identified in this research. By increasing public understanding and acceptance of AVs – as well as eHMIs – across all demographic groups, researchers can promote a smooth integration of these technologies into shared spaces.",1369-8478,Not found
How long the effect of take-over conditions Lasts? a survival analysis of Commercial Motor vehicle drivers’ reaction time and driving behavior in Level 4 of automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.033,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The transition from automated to manual driving, referred as to Take-over conditions (TOC), in highly automated vehicles (e.g., SAE Level 4 or higher) is a subject of great interest to driver’s safety researchers, considering advancement of automotive technologies. While the literature has focused primarily on the post-take-over behavior of passenger car drivers, assessing different aspects of Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) drivers’ post-take-over behavior has received less attention, although it is anticipated that CMVs will be the first to vastly adopt highly automated technology. This paper aims to address the question of how long the effect of TOC lasts in CMV drivers and how automated operation duration before TOC, repeated TOC, and driver’s factors (i.e., age, gender, education, and driving history) affect the duration of TOC’s effect. To accomplish this, we designed a 40-minute experiment on a driving simulator and compared participants’ responses to TOC with continuous manual driving to first, assess significant changes in driving behavior indices (e.g., acceleration, velocity, and headway) in different time intervals and second, evaluate the survival patterns of unsafe behaviors (e.g., hard brakes, sharp turns, and speeding) over time. Multilevel Mixed-effect Linear Models and Multilevel Mixed-effect Parametric Survival Models are incorporated to assess the duration of TOC’s effects. Results showed that the first 10 s of TOC carries the most significant driving behavior changes while the probability of observing unsafe behaviors reduces significantly after 20 s. The results indicated that the effect of TOC lasts longer in long-automated operations, old drivers, and drivers with bad driving history, while repeated TOCs, showed positive effects on mediating the effect of this transition. The findings of this paper offer valuable insights to automotive companies and transportation planners on the nature of Take-over conditions.",1369-8478,Not found
Investigating the situational dynamics of visual information sampling in lateral vehicle control – Subjective vs. objective estimates of spare visual capacity,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.034,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Drivers continually adapt their information sampling behavior to changing traffic conditions for safe driving. Scientists have studied this sampling behavior for decades; however, the literature on how drivers adapt their visual information sampling in response to observed driving dynamics is still incomplete, especially concerning what might be considered safe adaptation from an external perspective. While occlusion methods are commonly employed to study drivers’ visual information sampling, the variability in self-selected occlusion times and their relationship to actual driving performance has yet to be fully understood. In a driving simulator study with 30 participants, we analyzed and compared the situational dynamics influencing visual information sampling and performance in an occluded lane-keeping task. The findings underscore the significant influence of speed, lane position, time-to-line-crossing at the start of occlusion, and steering during occlusion on spare visual capacity in lane-keeping. Although the participants were able to make slight adjustments to their visual sampling based on these variables, their occlusion time choices appeared to be stable and primarily driven by individual preferences, unrelated to their driving experience or general lateral control instability under occlusion. In contrast, drivers’ general instability in lateral control under single-occlusion driving emerged as the strongest predictor of lane crossing during continuous, intermittently occluded driving. These insights contribute to the understanding of information sampling dynamics and spare visual capacity in lateral vehicle control, potentially guiding the development of personalized and contextually intelligent driver attention monitoring and warning systems.",1369-8478,Not found
What limits improper bike-sharing parking most: Penalties or incentives? Findings from an online behavioral experiment,10.1016/j.trf.2024.09.001,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Electronic fences are now used to regulate the parking behavior of bike-sharing users, but the issue of improper parking within such fenced areas has not been resolved. Based on the theories of perceived value and perceived risk, this study used online behavioral experiments to simulate a scenario of users parking shared bicycles. By considering three factors — economic incentives, punitive measures, and travel scenarios — this study examined variations in users’ willingness to standardize the parking of shared bicycles. Data from 809 valid questionnaires were collected and empirically analyzed using bootstrap and regression analyses. According to the results, both economic incentives and penalties significantly enhanced users’ willingness to standardize the parking of shared bicycles, and the impact of penalties was slightly stronger than that of incentives. Perceived value played a mediating role between economic incentives and users’ willingness to properly park shared bicycles. Perceived risk acted as a mediator between punitive measures and the regulated parking intention of users. Travel scenarios served as a moderating factor between penalties and users’ willingness to park shared bicycles in a compliant manner, with the users’ compliance willingness in non-commuting travel scenarios significantly surpassing that in commuting contexts. These findings enrich the knowledge of sustainable usage behaviors among bike-sharing users, providing insights for bike-sharing companies to manage user behavior. Based on these results, several policy recommendations aimed at guiding governments and companies in regulating electronic fences and user parking behaviors are proposed.",1369-8478,Not found
Predictability of driver's stop/go decisions at flashing-light-controlled grade crossings by coupling functional brain network and deep learning methods,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.031,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Detecting and predicting the stop/go decisions of drivers at grade crossings is crucial for enhancing road safety. Electroencephalography (EEG) data, which provides direct and effective physiological indicators for recognizing driver states, combined with associated machine-learning techniques, can be used to monitor driver decisions. However, the ability of EEG to predict a driver’s stop/go decisions remains unclear. To investigate this, we collected both EEG and behavioral data from drivers at a flashing-light-controlled grade crossing, where stop/go decisions are critical, using a driving simulator. Herein, we propose an EEG-based prediction framework that combines functional brain network analysis with conventional neural networks (FBN-CNNs) to predict drivers’ stop/go decisions. The functional brain network was measured using phase-lag index matrices and minimum-spanning tree techniques. We subsequently compared the obtained results of the FBN-CNN with those from traditional machine learning methods, specifically random forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results indicate that when facing a flashing red light, drivers who decide to stop exhibit stronger alpha band connectivity and weaker delta and theta activity than those who run the red-light. Furthermore, the FBN-CNN model outperformed the machine learning methods (RF and SVM) in both extracting EEG features and achieving high prediction accuracy. Interestingly, the EEGs of drivers during normal driving stages could help to predict their stop-or-go behavior at the onset of a flashing red light. In the typical dilemma zone, combining EEG data from the normal driving stage with those from the pre-decision stage improved the accuracy from 76% to 90%. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of EEG and deep learning methods in driver decision monitoring.",1369-8478,Not found

A systematic review of three databases yielded thirty-five articles that met our inclusion criteria. Our review results show that cycling experiments with eye tracking allow analysis of the viewpoint of the cyclist and reactions to the built environment, road conditions, navigation behavior, and mental workload and/or stress levels. Our review suggests substantial variation in research objectives and the consequent selection of eye-tracking devices, experimental design, and which gaze metrics are used and interpreted. A variety of general gaze metrics and gaze measurements related to Areas of Interest (AOI) are applied to infer cyclists’ mental workload/stress levels and attention allocation respectively.

Using distributed simulations to investigate driver-pedestrian interactions and kinematic cues: Implications for automated vehicle behaviour and communication,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.027,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"As we move towards a future with Automated Vehicles (AVs) incorporated in the current traffic system, it is crucial to understand driver-pedestrian interaction, in order to enhance AV design and optimization. Previous research in this area, which has primarily used naturalistic observations or single-actor virtual reality simulations, has been limited by its inability to draw causal conclusions, also due to a lack of real human–human interactions. Our study addresses these limitations by employing a high-fidelity distributed simulation setup that links drivers in a motion-based simulator with pedestrians in a CAVE-based environment. This method allows for the examination of real-time and reciprocal interactions across a range of road-crossing scenarios. Using thirty-two pairs of drivers and pedestrians, we investigated how different factors, such as the presence of zebra crossings and varying time gaps of the approaching vehicle, influence driver behaviour and pedestrian crossing decisions. The effect of drivers’ control of the vehicle during such crossings (e.g., braking behaviour and lateral deviation) on pedestrians’ crossing decisions were also analysed. We found that the distribution of drivers’ average deceleration values were bimodal, where drivers either markedly yielded to pedestrians, or continued in their path, with very few instances of intermediate behaviour. We also found that pedestrian decisions were seemingly influenced by the different braking strategies adopted by the driver, with pedestrians crossing before the vehicles in response to soft and early, or late and hard braking, while late and soft braking often resulted in the vehicle passing first. We also observed a slight lateral movement of the vehicle away from pedestrians when drivers were not yielding, but more of a lateral deviation towards them when yielding. This may be because drivers subconsciously transfer their walking interaction habits to their driving behaviour, to avoid a collision with pedestrians. Finally, our results showed a stronger influence of these kinematic cues on pedestrian crossing decisions, when compared to zebra crossings. As well as highlighting the value of a novel approach for investigating vehicle–pedestrian interactions, this study illustrates how vehicle cues can assist pedestrian decisions, adding new knowledge in the development of human-like behaviour for future AVs.",1369-8478,Not found
Characterizing the driving behavior of manual vehicles following autonomous vehicles and its impact on mixed traffic performance,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.028,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"An important issue for mixed traffic conditions, in which autonomous vehicles (AVs) and manual vehicles (MVs) coexist, is to analyze various vehicle interactions caused by different driving behaviors. Understanding the responsive behavioral characteristics of the following MV affected by the maneuver of the leading AV is a backbone in evaluating mixed traffic performance. The purpose of this study is to characterize the driving behavior of MVs following AVs in mixed-traffic situations. To characterize vehicle interactions between AVs and MVs, this study conducts multi-agent driving simulation (MADS) experiments, which can synchronize the space and time domains on the road by connecting two driving simulators. A maneuvering control logic for AV driving, which is used for MADS, is developed in this study. The driving behavioral data of MVs following AVs obtained from MADS are used to modify the parameters associated with the intelligent driver model (IDM). The IDM is a microscopic car-following model to represent the longitudinal following behavior of vehicles. This study identifies how the MV following AV would be different from the case where the MV follows MV. The results show that the average time headway of the following MVs in the AV-MV pair increased by 13.9% compared to the MV-MV pair. However, the maximum acceleration and average deceleration decreased by 44.45% and 4.89%, respectively. The proposed IDM for MV following AV was further plugged into a microscopic traffic simulation platform. VISSIM simulations were conducted to identify the difference in driving behavior between the proposed IDM and the original IDM. The outcome of this study is expected to simulate the maneuvering behavior of MV more realistically in the mixed traffic stream.",1369-8478,Not found
Effects of hazard type on the hazard perceptions of violation-involved and violation-free drivers: An ERP study,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.025,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Objective Hazard perception, which is closely related to crash risk, is the ability to anticipate potential dangers on the road. This study aimed to investigate the effects of drivers’ previous traffic violation history on their neural processing of hazard perception under different hazard types. Methods A mixed experimental design was employed, involving two groups of drivers (driver group: violation-involved, violation-free) and three types of images (no-hazard image, covert hazard image, overt hazard image). Twenty covert hazard images, 20 overt hazard images and 40 no-hazard images were randomly presented to 19 drivers with previous violation histories and 28 drivers without violations. The participants were asked to detect whether there was a hazardous situation in the images and press the keyboard quickly after detecting one. Response time, response accuracy and changes in the N1 (100–140 ms), N2 (250–300 ms) and P300 (300–400 ms) components of event-related potentials (ERP) were obtained and analysed. Results The response time to the covert hazard images was significantly greater than that to the no-hazard and overt hazard images, and the lower accuracy also revealed that the covert hazard images were harder to detect than the no-hazard and overt hazard images. Under both overt and covert hazard images, the response time of violation-involved drivers was longer, and their accuracy was worse than that of violation-free drivers. The N1 latency of violation-involved drivers was significantly longer than that of violation-free drivers. The amplitude of N2 was significantly larger in the no-hazard image than in the covert and overt hazard images. The P300 amplitude was significantly greater in the overt hazard images than in the covert and no-hazard images. Conclusion Violation-involved drivers have poorer hazard perception abilities than violation-free drivers regardless of hazard type. N1 latency can differ from that of drivers with and without previous violations. These findings provide support for the development of hazard perception training systems for drivers who are prone to traffic violations.",1369-8478,Not found
Therapists’ perspectives on experience and treatment of mobility-related anxiety disorders,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.022,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"In this paper, we explore how psychology professionals understand and treat the mobility issues of people diagnosed with anxiety disorder, based on 13 in-depth interviews. All interviewees regularly treat clients facing challenges using various modes of transportation due to anxiety disorders. Their clients exhibit a range of mobility issues, with some struggling with driving or being a passenger in a car, while others encounter difficulties when using public transport, cycling, or being a pedestrian. The mobility problems their clients experience affect their daily lives. Next to applying individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) adopted by most interviewees, they also suggest that adjustments in the mobility system could assist individuals with anxiety disorders to participate more fully in society. Hence, we advocate for more research on the mobility system that integrates psychological perspectives on mobility-related problems caused by anxiety disorder to support a more inclusive mobility planning, design, and organization of the system. Inclusive planning implies (1) designing mainstream infrastructures and services enabling people with anxiety disorders to move around independently while reducing anxiety-triggering situations without them becoming disclosed; (2) enhancing walkability and cyclability through both transport and land use planning, since having destinations within a short distance from home seems to be especially beneficial for people with anxiety disorders.",1369-8478,Not found
Two profiles of post-stroke drivers based on their driving perception,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.029,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Objective Stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability in adults, and can induce different sequelae which impact on abilities such as driving. This study investigated how post-stroke patients perceived their driving practice and behavior. The aim of this study was to determine different profiles of post-stroke drivers according to their driving perception. Methods Among 86 post-stroke patients who had undergone an official fitness-to-drive assessment in 2019 in the Kerpape Center or the Henry Gabrielle Hospital (France), 69 returned to drive. These 69 participants completed a questionnaire about their socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and driving perception, approximately three years after resuming driving. Questions about driving perception were statistically analyzed using hierarchical clustering analysis. Socio-demographic, driving, and clinical characteristics from the clusters obtained were then compared. Results Clustering analysis revealed two profiles of post-stroke drivers. One group consisting of 2/3 of the participants reported modified driving behavior, while the other group perceived no driving changes. A higher proportion of participants from the modified driving group reported driving significantly less, experiencing less pleasure, increased tiredness and more fear when driving post-stroke than those from the unmodified driving group. They also stated that they experienced more difficulties, avoided more situations, and implemented more driving strategies than participants in the unmodified driving group. Participants in the modified driving group were also younger (p = 0.014), lived in more rural areas (p = 0.028), and had more sequelae, including fatigue (p = 0.002), motor sequelae (p = 0.035), and cognitive sequelae (p = 0.013) than participants who did not modify their driving. Conclusions Two profiles of post-stroke drivers were identified: those who had perceived the need to modify their driving behavior, and those who had perceived no driving changes. Differences in socio-demographic characteristics may partly explained the divergencies between the two groups. Other factors such as self-awareness of driving abilities may influence their driving perception. Two lines of action could be investigated to enable post-stroke drivers to better appreciate their driving abilities. The first would be to develop targeted support programs to help drivers become more aware of their own abilities, for example using video support during on-road training to replay critical situations and improve awareness of their own abilities. A second approach would be to deploy technological driving assistance systems. A monitoring system enabling the driver to adjust his driving in real time could be very useful and relevant to develop.",1369-8478,Not found
Validation of the Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction scale in transport for urban commuters (BPNS-TUC) in Spain,10.1016/j.trf.2024.08.024,107,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The aim of this paper is to present a validity and reliability study of the translation into Spanish and adaptation to the transport planning domain of the Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction scale to assess autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfaction of urban commuters associated to the use of habitual travel modes, expanding past studies that only focused on a particular population of study and type of travel behavior. An explanatory analysis of the main relations found is also reported, including micro-mobility and shared travel options. To this end, data collected by an online survey during the summer of 2021 from 949 respondents who provided valid data is used. The average age of respondents was 42, and women were slightly underrepresented (40.4%). Factor structure is analyzed and a three-factor ESEM model supports the definition of the constructs. Internal consistency indices show adequate values for the three factors. No statistically significant differences of factor mean values are observed according to sex. The youngest respondents associate the highest values of satisfaction to travel modes when commuting, while the old adults score the lowest values. Active travel modes are associated to the highest values of satisfaction. On the other hand, urban bus is related to the lowest values of satisfaction. Private e-scooter and shared mobility are associated with a higher satisfaction than driving a private car. Future work and practical applications are identified.",1369-8478,Not found
